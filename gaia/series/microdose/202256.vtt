00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:10%
cone-shaped gland the size of a
pea, known as the pineal gland.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.400 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland is responsible
for producing and secreting

the vitally important hormone
melatonin in the body.

But is there another substantial
function of this gland?

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:84%
Ancient cultures and traditions
revered the pineal gland

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.280 align:middle line:84%
for being the key to unlocking
our universal connection

As an integral part of
the endocrine system,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.820 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland is a tiny
organ with a long history.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.150 align:middle line:84%
The name pineal comes
from the Latin word pinea,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.820 align:middle line:84%
meaning pine cone, due to the
pineal gland's conical shape.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.110 align:middle line:84%
The gland is often
associated with higher states

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.400 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.340 align:middle line:84%
French philosopher RenÃ©
Descartes called the pineal

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.880 align:middle line:84%
gland the seat of the soul
and believed it was the place

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:84%
in which all
thoughts were formed.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.760 align:middle line:84%
In Indian Hinduism, the
chakra energy system

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:84%
correlates to the glands of the
endocrine system in the body.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Subsequently, the third
eye, or Ajna chakra,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:84%
corresponds to the
pineal gland, which

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Hindus believe can serve
as a gateway to becoming

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:90%
clairvoyant and enlightened.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.800 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland has
photoreceptors on it.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.775 align:middle line:10%
And yet, they knew
that thousands of years

00:02:27.775 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:10%
ago, before they ever knew
that there were photoreceptors

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.110 align:middle line:10%
on the pineal.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So that, to me-- it
shows you that we

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:84%
know a lot more in
the past than we even

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.950 align:middle line:90%
do now with our technology.

Egyptian symbols of the
Eye of Horus and Eye of Ra

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.310 align:middle line:84%

the pineal gland

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.650 align:middle line:84%
and where it resides
in the brain.

a side view of the brain.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.740 align:middle line:84%
And there's a very
striking resemblance

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
between the limbic brain
and the Eye of Horus.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:10%
And it's important for you to
understand that this represents

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.950 align:middle line:10%
some type of inner vision.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Pineal gland has been known
to be called the third eye.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Because once it's stimulated
and activated to the next level,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:84%
it gives us profound
inner vision.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> For most of modern history,
the pineal gland was shrouded

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:90%
in mystery.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.160 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't until 1958 that
scientists discovered

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.890 align:middle line:84%
that the pineal gland was
responsible for producing

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:90%
and releasing melatonin.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.210 align:middle line:84%
This hormone, derived
from serotonin,

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.030 align:middle line:84%
helps to regulate our
circadian rhythms.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're exposed to light,
it stimulates that pineal

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:90%
gland.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:84%
And serotonin kicks in to
keep us active and aware.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.350 align:middle line:10%
But when we're in
the dark, that's

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.810 align:middle line:10%
when melatonin
production kicks in,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.750 align:middle line:10%
triggering a sleepy
or restful state.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
And in this state, we may
experience inner visions

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:90%
and dreams.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>> While serotonin and
melatonin are certainly critical

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.820 align:middle line:84%
to the function of our bodies,
it is speculated that there

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.270 align:middle line:84%
might be another somewhat
mysterious chemical component

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.910 align:middle line:84%
that the pineal gland
also secretes called

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.120 align:middle line:90%
N,N-dimethyltryptamine or DMT.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.880 align:middle line:10%
>> DMT is this, you
know, dimethyltryptamine.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.740 align:middle line:10%
The theory is that
it's what's released

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.297 align:middle line:10%
by the pineal gland that gives
us these elevated states,

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:26.400 align:middle line:10%
we can say.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.990 align:middle line:10%
>> Maybe DMT is the lens
of our pineal gland,

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.300 align:middle line:10%
allowing us to see wider areas
of reality than our normally

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:10%
accessible to our senses.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> DMT is a psychoactive
compound that is found

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.180 align:middle line:84%
in the human body as well as in
animals and at least 60 species

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.080 align:middle line:90%
of plants.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
It is also the main
chemical component

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:84%
of the psychoactive
ceremonial drink, ayahuasca.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a beverage.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.420 align:middle line:84%
It's made from two plants,
at least one of which

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.070 align:middle line:90%
contains dimethyltryptamine.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.100 align:middle line:10%
These are essentially
shamanic practices.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.840 align:middle line:10%
And ayahuasca is at the center
of that traditional mind-body

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.880 align:middle line:10%
kind of medicine.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.020 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2013, Professor
Jimo Borjigin and her team

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
discovered the presence of DMT
in the pineal glands of rats,

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.310 align:middle line:84%
leading them to hypothesize
that the pineal gland might

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.200 align:middle line:90%
synthesize DMT.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
However, more
recent studies found

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.080 align:middle line:84%
that the two enzymes needed
to bio-synthesize DMT

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:84%
were not only found in
the pineal glands of rats,

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.260 align:middle line:84%
but in other parts
of the brain as well.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.810 align:middle line:84%
When dimethyltryptamine is
isolated from its source,

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.640 align:middle line:84%
it is considered an illegal drug
in most countries worldwide.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:10%
When taken this way, the
effects are nothing short

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:10%
of mystical with users
reporting similar experiences

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.300 align:middle line:10%
of encountering strange
entities and traveling

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.730 align:middle line:10%
outside of time and space.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things that's
unique about DMT is that it

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.730 align:middle line:10%
seems to get one into a state
where there is an intelligence.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And so there's been
a lot of speculation

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.890 align:middle line:90%
as to what that might be.

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Might it be
extradimensional beings?

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Or might it just be activation
of certain areas of the brain?

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Scientists are currently
unsure of the role of DMT

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:84%
But a theory popularized
by Dr. Strassman

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:84%
is that the pineal gland
releases DMT in large amounts

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.110 align:middle line:90%
while dreaming and when we die.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.790 align:middle line:10%
Accounting for the
mystical near-death

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:10%
experiences that
some people report,

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.970 align:middle line:10%
this hypothesis found
some support in 2018

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:10%
when researchers found that
after inducing cardiac arrest

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.470 align:middle line:10%
in rats, DMT levels in
the brains of 60% of them

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:44.805 align:middle line:10%
rose more than two fold.

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:47.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
As if finding DMT in the pineal
gland wasn't mysterious enough,

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.500 align:middle line:84%
another recent discovery
was quite baffling.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.070 align:middle line:84%
In 2002, scientists made
the exciting discovery

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.150 align:middle line:84%
that calcite microcrystals
exist on the pineal gland,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.400 align:middle line:84%
and that these
crystals can interact

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:90%
with electromagnetic fields.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:10%

piezoelectric properties with

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.890 align:middle line:10%
excitability in the
frequency range of mobile

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:10%
telecommunications.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:10%
They theorized that
the interactions

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:10%
of these crystals
with global system

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.230 align:middle line:10%
for mobile
telecommunication waves

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.310 align:middle line:10%
could constitute a new
mechanism of transduction

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:10%
of the pineal membrane.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.730 align:middle line:84%
What this means
in layman's terms

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.520 align:middle line:84%
is that our pineal
gland is a cell phone.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
The wireless transmitter
that links us

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:84%
with the universal consciousness
is our pineal gland.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.870 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to
that pineal gland,

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and you hold your
breath, and you

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.470 align:middle line:84%
keep your attention
on that pineal gland,

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.030 align:middle line:90%
that's your target.

along with the holding
of your breath,

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:84%
would begin to push
cerebrospinal fluid right up

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.090 align:middle line:90%
into your brain.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
hold your breath,

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.630 align:middle line:84%
you're pushing that
cerebrospinal fluid right up

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:84%
against the crystals
of the pineal gland.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
And then the mechanical stress
begins to electrically activate

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.669 align:middle line:90%
those crystals.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And we are turning on the
radio receiver in the brain.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
>> In addition to meditation,
there are other techniques that

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
people claim can activate the
pineal gland for spiritual

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.420 align:middle line:90%
awakening.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
In addition, a 2013 study at
the University of Melbourne

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:84%
found that Wi-Fi
signals interfere

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:04.350 align:middle line:84%
with the function of the pineal
gland to produce melatonin.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And so experts suggest shutting
it off before going to bed.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Overall, the gland
and its functions

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
are still very much a
mystery to modern science.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that
ancient civilizations

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:84%
may have known about
the pineal gland's

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.840 align:middle line:84%
amazing spiritual potential,
though that knowledge seems

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.240 align:middle line:84%
to have been lost
to the modern world.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.910 align:middle line:84%
But it is certain that
this tiny endocrine

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:32.590 align:middle line:84%
gland has a history of mysticism
that spans thousands of years.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps the time has
come to reconnect

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
with our own pineal
glands and explore

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:90%
our ancient spiritual roots.
