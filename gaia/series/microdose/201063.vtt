>> I think the hardest part of
investigating the afterlife is

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.840 align:middle line:10%
what if the news is bad.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.945 align:middle line:90%
But it's good.

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:17.820 align:middle line:90%
All the news is good.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.410 align:middle line:90%
So do the investigation.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.590 align:middle line:84%
The most important thing it does
I think is take away all fear.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:10%
>> That moment was when I
understood that heaven is not

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:10%
a place, but it's a state.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:10%
And whether I chose to
stay there or come back

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:10%
into the body, now that
I knew what I knew,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:10%
I would bring heaven with me.

The enigmatic idea
of life after death

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:84%
has intrigued humanity
since time immemorial.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
There have been
thousands of anecdotes

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
from around the world describing
an afterlife, the vast majority

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.570 align:middle line:84%
of which come from near-death
experiences or NDEs.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
From a perception of being
outside one's body to racing

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:84%
down a dark tunnel towards
a bright white light,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:84%
near-death
experiencers frequently

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.960 align:middle line:84%
report remarkably
similar occurrences.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Yet are these
accounts proof enough

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that our consciousness lives on
after our corporeal form dies,

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.500 align:middle line:84%
or are these experiences
merely the result

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.040 align:middle line:84%
of a physical process
within a dying brain?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.380 align:middle line:10%
What can evidence
for an afterlife

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.945 align:middle line:10%
reveal about the
nature of our reality?

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:90%


00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.510 align:middle line:10%
According to a survey
conducted by the International

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.870 align:middle line:10%
Association for Near Death
Studies in the US, Australia,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.430 align:middle line:10%
and Germany, anywhere from
4% to 15% of the population

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.830 align:middle line:10%
has had a near-death experience.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.360 align:middle line:84%
These numbers have
been replicated

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.070 align:middle line:90%
in numerous other surveys.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And interest in NDEs has
grown exponentially of late.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Accounts of
near-death experiences

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.130 align:middle line:90%
date back to ancient times.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Modern era research into
near-death experiences

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:84%
is generally said to
have begun in 1975.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:10%
That was the year
Raymond A. Moody, Jr.,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:10%
a philosopher
turned psychiatrist,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.860 align:middle line:10%
published "Life After
Life," a groundbreaking

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.860 align:middle line:10%
book based on
interviews with some 150

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.720 align:middle line:10%
near-death experiences.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.790 align:middle line:84%
In all of the cases
he looked into,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Moody discovered claims
of startling similarity

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.450 align:middle line:84%
with experiences at or
near the moment of death.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Near-death experiences are
a common pattern of conscious

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:10%
experience that occurs to people
who are on the verge of death,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:10%
for example in a cardiac
arrest from which they are

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.360 align:middle line:10%
resuscitated.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.810 align:middle line:84%
And basically, they
consist of elements that

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:90%
are common all over the world.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Not every person has
all of the elements.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.970 align:middle line:10%
But among the things
that people say

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.600 align:middle line:10%
are that they hear the
doctor say something like,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:10%
oh my god, he's
dead, or we've lost

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.870 align:middle line:10%
her, which is very
surprising to them

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:10%
because they say that I have
never felt so alive as when

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:10%
I heard that doctor
say I was dead, because

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.390 align:middle line:10%
from their point
of view, they feel

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.620 align:middle line:10%
that they distance themselves
from their physical body.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And they watch the scene
of the resuscitation

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
typically from the
point of view above it.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
As this progresses, they
eventually wake up to the fact

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.520 align:middle line:84%
that, oh, this must be
something to do with death.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And at that point they enter
into states of consciousness

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:84%
that, no matter how
articulate they may be,

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:84%
they say there are no words for
it, that it's indescribable.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:84%
They go through a passageway
into a beautiful light.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
They feel comfort,
peace, and joy.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:84%
They meet relatives and friends
of theirs who have died.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And they go through
panoramic memory

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:84%
in which everything
they've ever done

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.430 align:middle line:84%
is displayed around them in
a sort of holographic three

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:90%
dimensional panorama.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
And they come back
from these experiences

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.380 align:middle line:84%
with a total new
take on life thinking

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.470 align:middle line:84%
that the most important thing
we can do while we're here

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.380 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how
to love and saying

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:84%
that they have no
more fear of death,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:84%
because they feel
that death is just

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:84%
a transition into
some other reality.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this other reality a
hallucination through firing

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:84%
synapses within the dying brain,
or could it be a literal other

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.580 align:middle line:84%
realm accessed by a liberated
consciousness at the moment

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.260 align:middle line:90%
of death?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:10%
In 2012, Dr. Eben Alexander
published the book

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:10%
"Proof of Heaven, a
Neurosurgeon's Journey

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.510 align:middle line:10%
into the Afterlife."

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
When several years
earlier his brain

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.430 align:middle line:84%
was attacked by a rare
and mysterious bacterium,

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:84%
he laid motionless in
a coma for seven days.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:84%
During that time,
Dr. Alexander claimed

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.650 align:middle line:84%
that he went on a journey
beyond this world,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.200 align:middle line:84%
meeting an angelic
being who guided him

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.440 align:middle line:84%
back to a divine
source of the universe.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:10%
It all started with
54 years of life

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.950 align:middle line:10%
working as an academic
neurosurgeon thinking I

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.410 align:middle line:10%
understood brain, mind,
and consciousness.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:84%
And then 4:30 in the
morning November 10, 2008,

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.830 align:middle line:84%
I suddenly became very ill
with a rapidly progressive gram

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.860 align:middle line:84%
negative bacterial
meningoencephalitis

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:90%
that took over my brain.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.590 align:middle line:84%
Within a few hours, drove
me into a state of seizures

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:90%
deep into coma.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.688 align:middle line:84%
And then I was admitted
to a hospital where

00:05:49.688 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:90%
I had worked as a neurosurgeon.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And I spent seven
days in that coma.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.400 align:middle line:84%
My doctors basically thought
I had a 10% chance of survival

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.190 align:middle line:84%
early in the week down to
2% by the end of the week

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:01.570 align:middle line:90%
with no chance of recovery.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
coming back to this world.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:84%
I had an extraordinary
experience

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.530 align:middle line:84%
that by all of
current neuroscience

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
would be completely
impossible because

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:84%
of the damage to the human
part of my brain, my neocortex.

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:90%
And yet it did happen.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And that has been the
basis of this mystery

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.940 align:middle line:84%
I've been trying to unravel
for the last nine years.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Alexander is one of
a growing number of highly

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.340 align:middle line:10%
credentialed medical
professionals who counter

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:10%
the arguments of scientists who
attribute the NDE experience

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:10%
to factors such as oxygen
shortage, imperfect anesthesia,

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.110 align:middle line:10%
and the body's neurochemical
responses to trauma.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Specialists like Dr. Alexander
dismiss these explanations

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.980 align:middle line:90%
as inadequate.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
The medical conditions under
which NDEs happen, they say,

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.060 align:middle line:84%
are too varied to explain
a phenomenon that seems

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.610 align:middle line:90%
so widespread and consistent.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.550 align:middle line:84%
They believe that the NDE
is a result of consciousness

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:84%
existing in some non-material
form independent of but closely

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:90%
connected to the brain.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.400 align:middle line:84%
At the time of death,
they hold, consciousness

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.730 align:middle line:84%
is released to
experience another realm.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Regardless of
scientific evidence,

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.150 align:middle line:84%
the near-death
experience has repeatedly

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.460 align:middle line:84%
been reported to be an
incredibly powerful one, often

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.360 align:middle line:84%
leading to profound
revelation and transformation.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it all started in
a very primitive, coarse,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.560 align:middle line:84%
unresponsive realm that I
call the earthworm's eye view,

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:84%
a very, very dark and murky
kind of coarse reality,

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:90%
like being in dirty jell-o.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Turns out that from
that realm I was rescued

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.460 align:middle line:84%
by a slowly spinning
white light, very clear,

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:84%
that came bundled with a
perfect musical melody.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.800 align:middle line:84%
And that white light
opened up like a rip

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:84%
in the fabric of that ugly
earthworm eye view realm

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:46.080 align:middle line:84%
and led up into an
ultra-real valley, what

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:84%
I call the gateway
valley, that was filled

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:90%
with many Earth-like features.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:84%
For example, there was lots
of plant life, lush growing

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.430 align:middle line:84%
flowers, blossoming
buds on trees.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.650 align:middle line:90%
No sign of any death or decay.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:84%
But that was only
a stepping stone

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle line:90%
to higher and higher levels.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, those angelic
choirs, the music from them

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.170 align:middle line:90%
provided yet another portal.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Music, vibration,
frequency are the way

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.080 align:middle line:84%
that our souls
transcend these realms.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.660 align:middle line:84%
But it was just an
extraordinary spiritual journey.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And the most amazing
thing, of course,

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
is that it happened when
my brain was demonstrably

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:84%
offline, when the neocortex
was known by neurologic exams

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:84%
and by my scans, my doctors
knew that I could not

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.730 align:middle line:84%
have had any kind of
robust experience,

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:84%
because this was far more
real than anything I've ever

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.809 align:middle line:90%
experienced in my existence.

00:08:37.809 --> 00:08:41.549 align:middle line:84%
>> So what then does the NDE
reveal about the very nature

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:43.090 align:middle line:90%
of reality?

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I am completely
confident saying, yeah,

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
the physical world
is an illusion.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And it makes me sound psychotic.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's all right,
because if they haul me

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.140 align:middle line:84%
away to a mental
hospital, that's

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
an illusion too and maybe
a very interesting one.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean we're not putting
the world down by saying

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.750 align:middle line:90%
that it's illusory.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:09.030 align:middle line:84%
This is an illusory narrative
driven thing we're in.

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:84%
And where I have come
and my thinking about it

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:16.980 align:middle line:84%
is that apparently we
finish this one story,

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and then we go through some
incomprehensible process,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:84%
and then I gather we're
back on another story line.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:10%
>> In 2014, linguist and author
Lisa Smartt created "The Final

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:10%
Words Project" with
Dr. Raymond Moody.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.550 align:middle line:84%
This investigation
collects accounts

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:84%
from health care providers,
friends, and family members

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.240 align:middle line:90%
of the dying.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.460 align:middle line:10%
Her book, "Words
at the Threshold,"

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:45.050 align:middle line:10%
offers the early findings
of the investigation.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So in the words of Steven
Jobs just before he died,

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:90%
the words were, oh wow.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh wow.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:54.170 align:middle line:90%
Oh wow.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.710 align:middle line:10%
>> His words are the ones
that might be most popular.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.820 align:middle line:10%
Many of us have heard but
what's remarkable is bedrooms

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.800 align:middle line:10%
or in hospital rooms
throughout the country,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.410 align:middle line:10%
even throughout the
world, words like that

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:10%
are being heard privately.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
People are seeing remarkable
things, oftentimes,

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:90%
as they leave this world.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean of all the
things he'd seen

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:22.500 align:middle line:84%
in this life, what he had seen
over there was unbelievable.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:90%
>> So what is over there?

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Does it really exist?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.890 align:middle line:90%
And if so, where?

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:29.570 align:middle line:84%
While much more
scientific study is

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:33.500 align:middle line:84%
required to empirically answer
these questions, what is clear

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.270 align:middle line:84%
is that the
near-death experience

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
is an excellent
vehicle for exploring

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:84%
the ancient human
belief that we are

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.750 align:middle line:90%
more than our physical bodies.

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:84%
The reality of an
afterlife not only

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.980 align:middle line:84%
suggests that there is
more to consciousness

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
than chemical and electrical
impulses in the brain.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.860 align:middle line:84%
But when the end
of life is upon us,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.830 align:middle line:84%
fear may be an
unwarranted emotion.

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Life on this Earth is
precious, yet our passage

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
into the afterlife
beyond this reality

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:84%
may truly be a
wonderful journey.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean to my utter surprise,
there is a life after death.

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:12.030 align:middle line:90%
So don't be afraid of death.

00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:14.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not anything
to be scared of.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But stay here as
long as your sentence

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.320 align:middle line:84%
is, because when you get out
of here, it will make sense.
