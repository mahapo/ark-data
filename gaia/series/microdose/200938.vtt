And then I went like
that and the spoon broke.

>> For the mainstream, the
notion of someone possessing

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.760 align:middle line:84%
psychic abilities has been
regulated to works of fiction

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.890 align:middle line:90%
or fringe pseudoscience.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.610 align:middle line:84%
Yet there have been and continue
to be scientific studies

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.959 align:middle line:84%
into the phenomenon with
truly intriguing results.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:84%
>> In 2010, Lance Storm,
Patrizio Tressoldi,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and Lorenzo Di Risio analyzed
29 ganzfield studies,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:84%
a form of sensory deprivation
test, from 1997 to 2008.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:84%
Of the 1,498
trials, 483 produced

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
hits corresponding to
a hit rate of 32.2%.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:84%
This hit rate is
statistically significant.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.890 align:middle line:84%
Participants who were
thought to be psi-conducive

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
were found to perform
significantly better

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
than control participants
in the experiment.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.550 align:middle line:10%
During the 1970s, Russian
housewife and former member

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:10%
of the Red Army tank
regiment Nina Kulangina

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:10%
made international headlines
by demonstrating a series

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:10%
of astounding psychic powers.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:10%
Mainly focusing on her
psychokinetic abilities,

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.730 align:middle line:10%
Russian scientists studied
Kulangina in a series of tests

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:10%
ranging from moving objects
and influencing laser beam

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:10%
trajectories to the stopping
of a frog's beating heart,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:10%
all using only her mind.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Nina could even generate
electromagnetic heat

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:90%
with her body.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
While doing so, she
would occasionally

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:90%
burn holes in her own clothing.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.210 align:middle line:10%
In one instance,
she accidentally

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.340 align:middle line:10%
burnt the arm of a reporter
who happened to be present.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.600 align:middle line:84%
If psychic ability
can be demonstrated

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:84%
in statistically
significant amounts

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.160 align:middle line:84%
through scientific
investigation,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.750 align:middle line:84%
is it possible we all possess
some amount of psychic power?

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.710 align:middle line:84%
And if so, can we develop and
hone our own psychic abilities?

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.890 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, when I teach
psychic development,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.980 align:middle line:10%
I let those people know
everyone is psychic.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.450 align:middle line:10%
Everyone has the ability to
give some sort of message.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, is that
not everyone believes

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:84%
that they are, and nor
is that everyone's path.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a
passion to pursue,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.772 align:middle line:84%
how do I develop my ability
so that I can help others?

00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:10%
>> If psychic abilities
are indeed a reality,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:10%
it stands to reason that world
governments would realize

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.120 align:middle line:10%
the huge potential in
utilizing such skills,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:10%
particularly in the fields
of defense and intelligence.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:10%
In 1975, the CIA tasked two
laser physicists, Dr. Russell

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:10%
Targ and Hal Puthoff, to develop
a psychic spy program that

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.070 align:middle line:10%
spent more than $20
million over 20 years

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.910 align:middle line:10%
testing, developing, and
applying psychic abilities.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So I formed, together with
my colleague Hal Puthoff,

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.030 align:middle line:84%
another laser physicist, a ESP
program at Stanford Research

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Institute.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.800 align:middle line:84%
But we felt that
during the Cold War,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
psychic abilities might
actually be useful.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.750 align:middle line:10%
So we went to the
CIA and said, we

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:10%
think we have the
ability to describe

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.080 align:middle line:10%
distant places in a way
that would be useful to you.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And the CIA gave us some
demonstration-of-ability task

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:84%
to do and that was
successful, and we then

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.340 align:middle line:90%
had a 20-year research activity.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The fact that the CIA spent
millions in taxpayer dollars

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.850 align:middle line:84%
over decades investigating
psychic abilities does lend

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
credence to the
phenomenon's legitimacy.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Yet physical proof
is notoriously

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:90%
difficult to ascertain.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.329 align:middle line:84%
However, during the
government-funded studies, Drs.

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.149 align:middle line:84%
Russell Targ and Hal
Puthoff became interested

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.670 align:middle line:84%
in one particular
individual who seemed

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:84%
to possess remarkable
psychic abilities

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and was able to demonstrate
them repeatedly.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.085 align:middle line:10%
This individual's
name was Uri Geller.

00:04:32.085 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:10%
>> They were very concerned.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.270 align:middle line:10%
The CIA were concerned that
the Russians were ahead

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.610 align:middle line:10%
of them in psychical research.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And I leave in 1972, straight
to Palo Alto, California,

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:90%
to Stanford Research Institute.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.360 align:middle line:10%
And that's where Dr. Hal Puthoff
and Russel Targ and Edgar

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.210 align:middle line:10%
Mitchell, and all
those scientists who

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:10%
had very direct
links to the CIA,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.210 align:middle line:10%
they set up their
experiments with me.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Investigations into Uri
Geller's powers covered

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.690 align:middle line:84%
the gamut of psychical areas,
though his ability to use

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.620 align:middle line:84%
psychoanalysis to seemingly
bend a spoon was what he is most

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.770 align:middle line:90%
famous for.

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I hold a spoon and I
stroke it very gently,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:84%
and I look at it and I say,
bend, melt, bend, melt.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:90%
And look!

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.200 align:middle line:84%
The metal is becoming
almost like plastic.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Plasticine-- no
heat is produced!

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I say bend, melt,
bend, and look.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I went like
that and the spoon broke!

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.730 align:middle line:84%
I produce an energy
wave and it penetrates

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.605 align:middle line:84%
the molecular
structure of the metal.

00:05:56.605 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Though Uri's ability to bend
a spoon is Indeed an impressive

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.920 align:middle line:84%
demonstration, it hardly
seems likely that the CIA were

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.440 align:middle line:84%
focused on this aspect
of Geller's powers.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:84%
More likely, it was Uri Geller's
remote-viewing capabilities,

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.500 align:middle line:84%
which he previously
utilized for the Mossad

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:16.160 align:middle line:84%
in Israel, that offered
the CIA more interest.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
But what is remote viewing
and how does it work?

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell us about remote viewing.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.375 align:middle line:90%
Exactly what is that?

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:26.780 align:middle line:10%
>> It's essentially systematic,
extrasensory perception.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:10%
We take the innate ability
that we're all born with,

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:10%
that intuitive feeling
that we sometimes have,

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.370 align:middle line:10%
knowing that the
phone's going to ring.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:35.530 align:middle line:90%
We turn that into a skill.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.380 align:middle line:90%
So it's very similar language.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
The skill itself can be
taught to anyone within weeks.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.450 align:middle line:10%
>> My remote-viewing skills
kicked in and I started asking,

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:10%
OK, so I'm seeing my
target from this position.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.170 align:middle line:90%
Flip it.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.360 align:middle line:90%
And I drew it that way.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.200 align:middle line:90%
Show me this.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.400 align:middle line:90%
Give me the colors.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
Detail after detail, some
of the best remote-viewing

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:55.730 align:middle line:90%
I've ever done.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:84%
But all of us focused in
on removing the dark spots,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:90%
or the things that we saw--

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.843 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:07:03.843 --> 00:07:04.840 align:middle line:90%
>> --in that.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.715 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you have to see
the person physically?

00:07:06.715 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not at all.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Actually, we just
used the model.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:90%
Think about this, George!

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.610 align:middle line:84%
We've got scientists,
physicists, bank owners, CEOs,

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.960 align:middle line:84%
people of high intelligence
that are running things

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.305 align:middle line:84%
all around the world, coming
in and doing this work.

00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:27.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It's clear psychic abilities
have at least some basis

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:84%
in reality, as the phenomenon
is not simply rejected

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.220 align:middle line:84%
by legitimate science and
governmental institutions,

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:84%
but rather embraced
and investigated.

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:84%
We know the CIA has explored
the phenomena in the past

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
and some believe they continue
with these psy-programs

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.710 align:middle line:90%
to this day.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:84%
If experts believe these innate
skills lie dormant within us

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.700 align:middle line:84%
all, imagine a world in
which psychic abilities

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:84%
are encouraged and developed
instead of dismissed

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.410 align:middle line:90%
and rebuked.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:84%
So what's stopping you from
testing your own abilities

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:90%
for yourself?
