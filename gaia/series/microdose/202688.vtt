just had this certain something.

that made some people not just

special, but somehow,
totally break

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.130 align:middle line:84%
the mold of what people think

all have in common?

They are all stereotypes
that many people

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:84%
think of upon hearing
the word occult.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Witches were shrouded
in myth, fears, suspicion.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But despite their bad
reputations for being

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.480 align:middle line:84%
associated with the dark arts,
are occultist practices really

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:90%
evil?

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.860 align:middle line:10%

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.440 align:middle line:10%
They could be used for
good or bad purposes.

>> And if they're
not inherently evil,

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.830 align:middle line:84%
how did these practices get to
be associated with such social

disgrace and disapproval
in the first place?

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.550 align:middle line:84%
The word occult originates
from the Latin word occulere,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.410 align:middle line:90%
meaning conceal.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:84%
The dictionary defines
the word occult

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.740 align:middle line:84%
as involving or relating
to supernatural, mystical,

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:90%
or magical powers or phenomena.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Historically, many of
these occult practices

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.760 align:middle line:84%
have been hidden or practiced
in the shadows of society.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, occult
just means hidden.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.028 align:middle line:10%
And anything that people
feel is hidden from them,

00:02:18.028 --> 00:02:20.320 align:middle line:10%
it's like when the lights
are off and the room is dark,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.390 align:middle line:10%

The word magic, as
defined by Wikipedia,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.000 align:middle line:10%
is the application of
beliefs, rituals, or actions.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.810 align:middle line:10%
Practiced with the view that
they can subdue or manipulate

the natural trajectory in life.

in the supernatural,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.660 align:middle line:84%
the term occultism has taken on
a rather negative connotation.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.570 align:middle line:84%
As these practices tend
to oppose the prevailing

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:84%
worldview, which is
rooted in science.

even some religions,

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.860 align:middle line:84%
such as Wicca,
voodoo, and paganism.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.650 align:middle line:84%

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.660 align:middle line:84%

that they're
directing it towards.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.450 align:middle line:84%
The way I like to think
of it is that they

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
are the subtle connections
between the subtle layers

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.200 align:middle line:84%
of our consciousness and the
subtle layers of existence.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.710 align:middle line:10%

actual shape or the sound

Perhaps, the most well-known
person in all things occult

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:90%
is Aleister Crowley.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.920 align:middle line:84%
An English magician who lived
in the early 20th century.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
He was a member of the
secret society, The Hermetic

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.100 align:middle line:90%
Order of the Golden Dawn.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.350 align:middle line:84%
He founded the
religion of Thelema.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:10%
And wrote several
books, including

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.070 align:middle line:10%
"The Book of the Law."

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.090 align:middle line:10%
He is credited with adding a K
to the end of the word magic.

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
In order to differentiate
between those

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.760 align:middle line:84%
doing stage tricks and those
who are performing true magic.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.410 align:middle line:84%
Crowley is known
for practicing what

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:84%
he called sex
magic, experimenting

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
with drugs and altered
states of reality,

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.810 align:middle line:84%
and for sensationalizing
his practices in order

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:84%
to manipulate the
media and gain fame.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Aleister Crowley was
an extraordinary figure.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.190 align:middle line:90%
He was a great artist.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.260 align:middle line:84%
I think, in many ways,
he was a great intellect.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:28.410 align:middle line:84%
In many ways, he was a truly
great explorer into the occult.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:10%
But he didn't provide the
ethical guardrails in his life,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:10%
in his works, or in the
lives of his students

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.790 align:middle line:10%
that would help them not
get sucked into a, kind of,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:10%
magical narcissism.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It's a recipe for
great personal danger.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And danger to other
people around you.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> While Crowley might have
practiced both white and black

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:84%
magic, most experts suggest
that this is in the minority

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and that the majority of
practitioners use only positive

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.430 align:middle line:90%
intentions in their practices.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many disciplines,
including magic and witchcraft,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.500 align:middle line:84%
have moral codes that are
not to be crossed if you

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.690 align:middle line:90%
are practicing white magic.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.170 align:middle line:10%
>> White magic is magic that
is undertaken for one's own

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.790 align:middle line:10%
personal evolution.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.280 align:middle line:10%
It's, for instance,
yoga, meditation,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.487 align:middle line:10%
the spiritual
quest, understanding

00:06:19.487 --> 00:06:20.320 align:middle line:10%
spiritual technique.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Something for
humanity, basically.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.155 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
something for humanity.

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:28.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the vertically raising
oneself to be all that you can.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
My definition of
black magic would just

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.520 align:middle line:84%
be things done purely for
personal or material gain,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.800 align:middle line:90%
without any spiritual focus.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.780 align:middle line:84%
People who dabble in
the dark side of magic

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.440 align:middle line:90%
will get their fingers burnt.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Until you get your
fingers burnt,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.760 align:middle line:84%
you don't fully
understand how important

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.107 align:middle line:84%
it is to be rigorous
with following the rules.

00:06:47.107 --> 00:06:48.440 align:middle line:10%
>> There's actually three laws--

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.350 align:middle line:10%
very important.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.022 align:middle line:10%
Do what you want, but
don't hurt anyone.

00:06:51.022 --> 00:06:53.480 align:middle line:84%
Do what you want, but don't
interfere with another person's

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.280 align:middle line:90%
free will.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And as you send out,
so return three-fold.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:10%
>> A cause and effect,
action and reaction.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.270 align:middle line:10%
What you put out
comes back to you.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.778 align:middle line:84%
That's why I wouldn't do
curses or dark spells.

00:07:04.778 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:84%
Because if you live in a
world, I'm going to curse you,

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.620 align:middle line:84%
then you live in a world
where curses exist.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.440 align:middle line:84%
If you give and your
generous with your time,

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:15.950 align:middle line:84%
with your money, with your love,
that's what comes back to you.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.650 align:middle line:84%
>> If you do something from
a place of insecurity, fear,

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and thinking I can't have
it, unless I manipulate,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.070 align:middle line:84%
then you're not ever really
going to have that intrinsic

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.380 align:middle line:84%
power that allows you to
experience a really full

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.500 align:middle line:90%
and happy and abundant life.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.580 align:middle line:84%
>> If most occult practices keep
to these moral codes and most

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.520 align:middle line:84%
practitioners are
practicing white magic,

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.720 align:middle line:84%
why is it that many of these
disciplines have been demonized

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.190 align:middle line:90%
by society?

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.310 align:middle line:10%
>> The idea of paganism being
that it was pre-Christian,

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:48.380 align:middle line:10%
when the Christian
faith established itself

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.770 align:middle line:10%
as a dominant religious mindset,
then what came before it had

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:10%
to be evil and debased.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And so that sort of threw
paganism into that bracket.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the pagan
god, Lord of the Forest, Pan.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a horned God.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.930 align:middle line:90%
He's got horns.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.200 align:middle line:90%
And half his body's an animal.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's more
metaphorical than literal,

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.230 align:middle line:84%
but that image of Satan
came from that image

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.880 align:middle line:90%
of the horned god.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:10%
>> The witch stereotype is the
witch of popular imagination.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Normally, a woman who is
part of this large conspiracy

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:84%
with other witches
to worship the devil.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.440 align:middle line:90%
Renounce Christianity.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.540 align:middle line:90%
That person did not exist.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.960 align:middle line:84%
What did exist were shamans
and wise women and seers.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Usually, the negative
stereotypes of witchcraft are

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.880 align:middle line:10%
based in ignorance and
a lack of information.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.909 align:middle line:84%
So I think the information
age has actually

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.850 align:middle line:84%
been really, really healthy
for the international magical

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.880 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.410 align:middle line:84%
>> If authentic magic isn't
inherently bad or evil,

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.620 align:middle line:84%
then what is the true
purpose of studying it?

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The act of living a magical
life is a perpetual act

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.280 align:middle line:84%
of transformation and of
evolution-- personal evolution.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Adopting magic, or
any other spiritual path,

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.380 align:middle line:84%
turns you into the best
version of yourself.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.510 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to find
your purpose in life.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:04.718 align:middle line:84%
And that's what people love
more than anything right now.

00:09:04.718 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
They have all this stuff
and then all this media.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.350 align:middle line:84%
But they don't know who
they are and they don't

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.790 align:middle line:90%
know what their life is for.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.530 align:middle line:90%
And magic unveils that for you.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.835 align:middle line:84%
Once you have that,
then you're going along

00:09:14.835 --> 00:09:16.210 align:middle line:84%
with the current
of the universe.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.100 align:middle line:90%
And the doors just open for you.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.680 align:middle line:84%
>> If one is drawn
to the magical art,

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.460 align:middle line:84%
does one need to already possess
magical abilities in order

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.780 align:middle line:90%
to join a practice?

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.400 align:middle line:10%
>> I think we're
all born with it.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.320 align:middle line:10%
And it's just-- it's
like going to the gym

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:10%
and learning to work out.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.250 align:middle line:10%
To just allow that
intuition to come through.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.110 align:middle line:90%
There's exercises you can do.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:90%
There's meditations you can do.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.000 align:middle line:84%
It's really just about
shutting down your left brain.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000 align:middle line:84%
You have to get reason
and logic out of the way

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.580 align:middle line:84%
and allow that world where
that right brain side,

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.820 align:middle line:90%
where anything can happen.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.310 align:middle line:10%
>> We have a tendency to
want to say that's the magic.

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.540 align:middle line:90%
The magic is the runes.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.560 align:middle line:90%
The magic is the cards.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:90%
The magic is the "I Ching."

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.910 align:middle line:90%
We are the magic.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that
everybody has divine gifts.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.400 align:middle line:84%
It's do you want
to use them or not?

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can do this,
if they want it.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>> It's really easy
to change your life.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.600 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take money.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take a lot of time.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.660 align:middle line:84%
If you've got something
you feel like it's a curse,

00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:90%
grab a lemon.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:19.140 align:middle line:90%
Grab some salt. Do this thing.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.120 align:middle line:90%
It goes away.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Despite hundreds of years
of perpetual dismissal as evil

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.470 align:middle line:84%
or quackery, occult
practices have persisted

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:90%
on in the shadows of society.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.660 align:middle line:84%
With the majority having
altruistic and benevolent

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:90%
intentions.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Today, with the internet
and social media,

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.680 align:middle line:84%
these ancient magical practices
are becoming less hidden

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:50.350 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, the stigma and
fear of them is improving.

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:84%
However, many
practitioners of magic

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.810 align:middle line:84%
encourage others to
approach the magical life

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
as a serious modern
spiritual path

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
in order to really
benefit from all

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.880 align:middle line:84%
it has to offer in one's own
life and one's relationship

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:84%
to the world and
universe at large.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:14.000 align:middle line:90%
