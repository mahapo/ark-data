00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not well understood.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.190 align:middle line:10%

John Lear, Bob Lazar,
and many others

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.260 align:middle line:84%
have claimed the existence
of reverse engineered energy

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and propulsion systems from
alien technology for decades.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Bob told us that they were
going to test the alien craft

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:10%
that night.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.205 align:middle line:84%
Bob's job was to back
engineer to see if we

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:90%
could get that technology.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.040 align:middle line:10%
He told me in detail how the
antimatter reactor worked.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.540 align:middle line:90%
This is the antimatter reactor.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it sits
in the middle of the craft.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> If reversed alien
technology is real,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
then what is the energy source
used to power these vehicles?

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.400 align:middle line:84%
One possibility is
zero-point energy,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:84%
or the lowest possible energy
a quantum mechanical system

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.350 align:middle line:90%
can have.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.010 align:middle line:10%
It is theorized that with the
power of zero-point energy,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:10%
we could tap into
the vacuum of space

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.010 align:middle line:10%
and pull an endless
amount of clean energy.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Everything changes vary
dramatically from this simple

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.030 align:middle line:10%
fundamental understanding
that space is full of energy.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.270 align:middle line:90%
And it's the source of creation.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.450 align:middle line:84%
If we extract 1
billionth of a billionth

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:84%
of a billionth of a
percent of the energy

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.640 align:middle line:84%
that's in a centimeter
cube of space,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.300 align:middle line:84%
we would have enough energy to
run our planet for thousands

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.350 align:middle line:90%
of years.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:84%
>> By harnessing the power
of zero point energy,

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.980 align:middle line:84%
we may ultimately discover the
solution to our growing demand

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.310 align:middle line:84%
for energy and open the
potential to new propulsion

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.820 align:middle line:84%
systems that could take us
beyond our solar system.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.250 align:middle line:84%
We are talking
about a society that

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.070 align:middle line:84%
has access to their solar system
to most likely their galaxy are

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.930 align:middle line:84%
able to go from one universe to
another, even open worm holes,

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.340 align:middle line:84%
travel at instantaneous
speeds across the universe.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> But is it possible that
a clandestine group within

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.780 align:middle line:84%
the government is keeping this
existing technology under wraps

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:84%
and will stop at nothing to
conceal it from the public?

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Bill Colby had
been read into this.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.100 align:middle line:10%
In his retirement,
he was going to try

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.470 align:middle line:10%
to get one of these so-called
zero-point energy systems

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.372 align:middle line:10%
to us with some funding.

00:05:56.372 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
That week that he
was going to meet

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.560 align:middle line:84%
with a member of my
board of directors,

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.630 align:middle line:84%
they found him floating
down the Potomac River.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Assassination team
had taken him out,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.860 align:middle line:84%
made it look like a
drowning or a suicide.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.160 align:middle line:10%
>> With the Invention
Secrecy Act, enacted in 1951,

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.150 align:middle line:10%
the US government gained the
means to control the release

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:10%
of new technologies that might
threaten the national defense

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.090 align:middle line:10%
and economic stability
of the country.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.020 align:middle line:84%
The Act is still in effect today
with an ever increasing amount

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:84%
of secrecy orders being
issued every year.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So why would these
groups within government

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.890 align:middle line:84%
keep the reality of free
energy so secretive and out

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.960 align:middle line:84%
of the public
arena when it could

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.320 align:middle line:84%
be the solution to so
many of the problems we

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.000 align:middle line:90%
face in the world today?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>> By the mid '50s onwards, we
have not needed oil, gas, coal,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.330 align:middle line:90%
rockets--

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:90%
nuclear jets, cars.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.190 align:middle line:84%
The good news here is
that this is fixable.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.150 align:middle line:10%
The cure some people view
is worse than the illness,

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:10%
in the sense that
at this point it

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.460 align:middle line:10%
would disrupt hundreds
of trillions of dollars

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:10%
in fossil fuel and
infrastructure assets

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.890 align:middle line:10%
and what have you in order
for these zero-point and other

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:10%
technologies to come out.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Considering the consequences
of our current trajectory,

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:84%
should the introduction
of zero-point energy

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.750 align:middle line:84%
into the public sphere be seen
as a necessary move no matter

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.660 align:middle line:84%
the disruption it may cause
to the stranglehold global

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:90%
corporations have on our lives?

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.170 align:middle line:10%
>> This is an enormous problem,
because in the '50s, it would

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.600 align:middle line:10%
have been a daunting
thing to take on.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.180 align:middle line:10%
To do it now, you have
much more of the world

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:10%
dependent on this centralized
energy and corporate

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:10%
and petrodollar system
than you did in 1945

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.860 align:middle line:10%
or '55 or '65 or even '75.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:10%
But we need to move on
into this next chapter,

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.690 align:middle line:10%
not only for the benefit of
humanity, but to for Gaia

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:10%
and for the sustainability
of this planet.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Would it ultimately be
in humanity's best interest

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.260 align:middle line:90%
to release the technology?

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And if so, what can
we do to pressure

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:84%
those secretive gatekeepers
into releasing it?

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the whole thing
ought to be open sourced.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Just put it out there for
the benefit of everybody.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:10%
Human civilization has to
raise its consciousness

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:10%
enough so that these
technologies and the ones

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.650 align:middle line:10%
to follow could be
responsibly implemented.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:10%
>> It is the only path
to sustainability.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:32.030 align:middle line:10%
We must learn to extract energy
from this source of energy that

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.740 align:middle line:10%
is at the foundation of creation
and utilizing that as the power

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.720 align:middle line:10%
source of your society.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.360 align:middle line:84%
This will transform
everything we know.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.870 align:middle line:84%
And we are arriving
at this point.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.480 align:middle line:84%
