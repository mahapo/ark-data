00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The being that comes forward is
a real presence or information

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:84%

is interpreted by yourself

have been discussed.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the concept
in and of itself

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.460 align:middle line:90%

How did it do that?

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, it goes back to the
issue that string theorists

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:90%
are grappling with--

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.570 align:middle line:84%
the challenge of identifying

over 10 to the power
500 possibilities,

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:90%
which is a massive number.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.480 align:middle line:84%
String theorists
have instead proposed

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.500 align:middle line:84%
that all of these possibilities
are equally probable,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:84%
and likely exist somewhere
within a multiverse,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:84%

10 to the power of 500

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
differently tuned universes out
there in the multiverse, maybe

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.240 align:middle line:90%
even infinite numbers.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> If the existence of other

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.860 align:middle line:84%
then wouldn't the idea of beings

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:90%
as legitimate?

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.150 align:middle line:90%
So what are these beings?

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Do they have purely
benevolent reasons

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.710 align:middle line:90%
for interacting with humanity?

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.650 align:middle line:84%

they're on a timeline
that is now--

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:10%
our information can
be more helpful.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:10%
We have moved beyond density,
and we bridge back and forth

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:47.640 align:middle line:10%
between non-physicality

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.740 align:middle line:10%
to be able to communicate.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:84%
From our standpoint, we are
no longer in physical form,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:03.000 align:middle line:84%
and even our densest nature does
not hold physical separation.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>> These beings are known in
our realities like the masters

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:90%
and guides of every dimension.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:10%
What they do is to resonate
to the system of the matter

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.620 align:middle line:10%
all the process of creation
to help us understand

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.830 align:middle line:10%
which ways we can
take in order to be

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.390 align:middle line:10%
in the same level of
vibration as them.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So even the darkest
ones and light ones,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:84%
they are leaving patterns
to us so we could reach

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.790 align:middle line:84%
and understand how we
can build a good reality,

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.100 align:middle line:84%
and how we can transcend
the reality we live in.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.160 align:middle line:10%
>> The role that many of us in
this collective have is energy

balancing.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:10%
So we are assigned,
several of us,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.680 align:middle line:10%
to bring balance
to certain points

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.900 align:middle line:10%

mm, mm, a little bit

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:90%
of a volcano in waiting.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
That is not actually how we see

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:10%
You are coming to
this culmination point

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.220 align:middle line:10%
in human history,
which will take

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:10%
place between 2030 and 2050.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:10%
And that will be when

to take from us?

reality.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Spirit attachments are
in a different dimension

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.070 align:middle line:84%
that attach to you
because we have energy

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.170 align:middle line:90%
and they need energy.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the underlying
basis for the interaction.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.850 align:middle line:84%
They are not actually giving you
information like the entities,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.230 align:middle line:90%
but more taking of your energy.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.330 align:middle line:90%
What about ghosts?

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.880 align:middle line:84%
Ghosts are not
exactly non-physical.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:84%
People that are alive might be
sending information or energy

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.460 align:middle line:84%
to the person that
has passed, and that

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.930 align:middle line:84%
might energize them to come
into the physical form.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It would seem the importance
of inviting only those higher

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.010 align:middle line:84%
vibrational energies into your

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.130 align:middle line:84%
When interactions with
interdimensional beings occur,

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.030 align:middle line:84%
having control over that which
positively enriches your life

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:90%
is a recommended approach.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I teach that you should
not put your energy towards

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:42.790 align:middle line:84%
non-physical beings, and instead
focus on internally knowing who

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:90%
you are and being yourself.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:84%
This will keep you safe, and
create trust within yourself.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
>> How much influence might
we assume is directed from

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.390 align:middle line:90%
interdimensional entities?

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And is there cause for concern
from these interactions?

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Their ability to influence
and affect us has a lot to do

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:84%
with what we believe their
ability to affect us is.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So if we believe they
have an effect on us,

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.313 align:middle line:90%
then they can affect us.

00:08:09.313 --> 00:08:11.230 align:middle line:84%
If we believe they don't
have an effect on us,

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.550 align:middle line:90%
then they tend to not.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's our thinking and our
belief systems that actually

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
become our own reality
when we're visualizing.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:90%
>> More than anything else, yes.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:84%
I think our experience
tells us that most of them

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:90%
are beneficial.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are basically
trying to help and cooperate,

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.900 align:middle line:84%
and that 5% that just is
trying to cause trouble.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> If the majority of
interdimensional beings are

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.610 align:middle line:84%
trying to guide us
in positive ways,

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.188 align:middle line:84%
what is the message they
are trying to deliver?

00:08:40.188 --> 00:08:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>> These beings have a lot of
information and a lot of access

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.530 align:middle line:84%
to information that
they want to share,

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and they're encouraging us to
understand how to access that

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.460 align:middle line:90%
information, as well.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.250 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, knowledge,
information, truth.

>> It would seem that the
influence interdimensional

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:59.110 align:middle line:84%
beings have over humanity is
dictated by our own perceptions

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:84%
If we are to resonate
with the guidance

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.380 align:middle line:84%
from beings who wish
to help, we must first

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:84%
recognize when we are being led
astray by negative entities.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.880 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps, with a cautioned
approach to further exploration

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.300 align:middle line:84%
and contact with
interdimensional beings,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:84%
we may learn the secrets of
our own universe and beyond.
