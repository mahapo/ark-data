This ability for the
dreamer to be aware

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.340 align:middle line:84%
that he or she is dreaming
is called lucid dreaming.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.290 align:middle line:84%
In this state of
awareness, the dreamer

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:84%
can learn and receive
guidance from the dream

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
narrative, environment, and
even the dream characters.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.410 align:middle line:84%
The term lucid
dreaming was coined

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.180 align:middle line:84%
by a Dutch psychiatrist named
Frederik van Eeden in 1913.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.310 align:middle line:84%
However, early references
to this phenomenon

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.530 align:middle line:84%
can be found in
ancient Greek writings,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
as well as in ancient Hindu
and Buddhist practices.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.120 align:middle line:10%
In 1975, parapsychologist
Keith Hearne

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.390 align:middle line:10%
proved that people can be
conscious in their dreams

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.600 align:middle line:10%
by having his test subjects
give coded eye signals

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.560 align:middle line:10%
while they were dreaming, thus
proving that they were lucid.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:10%
>> When people were
in the dream state,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:10%
they were able to communicate by
moving their eyes right, left,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.030 align:middle line:10%
right, left--

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:10%
you know, going back and forth.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:84%
>> This was conscious signaling
from the lucid dream state

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.270 align:middle line:90%
world to the lab techs?

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And that was what demonstrated
that lucid dreaming was

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.710 align:middle line:90%
a reality.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Before jumping into
how to lucid dream,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.200 align:middle line:84%
are there any actual benefits
to learning this practice?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, studies show that
lucid dreaming can literally

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.930 align:middle line:90%
rewire your brain.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.090 align:middle line:10%
During normal dreaming,
the part of your brain

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.640 align:middle line:10%
called the visual
cortex is activated

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.590 align:middle line:10%
and your prefrontal
cortex, which

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.980 align:middle line:10%
is associated with your sense
of self, is deactivated.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.220 align:middle line:84%
But during a lucid dream,
your prefrontal cortex

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:90%
suddenly gets activated.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.259 align:middle line:10%
>> Once the prefrontal
cortex is activated,

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:10%
neuroplasticity
becomes activated too.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it
gets really interesting.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity, of
course, the phenomena

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.880 align:middle line:84%
of the brain to
rewire itself in favor

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.310 align:middle line:90%
of a repeated action or habit.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.940 align:middle line:84%
What you do in the lucid dream,
how you spend the lucid dream,

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:84%
actually rewires your brain
in favor of that activity.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.228 align:middle line:84%
This means that you can
learn in your lucid dreams.

00:02:33.228 --> 00:02:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the more
fascinating studies coming out

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.900 align:middle line:84%
of Heidelberg University in
Germany showed that 9% of all

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.230 align:middle line:84%
athletes who used the lucid
dream state to practice motor

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:84%
skills displayed a positive
impact on physical performance.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.830 align:middle line:84%
The study confirmed that
practicing movements

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.340 align:middle line:84%
in lucid dreams is
possible and could possibly

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:84%
even improve physical
performance in waking life.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> They were strengthening
the neural pathways,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.040 align:middle line:84%
which meant in the waking
state, when they did squats,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.610 align:middle line:84%
they could do more of them and
this led to increased muscle

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.410 align:middle line:90%
mass.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:90%
But so what?

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:84%
We can get a nice bum and tum if
we work out in the lucid dream.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:84%
Imagine if we practice
our meditation

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.460 align:middle line:84%
in a lucid dream, if we
practice being the person

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.530 align:middle line:84%
that we know we could
be, if we could just

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.770 align:middle line:84%
remove that block of fear that
stops us being that person.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:84%
That's how we can really retrain
our brains for lucid dreaming.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Lucid dreaming can also
help us access the depths

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
of our subconscious in
order to heal trauma,

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.833 align:middle line:84%
release stuck emotions, and even
to physically heal the body.

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:34.250 align:middle line:10%
>> Dreaming is
medicine, you know,

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.050 align:middle line:10%
what the body knows
what's going on inside.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.470 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the ways it tries to
speak to us is through dreams.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can read dreams by
looking at the landscapes

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and conflicts inside the dream
as scenes from inside the body.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Being conscious in your
dreams also means that you can

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.070 align:middle line:84%
actively try to solve current
conflicts in your life.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> A dream character could
literally walk in and say,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.910 align:middle line:84%
dude, you've got to get
your finances in order.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:90%
We're struggling here.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.040 align:middle line:84%
You need to sort this
out in real life.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, it's amazing what you can
get from the dream if you ask.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Lucid dreaming can also be
a remarkably powerful method

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.820 align:middle line:84%
of preparing yourself for
important situations like a job

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.400 align:middle line:90%
interview or closing a big deal.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Like a computer
simulation, we all

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.519 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to practice
anything while lucid dreaming,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
preparing ourselves
for experiences that

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.278 align:middle line:90%
can be applied in waking life.

00:04:23.278 --> 00:04:25.820 align:middle line:10%
>> You know, if you go into the
lucid dream and call out I am

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.280 align:middle line:10%
lovable, I attract
love into my life,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:10%
that's not just like
me saying it now.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.960 align:middle line:84%
That's like an echo
chamber, you know?

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.793 align:middle line:84%
That's like saying
it 1,000 times.

00:04:34.793 --> 00:04:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Once you do it in the
lucid dream state,

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.340 align:middle line:84%
it's a very, very powerful place
for amplification of intent.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And lastly, lucid dreams
may allow you to interact with

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:84%
your higher self,
deceased relatives,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.880 align:middle line:84%
or enlightened beings who
have guidance for you.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.940 align:middle line:10%
>> It puts us in touch with
wiser sources than the waking

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:53.780 align:middle line:10%
mind.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:10%
It puts us in touch with the
high self for greater self.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.100 align:middle line:84%
It puts us in touch
with the ancestors

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and our authentic
spiritual teachers.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Studies show people
spend an average of 26 years

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:90%
of their life sleeping.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.270 align:middle line:84%
So wouldn't it be great
to be able to access

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.690 align:middle line:84%
some of that time in order
to work on your life?

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Here are some steps from experts
to get you started on your path

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.030 align:middle line:90%
to lucid dreaming.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:84%
First, track your
dreams every night

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.250 align:middle line:84%
for several weeks
using a dream journal.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Write down anything
you can remember,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
including colors, sounds,
visuals, or even just

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.900 align:middle line:90%
feelings you had.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.240 align:middle line:84%
After a few weeks,
review your journal

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.080 align:middle line:84%
and look for dream signs,
which would be anything

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
out of the ordinary
that could signal

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
to you that it was a dream
as opposed to real life.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:10%
>> Is there any, you know,
weird moments going on?

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.390 align:middle line:10%
Is there, like, a pink elephant
walking across the street?

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:49.720 align:middle line:84%
That might be a sign that
you're either at the circus

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:90%
or that you're dreaming.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Then, during
your waking life,

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.340 align:middle line:84%
stop to ask yourself every
so often, am I dreaming?

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:10%
Try doing this about
20 times per day

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.600 align:middle line:10%
so that you get into
the habit of asking.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And then all this
leads up to a moment where

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
you're in the dream, and your
mind that has become accustomed

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.080 align:middle line:84%
to asking that question asks
the question, am I dreaming?

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And in the dream, you
just flew to this party--

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm in a dream.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean that's the moment
where you switched from not

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.310 align:middle line:90%
being lucid to becoming lucid.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And finally, have the
intention of having a lucid

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:25.330 align:middle line:90%
dream.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Tell yourself over
and over in your mind

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.460 align:middle line:84%
as you are falling
asleep that you will

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.500 align:middle line:90%
be conscious in your dreams.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:10%
>> So if we engage the hypnotic
suggestion to become lucid

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:10%
in our dreams, we engage a very
powerful intention that may

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:10%
well help us get lucid tonight.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So after practicing
lucid dreaming in your life

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:84%
for a while, what are the
overall effects that you may

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>> If we are in sync, we realize
that we get the dreams we need

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:90%
at exactly the right time.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an innate
enlightened intelligence within

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.460 align:middle line:84%
us which shines through in the
dreams and guides us but only

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.830 align:middle line:84%
if we are willing to listen
and to take our fingers out

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.630 align:middle line:90%
of our ears.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So if being conscious in
your dreams is shown to help you

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.320 align:middle line:84%
manifest your desires,
resolve conflicts,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and even rewire your brain, then
perhaps we could start looking

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.270 align:middle line:84%
to lucid dreaming as a guidance
system that we can access

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.050 align:middle line:84%
and download information
from every single night.
