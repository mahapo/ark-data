00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.960 align:middle line:84%
The practice of
channeling is a means

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.750 align:middle line:84%
of communicating with a
discarded consciousness

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:84%
by allowing that consciousness
to express itself

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:90%
through the channeler's body.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Greetings, dear ones.

somebody is whispering to me
from the other side of a room.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like a thought
that pushes aside

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.880 align:middle line:84%
all other thoughts to
the forefront of my mind

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.960 align:middle line:84%
that has this quality of
truth that I can't deny

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.630 align:middle line:84%
and is always, almost always,
not convenient to what

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:90%
I want to hear.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:90%

the channeler are, in fact,
from a legitimate other worldly

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:10%
source and not just
the work of charlatans?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.840 align:middle line:10%
>> I did a channeling with my
head wired to an EEG machine,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.900 align:middle line:10%
and one of the most profound
things is that there are

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.810 align:middle line:10%
certain centers of the brain
that are responsible supposedly

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:10%
for processing the personality.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.260 align:middle line:84%
During the channeling state, my
personality center is shut off.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.940 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm not there,
who's speaking?

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.800 align:middle line:84%
The other thing we
found out is that there

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.810 align:middle line:84%
are certain things
that are called

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.450 align:middle line:84%

The set point when I
channel changes in seconds,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.615 align:middle line:84%
and that's not supposed
to be possible.

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The practice of channeling
has been around since earliest

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
eras of human history as shamans
and witch doctors have always

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:84%
claimed the ability to
communicate with the other

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:90%
side.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.770 align:middle line:84%
Trance channeling is thought
to have begun in ancient Egypt

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
and ancient China
where the name Wu was

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.750 align:middle line:90%
given to trance channelers.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:84%
In ancient Greece, the
high priestess, the Pythia,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
also known as the
Oracle of Delphi,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.110 align:middle line:84%
was a role played by many
women over a 600-year period.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.690 align:middle line:10%
Ancient Greeks would never
make important decisions

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.300 align:middle line:10%
without first
consulting the Oracle.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.310 align:middle line:84%
Travelers would
travel great distances

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
to seek guidance
from her prophecies.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the main accounts
regarding the Oracle's process

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.770 align:middle line:84%
claims that she would
inhale vapors rising

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.620 align:middle line:84%
from a chasm in the rock
after which she would

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:84%
enter a trance-like
state and begin

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:90%
speaking with an altered voice.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:84%
It was speculated
that she was speaking

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of the gods,
specifically Apollo.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Spartan Victor of the
Peloponnesian War,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Lysander, was warned
by the Oracle, also

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.900 align:middle line:84%
the dragon Earthborn, in
craftiness, coming behind thee.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.160 align:middle line:10%
Eight years later, Lysander
was slain, stabbed from behind

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:10%
by a warrior who yielded a
shield with a serpent painted

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:10%
on it.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:84%
The case could be made
for every religion

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.490 align:middle line:84%
being the result of
channeled communication

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
from another realm.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:84%
Could Moses have essentially
channeled the Ten Commandments

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.160 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible?

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Could the Quran
be channeled texts

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.720 align:middle line:90%
representing the word of God?

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Famous channelers within
the Christian church

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
include Joan of Arc,
Michel de Nostradamus,

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:90%
and Saint John of the Cross.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
However, the
Christian church did

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.050 align:middle line:84%
make a distinction between
holy spirit channelers

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.170 align:middle line:84%
and those who they believed
to be channeling evil spirits.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
They claimed these people
were possessed by the devil

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.525 align:middle line:84%
and burned them at the stake
as witches or heretics.

00:04:32.525 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:90%


00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, the
practice continued

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:84%
on through the centuries
with well-known channelers

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.420 align:middle line:84%
such as Edgar Cayce, Jack
Purcell, and Jane Roberts,

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
who channeled an entire
bestselling book called

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.330 align:middle line:90%
"Seth Speaks" in 1972.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.650 align:middle line:10%
>> I wasn't aware of my body
at all or the manuscript,

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.560 align:middle line:10%
the writing, or anything.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
that I really hope

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:84%
is that people would begin
to trust their own revelatory

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.230 align:middle line:84%
experience and not automatically
cloak it in whatever dogma

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.958 align:middle line:90%
they believe in.

00:05:07.958 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:84%

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.290 align:middle line:90%
known as Ra.

complex that was attempting to
aid in the spiritual evolution

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Through Carla, Ra

of teachings including

>> But who are some of the other
beings trying to communicate

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.230 align:middle line:90%
with us and why?

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Experts say that channeling
might include communicating

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
with spirit guides, ascended
masters, angels, deceased loved

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.660 align:middle line:84%
ones, deities,
extraterrestrials,

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.120 align:middle line:84%
spirits that have
never incarnated,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.820 align:middle line:90%
and even your own higher self.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Their purpose, according
to many channeled entities,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:90%
is to help humanity.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Humanity is a collective.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:84%
You imprint the
collective consciousness

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.330 align:middle line:84%
of all of humanity
regardless of the state

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.190 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness of some of
the humans that occupy Earth.

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the most common
themes of channeled messages

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:84%
include the nature of the human
existence, manifesting desires,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.275 align:middle line:84%
and the misunderstandings
of death.

00:06:53.275 --> 00:06:56.950 align:middle line:10%
>> Dying is the easiest thing
you'll ever do because you are

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.830 align:middle line:10%
reemerging back into
the world of spirit,

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.500 align:middle line:10%
back to where you came
come, back to your source.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Regardless of what happens
to the physical personality,

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.050 align:middle line:10%
the spirit, the being, the
consciousness is eternal

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:10%
and infinite.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:10%
>> You create your realities,
every bit of your realities.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Whatever you are
putting out emotionally,

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.512 align:middle line:10%
you're going to get
back energetically.

00:07:20.512 --> 00:07:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>> During a channeling session,
the channeler can receive up

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.750 align:middle line:90%
to hours of information.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.860 align:middle line:84%
So how aware is the channeler of
the information being relayed?

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.760 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm aware that there is
a communication going on.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:10%
I don't really hear the
words because that's

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:10%
secondary to what I'm receiving.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm receiving these
telepathic concepts

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.610 align:middle line:84%
in a way that allows
me to experience

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.270 align:middle line:84%
imagery and emotion
that's so all encompassing

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.970 align:middle line:84%
that if I were to pay attention
to the translation which

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.920 align:middle line:84%
is for the person
asking the question,

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I would take myself out
of the altered state.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So how exactly does
the connection take place?

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:00.820 align:middle line:84%
>> You shift your brain wave
frequency into a state called

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
gamma, which is about 40
to 100 cycles per second,

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and then Bashar makes an
adjustment in his brainwave

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.420 align:middle line:90%
frequency.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.200 align:middle line:84%
And somewhere in
the middle we lock.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.850 align:middle line:10%
And as we vibrate
together, what you get

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.570 align:middle line:10%
is a translation of his
thoughts into the language

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.890 align:middle line:10%
that I'm programmed with.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:21.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Experts recommend a healthy
dose of cautiousness for those

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.560 align:middle line:84%
intending to delve
into channeling.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:84%
While some self-proclaimed
channelers can fairly easily

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:84%
be identified as
fake, others who

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.460 align:middle line:84%
seem to be having a legitimate
channeling experience

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:36.159 align:middle line:84%
may be bringing through
lower vibrational entities.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Possession is believed to
be a very real consequence

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.309 align:middle line:84%
of channeling as there are
many lower entities that

00:08:42.309 --> 00:08:44.500 align:middle line:90%
might attempt to invade a host.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Once attached, it is said
these negative entities

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:50.410 align:middle line:84%
can then feed off of
their host energy,

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.140 align:middle line:84%
instilling fearful
messages and weakening

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.270 align:middle line:90%
the person they are possessing.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:59.920 align:middle line:84%
However, this can only happen
if the person allows them in.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.390 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing to do when

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.820 align:middle line:84%
listening to a channeled
message or if you

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:08.260 align:middle line:84%
decide to attempt channeling
yourself is to use discernment.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Does the message feel
positive and uplifting to you,

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
or is it fearful
and disempowering?

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:17.710 align:middle line:10%
If your channeling session
feels negative or does not

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.380 align:middle line:10%
resonate with you
in any way, experts

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:23.080 align:middle line:10%
say to disconnect immediately.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.980 align:middle line:84%
Send the entity to the
light and leave it behind.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:10%
Channeled messages have
been received for millennia

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.230 align:middle line:10%
and will most likely
continue into the future

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:10%
if we are open and
willing to accept them.

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.790 align:middle line:84%
For the most part,
the practice is

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:90%
believed to be relatively safe.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's also important
to use discernment.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.320 align:middle line:84%
Always listen to
your inner truth

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.570 align:middle line:84%
when evaluating the merits
of channeled information.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.920 align:middle line:84%
If you do, however, feel a
calling to attempt channeling,

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:84%
then perhaps a trove
of ethereal wisdom

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.950 align:middle line:84%
lies just beyond
this earthly realm

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.180 align:middle line:90%
waiting for you to receive it.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.000 align:middle line:90%
