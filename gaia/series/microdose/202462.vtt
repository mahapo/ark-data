>> The eighth dimension is the
one that connects the whole

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.380 align:middle line:84%
thinking of the universe
in different levels

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.940 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.880 align:middle line:10%
Not only mind as in
the first dimension,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.940 align:middle line:10%
but also emotional and physical.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why we call the eighth
dimension the Akashic Records.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:84%
And also we call the eighth
dimension the matrix in which

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.450 align:middle line:90%
we are all in.

The concept of the
Akashic Records

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.250 align:middle line:10%
finds its origins in
ancient Sanskrit texts.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.030 align:middle line:84%
But what knowledge lies within
these treasured records?

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.638 align:middle line:84%
And how does one uncover
their eternal truths?

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.670 align:middle line:10%
The Hindu word akasha,
meaning upper sky,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:10%
was introduced into
Western culture

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:10%
by Theosophical Society
co-founder Helena Blavatsky

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.550 align:middle line:10%
during the mid-1800s.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:84%
Theosophists describe the akasha
as the primordial substance

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.300 align:middle line:90%
that includes all vital forces.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.130 align:middle line:84%
Though never
specifically referring

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.070 align:middle line:84%
to the Akashic Records
directly, Blavatsky

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.980 align:middle line:84%
did make reference to
indestructible tablets

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:84%
of the astral light,
utilized for recording

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.750 align:middle line:84%

referred to as the
Akashic Records,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.526 align:middle line:10%
was widely disseminated
by early theosophists,

00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:10%
like author Alfred
Percy Sinnett.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.210 align:middle line:10%
In his 1883 book
"Esoteric Buddhism,"

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.820 align:middle line:10%
Sinnett suggests one could
view their own Akashic

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.700 align:middle line:10%
Records upon attaining
higher stages

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.755 align:middle line:10%
of individual enlightenment.

00:02:15.755 --> 00:02:20.855 align:middle line:10%
>> The Akashic Records
is an etheric language.

00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:10%
It's an actual place, as
well as a modern day modality

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.470 align:middle line:10%
of healing and intuitive work.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.350 align:middle line:84%
It has the energetic imprint
of all of your past lifetimes.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
personal book of life

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
that's stored in the
etheric field of the planet,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.460 align:middle line:90%
in the Akashic Records.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can access this
during your lifetime

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:84%
and it will give you a
deeper knowing of who you are

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.470 align:middle line:90%
and why you're here.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Many religions reference
a posthumous life review upon

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.290 align:middle line:84%
entering the afterlife, where a
book of life or similar notion

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:84%
is used to judge and weigh
the merits of one's existence.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.850 align:middle line:84%
Yet, is the idea of
an Akashic library

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.920 align:middle line:90%
a literal, physical place?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Or a metaphorical myth used
to explain a complex idea?

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It's been referred to
as the Hall of Records,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:84%
the Library of Light, the Mind
of God, God's Remembrance.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:84%
There's many ways that
they are referred to.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:10%
And they hold what we would
call our past, present,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:10%
and potential future.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's because we are
here in linear time,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.660 align:middle line:84%
in the third
dimension, and we've

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.210 align:middle line:84%
agreed to this time
space continuum that

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:90%
says, well, there is a past.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:90%
There is a present.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.520 align:middle line:90%
And there's the future.

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But where these records
reside, we could say,

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
is really in the
entire eternal now.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:90%
In the present moment.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.780 align:middle line:90%
And so there is no past.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:90%
There is no future.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.620 align:middle line:90%
There is only now.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.840 align:middle line:84%
>> When I explain about
the eighth dimension

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
and the Akashic Records, I
just explain it like if it were

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.320 align:middle line:84%
a library or kind
of a Wikipedia,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.080 align:middle line:84%
where you can go and look
for any information you want.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.020 align:middle line:84%
But for the eighth
dimension, when

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.210 align:middle line:84%
you realize that every
dimension is just

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.190 align:middle line:84%
the perspective
of reality, do we

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
realize that the
eighth dimension is not

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
the place where you have to go
to look for that information.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.520 align:middle line:84%
But you have to become in
order to see it and feel

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.760 align:middle line:90%
that information.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> It would seem that accessing
the Akashic Records is a more

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:84%
metaphysical process than merely
reading words on a physical

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:90%
page.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So how is human consciousness
connected to the Akashic realm?

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> If we think that we are
a leaf or a flower in a tree

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.020 align:middle line:84%
and because we a
leaf or a flower,

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.130 align:middle line:84%
we are trapped in the tree it's
because we didn't understand

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:84%
that the flower and leaf
are the product of the tree.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:90%
They are not something separate.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.190 align:middle line:84%
They are trying
to feed the tree.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:84%
With every experience,
with every breath,

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.210 align:middle line:90%
you are feeding the network.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.220 align:middle line:84%
The Akashic Records
is like this library

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.660 align:middle line:84%
where every book that
hasn't been written yet

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.950 align:middle line:84%
and every book that was written
shares the information all

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.480 align:middle line:90%
the time.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Though the insight one might
gain from viewing their own

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.830 align:middle line:10%
Akashic Records is
a tempting prospect,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:10%
Matias de Stefano warns against
this practice before one is

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.370 align:middle line:10%
spiritually prepared.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is the difference
between the people that is

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:84%
trying to get into the Akashic
Records to look for information

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and the people that is
willing to transform itself.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So if you take the information
from other universe,

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:84%
instead of creating
your own universe so

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.280 align:middle line:84%
you will be eating the
fruit of that tree of life.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And your own reality
will disappear

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and will be destroyed
by the information that

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.390 align:middle line:90%
is not your vibration.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.230 align:middle line:84%
That's why in the story,
when Eve eats the apple,

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.290 align:middle line:84%
the whole story for
them is destroyed.

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Because she was not building
their own information.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.910 align:middle line:84%
The only way you can download
that information is not

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.320 align:middle line:84%
going there and look for
it, but to be yourself.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Transform into the vibration
of that information

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.840 align:middle line:90%
so you can download it.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.180 align:middle line:90%
That's the good way of doing it.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.700 align:middle line:84%
Don't go and look
for the information.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Just put yourself in the
level of that information

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:84%
so it could be
downloaded to you.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Accessing the records
is not as simple as walking

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.990 align:middle line:90%
into a local library.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
Those familiar with
the Akashic realm

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:84%
suggest one must first
attain a deeper understanding

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:84%
for the spiritual and
metaphysical process.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.080 align:middle line:84%
However, spiritually-minded
individuals

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.200 align:middle line:84%
suggest that with the knowledge
of the Akashic Records

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.420 align:middle line:84%
and their chronicling
of our past,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
present, and future,
comes a great tool

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:90%
for enriching one's life.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.790 align:middle line:84%
>> There's literally, no
inaccuracy with the book.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Because the book is
not going to be telling

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.950 align:middle line:90%
a fictional story for you.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:84%
The book is literally going
to be your truest self.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you connect
into your records,

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.500 align:middle line:84%
if you connect into
your book of life,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.930 align:middle line:90%
it's like looking in the mirror.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.560 align:middle line:90%
The mirror doesn't lie.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing about this mirror

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:41.060 align:middle line:90%
is it's a mirror for the soul.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And when you look into it,
you're actually able to write.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.540 align:middle line:84%
You're actually able to create,
to heal, to clear yourself,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.630 align:middle line:90%
to create a great life.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.900 align:middle line:84%
>> The story of our
lives is both individual

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and the coalescence of
all living things within

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:90%
our reality.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
Accessing the Akashic Records
and viewing our own past,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.480 align:middle line:84%
present, and future may be
the most profound guidance

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
to understanding the true
nature of our reality.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:90%
