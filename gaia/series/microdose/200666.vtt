>> Ancient Eastern cultures have
detailed descriptions of energy

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.120 align:middle line:10%
centers in the body
called chakras.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.210 align:middle line:84%
But is there scientific
evidence of chakras?

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And if so, can these
energetic areas

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.900 align:middle line:84%
be the key to lowering
stress and curing illnesses?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:10%
In 1975, professor of
Kinesiology at UCLA,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.080 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Valerie Hunt, recorded
radiation emanating

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:10%
from the body in areas that
are traditionally associated

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:10%
with the chakra points.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.930 align:middle line:10%
She also recorded sound
wave frequencies and colors

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:10%
associated with the
chakras, which corresponded

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:10%
to the colors that the
ancient Indian Hindu

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.709 align:middle line:10%
tradition established.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:09.003 align:middle line:10%
>> Dr. Valerie Hunt was actually
able to record the chakras that

00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:10%
are, of course, in the body.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.880 align:middle line:84%
And they also extend
beyond the body,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.730 align:middle line:84%
and determine the colors of
them and the sounds of them.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.425 align:middle line:84%
We've proven that these
flow through the body.

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:18.225 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely.

00:01:18.225 --> 00:01:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You can't see
them with an X-ray.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:84%
But scientists have used
radioactive isotopes--

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.482 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, they have?

00:01:24.482 --> 00:01:24.711 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:84%
>> --to actually
track the movement.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.370 align:middle line:84%
>> There have also been studies
on the energy channels that

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.090 align:middle line:84%
lead to the chakras, called
nadis in the Indian tradition

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:84%
or meridians in the
Chinese tradition.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:84%
In the 1980s, two
French researchers

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:84%
injected radioactive technetium
into the accupoints of patients

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and used nuclear
scanning equipment

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.580 align:middle line:84%
to follow the flow
of technetium.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.920 align:middle line:84%
When the true accupoints
were injected,

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.700 align:middle line:84%
the radioactive technetium
followed the exact pathways

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:84%
as the acupuncture meridians
in the ancient charts

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:90%
of Chinese acupuncture.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
The word, chakra, comes from
the Indian Sanskrit word

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.240 align:middle line:84%
for wheel, which describes
the round vortex-like energy

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.479 align:middle line:84%
centers along the sushumna
nadi, which runs along

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:90%
the spine of the human body.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.910 align:middle line:84%
The chakras are essentially
storage places for vital energy

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:84%
forces that connect the
physical body to the layers

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:90%
of the auric field.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Each chakra operates at
a specific frequency,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.710 align:middle line:84%
which determines its
color and characteristics.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Most familiar is the
seven chakra system,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.650 align:middle line:84%
starting with the root chakra
at the base of the spine

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and moving up to the crown
chakra at the top of the head.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.750 align:middle line:84%
However, there are
many more chakras

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.555 align:middle line:84%
that you can work with
in and around the body.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:10%
>> We find many different
chakra systems are taught

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.050 align:middle line:10%
in accordance with different
practices and in accordance

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:10%
with different practitioners.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Five chakra systems, six,
seven, nine chakra systems,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.550 align:middle line:84%
12 chakra systems, all the
way up to 21, or even 108

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.950 align:middle line:84%
chakras if you include
all these subtle energy

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.085 align:middle line:84%
centers in the various
limbs of the body.

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Practitioners use a tool
called a pendulum to read

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.780 align:middle line:90%
the chakras.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
When a chakra is
in balance, energy

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.075 align:middle line:84%
is free-flowing and spinning
clockwise at a constant medium

00:03:16.075 --> 00:03:16.875 align:middle line:90%
rate.

00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:19.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And I'd say I'm
about 3 inches out,

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.110 align:middle line:90%
and I'm right in front of it.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting great
clockwise movement.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite
large, by the way.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.305 align:middle line:90%
Good for you.

00:03:25.305 --> 00:03:28.110 align:middle line:84%
>> When it is spinning
counterclockwise,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:84%
or if it is spinning too
rapidly, or too slowly,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.950 align:middle line:84%
or not at all, these
are all indications

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.855 align:middle line:90%
of an out-of-balance chakra.

00:03:36.855 --> 00:03:40.367 align:middle line:10%
>> What stops our chakras
dead in the water is taking

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:42.450 align:middle line:10%
an emotion and saying, I'm
not going to feel that.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Just move on.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:90%
- Yeah.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
That energy freezes just like
your blood or your lymph.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:90%
You want it moving all the time.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And so when it stops moving, it
makes your field, your energy

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.180 align:middle line:90%
field all muddy looking.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, since our bodies
grow out of our energy fields--

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:90%
this such a key point--

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the body actually
grows out of the field.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.145 align:middle line:84%
Your body's ultimately going
to look like your field.

00:04:05.145 --> 00:04:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> There is now additional
technology available to assist

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:84%
in reading the chakras, a new
device called the Bio-Well,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
invented by Russian scientist,
Konstantin Korotkov,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:84%
is able to scan the chakras
from a person's fingertips using

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.620 align:middle line:84%
an electrophotonic
imaging technique.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.140 align:middle line:10%
The reading is then registered
by a computer program

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.390 align:middle line:10%
and analyzed by a
practitioner to see

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.820 align:middle line:10%
what is out of alignment.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.000 align:middle line:84%
It is said by experts that
out-of-balance chakras can

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.180 align:middle line:84%
manifest as physical illnesses
or emotional imbalances

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.050 align:middle line:84%
when we are not in alignment
with our life experiences.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.440 align:middle line:84%
>> The chakras are
not able to roll.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.690 align:middle line:10%
And that stuck the chakras,
and it becomes an illness--

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:10%
sick.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.610 align:middle line:10%
So every process that we
think is something bad that

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:10%
is happening to us, it's not
because someone is sending that

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:10%
to us; it's because we are
stuck in the process of not

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.600 align:middle line:10%
understanding why we
choose this experience.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do you balance a
chakra once its energy has

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.380 align:middle line:84%
gotten blocked,
stagnant, or too open?

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are many ways
to correct these imbalances,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
including meditating on
the out-of balance chakra,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.790 align:middle line:84%
eating foods that are of
the same color or vibration,

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
using tuning forks or
other instruments that

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.770 align:middle line:84%
hold the same frequency
of the chakra,

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.340 align:middle line:84%
working on stuck emotions
in the area of the chakra,

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and doing certain yoga, tai
chi, or qi gong practices that

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.940 align:middle line:84%
stimulate the energy
of the chakra,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.605 align:middle line:84%
using herbs or
essential oils, getting

00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:43.310 align:middle line:84%
a reflexology, acupuncture,
or Reiki session, and more.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.320 align:middle line:10%
There are also
numerous studies that

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:10%
show the efficacy of energy
healing practices related

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:10%
to the chakras.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.540 align:middle line:84%
In one early 1980s
study, therapeutic touch,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:84%
an energy healing technique
where the practitioner places

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:84%
their hands on or near the
patient to balance the chakras,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.550 align:middle line:90%
was put to the test.

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.940 align:middle line:10%
Dr. John Zimmerman used
a superconducting quantum

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.120 align:middle line:10%
interference device at the
University of Colorado School

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.460 align:middle line:10%
of Medicine in
Denver, and discovered

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.330 align:middle line:10%
that a huge, pulsating bio
magnetic field emanated

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.690 align:middle line:10%
from the hands of a
therapeutic touch practitioner.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.210 align:middle line:10%
The biomagnetic
pulsations from the hands

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:10%
swept back and forth
through the full range

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.530 align:middle line:10%
of therapeutic frequencies, thus
being able to stimulate healing

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.200 align:middle line:10%
in any part of the body.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:84%
In both 2006 and 2008,
stressed out lab rats

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.560 align:middle line:90%
received Reiki treatments.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And they all showed
significantly reduced

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:84%
stress, anxiety, and
depression responses.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.620 align:middle line:84%
Fake Reiki treatments were
given to the placebo group.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And they showed no reduction in
stress, anxiety, or depression.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:10%
>> We have so many people
after cancer treatment that are

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:10%
suffering from such
debilitating amounts of fatigue,

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.890 align:middle line:10%
including brain fog,
inability to get up and move.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, why aren't we

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.160 align:middle line:84%
looking at energy
healing for this?

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.440 align:middle line:84%
We were going to do a
randomized controlled trial.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:90%
So we did our placebo.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And we had a group of
skeptical scientists

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:90%
who mimicked the hand positions.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.290 align:middle line:84%
We found that the actual energy
healing not only dramatically

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.650 align:middle line:84%
reduced fatigue; within a month,
their brain fog had lifted.

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.640 align:middle line:84%
But also the rhythms of
cortisol in their body improved.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> People are experiencing a
wide range of benefits from

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.790 align:middle line:84%
balancing their chakras,
whether it's from acupuncture,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.350 align:middle line:84%
meditation, Reiki, or some
of the other chakra balancing

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.940 align:middle line:90%
practices.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So getting to know where energy
might be stuck or too open

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.350 align:middle line:84%
and balancing those
energies could possibly

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.230 align:middle line:84%
help you to not only
heal from illnesses,

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:48.710 align:middle line:84%
but to prevent illness from
manifesting to begin with.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.760 align:middle line:10%
A balanced chakra system could
mean a healthier body, mind,

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.800 align:middle line:10%
and spirit.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.150 align:middle line:90%
