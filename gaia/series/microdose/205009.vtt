>> I expect that
reincarnation is true.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.880 align:middle line:84%
After you leave your
body on this existence,

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.030 align:middle line:84%
then you go into
some other realm.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And after some
length of time has

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.300 align:middle line:84%
elapsed on this Earth
plane, for some reason

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:90%
you choose to go back.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.270 align:middle line:10%
There is a conscious process
in selecting the life

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:10%
that you're going to lead,
and that you consider

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.200 align:middle line:10%
different alternatives, and
then that you choose someone

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.720 align:middle line:10%
that I gather that you
learned something from.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Reincarnation is a
concept that stretches deep

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.170 align:middle line:84%
into our history and is the
central tenet for many pagan

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and Indian religions, including
Buddhism and Hinduism.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Billions of people
around the world

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:84%
still believe in
the idea of rebirth.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.820 align:middle line:84%
But is there any
scientific evidence

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:90%
to support such claims?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:10%
>> So what they've done is
to collect thousands of case

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:10%
studies that support the idea
that these kind of past life

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.950 align:middle line:10%
experiences are vividly
remembered and are even

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:10%
correlated with some kind
of physical birthmark.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:84%
>> If reincarnation is real,
then what might its purpose be?

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.480 align:middle line:84%
Why do souls
repeatedly incarnate?

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The soul is
required to evolve.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.260 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like
as a soul, we're

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:10%
required to come into body,
and we're required to learn.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.840 align:middle line:90%
And learning isn't easy.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The implications of
reincarnation are no less than

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.800 align:middle line:84%
profound and could answer some
of the big questions humans

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.880 align:middle line:84%
have been asking since
the dawn of time.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.127 align:middle line:90%
Who are we and why are we here?

00:01:51.115 --> 00:02:04.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.210 align:middle line:10%
>> In the United States, there's
this myth that ideas about

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.950 align:middle line:10%
reincarnation first came into
the west through India back

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.850 align:middle line:10%
in the 19th century.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.470 align:middle line:84%
But that's just simply not
correct because reincarnation,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:84%
it was present as an idea
at the very beginning

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.180 align:middle line:90%
of western civilization.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Scholars agree the concept
of reincarnation is rooted

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.800 align:middle line:90%
in antiquity.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Neanderthal
buried their dead

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.470 align:middle line:84%
along with their instruments
and food for future lives.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.500 align:middle line:10%
And the idea of
rebirth continued

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.600 align:middle line:10%
into western
civilization, and was

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:10%
famously taught by the
man who coined the term

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:10%
philosophy, Pythagoras.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Pythagoras, for example,
who was the person who coined

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.300 align:middle line:10%
the term philosophy,
was a reincarnationist.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:10%
And he claimed to remember
eight of his past lives,

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.310 align:middle line:10%
and had some
technique that he was

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.260 align:middle line:10%
able to get his students to
have that experience as well.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Past life regressions can
be a contentious topic among

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.480 align:middle line:10%
practitioners of psychology.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.390 align:middle line:10%
The evidence and accounts
are overwhelming,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.210 align:middle line:10%
but there's debate as
to what they really are.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.780 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Ian Stevenson was a
well-respected psychologist

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:10%
and was the chair of the
Department of Psychology

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:10%
at the University of Virginia.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:10%
He was given a $1 million
grant to fund research

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.630 align:middle line:10%
into paranormal psychology,
also known as parapsychology,

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.040 align:middle line:10%
with the intention of disproving
the concept of reincarnation.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Stevenson went on to
research thousands

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.620 align:middle line:84%
of cases on the uncanny
memories of young children

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:90%
from their past lives.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.570 align:middle line:10%
While his intention was to
disprove this phenomenon,

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:10%
in the end, he became one
of its staunchest defenders

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.750 align:middle line:10%
and most dedicated researchers.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.690 align:middle line:10%
Today, Dr. Jim Tucker
continues to conduct

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.880 align:middle line:10%
the work started by Stevenson.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:10%
Unlike past life regressionists,
Dr. Stevenson and Dr. Tucker

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.780 align:middle line:10%
do not study those
put under hypnosis.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:10%
Instead, they look
at cases of kids

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.570 align:middle line:10%
who start to spontaneously
remember things and start

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:10%
speaking about their previous
lives while fully cognizant.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.530 align:middle line:10%
In one of Tucker's papers,
he recounts a story

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:10%
of a boy from Thailand
who, at the age of three,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.380 align:middle line:10%
started complaining that
he had been shot and killed

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.190 align:middle line:10%
in his past life while
riding a bicycle to school.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:10%
He even remembered that
he was a local teacher,

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.020 align:middle line:10%
and he remembered
his name, Bua Kai.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.840 align:middle line:10%
His grandmother took him to the
village where he said he lived,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.100 align:middle line:10%
and he led her to a house.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.400 align:middle line:10%
He recognized the
people living there,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.255 align:middle line:10%
and they confirmed that five
years earlier, their son, Bua

00:04:43.255 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:10%
Kai, had been shot and killed
while riding a bike to work.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.620 align:middle line:10%
He was shot in the back of the
head, marked by a small entry

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:10%
wound, with a larger exit
wound in the front of his head.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.250 align:middle line:10%
The little boy had been
born with a small birthmark

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.850 align:middle line:10%
on the back of his head and
a larger, oddly-shaped mark

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:10%
on his forehead.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:10%
>> It happens a
lot with children.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:10%
And at the University of
Virginia in Charlottesville,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.980 align:middle line:10%
they have documented
thousands of these cases.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So you can say,
you can't make this

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.900 align:middle line:90%
happen in a laboratory setting.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.030 align:middle line:84%
But what you can do is
create enough evidence

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
that it becomes
something meaningful from

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:90%
a scientific point of view.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we have
in terms of the evidence

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.210 align:middle line:90%
for reincarnation.

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.840 align:middle line:84%
>> There are two primary ways
people recall past lives.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:84%
One is spontaneously, like in
the case of so many children

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.650 align:middle line:84%
who suddenly remember
memories in great detail.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Number two is hypnotherapy,
where a patient

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.950 align:middle line:84%
is put under hypnosis and then
guided by a trained regression

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:84%
therapist into recalling
previous lifetimes.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> It surprises people how easy
it is to access the first scene

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.100 align:middle line:90%
in a past life.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And then it's the job of a
trained regression therapist

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:84%
to know how to open it
up, how to ask questions,

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:04.980 align:middle line:90%
how to deepen it.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:84%
But also, it moves
forward spontaneously.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't give the
information to the client.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.200 align:middle line:90%
They tell me the information.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:84%
>> If reincarnation is real,
then what is its purpose?

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.480 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Linda Backman, psychologist
and regression therapist,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.960 align:middle line:10%
has guided hundreds of
patients into their past lives

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:10%
and may have the answer.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.750 align:middle line:84%
>> The past lives explain
something in current life

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.620 align:middle line:84%
because the past lives have
a direct connection to life

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.580 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.400 align:middle line:84%
They explain something
we're working on

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
to change in life today,
which is what we call karma.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.330 align:middle line:84%
They also can explain
a relationship,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.110 align:middle line:90%
a phobia, a physical symptom.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.010 align:middle line:84%
The soul is required to evolve,
and we're required to learn.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So we gather karma and
we also gather dharma,

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.770 align:middle line:84%
and that's what we're working
on in our current life.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Karma is a free will
decision we made

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:07.950 align:middle line:84%
in a past life that perhaps
wasn't the best decision.

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:11.610 align:middle line:84%
It's not a permanent
black mark on your soul.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
It's something you can
balance in a subsequent life.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
You have a life plan,
life intentions.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you basically
come in with free will.

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Many humans experience
profound suffering during

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:28.590 align:middle line:90%
their lifetime.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.650 align:middle line:84%
So why would a soul
choose to come into body

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:90%
knowing it will be painful?

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.500 align:middle line:84%
>> It's perfectly plausible
to me that from the framework

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.400 align:middle line:84%
outside of this one, we would
choose to come into it knowing

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:84%
that we were going to be having
a certain kind of suffering

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.340 align:middle line:84%
because we know from that
framework that it's time

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.840 align:middle line:84%
limited, that
you'll be out of it.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.930 align:middle line:10%
But then once you get
into this framework, see,

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:10%
that knowledge is blocked
so that you're faced there

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:10%
with the raw suffering,
without the insight,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:10%
maybe, that you chose
it in the first place,

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.800 align:middle line:10%
but also that it will be over.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the most fascinating
parts of reincarnation is

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.690 align:middle line:84%
the idea of a soul group, or
a group of souls that choose

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:90%
to incarnate together.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:10%
>> I know this from client
after client after client,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.750 align:middle line:10%
where what they come upon at
times in at the soul level

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.890 align:middle line:10%
of a regression is a group of
souls with whom they incarnate

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:26.850 align:middle line:10%
repetitively.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:84%
So simply put, I like
to call it a soul pod.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.650 align:middle line:84%
A soul pod means most of us have
about 10 to 20 souls with whom

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.900 align:middle line:90%
we incarnate most often.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're the parent
and there's a child,

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:84%
you made an agreement
at the soul level

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:90%
to be parent and child.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.610 align:middle line:90%
You came together for a reason.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Throughout many
regression therapy sessions,

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.580 align:middle line:84%
patients not only recall
previous human lives,

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:57.540 align:middle line:84%
but the lives of intelligent,
off-planet alien species.

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm regressing a lot of
clients in the last 10 to 12

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:04.140 align:middle line:84%
years who discover their
interplanetary souls,

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.140 align:middle line:84%
meaning they don't
regularly come here.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:84%
They come here on occasion,
and they come to Earth,

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:84%
if I oversimplify the
explanation, because they're

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.730 align:middle line:84%
highly evolved and they
come from evolved, healthy

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:18.870 align:middle line:90%
locations.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:25.420 align:middle line:84%
They come to teach us how
to progress as humanity.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:90%
I have clients that begin--

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm intending to guide
a past life regression,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.900 align:middle line:84%
and the first scene is
literally in a spaceship.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.600 align:middle line:10%
And some listeners
might go, oh, well,

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.100 align:middle line:10%
the client was just
making that up.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.980 align:middle line:84%
The level of detail,
and the level of

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:90%
not only the detail of the ship.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:84%
We get literal
physical detail of what

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:49.350 align:middle line:84%
materials is it made from, and
what do the controls look like?

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:84%
The chain of command on
the ship as explained.

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
The interrelationships of the
chain of command on the ship

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.540 align:middle line:90%
is explained.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:84%
There's far too many details,
in my opinion, to be made up.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:04.650 align:middle line:10%
Matias de Stefano,
host of "Initiation",

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.520 align:middle line:10%
claims to remember his past
lives as different ETs.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Like other
interplanetary souls, he

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:84%
is here on a mission to teach
our intergalactic history

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:84%
and to help raise
consciousness as humanity

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:90%
progresses into a new age.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:24.660 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was 11, 12 years old,
I started to remember my lives.

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I
thought many times

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I was getting crazy
until I started

00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:84%
to find many others
that also remembered.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.150 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I
am doing in my life,

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.830 align:middle line:84%
it's aligned to my mission
to go all around the world.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And to connect all
this nodes of energy,

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:84%
and to share and teach
people about my memories

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:84%
is something I live
in balance with.

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:55.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Reincarnation is a concept
embedded in our history

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.280 align:middle line:84%
and culture with profound
implications regarding

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.230 align:middle line:84%
our purpose and evolution as
individuals and as a species.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:84%
While scientific evidence
is hard to quantify,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.560 align:middle line:84%
according to those who
remember their past lives,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:84%
our soul's evolution is akin
to an epic science fiction

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.910 align:middle line:84%
narrative where the soul
learns and grows over

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:84%
billions of years
through multiple species

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:84%
throughout this
universe and beyond.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I gather that there must
be ways that you can tap

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:84%
into these memories
of past lives.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.940 align:middle line:10%
However, I do respect
the Tibetan tradition

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.850 align:middle line:10%
that says you probably
better leave it alone.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.540 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is Plato
said a similar thing.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
If at every moment
in our waking life,

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.760 align:middle line:84%
we were flooded with all this
information from past lives,

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.330 align:middle line:84%
it would make it more
difficult to concentrate

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.230 align:middle line:90%
on this task at hand.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:90%
