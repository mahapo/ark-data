>> Astral travel gives us a way
to explore and experience this

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.379 align:middle line:90%
multi-dimensional reality.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.920 align:middle line:10%
Through learning this art,
we can strengthen our focus

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.900 align:middle line:10%
and become more aware.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:84%
We already have this
ability innate within us.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:84%
We just need to remember
it and become conscious

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.840 align:middle line:84%
of the process of
actually doing it.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Imagine having the ability
to travel vast distances beyond

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.070 align:middle line:84%
the earthly bounds of
your physical body.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Astral travelers and
out of body experiencers

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.590 align:middle line:90%
have claimed just this ability.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
If these claims are
true, how would one

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
achieve an out of
body experience?

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.797 align:middle line:90%
And what might the benefits be?

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.670 align:middle line:10%
In 1966, Dr. Charles
Theodore Tart

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.860 align:middle line:10%
conducted a study
on a woman while she

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:10%
left her body during sleep.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.870 align:middle line:84%
While out of body,
her objective was

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to read a number about
1.5 meters above her head

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.380 align:middle line:84%
that was illegible from
her physical position.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Not only was she able to
identify the correct number,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.830 align:middle line:84%
but her brainwave patterns
during the experiment

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.450 align:middle line:84%
were different than any
other state of consciousness.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.080 align:middle line:10%
Another experiment by Janet
Lee Mitchell and Karlis Osis

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.410 align:middle line:10%
studied clairvoyant
Ingo Swann and revealed

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.070 align:middle line:10%
that he correctly identified
eight out of eight target

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.380 align:middle line:10%
observations while out of body.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
The probability of this
occurring by chance

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:90%
was 1 in 40,000.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.390 align:middle line:84%
In the general population,
about 1 in 10 people

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:84%
have claimed to have an
out of body experience

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.710 align:middle line:90%
at one point in their lives.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
This experience of
leaving the body

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
is called an out
of body experience

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
or OBE, which is
sometimes described

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.710 align:middle line:84%
as a separation of one's astral
form from their physical body.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.540 align:middle line:84%
This experience is
commonly referred

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.355 align:middle line:90%
to as astral projection.

00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Once I'm out of my body,
there's no such thing as time

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:10%
or space.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.070 align:middle line:10%
So we can jump
through timelines.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.990 align:middle line:90%
We can jump through dimensions.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's many
different levels

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.460 align:middle line:90%
of experience in those realms.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But besides having an
experience where you can fly

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:84%
anywhere or any time you want,
what are some of the other

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:84%
benefits you can get
from this practice?

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:10%
According to a survey, 86% of
399 out of body participants

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.090 align:middle line:10%
had a greater
awareness of reality.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Your whole reality changes.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Your perception of
reality changes.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:90%
What's important to you changes.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.000 align:middle line:10%
And your emphasis and
through life changes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:10%
Your trajectory in life
changes, because you're

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:10%
no longer obsessed with
the acquisition of things.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Another claimed benefit by
astral travelers is a decreased

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.650 align:middle line:84%
fear of death due to the
realization of our immortality.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>> My fear of death
is completely gone.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
I know, because you know from
experience, we're immortal.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:90%
We're powerful.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.230 align:middle line:90%
We create our own realities.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Other claims from OBEs
include increased psychic

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.680 align:middle line:84%
abilities, the ability to
time travel and visit other

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, spontaneous
healing, meeting dead relatives

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.060 align:middle line:84%
and spirit guides, and
increased spirituality.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I have been to other
planets, other dimensions,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:84%
other timelines,
and parallel earths.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:84%
This is not only astral travel
but this is astral time travel.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm being placed in a
different timeline of Earth.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes when people
have out of body experiences,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.450 align:middle line:84%
for example, they meet relatives
that have already passed away.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:10%
If they were missing
them a lot, they realize

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:10%
or they can verify it by
themselves in the practice,

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:10%
my relative is there.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Beliefs are no longer
needed, because you know--

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:84%
you move from being a
believer to a knower.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's a huge shift.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.600 align:middle line:84%
>> People who astral project
also report accelerated

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.840 align:middle line:84%
personal development and
obtaining of personal answers,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.900 align:middle line:84%
such as who am I,
what is my purpose,

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.210 align:middle line:90%
and what is the meaning of life.

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.079 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to know absolutely
know where I'm going,

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.730 align:middle line:90%
what that reality is like.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.800 align:middle line:84%
I want to know
where I come from.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
my real trajectory is,

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:84%
what's my evolution, and where
am I headed, why am I here.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:90%
I want to know it all.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Robert Allen Monroe wrote
"Journeys Out of The Body"

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.180 align:middle line:10%
in 1971, popularizing the
term out of body experience.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.890 align:middle line:84%
In 1974, he founded the Monroe
Institute, an organization

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to conducting
seminars in the exploration

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.570 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.480 align:middle line:84%
The Monroe Institute
outlines several strategies

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.580 align:middle line:90%
for out of body consciousness.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:10%
One of the most important
things to remember

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:10%
is to remain calm
during sleep paralysis.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.370 align:middle line:10%
Sleep paralysis is a prelude.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.860 align:middle line:10%
If you know how to
stay calm and know

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:10%
how to do the right
procedure, you

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.350 align:middle line:10%
can easily initiate an
out of body experience.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Next time that it
happens, try to stay calm,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
try to stay relaxed, and
then just think about rolling

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.280 align:middle line:90%
outside your body.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.320 align:middle line:90%
>> You are mentally rolling.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the procedures people

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
use to initiate a
fully conscious out

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.310 align:middle line:90%
of body experience.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Astral travel is
deemed safe by experts,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
as long as you keep yourself
at a high vibration.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
It is suggested
that you don't want

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:84%
to try it when you are feeling
low vibration emotions,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:90%
such as fear and anger.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.400 align:middle line:84%
This can take you to
a lower astral plane

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.400 align:middle line:84%
that resonates with the lower
emotions of the beings that

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:90%
reside there.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:84%
However, if you do find
yourself in one of these places,

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:84%
stay calm and start having
positive thoughts and emotions

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:56.090 align:middle line:84%
to raise your vibration enough
to go into another dimension.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, one common fear that
people have with astral travel

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.430 align:middle line:10%
is related to the myth
of the silver cord.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:10%
There's a lot of
literature out there

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.190 align:middle line:10%
that says that when
we astral travel,

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.930 align:middle line:10%
there is the silver cord
that connects us to our body.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:10%
The fear is that if the
silver cord was ever severed,

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:10%
we could lose our way.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And if we're unable to get
our way back to our body,

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:90%
we might die.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:10%
But not to worry,
this is a myth.

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.510 align:middle line:10%
The fear has been
used to scare people

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.000 align:middle line:10%
from ever trying the art
of astral travel, which

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:10%
is a huge disservice.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:90%
We are multi-dimensional.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.520 align:middle line:90%
We are eternal beings.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:90%
We have never been born.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.080 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, we can never die.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Out of body experiences, as
mystical as they might seem,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:84%
have scientific evidence to
suggest that they might be very

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.300 align:middle line:90%
real.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.240 align:middle line:84%
There are many claimed
benefits of the practice,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:84%
but what seems to be universal
across all astral travel

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.260 align:middle line:84%
is learning more about your
personal human experience

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and the world that we
live in and beyond.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The old concepts
of body, mind,

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
spirit or primitive
and inaccurate.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:84%
We are a
multi-dimensional beings.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.980 align:middle line:84%
We exist on many
different dimensions.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you have an
out of body experience,

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.140 align:middle line:84%
you're shifting
your consciousness

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.130 align:middle line:84%
into an energy body that is
already an aspect of us of,

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:90%
of all of us.

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.030 align:middle line:84%
>> So travel is a tool to awaken
ourselves so fully that we

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:28.020 align:middle line:84%
develop deeper connection
to our multi-dimensionality.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.480 align:middle line:84%
We learn about ourselves
and our purpose.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And we can take what
we learn from it

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.710 align:middle line:84%
and then put it into
service in this world.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:90%
