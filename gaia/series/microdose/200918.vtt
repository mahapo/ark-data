that was border patrol used for
assistance on other planets.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.000 align:middle line:84%
However, there were a number of
training exercises and training

Later in my deployment, I found
out a lot more information

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.720 align:middle line:84%
about the history of the
space program, this one

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.010 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

>> Could there be proof of an
off-planet military presence?

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.150 align:middle line:10%
At a certain point,
you have to go public.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.410 align:middle line:90%
It's much safer.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.783 align:middle line:90%

sole issue on which I've been

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.060 align:middle line:10%
required to make a
decision is whether Mr.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.120 align:middle line:10%
McKinnon's extradition to the
United States would breach his

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.010 align:middle line:10%
human rights.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%

a Scottish system administrator

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.410 align:middle line:10%
McKinnon perpetrated one of the
biggest military computer hacks

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:10%
on the United States.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.720 align:middle line:84%
McKinnon was accused of
hacking into 97 United States

military and NASA computers
over a 13-month period.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.440 align:middle line:84%
His goal, evidence
that the US was

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.920 align:middle line:84%
hiding UFO activity and
proof that indeed there

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:90%
was a secret program.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Allegedly, he found
flight records

from traffic controllers off
planet, actual UFO technology,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
and he discovered lists
of off-planet personnel.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Could there really be an
off-planet military presence?

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The late '40s were the
same time period that the Mars

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Germans started planning
for and building their bases

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:90%
on the moon as well as Mars.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:10%
The late '40s marked
a very crucial moment

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:10%
in the development of the
Antarctic German civilization.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:84%
That was when they
started building out

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.360 align:middle line:90%
their bases away from Earth.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.630 align:middle line:84%
In 1945, Major
Staver was in charge

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:84%
of tracking down top Nazi
scientists in Operation

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Overcast.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Most of the names
on his list were

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.450 align:middle line:84%
engineers that worked at
the German Army research

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
center, Peenemunde,
developing V-2 rockets.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.350 align:middle line:10%
One of these famous scientists
was Wernher von Braun,

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.592 align:middle line:10%
Germany's premier
rocket scientist.

00:02:42.592 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:10%
>> If there's one thing we can
say for sure about the Nazis

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:10%
during the Second World War
was that their technology was

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.860 align:middle line:10%
highly advanced.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.520 align:middle line:10%
In many respects, far more
advanced than the Allies

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.970 align:middle line:10%
even though, that ultimately,
thank goodness, we won the war.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Their scientists, for example,
in the fields of rocketry,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.800 align:middle line:84%
and biological warfare,
chemical warfare,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.430 align:middle line:84%
they were years ahead
of everybody else.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:10%
>> The issue regarding the
Nazis and their flying saucer

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.260 align:middle line:10%
research is that there
is a basis in fact, here.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:10%
You know, we all
know now that there

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.870 align:middle line:10%
were certain German scientists
during World War II,

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:10%
I think most prominently Viktor
Schauberger, who were doing,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:10%
let's say, even genius-level
work on disk-shaped air frames.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.730 align:middle line:10%
Schauberger was a
self-taught genius

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:10%
who was then
commandeered by the SS

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:10%
to work for them during the war.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:90%
He did create disk-shaped craft.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.350 align:middle line:90%
They were tested.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:10%
Or of course, since that's a
real hidden part of history,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.670 align:middle line:10%
I don't think anybody
knows for sure

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.410 align:middle line:10%
what happened to
the German saucers.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.940 align:middle line:10%
What we know for
absolute positive

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.240 align:middle line:10%
is that they had the plans.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.450 align:middle line:10%
The drawings were on
the drawing board, OK?

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:10%
The only argument is, did
they actually ever fly any?

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.340 align:middle line:10%
>> The late William Tompkins,
a Navy aerospace engineer who

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:10%
claimed to have designed
spacecraft for the secret space

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:10%
programs believed there was
an even more incredible story

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:10%
behind these vehicles.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.460 align:middle line:10%
>> It's '42, 1942.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.860 align:middle line:10%
The war is on.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:10%
Rico Botta, his hobby is
sending these Navy operatives

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:10%
into Germany.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.820 align:middle line:84%
They've been going
all over Germany,

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:84%
and they're staggered
at what they found.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.690 align:middle line:84%
They found that
Hitler and the SS

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
made an agreement with
reptilian extraterrestrials.

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.690 align:middle line:10%
They found hundreds of different
types of advanced weapons being

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:10%
built. These included
500-foot UFOS, round vehicles.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.270 align:middle line:10%
>> On September 3rd, 1946,
President Truman approved over

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:10%
1,000 German scientists
temporary limited military

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:10%
custody under a secret directive
called Operation Paperclip.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:84%
>> When we look at the entire
time frame of '44, '45, through

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.130 align:middle line:84%
the late '40s, early '50s,
the British, the Americans,

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and the Russians essentially
grabbed as much material

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:84%
as they could, and
also the scientists.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.560 align:middle line:84%
For example, the US had
Operation Paperclip,

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:84%
which was designed to bring
as many Nazi scientists

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
over to the US to continue
the rocket base programs out

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:84%
at the White Sands
Missile Range.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.010 align:middle line:84%
Many of the German
scientists were sent there,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
where they worked
on, essentially,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.300 align:middle line:90%
the German V-2 rocket.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:90%
It was just a continuation.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.540 align:middle line:10%
And of course, you
know, one of those

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:10%
was Wernher von Braun, who
became one of the leading

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.590 align:middle line:10%
figures in NASA later on.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, we've
got this paper trail,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.540 align:middle line:84%
and people trail as well,
going from Nazi Germany,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
through Paperclip, right through
NASA through the '60s and '70s,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:90%
and all interconnected.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The V-2 rocket designed
by Wernher von Braun was

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.200 align:middle line:84%
the world's first long-range
guided ballistic missile

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.780 align:middle line:84%
powered by a liquid-propellant
rocket engine.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:10%
This rocket laid the foundation
for the space launchers.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.150 align:middle line:84%
But that is not all
he was designing.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.030 align:middle line:84%
He was also working out
preliminary concepts

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:90%
for a human mission to Mars.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.190 align:middle line:10%
>> The documentation shows that
the Defense Department was very

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.880 align:middle line:10%
interested in what NASA was
doing with the Apollo missions,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.280 align:middle line:10%
going to the moon, trying
to figure out, well,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.602 align:middle line:10%
it's great for science, but
how can we use that for war?

00:06:25.602 --> 00:06:27.560 align:middle line:10%
How can we use this for
intelligence gathering?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:10%
How can we ultimately
utilize what NASA

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.940 align:middle line:10%
is doing for defense purposes?

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.390 align:middle line:10%
And this was decades
ago, in the 1960s,

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.870 align:middle line:10%
when we were just trying
to set foot on the moon.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:10%
The Department of
Defense were exploring

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.060 align:middle line:10%
plans of creating a moon base.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:10%
And there are government
documents declassified

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.280 align:middle line:10%
that show that they wanted
to build a base on the moon.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
There absolutely could
still be that connection

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.970 align:middle line:84%
between the Space
Program and Defense,

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
because the Defense really
gets kind of into everything.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:84%
They get their
fingers on everything.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.550 align:middle line:84%
And so it's pretty safe to say
that they're still doing things

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.960 align:middle line:90%
that we don't know about.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Could the Defense Agency
have had a secret agenda?

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.170 align:middle line:10%
And if so, could there
have been two programs,

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:10%
one for the public
and one classified?

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:10%
>> In fact, after '59,
the whole field went dark.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.000 align:middle line:10%
The aircraft industry was not
allowed to speak to the media

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.460 align:middle line:10%
any longer about the
research they were doing.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Huh.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And none of us
knew about this.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it was known back
in the '50s, early '50s,

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.610 align:middle line:84%
that there was electric
robotics research going on.

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.830 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't secret.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:41.270 align:middle line:84%
It was in magazines, like
"Product Engineering."

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.510 align:middle line:90%
>> "Popular Mechanics?"

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:43.940 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Stuff like that.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.453 align:middle line:84%
>> And then people forgot about
it because it wasn't discussed

00:07:47.453 --> 00:07:48.253 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:07:48.253 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>> There were six crude US moon
landings from 1969 to 1972,

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.080 align:middle line:90%
and then things went dark.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.190 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.000 align:middle line:84%
Some people suggest there
might be a trail to follow.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.890 align:middle line:10%
>> If you look at the
percentage of the--

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:06.110 align:middle line:10%
of both the GNP and
the federal budget that

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.850 align:middle line:10%
was going into space at the end
of the Kennedy Administration

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:10%
and the end of the
Johnson Administration,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.662 align:middle line:10%
you know, it's gone down.

00:08:13.662 --> 00:08:15.203 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
because it's secret.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:90%
>> The secret went up.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I think the
trajectory continued,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.320 align:middle line:84%
but the gap between
what's public

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:84%
and that trajectory
has been part of this.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Numerous people have come
forward claiming that they were

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:31.190 align:middle line:84%
part of these secret space
programs beginning in 1954

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and taking place as we speak.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.240 align:middle line:84%
Could these be
some of the people

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.429 align:middle line:90%
that Gary McKinnon came across?

00:08:37.429 --> 00:08:40.010 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm a Captain United States
Marine Corps Special Section,

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.620 align:middle line:10%
which is the covert military
space program arm of the Marine

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.920 align:middle line:10%
Corps, which was formed in
about the 1954 time frame

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.920 align:middle line:10%
by President Dwight Eisenhower
as response to the lack

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:10%
of cooperation that he
was getting from the MJ12

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:51.890 align:middle line:10%
committee.

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1960s,
they were developing

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:59.810 align:middle line:84%
a augmented-soldier program
to build soldiers genetically

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.430 align:middle line:84%
from the ground up, which I was
in a program in the late 1960s

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.812 align:middle line:90%
called Project Moon Shadows.

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:09.020 align:middle line:10%
>> He said, we're going to
borrow your consciousness,

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:10%
and you're going to
be gone for 20 years.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:12.970 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that.

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
I have my mom, and
dad, and my family.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.130 align:middle line:90%
I have a family.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.550 align:middle line:90%
I can't be gone.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:90%
And he explained-- he said, no.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.272 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go
right back the next day.

00:09:19.272 --> 00:09:20.870 align:middle line:84%
It'll be like you
never left, but you

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:90%
get to live this extra time.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.920 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a huge,
like, blessing to you.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:28.850 align:middle line:84%
>> But if this is true, why keep
this program with its personnel

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.120 align:middle line:84%
and technological
advances a secret?

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:10%
>> I believe that the energy
aspect of it is probably

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.520 align:middle line:10%
the single most important
core of the UFO cover up.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I think a 10-year-old child
looking at a flying saucer that

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:84%
can instantly
accelerate is going

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:84%
to understand somehow that
they're not using gasoline

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:45.590 align:middle line:90%
to go around.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's using something better
than that, whatever that is.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's zero point or some
kind of safe, nuclear fusion,

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.030 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it is.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not petroleum.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.800 align:middle line:84%
And therein lies--
that's the revolution.

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Because implicit in
this solution of UFO

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.050 align:middle line:84%
technology is a
post-petroleum civilization,

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and that is the
most radical thing

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.990 align:middle line:84%
that I can imagine right now
for our global power structure.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it possible we have
advanced technology that is not

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.720 align:middle line:84%
available to our
current society?

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Evidence seems to point to a
private and a public program

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.950 align:middle line:84%
focused on exploring space that
could have happened sometime

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.090 align:middle line:90%
in our history.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:84%
One thing is for sure, a
trail of technology, money,

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and personal stories never seem
to stay secret with regards

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:90%
to the secret space program.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.290 align:middle line:90%
