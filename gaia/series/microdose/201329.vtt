modern societies have taken

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.760 align:middle line:10%
a psychedelic sacrament that
was used in a beverage called

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:10%
the kykeon.

Psychedelics, from the Greek
"psyche," meaning mind,

and "delos," meaning
make visible or reveal,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.900 align:middle line:10%
are substances that produce

and cognitive processes.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:84%
In the United States,
most psychedelics

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:84%
fall into the Schedule
I drug category,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.500 align:middle line:84%
including dimethyltryptamine,
peyote, psilocybin, and others.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:10%
According to the United
States Controlled Substances

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.570 align:middle line:10%
Act, Schedule I
means the substance

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.900 align:middle line:10%
has a high potential for
abuse and has no accepted

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.070 align:middle line:10%
medical use.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.760 align:middle line:84%
However, research over the past
few decades on psychedelics

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.090 align:middle line:84%
has shown that substances
such as psilocybin mushrooms

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.630 align:middle line:84%
have very low toxicity
and abuse potential.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Sacred psychedelic

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.150 align:middle line:84%
such as peyote,
ayahuasca and San Pedro

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.420 align:middle line:84%
have been used in rituals

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.190 align:middle line:84%
if not thousands of years for
their mind-expanding qualities.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.760 align:middle line:10%
Some argue that early humans,
known as Homo erectus,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:10%
rapidly evolved
into Homo sapiens

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.710 align:middle line:10%
by eating psilocybin mushrooms.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:10%
Proponents of the idea believe
the psychedelic mushrooms

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.770 align:middle line:10%
are what was responsible
for the sudden doubling

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.130 align:middle line:10%
of the human brain
200,000 years ago.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:84%

species has had a very long

relationship with mushrooms.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.680 align:middle line:84%
They evolved in
the same ecologies.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Inevitably, people would
have discovered them

and had the experiences
that they make possible.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.580 align:middle line:10%
And I think they really
did play a role in what you

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.920 align:middle line:10%
might call cognitive evolution.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.460 align:middle line:84%
They taught our species
how to use language

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.900 align:middle line:84%
because they created a
world where symbols, images,

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:90%
and sounds were connected.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.840 align:middle line:84%

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.000 align:middle line:84%
as addiction, PTSD, and anxiety

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
With mainstream scientific
studies only now showing

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.100 align:middle line:84%
promising results,
the development

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.430 align:middle line:84%
of conventional treatments
could take years.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.910 align:middle line:84%
This has led some sufferers of

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.970 align:middle line:84%
to synthetic pharmaceuticals
to self-medicate

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:90%

and mentally, and
physically dead.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.810 align:middle line:10%
I turned to plant
medicines like CBD.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:10%
I had a hero dose of
psilocybin to really wake me up

from my anxiety, depression,
and suicidal thoughts.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:25.190 align:middle line:84%

to continue introducing

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.990 align:middle line:90%
the medicine into my body.

ayahuasca in a double-blind,

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.650 align:middle line:84%
randomized,
placebo-controlled trial.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.350 align:middle line:84%
The researchers observed
significant antidepressant

effects of ayahuasca
when compared to placebo.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.900 align:middle line:84%
The researchers
concluded that this study

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.510 align:middle line:84%
brings new evidence
supporting the safety

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
and therapeutic

years worth of
therapy in one night.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:10%
Because when you're in therapy
in the West, you're talking

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.440 align:middle line:10%
and you're engaging
the intellect.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.150 align:middle line:10%
But ayahuasca makes
permeable your unconscious.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.760 align:middle line:90%
It opens the heart more.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.050 align:middle line:90%
And it becomes very visible.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Anything you've been holding in
your energetic field, anything

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.708 align:middle line:84%
emotionally or you've
suppressed can come up.

00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And it comes up in a way that
you're not attached to it

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.230 align:middle line:90%
So you can entertain it.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.380 align:middle line:90%
And then we can let go of it.

end-of-life anxiety.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.000 align:middle line:90%
And then we have MDMA for PTSD.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And so what it's
looking like is the FDA

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.510 align:middle line:84%
has granted breakthrough
therapy status

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.310 align:middle line:90%

within illegal paradigms?

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.000 align:middle line:10%
>> Real genuine mystical

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.690 align:middle line:90%
They help promote peace.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:84%
They help promote different
ways of relating to each other.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:84%
They help people to
think for themselves.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Most institutions, they
want to take that power away

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.090 align:middle line:90%
from the individual.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Psychedelics, they're
dangerous in that sense,

not that the drugs are
particularly dangerous.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:84%
The drugs are remarkably
safe in the physiological,

toxicological sense.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.105 align:middle line:84%
They're dangerous because
they give you dangerous ideas.

00:07:14.105 --> 00:07:16.610 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.150 align:middle line:84%

>> The shamans have attained
a sufficient sophistication

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.300 align:middle line:10%
to explicitly understand that
the vessel about chemical

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:48.560 align:middle line:10%
transformation is the body.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.920 align:middle line:10%
And the plants lift the
imprisoning structures

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:10%
of the ego.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:02.060 align:middle line:10%
And the ego flows
out into the world.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:10%
>> Coming out of an
experience like that,

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:09.290 align:middle line:10%
whether or not it's
true, it feels true.

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And it creates an opportunity to
reassess your entire worldview,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.880 align:middle line:84%
your spiritual, religious,
and materialistic worldview.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
It brings everything
into question.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.150 align:middle line:90%
as they construe them.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.820 align:middle line:10%
Those supernatural beings
may communicate with them

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:38.620 align:middle line:10%
telepathically.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:10%
This is very common in
the shamanistic trance.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:90%
They may give them teachings.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And very often, they'll have
a therianthropic appearance.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.290 align:middle line:84%
They'll be part
animal and part human.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.870 align:middle line:84%
>> The metaphysical aspects
of the psychedelic effect

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:56.530 align:middle line:84%
on the human mind do
deserve further exploration.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Yet, the health
benefits of psychedelics

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.630 align:middle line:84%
remains the focus
of modern science.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.700 align:middle line:84%
It's possible we'll
see a day in the future

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.390 align:middle line:84%
where psychedelics are used
as commonplace medicines.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Until then, if one feels
called to explore them,

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:12.670 align:middle line:84%
how could psychedelics
be used in

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.910 align:middle line:84%
an educated, responsible,
and appropriate way?

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.340 align:middle line:10%
>> I think they will have
their therapeutic uses.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:10%
But I think the idea to just
have places where you can go

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:26.740 align:middle line:10%
and have the experience
in a safe environment

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:10%
and focus on the experience
with people there

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.480 align:middle line:10%
who can help you facilitate it.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.200 align:middle line:84%
They enable you to
have a rich experience.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.130 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm not just taking
information and going off

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:10%
and going to the jungle to
someone that I don't know

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:10%
on a whim.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:90%
I need to understand.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.598 align:middle line:84%
And people have to
understand this.

00:09:45.598 --> 00:09:48.195 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to go
to a school let's say,

00:09:48.195 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:84%
you want to check
out the school.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.530 align:middle line:84%
You want to read
some reviews on it.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.050 align:middle line:84%
You want to go meet some
people that have actually

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:53.933 align:middle line:90%
gone to the school.

00:09:53.933 --> 00:09:56.350 align:middle line:84%
The same with the teacher, the
same with the practitioner.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:90%
Do your research.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
>> This brave new world of
psychedelic usage has a bright

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
future, especially for those
suffering with afflictions

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:11.090 align:middle line:84%
of PTSD, depression,
addiction, and physical trauma.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Modern applications of
psychedelic substances

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.520 align:middle line:84%
can also offer metaphysical
and spiritual experiences

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
that very well may be life
changing for the individual.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.660 align:middle line:84%
In order to continue
our progress

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.770 align:middle line:84%
into a psychedelic future,
we must first open our minds

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and not immediately fear that
which we do not yet understand.
