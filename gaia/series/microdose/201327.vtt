>> When you start looking at the
schematics of the Great Pyramid

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.830 align:middle line:10%
and the unusual interior design,
it doesn't represent any kind

of structure or building where
people would spend any time

They had a lot of skill.

There's no way that it

Yet to achieve this
timeline, one block

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:10%

On top of this monumental
achievement in construction,

the form and position
of the pyramid structure

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:84%
is also an intriguing
marvel of the ancient world.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Contrary to popular
belief, the Great Pyramid

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.420 align:middle line:84%
is not simply a
four-sided structure.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Experts suggest a closer
look at its unique shape

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:84%
may provide some clues as to
the true power and relationship

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.120 align:middle line:90%
to Earth's motion.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Many people don't know
this, but, in fact it's a not

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.640 align:middle line:10%
a four-sided pyramid.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:84%
It has a slight
concavity on each side,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.335 align:middle line:84%
making it an
eight-sided pyramid.

00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:84%
Now the minute you
do this, it produces

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:90%
another bizarre geometry.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:90%
It reduces numbers.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.490 align:middle line:84%
Numbers keep
popping out, numbers

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:90%
that shouldn't be there.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.390 align:middle line:84%
Things like universal
constants that

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.850 align:middle line:84%
has been known
for over 100 years

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.310 align:middle line:84%
defy constants,
the golden ratio,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:84%
but we have now strange numbers
like the pyramid's number

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.860 align:middle line:90%
coming up in the design.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:10%
>> If you take upon yourself the
project of building a pyramid

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:10%
and aligning it to true
north, south, east, and west,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.660 align:middle line:10%
you wouldn't make
any error at all.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.460 align:middle line:10%
There is an error in
the Great Pyramid.

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.780 align:middle line:90%
It's tiny.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.670 align:middle line:84%
It's 3/60ths of a single
degree of true north.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:84%
This is almost eerie
precision because the scale

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:90%
of the monument is so huge.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.920 align:middle line:90%
This thing is 481 feet high.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:84%
It has a footprint of 13,
slightly more than 13, acres.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:90%
It weighs 6 million tons.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.730 align:middle line:84%
It consists of 2 and 1/2 million
individual blocks of stone.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.180 align:middle line:84%
You're taking that whole
gigantic mountain of stone,

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.610 align:middle line:84%
and you are aligning it within
just 3/60ths of a single degree

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.410 align:middle line:90%
of true north.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.080 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
magnetic north, which varies.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.815 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
astronomical north,

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:90%
the true north of this planet.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:10%
It's a very remarkable
thing, and that's

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:10%
the north of this planet.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.126 align:middle line:10%
Once again the Great
Pyramid is speaking.

00:04:51.126 --> 00:04:55.200 align:middle line:10%
>> "Chariots of the Gods" author
Erich Von Daniken suggests that

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.010 align:middle line:10%
this monumental task was only
made possible through the use

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:10%
of advanced technologies given
to the Egyptians by visitors

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.990 align:middle line:10%
from the stars.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.260 align:middle line:84%
>> The Great Pyramids is one
of the miracles of the world.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
That's why all the
questions come up.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Who did it?

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.970 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.570 align:middle line:90%
For what purpose exactly?

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I, again, suggest they
did it for the gods.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:10%
And the gods, of course, were
visitors from outer space.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.720 align:middle line:84%
They taught our ancestors in
astronomy, in mathematics.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.890 align:middle line:10%
The pyramid was constructed
by a technology which Enoch

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.050 align:middle line:10%
had from the extraterrestrials.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.510 align:middle line:10%
The planning, the
engineering planning,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.220 align:middle line:10%
came from the extraterrestrials.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Some of the tools came
from the extraterrestrials.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.456 align:middle line:84%
The dirty work was done
by us, by the humans.

00:05:42.456 --> 00:05:46.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Matias de Stefano, who
remembers his past lives with

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:10%
clarity, has an alternate
point of view on the creation

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.520 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramids and their
potential alien origin.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Pyramids are the ancient
technology not only from this

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.410 align:middle line:90%
planet.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:10%
In many planets, we used
to build these structures

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.720 align:middle line:10%
because it was a physical way
in which we could be connected

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:10%
to the nine dimensions.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:13.920 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids were organized
and built by music, by sound.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
These structures were built
all by vibration and frequency,

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:84%
and there were beings
from Sirius helping

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.160 align:middle line:90%
us to build these realities.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:84%
But there was no ships
to pull up the stones.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.580 align:middle line:84%
There were just
electromagnetical tools

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:84%
with these magnets so they could
use the water with magnetism

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.630 align:middle line:84%
to move the stones and
then to light it up

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
to the different levels by
always vibration of this tune

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:90%
forks.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids around the world
are like a big network

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:90%
of computers.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
All the pyramids in
the world are aligned,

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:84%
and what you will
find is that the Earth

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:04.320 align:middle line:84%
is reflecting the portals of
Pleiades, Orion, and Sirius.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramids are
aligning themselves

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.980 align:middle line:84%
so the energy of the sun always
can come inside the planet

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.876 align:middle line:84%
and keep rolling within to
activate the whole machine.

00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks to satellite imagery,
pyramidal structures continue

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.700 align:middle line:84%
to be found all over the
world underground, in jungles,

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
under ice, and
even under oceans.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:10%
Though the Egyptian desert sands
are a commonly conjured image

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:10%
when envisioning pyramids,
these resilient structures

in every climate on Earth.

00:07:40.365 --> 00:07:44.610 align:middle line:84%
>> They're finding them in
Antarctica, all over Serbia,

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.230 align:middle line:84%
but many, many, many different
countries now are coming up

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:48.280 align:middle line:90%
with pyramids.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:10%
>> I spend a lot of time in the
jungles of Honduras, Guatemala,

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.210 align:middle line:10%
El Salvador, Belize, and Mexico.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:57.870 align:middle line:84%
I've seen hundreds and
hundreds of pyramids,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.060 align:middle line:90%
250 pyramids in China.

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.000 align:middle line:84%
Then you ask yourself, hey,
if the pyramids are not

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.810 align:middle line:84%
only native to Mexico
but all over the planet

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
on all six continents,
what's their purpose?

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:10%
All pyramids in
China, 250 of them,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.670 align:middle line:10%
are oriented to
the cosmic north.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
The oldest, the biggest
Egyptian pyramids, north.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.390 align:middle line:84%
>> They do seem to have less
connection with each other.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.420 align:middle line:84%
If you look at where
they're positioned,

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.890 align:middle line:84%
it does seem like this ancient
culture were very knowledgeable

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:84%
of Earth energies and
working with Earth energies

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.730 align:middle line:90%
all around the planet.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:39.210 align:middle line:84%
I think the fundamental purpose
for harmonizing the planet,

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:42.059 align:middle line:84%
it allows you to relieve
stresses in the Earth

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
so that it would eliminate the
destruction of earthquakes.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:10%
>> In addition to harmonizing
the Earth's energy plates

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:52.110 align:middle line:10%
and grid, Christopher Dunn
offered an additional theory

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.510 align:middle line:10%
in his book "The
Giza Power Plant."

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.610 align:middle line:10%
>> When we look at
the Great Pyramid,

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:10%
especially using Chris Dunn's
Giza power plant hypothesis

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.990 align:middle line:10%
on how we see it built like a
Faraday cage, we see granite,

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.280 align:middle line:10%
sandstone, limestone.

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:10%
It's a technology.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.520 align:middle line:10%
It's a power plant.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.490 align:middle line:84%
We see these acting like
transmitters for energy.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.930 align:middle line:84%
I believe they
were experimenting

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.630 align:middle line:84%
with electromagnetic
energy and gravity

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
much how we're playing
around with harp now.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The frequencies are
generally harmonically coupled,

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.880 align:middle line:90%
the whole series of pyramids.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Because it is using
harmonics and it's

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
working with Earth energies,
the people in the area

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:84%
are going to be
affected by it, too,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.520 align:middle line:84%
because we resonate with
Earth frequencies, too.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.210 align:middle line:84%
>> If the Earth itself has
an energetic connection with

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:84%
pyramids, is it possible that
humans too are resonating with

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:90%
these structures?

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.100 align:middle line:84%
What effect might
that have on us?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:10%
Dr. Semir Osmanagich has studied
pyramid science for over 30

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.270 align:middle line:10%
years and is credited with
discovering the Bosnian

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:10%
pyramids where he claims to
have witnessed their healing

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.010 align:middle line:10%
properties firsthand.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.200 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Osmanagich
invited "Open Minds"

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.680 align:middle line:84%
host Regina Meredith to
experience this for herself

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.085 align:middle line:84%
deep within the
pyramid of the sun.

00:10:08.085 --> 00:10:11.200 align:middle line:84%
>> We've had so many people
telling us that they feel

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:90%
so good.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:84%
They-- if they had asthma, once
they got out, asthma basically

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.750 align:middle line:90%
they can breathe.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.670 align:middle line:84%
So let's see-- we measure the
concentration of negative ions.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:84%
In the first
underground chamber,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:90%
it is 43,000 negative--

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.130 align:middle line:84%
>> No wonder we felt
so good in there.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:35.812 align:middle line:84%
>> It's 200 times healthier
than what we have here.

00:10:35.812 --> 00:10:40.573 align:middle line:84%
>> I have for a long while
argued that the central concept

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:43.240 align:middle line:84%
of the pyramids of Egypt-- and I
think the case is true all over

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:90%
the world--

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:84%
was to do with
the transformation

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:90%
of human consciousness.

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Whatever else the
Great Pyramid is,

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.750 align:middle line:84%
it is for sure an
instrument that works

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:90%
upon the human consciousness.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Nothing in the distant
ancient world is ever one

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:57.940 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.860 align:middle line:84%
It's multi-purpose,
multi-dimensional,

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:90%
multifaceted.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.830 align:middle line:84%
Many, many things
went on because it's

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:90%
a very sophisticated technology.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And so, yes, power
plant, yes, generate

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
energy, yes, stabilize the
planet, connect the Earth grid.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We simply need to be ready
for the new discoveries.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.935 align:middle line:90%
Only then, there is hope for us.

00:11:17.935 --> 00:11:21.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It is clear that pyramids
were of profound significance

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.010 align:middle line:90%
to ancient civilizations.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Evidence suggests
these structures

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:31.000 align:middle line:84%
served a variety of purposes
from power stations to portals.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.670 align:middle line:84%
By unlocking the
secrets of the pyramid,

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:38.520 align:middle line:84%
we may open the door to a
universe of possibility.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:90%
