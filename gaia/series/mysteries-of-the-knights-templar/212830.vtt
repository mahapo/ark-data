00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:10%
been inspired by

>> Yes.

00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:01.150 align:middle line:84%
You know, the historical
record that the Templar Order

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.230 align:middle line:84%
has looked into has
found not only evidence

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
of flying craft being
mentioned in ancient texts

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:84%
all over the world,
but also references

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.140 align:middle line:84%
to star gates as found
at the temples of Egypt.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And the Order has been
cataloging these things

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.420 align:middle line:90%
for the last thousand years.

>> You know, when I first got
involved in this research going

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:10%
back 23 years now, the last
thing in the world I ever

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.580 align:middle line:10%
expected was for this Templar
research to go down the road

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.380 align:middle line:10%
of aliens.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.620 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, that's exactly
what's happened to me.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would like to share
something with you that I think

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:84%
is frankly incredible
and came out of the blue,

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:90%
but here it is.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're aware of this
Templar document, the Cremona

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Document we've been working
on for several years that

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:84%
was purchased by
somebody back in 1971 who

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.780 align:middle line:84%
has shared this research and
has been receiving documents

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.540 align:middle line:84%
from colleagues that
have been passing on

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:90%
over the last several years.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
In 2022, we received a document
that just came out of the blue.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:84%
And what I would like
to do is read a passage

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:90%
from this document.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, there is a
document that we learned

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
from this Cremona
material called

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.637 align:middle line:84%
"The Book of the
Wars of the Lord."

00:02:26.637 --> 00:02:27.720 align:middle line:90%
Have you ever heard of it?

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>> To my knowledge, this
has never been revealed

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.680 align:middle line:90%
to the public before.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It says that it was mentioned
in the Bible in the Book

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of Numbers, but no extant
copy is known to exist today.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, guess what?

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.800 align:middle line:90%
We have a part of it, at least.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you'll indulge me,
I'd like to read something.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to read
the entire passage,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.920 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
read what I consider

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.560 align:middle line:90%
to be the most relevant.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what we
have here is a standoff

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
between the sons of Dan and
another warring faction.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.890 align:middle line:84%
They're standing on the
edge of essentially a swamp,

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.890 align:middle line:84%
and they are told not
to go into the water,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.800 align:middle line:84%
but to goad your
enemy into the water.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.740 align:middle line:84%
So with that as a backdrop, "The
Goddess Wisdom has commanded us

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and we have obeyed, but we
set not foot into Edom."

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Then a cloud descended
from Heaven, and out

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
of the cloud, quote, "These
are the people of the Lord,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.260 align:middle line:90%
and I am their goddess.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.110 align:middle line:84%
You will depart this
place or be destroyed,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.350 align:middle line:84%
for I do battle this
day for the sons of Dan.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:84%
The leader of the Edomites
set forth in his chariots

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:90%
into the shallows of the water.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Then did a silver beast
descend from the cloud

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.340 align:middle line:84%
in the likeness of a great bird
and spat bolts of lightning

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.390 align:middle line:90%
from its wings into the water.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And the horses of
the chariots died

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.300 align:middle line:84%
and the men of the chariots
shook as with palsy,

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.820 align:middle line:90%
fell to the waters, and drowned.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:84%
Then a great flame emitted
from the mouth of the beast

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and the host of the
Edomites were consumed.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.360 align:middle line:10%
To the last blade of
grass, they were consumed

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.629 align:middle line:10%
and the Earth scorched black."

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:90%
One last thing.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:84%
In times to come, the
King of Edom shall

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:84%
remember this place
and this day and shall

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.105 align:middle line:84%
enter into a covenant--"
there's that word again--

00:04:28.105 --> 00:04:31.540 align:middle line:84%
"with Israel to build
a great fort here.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
So it was written in the "Book
of the Wars of the Lord."

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So even just those few passages,
there's a lot to unpack.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:84%
What do you take from
what I just read?

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, certainly, we
have the Goddess of Wisdom.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:84%
This, of course,
reminds us of Sophia.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:90%
At I'm also reminded of--

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Solomon was said to have
gotten in trouble because he

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
was worshiping not only
Yahweh, but also Asherah, which

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.390 align:middle line:90%
was a female consort of Yahweh.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Male and female,
just as it says here.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.220 align:middle line:84%
And so as it's being
suggested here.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But more important
than that, here we

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.830 align:middle line:84%
have literally a description
of the flying craft

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.690 align:middle line:90%
coming in and doing damage.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.940 align:middle line:90%
>> What else can it be, right?

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that it didn't
just come in indiscriminately

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:90%
and start wreaking havoc.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:84%
It was commanded, or it was
asked to do this work, right?

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.360 align:middle line:90%
And this is an alien spacecraft.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
really interesting

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:84%
here is that it talks about,
this is the place where

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.820 align:middle line:84%
a great fort would be
built, which I can only

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.490 align:middle line:84%
interpret it to be the
Temple of Solomon, right?

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and that
would make sense.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.910 align:middle line:90%
>> But it doesn't end there.

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:46.930 align:middle line:90%
There's more.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a little context
to these other documents,

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:50.740 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
This is not the "Book of
the Wars of the Lord."

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
These are other messages
that were deeply encrypted.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:90%
They took us weeks to decipher.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And these were the
hardest ones to decipher,

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.330 align:middle line:84%
and I think the reason
is the information

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.640 align:middle line:90%
is the most profound.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.010 align:middle line:90%
And this is dated 1898.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.010 align:middle line:90%
"I saw the lights again.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:90%
Could be an ill omen.

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.650 align:middle line:10%
The right one descended upon
my winter lodge and behold,

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.250 align:middle line:10%
there stood the
likeness of Amon."

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't say "a man."

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.080 align:middle line:90%
It says "Amon."

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:10%
>> Traditionally,
"A-mun" or "A-mon"

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:10%
just meant the hidden one.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:10%
And it was something
that was-- for example,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.660 align:middle line:10%
the Lord's Prayer originally
came from the "Papyrus of Ani"

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:10%
where it began, Amun, Amun,
who art in Heaven, hallowed

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.950 align:middle line:10%
be thy name."

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:90%
It represented the hidden one.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.680 align:middle line:90%
It was this hidden power.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So what happened
here happened in 1898.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.590 align:middle line:84%
"He was of common dress
and medium height;

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.850 align:middle line:84%
he had about the eyes
shown a light blue."

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:84%
What he's asked to do is
to go recover something,

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.920 align:middle line:90%
and I'll hold that till the end.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
But while he's taking this
journey to the place where

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.230 align:middle line:84%
this thing is hidden
he's supposed to recover,

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:12.110 align:middle line:84%
he interacts with people
and he asks them questions,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.700 align:middle line:84%
and they have to respond
with the proper response, OK?

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.420 align:middle line:84%
Kind of sounds like
Freemasonry, right?

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.610 align:middle line:84%
>> In one case he asked,
do you have a land cage?

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:84%
And he responds, "Just
a k candle saga Kay."

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:90%
Remember that name Kay.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:10%
Later, he asked
Kay, "Thus, will ye

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:10%
know him to give him
the goat skin scroll."

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:10%
He gives him the scroll, and
then later in the message

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.510 align:middle line:10%
it says, "So has passed the
scroll of the Wars of the Lord

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.600 align:middle line:10%
from the world of men."

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.400 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.670 align:middle line:90%
This is 1898.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:90%
Your interpretation.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.530 align:middle line:84%
>> If we go back to Francis
Bacon's "New Atlantis,"

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.450 align:middle line:84%
if we read in his book we have
this story about these people

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:90%
who crashed on an island.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.490 align:middle line:84%
They encountered a group known
as the Brotherhood of Solomon.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.270 align:middle line:84%
They were developing all these
technologies and medicines

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.450 align:middle line:90%
and everything else.

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And the people who
crashed on the island

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.370 align:middle line:84%
said, well, how did
you develop this?

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, we
saw this light in the sky,

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.910 align:middle line:84%
and we sailed our
boat out to it,

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and a force field kept us
from getting any closer.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And then it spit
this book out to us.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And we brought the book
back and we started

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.060 align:middle line:90%
trying to create the things.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Could it be the "Book
of the Wars of the Lord?"

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to be right in
line with the same idea.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:90%
That's fantastic.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.940 align:middle line:84%
We have a total of six messages
that we received this year.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:84%
It took us literally
two months to decode

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.620 align:middle line:90%
these encrypted messages.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:49.700 align:middle line:84%
But the name Kay is
mentioned multiple times.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, at the end of
one message it says here,

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.770 align:middle line:84%
"Uriel pledged to the
service of the angel Kay."

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's mentioned in
three different messages.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:06.215 align:middle line:84%
So this person has to be an
otherworldly being, right?

00:09:06.215 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:84%
My takeaways from this "Book
of the Wars of the Lord"

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
are first and foremost,
the dual-gendered nature

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:17.060 align:middle line:84%
of God, which is something I've
been arguing for years, right?

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Here we seem to have
it being confirmed.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.790 align:middle line:84%
That is something that
would be heretical certainly

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:90%
to the church, right?

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, we have what
can only be the mention

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:90%
of extraterrestrial beings.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.960 align:middle line:84%
That is an explosive
bit of information.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle line:84%
And lastly, apparently, the
world was not ready in 1898,

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.820 align:middle line:90%
so they took it back.

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.440 align:middle line:90%
It's coming out now, right?

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:90%
This has come to us now.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.720 align:middle line:84%
We're just sharing this for
the first time right now.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean the world is now
finally ready for these truths

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.360 align:middle line:90%
to be revealed?

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Really, why we're even
doing this is it's time to wake

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.030 align:middle line:84%
people up to this
deeper history,

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:05.980 align:middle line:84%
and also our deeper connection
with something beyond this

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:84%
world that we've been
experiencing for forever.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think you're
hitting the nail on the head.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And it goes beyond
that, because look.

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
In the last several
years, there's

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.430 align:middle line:84%
more and more discussion
about extraterrestrials.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And it seems that it's
inevitable that it's not just

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.150 align:middle line:90%
the United States, of course.

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.510 align:middle line:84%
There are other governments
around the world that know

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.640 align:middle line:90%
about these beings out there.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.680 align:middle line:84%
And actually, what
I've been told

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.890 align:middle line:84%
is there's been a
lot more interaction.

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.530 align:middle line:84%
A couple of years ago, I
was approached by somebody

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
with the Department
of Defense that

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.680 align:middle line:84%
asked if I would be willing
to help out with disclosure.

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And I said, after vetting
this person, sure.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:90%
Anything I can do to help.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things
I was told is not only

00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.520 align:middle line:84%
are ETs or extraterrestrials
real and out there,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.350 align:middle line:84%
but we've actually
been interacting

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:59.270 align:middle line:84%
with them for many
decades, if not centuries.

00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:03.290 align:middle line:84%
In fact, at one point he told
me that in the United States,

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.955 align:middle line:90%
2.5% of the population is them.

00:11:07.955 --> 00:11:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Some know who they are.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.460 align:middle line:90%
Others don't.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So what that tells
you is that they

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.110 align:middle line:84%
look like us, or at least
this particular species.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And we might have one or
more in this very room.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.950 align:middle line:84%
There's 400 million
people approximately

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.075 align:middle line:10%
That would be about
eight million people.

00:11:26.075 --> 00:11:28.910 align:middle line:84%
What's happening now
is the time is right.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.240 align:middle line:90%
The time is now.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's part of
the reason we're here together

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and bringing forth these truths
and this ultimate message.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:41.270 align:middle line:84%
And I guess, what is it we
want people to think when they

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.160 align:middle line:90%
get done with this program?

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, something that the
Templar tradition has always

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:51.860 align:middle line:84%
said, that divine spark
is within everybody.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And so anybody through
their own efforts

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:84%
can attune with that higher
consciousness, whatever you

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.220 align:middle line:90%
want to call it, that source.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:84%
But even beyond
that, that source,

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.505 align:middle line:84%
not only does it connect with
each one of us individually,

00:12:06.505 --> 00:12:10.100 align:middle line:84%
but it allows us to be
connected to each other,

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:84%
whether that be people
from this planet or beings

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.780 align:middle line:84%
from other planets,
that they would all

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:21.340 align:middle line:84%
be a part of this
network of consciousness.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:84%
The true mission of
the Templar order

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.980 align:middle line:84%
has always been to
prepare humanity

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:31.060 align:middle line:84%
to enter into this
galactic community.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:84%
We are at a point now where
we're growing up, so to speak,

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and where our technology is
outpacing our spirituality.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So we have to find this perfect
blend so that we can move

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:90%
forward responsibly into space.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.650 align:middle line:84%
If we look historically,
the Templar Order

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:53.400 align:middle line:84%
has always been involved in
trying to raise consciousness,

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:84%
and that equality
was being celebrated.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.770 align:middle line:84%
They belonged to Gnostic
traditions in which

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.485 align:middle line:90%
there were female priesthood.

00:13:01.485 --> 00:13:02.370 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:84%
There was this
celebration of Sophia

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.260 align:middle line:84%
and her many forms
of the goddess.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.290 align:middle line:84%
There was a
celebration of people

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.710 align:middle line:84%
of all different backgrounds,
from the lowliest peasant

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:18.330 align:middle line:84%
to the highest kings, all
different cultures specifically

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.330 align:middle line:84%
for this purpose of bringing
us together to enter

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:24.630 align:middle line:90%
into our greater destiny.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>> I have one more thing
I would like to read.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.470 align:middle line:90%
This is towards the end.

00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened here
is CLY, the person that wrote

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:37.350 align:middle line:90%
this, is being directed by Kay.

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.085 align:middle line:84%
"From there Kay told me to go
one day north and make camp."

00:13:41.085 --> 00:13:46.060 align:middle line:84%
What he's doing is
he is hiding relics.

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.420 align:middle line:84%
"The next morning, I see the
lake is deeper and bigger,

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:53.650 align:middle line:84%
so then it has been hidden
from the hands of men, the cup

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.220 align:middle line:90%
of our Lord Christ Jesus.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:00.310 align:middle line:84%
I returned to the shore
and sleep under the boat.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.500 align:middle line:84%
The next morning,
as the fog lifts,

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I see Alfredo aship
and paddle to him.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.630 align:middle line:84%
So now I know it is not
the relic, but the quest.

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:84%
It is not the finding
or the having,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.020 align:middle line:84%
but the journey that with a
pure heart and sound mind,

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:84%
the truth shall out, for a
thing holds no power of itself.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.065 align:middle line:90%
The power of God is within you.

00:14:26.065 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:10%
The relics were meant to unite
all men in love and peace."

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, before we were
talking about it

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.880 align:middle line:90%
in an allegorical sense.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.170 align:middle line:84%
But I think in this case, we're
talking about the actual cup.

00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:39.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, probably a ritual cup--

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:84%
>> --that was used
at the Last Supper.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
other relic would be

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:45.160 align:middle line:90%
the head of John the Baptist.

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.770 align:middle line:84%
>> "As Lionel the 1st was able,
took refuge with the Hebrews

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:52.420 align:middle line:90%
in the Valley of Cold."

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.365 align:middle line:84%
This would be the Temple of
the Goddess in the Catskills.

00:14:56.365 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:84%
"And from Safed for they revere
the Feminine Aspect of God.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:90%
So was I also born.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:10%
Finitus Est, It is Finished,"
and "Alav Ha-Shalom."

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:11.260 align:middle line:10%
Goodbye, my love.

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.685 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:15:12.685 --> 00:15:16.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Here we're getting to the
heart of getting in touch with

00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:90%
that inner source.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:22.150 align:middle line:84%
That's what keeps us
maintaining order.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what keeps us
connected with each other.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:27.610 align:middle line:84%
It's what keeps us connected
with the universe around us.

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:31.000 align:middle line:84%
It's what ensures things
don't fall out of balance.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.035 align:middle line:84%
If we learned anything
from the story of Atlantis,

00:15:35.035 --> 00:15:40.000 align:middle line:84%
is that here was this great
civilization that even

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.645 align:middle line:84%
with all their technology
and everything else,

00:15:43.645 --> 00:15:45.730 align:middle line:90%
it still collapsed.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's taken over
12,000 years for us

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:84%
to get back probably to the
point where we were at before.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:57.890 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to learn from the
past so that we can go forward

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:58.920 align:middle line:90%
into the future.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.140 align:middle line:84%
This is important
work that we're doing.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And we all need to do--
everybody watching this needs

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:09.230 align:middle line:84%
to take it upon themselves to
try to do whatever they can

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:12.490 align:middle line:84%
that's within their power to
help make the world a better

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:13.290 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:10%
And part of that
is by also trying

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:20.120 align:middle line:10%
to achieve that spiritual
enlightenment, that connection

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:10%
with deity that you
don't necessarily need

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.400 align:middle line:10%
a human conduit to achieve.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:90%
You have the power.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what it says
right here, right?

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It's inherently
already in you.

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And I'm reminded at
this instance of, again,

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.900 align:middle line:84%
with Sophia, is she represented
the freedom to not only make

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:84%
mistakes, but to learn
from those mistakes

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.250 align:middle line:84%
so that she could attain
the higher consciousness.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And in the earliest
depictions of her,

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:84%
she was depicted with a
seven-pointed crown holding

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.410 align:middle line:90%
a torch.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.450 align:middle line:90%
And what does this sound like?

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:57.340 align:middle line:90%
Statue of Liberty.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> It also sounds
like Persephone--

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Freedom-- that stands atop our
Capitol dome in Washington, DC.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:90%
>> It's exactly right.

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:08.710 align:middle line:90%
We have formed the new Atlantis.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:11.109 align:middle line:90%
Now it's our job to maintain it.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is what
we've been promised.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:90%
>> It's our destiny.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It's our destiny.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:22.510 align:middle line:84%
Then we have a greater
destiny beyond this world.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:84%
There's an entire
galactic community

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:27.760 align:middle line:84%
out there waiting
for us, but we have

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
to prove that we can get
along with each other

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.850 align:middle line:84%
down here first before we're
going to be allowed there.

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:36.460 align:middle line:84%
You talked about the
chalice of Jesus,

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:90%
the skull of John the Baptist.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.030 align:middle line:84%
While they hold religious
and sacred significance

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and Templars have always
sworn to protect the sacred,

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:84%
let's also not forget
about the arks.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:57.055 align:middle line:84%
These arks are a technology,
and they are meant to be used.

00:17:57.055 --> 00:17:59.750 align:middle line:84%
It's our understanding
if these arks were

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.240 align:middle line:84%
used as they had
been in the past,

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:84%
they were a technology
to provide power

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.740 align:middle line:90%
to the entire world.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So this was the
Atlanteans-age Internet or grid

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:13.880 align:middle line:90%
system, right?

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, to broadcast
electricity within regions.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:84%
If there was a
massive solar flare,

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:23.540 align:middle line:84%
for example, that could wipe
out our solar grid, something

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.540 align:middle line:84%
like the Carrington
Event, we would

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.410 align:middle line:90%
be in a really bad situation.

00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:90%
>> We'd be in a world of hurt.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.980 align:middle line:84%
But these arks could be
utilized in order to--

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:34.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Resurrect?

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:37.640 align:middle line:84%
>> --build things back up
again because they are natural

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.100 align:middle line:84%
capacitors that build up the
electricity from the Earth

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:41.900 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:84%
It's really technology that even
Tesla was trying to implement.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.420 align:middle line:84%
But we have to be coming from
the right place spiritually

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.350 align:middle line:84%
and internally to be
responsible with this technology

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
because even as
the Bible warns us,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:84%
if the ark wasn't
put in good hands,

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.840 align:middle line:84%
it could be incredibly
destructive.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:90%
This is still the case today.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.030 align:middle line:90%


00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:84%
It's our intention in
the very near future

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.960 align:middle line:84%
to actually take these
arks out of the vaults

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.780 align:middle line:84%
that they're in so that
they can be utilized.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.780 align:middle line:84%
But we need to
know that humanity

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.300 align:middle line:84%
is in the right frame of mind,
the right motivation for using

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.100 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:28.090 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the other things that
I was told by this contact with

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:31.060 align:middle line:84%
the DOD is we don't
have to get everybody.

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:34.570 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't require
100% participation

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:84%
because you're never
going to get that.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:84%
But what he told
me is if we could

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:43.090 align:middle line:84%
get 6% of the population--
only 6%, he said,

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:44.660 align:middle line:90%
that's enough to do it.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And if that's not doable,
I don't know what is.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.330 align:middle line:90%
I know we can do that.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I believe we can as well.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
we need to work for.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And I think ultimately,
this is our Eden.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:19:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we have been
entrusted the responsibility

00:19:59.890 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:90%
to attend this garden.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.630 align:middle line:90%
This is my dream.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.100 align:middle line:90%
This is my ambition.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:84%
This is what the Templar Order
has always strived towards.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Though sadly, if we can't get
there, everything falls apart.

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:18.515 align:middle line:84%
If we just can't
rise to the occasion,

00:20:18.515 --> 00:20:22.010 align:middle line:84%
the Templar Order continues
to pass on the keys

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:24.360 align:middle line:90%
for rebuilding civilization.

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't want to become
the next chapter in the fall

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.300 align:middle line:84%
of Atlantis, having to pass
on to another generation.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.220 align:middle line:84%
We want to fix it
this time, right?

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's right.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.360 align:middle line:84%
As we continue to
protect the sacred,

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.060 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the sacred
within each other,

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and to our other beings that
are out there that we will enter

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
into this galactic community,
and humanity will now

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.540 align:middle line:84%
take its place in the table of
this greater community that's

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.340 align:middle line:90%
out there.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And as Templars, it's
our responsibility,

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:03.870 align:middle line:84%
just as it always has been,
to lead people to that place.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.930 align:middle line:84%
>> This concludes this season
of "Mysteries of the Knights

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:07.730 align:middle line:90%
Templar."
