>> What was Atlantis?

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.470 align:middle line:84%
Was it a place, a culture,
and what happened to it?

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm Timothy Hogan, grandmaster
of the Knights Templar.

>> And I'm Scott Wolter,
a forensic geologist

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:10%
and a Knights Templar, and this
is Mysteries of the Knights

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So the question is, who were
the medieval Knights Templar,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.500 align:middle line:90%
and who are the Templars today.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly
than that, what

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.560 align:middle line:84%
is the connection between
the Templars and Atlantis,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.620 align:middle line:84%
and who better to ask that
question than the grandmaster

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.420 align:middle line:90%
himself.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Tim, who were the
Knights Templar?

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.770 align:middle line:10%
>> History has suggested that
it was an order founded in 1118,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:10%
specifically, to defend pilgrims
on their way to the Holy Land.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.550 align:middle line:84%
This was during the Crusades,
and pilgrims needed protection

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.570 align:middle line:90%
in order to go there.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But we know, in fact,
this was actually a cover.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:10%
The Templar order was
founded because there

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:10%
was a belief there was a
knowledge that there had been

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:10%
a prediluvian civilization.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:84%
The Bible referred to
it as the time of Noah

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and that it had collapsed
during a massive cataclysm.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:84%
Flood is how it's
described in the Bible.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, these
Templars, they needed

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
to track down the
pockets of survival

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge, the
technology, the philosophies

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
that had been preserved from
this prediluvian civilization.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm hearing you
say is that Atlantis was not

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.380 align:middle line:84%
necessarily a place that
sunk into the ocean.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:90%
It was a high culture.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it was more
like a worldwide network

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
of information that was being
preserved at different parts

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.480 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And when this
cataclysm occurred,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:90%
everything fell apart.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.050 align:middle line:84%
It fell into disarray, and we
went into a very dark period

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.190 align:middle line:90%
in humanity.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:84%
But the Templars understood
that if they were ever

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:84%
going to bring Europe
out of the Dark Ages,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
they needed to find the
remnants of this lost

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:84%
civilization, the
technology, the philosophy,

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and use it to spur people
into a new high culture.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:46.655 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, let me ask you this.

00:02:46.655 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Is this a fair way to couch
this that the Crusades

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and the Templars
involvement in Crusades

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.610 align:middle line:84%
of capturing the Holy Land
and establishing really

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.940 align:middle line:84%
which was a base of
operations so that they could

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
go throughout the
region to round up

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.800 align:middle line:84%
some of this ancient knowledge,
this ancient information,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.380 align:middle line:90%
is that pretty much the story?

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, while Crusaders
were busy trying to fight

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
for the Holy Land and
taking over territory,

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.890 align:middle line:84%
the Templars were more concerned
with digging for artifacts.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So what it sounds like to me
is the Templars had a mission

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.530 align:middle line:90%
even before the Crusades.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.630 align:middle line:90%
They knew this stuff was there.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.550 align:middle line:84%
How did they get
that information?

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.300 align:middle line:84%
Did it trickle down all the
way from the time of Atlantis.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it did.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to remember that
the Templars largely came out

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.650 align:middle line:84%
of Albigensian families
in Southern France, which

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.150 align:middle line:90%
were a Gnostic sect.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So they already
had ideas that were

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
contrary to the popular
establishments of the time.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean of the
Roman Catholic Church?

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Roman Catholic Church
and the monarchies.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
They were very
Democratic, and they

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.330 align:middle line:84%
were open to spiritual ideas
in which the individual was

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:90%
empowered.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.440 align:middle line:10%
This allowed them
to go out and try

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:10%
to seek out other communities
that had these views.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.110 align:middle line:84%
In particular, there
was a tradition

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
that caused the Templars
to travel to Constantinople

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.350 align:middle line:84%
to meet with a group
there that was known

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.269 align:middle line:90%
as the Brothers of the East.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:10%
This particular group
in Constantinople

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.230 align:middle line:10%
had originally come from Greece,
had been established in 1057,

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:10%
and they set themselves
up in an area that

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.370 align:middle line:10%
was known as the Church of
Saint Sergius and Bacchus, which

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:10%
was a building designed by an
alchemist in which Pythagorean

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.570 align:middle line:10%
and other ideas
were incorporated

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.400 align:middle line:10%
into it, Gnostic ideas.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Sacred geometry.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Sacred geometry, absolutely.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So Tim, there's a pervasive
rumor within the Templar

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.600 align:middle line:84%
tradition that I've
heard for years,

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.890 align:middle line:84%
and I would like to get
confirmation from you.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:10%
The equilateral,
equal armed cross

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.560 align:middle line:10%
that adorned the
Templars white tunics

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.100 align:middle line:10%
and that they're famous for,
that's a very old symbol.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Is it true that it goes back
to the time of the Atlanteans?

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in fact, it's a symbol
that is found all throughout

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.170 align:middle line:84%
the ancient world, in
particular, ancient Sumer.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.000 align:middle line:84%
It was something
that was utilized

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.500 align:middle line:84%
by what were known
as the Anunnaki

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.950 align:middle line:84%
or the gods of ancient
Sumer, but you also find it

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.690 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt and other places.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.350 align:middle line:84%
And it related, specifically,
in ancient Sumer

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.900 align:middle line:84%
to an alchemical science
that was known as gra.al.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.100 align:middle line:90%


00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:90%
>> That sounds familiar.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.150 align:middle line:10%
This came to be
partially associated

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.210 align:middle line:10%
with what was later to be known
as the Holy Grail right, which

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:10%
the Templars were
said to be guarded.

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.790 align:middle line:10%
So they adopted this symbol.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So a lot of people are
going to ask a question,

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:84%
how did these different
traditions recognize each

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.370 align:middle line:84%
other, how do they know who's
on their side and who's not.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think that breaks
down to signs of recognition

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.630 align:middle line:84%
just like we have in
our modern Templar order

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:01.840 align:middle line:90%
and within Freemasonry.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.430 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, there were certain signs.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
There were certain
handshakes that

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.770 align:middle line:84%
had been passed down
from early times

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:84%
that these different Gnostic
families and traditions had

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.240 align:middle line:90%
been holding on to.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.290 align:middle line:84%
So when Hugues de Payens
and Godfrey de Saint-Omer

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.770 align:middle line:84%
had inherited these things,
they went to Constantinople.

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:84%
They were able to exchange them
with the Brothers of the East.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:10%
In particular, there was a
Johannite tradition under a guy

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Theoclite
and another man

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.770 align:middle line:10%
by the name of
Michael Psellos, who

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.050 align:middle line:10%
was a very famous
French philosopher.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And they had been
at Constantinople.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And they had the
blueprints for what

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Hugues de Payens and
Godfrey de Saint-Omer

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.010 align:middle line:84%
needed to do to form
the Templar order

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and, specifically, to go to
Jerusalem for the next stage

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:90%
of their mission.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> There's documentation that
has come to me over the last 15

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:90%
years.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
Cremona document.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And one part of it is
a specific narrative

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:84%
that talks about Hughes de
Payens, the first grandmaster

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.900 align:middle line:84%
of the Knights Templar
and five other knights who

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.790 align:middle line:84%
entered under the south wall
and followed a tunnel system

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
and found an ancient
ritual chamber.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:84%
How old it is unknown,
but inside that chamber

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:90%
they found--

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
or I should probably
say recovered, not

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.390 align:middle line:84%
discovered artifacts that
they knew were there.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:37.440 align:middle line:84%
This included ancient
scrolls, ancient knowledge,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.600 align:middle line:84%
as you mentioned, technologies
in the form of instrumentation,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:84%
gold, wealth, and the remains
of a very important person

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:84%
in templarism going all the way
back to the first century, John

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.610 align:middle line:90%
the Baptist.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:10%
Is there a connection
between John the Baptist

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.850 align:middle line:10%
in the Johannite tradition?

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.860 align:middle line:84%
>> There is, in fact, the entire
Johannite tradition got its

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.290 align:middle line:84%
name specifically
from John the Baptist,

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:07.980 align:middle line:84%
who is deemed to be
the initiator of Jesus.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
Johannite tradition,

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:16.800 align:middle line:84%
he was meant to be the leader
of this spiritual tradition.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, he
was taken out early,

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.680 align:middle line:84%
but the Johns of the Bible were
all part of this tradition.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.550 align:middle line:10%
And it's believed that
there was a succession,

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.880 align:middle line:10%
a line of succession going all
the way up to the Theoclite

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:10%
in Constantinople, who then
in turned entrusted Hugh de

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.480 align:middle line:10%
Payens with this same mission.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so what you're saying is
there's a tradition that starts

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.380 align:middle line:84%
with John the Baptist
comes forward all the way

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.950 align:middle line:90%
to Theoclite, right.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:48.125 align:middle line:84%
>> How about going
the other way?

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Does this go all the
way back to Atlantis?

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we go back
to some of the Babylonian

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
traditions that talk
about the God Oannes, who

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:84%
came from the sea and
baptized priests kings

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.650 align:middle line:84%
and gave them the keys
to rebuild civilization.

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.620 align:middle line:84%
It was deemed that these
myths were probably

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:16.840 align:middle line:84%
alluding to the Atlanteans,
who had survived this cataclysm

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:84%
and had preserved pockets of
information and technology.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:26.490 align:middle line:10%
And it's worth pointing out
that the word Oannes, the name

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:10%
Oannes, whose feast day in
the ancient world was June 24,

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.340 align:middle line:10%
just happened to become
John the Baptist day.

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.510 align:middle line:90%
- That's exactly right.

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:90%
And John in Greek is Ioannis.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.400 align:middle line:90%
>> So coincidence?

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>> It was a tradition.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:10%
>> It was information
being passed down.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.050 align:middle line:10%
The Templars recovered this.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.300 align:middle line:84%
They began their
archaeological digging.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:54.030 align:middle line:84%
For the first nine years
that they were in Jerusalem,

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.730 align:middle line:84%
that's all they did was
dig under the Temple Mount.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And information that
they got from there

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.720 align:middle line:84%
led them to other locations
like Egypt, Lebanon,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and other places, ultimately,
to The New World of what

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.730 align:middle line:90%
was to become known as America.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.730 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, the evidence
that we see is

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:84%
in the form of Templar
graffiti carved all

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:90%
over the Middle East region.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.350 align:middle line:84%
They met with people
like the Sabeans

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.600 align:middle line:84%
in Northern Turkey,
who were preserving

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.690 align:middle line:84%
a whole tradition in
the area that we now

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.730 align:middle line:84%
refer to as Gobekli Tepe, which
had the seeds of civilization

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:84%
being preserved there, all the
way down into Egypt in places

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.150 align:middle line:84%
like Abydos, where
they were meeting

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:42.420 align:middle line:84%
with Coptic Christians, which
was a different tradition.

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:10%
And then within
Jerusalem itself as they

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.520 align:middle line:10%
were digging into the Temple
Mount and other places, one

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:10%
of the things that came across--

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.350 align:middle line:10%
and this is from
traditional Jewish sources--

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.990 align:middle line:10%
is they came across
certain jars.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And as they opened
up these jars much

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:84%
like we find with the Dead
Sea Scrolls or the Nag Hammadi

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:84%
library, they discovered
these new texts, which

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
what we now know is, were
the Zohar, the text known

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:84%
as the fundamental
aspects of the Zohar.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So this would have been the
Genesis of Jewish mysticism,

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.620 align:middle line:90%
the Zohar?

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.220 align:middle line:10%
Not only was it the Genesis
of Jewish mysticism,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.800 align:middle line:10%
but there was
information in the Zohar

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:10%
that pointed to land on the
other side of the ocean.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.770 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they talked about
other continents and the Earth

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:84%
being round and
where people lived.

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:10%
And this was fundamental
to the Templars

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:10%
in their discoveries of what
there was to follow thereafter,

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:41.200 align:middle line:10%
including going
to the New World.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:84%
Just recently some
images were shared

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.360 align:middle line:84%
with me and some drone
footage of a site that's

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.360 align:middle line:84%
2 and 1/2 miles away
from Gobekli Tepe.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And we've now coined the phrase
for this site Templar Tepe

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:84%
because there are a couple of
walls with Templar graffiti

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:05.230 align:middle line:84%
carvings that are undeniable,
unmistakable, which tells us

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.890 align:middle line:90%
the tradition was there.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.830 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
what were they doing.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Was it somehow connected
to Gobekli Tepe?

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
prevailing wisdom now

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:84%
is pretty much universal
that Gobekli Tepe was

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.710 align:middle line:84%
an ancient observatory
dating back

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.380 align:middle line:84%
to the time of the Atlanteans
because you mentioned

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:84%
this catastrophic event
that didn't completely

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.930 align:middle line:84%
destroy the culture,
significantly

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:84%
reduced it almost
down to nothing.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And what we see at Gobekli Tepe
is this incredible observatory

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.810 align:middle line:90%
was intentionally buried.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.240 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists are saying
it was intentionally

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:84%
buried at the very same time
of this catastrophic event that

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:48.290 align:middle line:84%
has now been labeled the
Younger Dryas impact event.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, and it just so happens
that this Younger Dryas impact

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.590 align:middle line:84%
event, as it's being called
now, falls exactly in line

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.310 align:middle line:84%
with the time frame of
when Plato specifically

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:90%
said Atlantis collapsed.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:06.040 align:middle line:10%
And not only that,
but we find remnants

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.270 align:middle line:10%
of that same story being
preserved at Edfu in Egypt

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.610 align:middle line:10%
talking about this
great cataclysm

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.820 align:middle line:10%
and how long ago it
was, and it falls in

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.490 align:middle line:10%
with that exact
same time period.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.700 align:middle line:84%
What we understand
now as Templars

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:26.080 align:middle line:84%
was that as that
civilization collapsed,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:84%
the technology had
to go into hiding.

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.020 align:middle line:84%
It had to be preserved
in different areas.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:38.620 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, places like
Lebanon and Egypt and Jerusalem

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.010 align:middle line:84%
became fertile places
to preserve this stuff

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.700 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that
was found by the Templars

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.980 align:middle line:84%
was a series of arks,
which are now associated

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.240 align:middle line:90%
with arks of the Covenant.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Wait a minute
a series of arks?

00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:57.460 align:middle line:84%
I thought the ark was
just the ark, the one ark.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.010 align:middle line:90%
>> No, there were multiple arks.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some traditions
say that there

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.970 align:middle line:90%
may be as many as 100.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.810 align:middle line:10%
The Templar order has found
evidence of at least 10,

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.920 align:middle line:10%
but they recovered
6, and they knew

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.860 align:middle line:10%
that these things couldn't fall
into the hands of the power

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.490 align:middle line:10%
structures of the day.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.530 align:middle line:90%
So they had to go into hiding.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So there was a great effort on
the part of the Templar order

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.660 align:middle line:84%
to take these arks and
try to understand them,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.860 align:middle line:84%
how they worked, and it turns
out these arks what they really

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.350 align:middle line:90%
were was giant capacitors.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.960 align:middle line:84%
They could generate
electricity, and they

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:38.500 align:middle line:84%
were filled with a
superconductive substance,

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:42.080 align:middle line:90%
which the Bible refers to as--

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:42.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Manna.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Manna, that's right.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And manna in Hebrew
just means "what is it?"

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And we know now it was
probably named this

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.680 align:middle line:84%
because when you
test this substance,

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.540 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't show up as anything.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Like, most tests are done with
spectroscopic analysis or--

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Infrared spectrometer,
X-ray diffraction.

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.100 align:middle line:84%
Back then they
would do a burn test

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.530 align:middle line:84%
to see what color the
flame was, but this

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:09.730 align:middle line:90%
didn't show up as anything.

00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:11.920 align:middle line:84%
But it had these
unusual properties.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.150 align:middle line:84%
And since they couldn't tell
what it was, what is it.

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, here's the
big question though.

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:21.970 align:middle line:84%
You said the manna was
the power source, right,

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.600 align:middle line:84%
and that these were
capacitors, batteries.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.040 align:middle line:90%
What did they run?

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Thing that we think is
it was probably broadcasted

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.550 align:middle line:84%
electricity throughout the
planet from the old Atlantean

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:90%
tradition.

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
They probably was a world grid
network, electricity being

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.240 align:middle line:90%
broadcasted around the world.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And when this
cataclysm happened,

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:90%
it just shut that all off.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.440 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
preserve the capacitors,

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.520 align:middle line:90%
and that's about it.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:50.200 align:middle line:90%
>> But the grid was shut down.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.050 align:middle line:90%
>> The grid was shut down.

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars
were wise enough

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.050 align:middle line:84%
to recognize, OK, this
happened in antiquity.

00:15:59.050 --> 00:16:00.890 align:middle line:90%
It could happen again.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:04.990 align:middle line:84%
They had the mission of
trying to rebuild civilization

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to where Atlantis was before
recognizing that civilization

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.040 align:middle line:84%
is fragile, and it
could fall apart.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.840 align:middle line:84%
So they had to preserve the
keys to rebuild civilization

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.350 align:middle line:90%
again and again.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:23.080 align:middle line:84%
When civilization
collapsed, there

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.740 align:middle line:84%
was an attempt to try to
preserve what they could.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Some of this not only
included these arks,

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
but they also
included instructions

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:84%
for government, Democratic
ideas, power of the individual,

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:39.460 align:middle line:84%
the connection of the
individual to God,

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.550 align:middle line:84%
and that the source
of who we really are

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:46.690 align:middle line:84%
is connected to the
creator and that everybody

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.660 align:middle line:84%
through their own efforts
could connect with that.

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:84%
This was the basis of what
empowered democracy originally.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So really what you're
talking about is something that

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.530 align:middle line:84%
we've all heard that
resonates with all humans,

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:03.260 align:middle line:84%
that we are all born
with inalienable rights--

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.280 align:middle line:84%
>> --as humans when we
come into this world,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.300 align:middle line:84%
that we all have a basic list
of things that we are entitled

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.970 align:middle line:90%
to just being here, right.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:12.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the Templars tried to
preserve that and establish

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:16.450 align:middle line:90%
that.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.430 align:middle line:84%
There were maps
of the old world.

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many of these maps
that the Templars were creating

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and that the Templars
also inherited

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.430 align:middle line:84%
were later to
become known as what

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Admiral Piri Reis of Turkey or
the Ottoman Empire at the time

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:34.190 align:middle line:90%
was cataloging.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And he even said, hey, he got
these maps from earlier maps.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, these were Templar maps
that had been being preserved.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that's
always fascinated me is

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:90%
the Piri Reis map.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And there are things on that
map that shouldn't be there.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, he had cataloged
things prior to Columbus,

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.650 align:middle line:84%
including Antarctica
without ice,

00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:02.330 align:middle line:84%
and also the entire
South American area.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And this seems to
suggest information

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.800 align:middle line:84%
that had been preserved from
a previous civilization.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:14.030 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're talking about
Antarctica being mapped without

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
ice, you're talking
a long time ago.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably what happened was
there was even a tradition from

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:24.380 align:middle line:84%
before Atlantis that was
preserving this information.

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.840 align:middle line:84%
These are part of
the cache of things

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:28.580 align:middle line:90%
that the Templars discovered.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me guess.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.515 align:middle line:84%
Piri Reis probably
a Templar, huh?

00:18:32.515 --> 00:18:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he, certainly,
came out of that tradition.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.700 align:middle line:84%
You got to remember he was
in Constantinople right

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.550 align:middle line:84%
where the Brothers of the East
were, right where the Templar

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.410 align:middle line:90%
order was secretly founded.

00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And this was the center
of commerce at the time.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.970 align:middle line:90%
It was the center of the world.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is where information
was being brought back to.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The other thing that's really
interesting about the Templars,

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.300 align:middle line:84%
something I've paid a lot of
attention to and studied myself

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:03.620 align:middle line:84%
are these round churches
that were used for--

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.130 align:middle line:84%
well I should call
them chapels, right.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Observatory chapels.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.160 align:middle line:84%
Laboratory astronomical
chapels that actually

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:84%
were observatories that
were mapping the heavens.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And what we now
know is that there's

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:23.240 align:middle line:84%
a system of churches on the
island of Bornholm in Denmark

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.070 align:middle line:84%
in Europe that they have now
figured out by using long range

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.430 align:middle line:84%
alignments in the heavens
to be able to calculate

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.350 align:middle line:90%
the circumference of the Earth.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
Now this may not
seem like a big deal.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.940 align:middle line:84%
But when you are
a Maritime culture

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and you're traveling
on the ocean,

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.200 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
things you need to know

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:84%
is how far is it
to my destination.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:49.250 align:middle line:10%
That'll allow you to plan
accordingly with food and water

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.240 align:middle line:10%
and people, and it's going to
give you a tremendous advantage

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:10%
over anyone else if you
know how big the Earth is

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:10%
and how far away things are.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.080 align:middle line:84%
>> They also began to encounter
a number of different cultures

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.890 align:middle line:84%
that most people in Europe at
the time had never encountered.

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And these included groups like
the Druze, the [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:15.360 align:middle line:84%
There were Islamic sects
that were mystical in nature.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:84%
Now we would refer
to them as Sufi.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:10%
There were Druid
traditions, and there

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:23.780 align:middle line:10%
were traditions within
Lebanon that were really

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.000 align:middle line:10%
inheritors of
Phoenician traditions

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.010 align:middle line:10%
and Canaanite traditions.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And in their associations
with these groups

00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:34.310 align:middle line:84%
and in their travels in
Egypt, there was one thing

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:37.670 align:middle line:84%
that they found amongst
them all that was secretly

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:40.820 align:middle line:84%
being passed down, and it
was this science that we now

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.190 align:middle line:90%
refer to as alchemy.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Alchemy.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and we know now,
especially you find this

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:51.870 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt at places like Abydos,
where the Templars set up

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:52.670 align:middle line:90%
headquarters.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.700 align:middle line:84%
They also set up
commanderies at Philae,

00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.750 align:middle line:84%
at Dendera, at Edfu and a number
of different places in Egypt.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:84%
But particularly, at
Abydos and even at Luxor

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:84%
itself and Karnak,
there are depictions

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:90%
of alchemical processes.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, there's
depictions of these arks,

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.190 align:middle line:84%
and there's depictions
of the manna.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.190 align:middle line:84%
That manna putting in
there was the catalyst

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:84%
for the ark to
work, and this manna

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:22.593 align:middle line:90%
had to be made alchemically.

00:21:22.593 --> 00:21:23.510 align:middle line:90%
When it was produced--

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you make manna?

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.290 align:middle line:90%
What does it come from?

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:28.022 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it comes from
just about everything,

00:21:28.022 --> 00:21:30.230 align:middle line:84%
but you have to be able to
calcinate it down and then

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:90%
extract it out of the ashes.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:39.210 align:middle line:84%
We're going to pour that
ashy lye into this to filter.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Make sure the pH
is nice and high.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to add an acid to it,
taking something from above 12,

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.455 align:middle line:90%
and we're dropping it down.

00:21:46.455 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
You can see there's
stuff starting to form.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do this eight
times just to clean it.

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.260 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes this
self-contained atom

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.090 align:middle line:84%
that it becomes
completely captured,

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:05.680 align:middle line:84%
and it doesn't
bind with anything.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.460 align:middle line:90%
And this was the moment.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.160 align:middle line:84%
You could also convert
certain platinum metals

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:15.070 align:middle line:84%
into manna, which we
believe this is really

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:84%
what Moses was
doing when he burned

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:84%
the Golden calf into a
white powder and to feed

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.090 align:middle line:90%
to the wandering Hebrews.

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:26.200 align:middle line:84%
>> But it was an allegorical
reference to the alchemical

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.890 align:middle line:84%
science that he was performing,
but it had to be veiled.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:30.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And we see this depiction
on the Egyptian temple walls

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:84%
as well of where the
pharaoh was being

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.920 align:middle line:84%
fed these cakes that looked
like they were cone shapes.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're usually depicted
right next to these ark boxes,

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and they're being fed to the
pharaoh as this special food

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that kept him
healthy and that they

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:55.960 align:middle line:84%
were being stored
in these arks, which

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.630 align:middle line:90%
generated the electricity.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.410 align:middle line:84%
>> But let's go
back for a second.

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to understand exactly how
does manna work inside the ark

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.460 align:middle line:90%
to create this power cell.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So what this manna is,
it's platinum metals

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.220 align:middle line:90%
that are in a monoatomic state.

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So what that means
is each atom doesn't

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:21.320 align:middle line:84%
bind with the other
atoms, and it does this

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.630 align:middle line:84%
because it's in a high
spin state, what's

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.580 align:middle line:84%
known as a high
spin state, the two

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:84%
outer electrons and the
atom enter into what's

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.730 align:middle line:90%
known as a Cooper pair.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And when they do that, they
go into this high spin state.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.050 align:middle line:84%
They're completely captured
by the nucleus of the atom,

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and they don't bind
with the other atoms,

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.160 align:middle line:90%
like, they normally would.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:44.360 align:middle line:84%
When this happens, they enter
into a superconductive state,

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.850 align:middle line:84%
and it just so
happens that when you

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:52.010 align:middle line:84%
have a container full of
manna, these monoatomic atoms

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.950 align:middle line:84%
if you subjected to a
very weak electrostatic

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:56.660 align:middle line:90%
or electromagnetic field--

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:90%
>> The spark if you will.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:84%
>> The spark, it ends up causing
the container filled with manna

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:06.650 align:middle line:84%
to weigh less than the same
container filled with nothing.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:09.552 align:middle line:84%
So there's an anti-gravity
effect that's--

00:24:09.552 --> 00:24:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> A levitation effect.

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Levitation effect.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is the reason
why the ark in the Bible

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.720 align:middle line:84%
is guarded by the Levites
from which we get the word

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:26.380 align:middle line:84%
levitation later on and that two
Levites could carry these arks

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:30.370 align:middle line:84%
with rods even though the
amount of gold and acacia wood

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.680 align:middle line:84%
that was put into
building these arks

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.320 align:middle line:84%
would have caused the ark
to weigh several tons.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.430 align:middle line:84%
But two people could carry
it as long as it had a charge

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.370 align:middle line:84%
and as long as these
monoatomic atoms,

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.650 align:middle line:90%
this manna was inside of it.

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.670 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so what you're saying is
they basically had the ability

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:84%
with manna when it was super
charged to cause things

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.830 align:middle line:90%
to levitate.

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:58.000 align:middle line:84%
Could this be the secret to
the massive megalithic blocks

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.250 align:middle line:84%
that we find all over the world
that have been cut and placed.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.820 align:middle line:84%
And seemingly it is
impossible that any humans

00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.800 align:middle line:84%
with the technology
that we thought

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.130 align:middle line:84%
they had in the
distant past actually

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:14.110 align:middle line:90%
could have been moved this way.

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, we think so.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:18.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's even possible
that they may have just taken

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:21.470 align:middle line:84%
one of these arks,
bound it to the stone,

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and then that helped to cause
the weightlessness of the stone

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.120 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:84%
So at that point, then
they could move the stones

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.040 align:middle line:90%
any way they needed to.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.620 align:middle line:84%
As the Templars started
discovering these things

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.550 align:middle line:84%
and figuring how it worked, they
realized this was a technology

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.350 align:middle line:90%
that it was godlike power.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So they knew if these
fell into the wrong hands,

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.390 align:middle line:90%
they could be abused.

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:84%
And so at this
point the Templars

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:84%
had a strong mission
to move these arks

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and these other artifacts out
of the areas of Jerusalem,

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.730 align:middle line:84%
of Egypt, and other
areas, move them

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:04.250 align:middle line:84%
through Lebanon into places like
Portugal, France, ultimately,

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.890 align:middle line:84%
Scotland and then
from there move it on

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.620 align:middle line:84%
over to the Americas,
which they had,

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:84%
of course, by this point
had already been mapping

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:13.460 align:middle line:90%
and knew about.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>> They knew all about it.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's just talk
about the elephant

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.920 align:middle line:84%
in the room to this whole
plan that the Templars had,

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.930 align:middle line:84%
and that's the Roman
Catholic Church, right.

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And it brings to mind
their strategy was

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.020 align:middle line:84%
something analogous to
keep your friends close.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:90%
Keep your enemies closer.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think really
that's exactly what

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:36.320 align:middle line:84%
was going on at least for
the Templar leadership.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.640 align:middle line:84%
And by aligning with the
church and giving them

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
the impression that
they were on their side

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.700 align:middle line:84%
was what allowed them to
have the freedom that they

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
did to round this stuff up with
the ultimate plan of bringing

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:90%
it to North America.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.260 align:middle line:90%
And I agree with you.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:54.470 align:middle line:84%
I think that's exactly
what was going on.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Templars would
throw the church a bone.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Every once in a
while, the Templars

00:26:58.910 --> 00:27:00.740 align:middle line:84%
were responsible for
starting to build

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.050 align:middle line:90%
the cathedrals for the church.

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:84%
But even on the cathedrals,
they tried to carve and preserve

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.980 align:middle line:84%
this information much
like the Egyptians had

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:12.120 align:middle line:90%
done in earlier times.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So even to this day, there's
Pythagorean concepts,

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Gnostic concepts,
alchemical information.

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:10%
You go to the front doors
of Notre Dame Cathedral,

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.800 align:middle line:10%
for example, there's a
series of plate medallions

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.587 align:middle line:10%
that show all the stages
of the alchemical process.

00:27:27.587 --> 00:27:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is part of
what the Templars were

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:30.650 align:middle line:90%
trying to preserve.

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:32.870 align:middle line:84%
They also brought
over iconography.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:37.370 align:middle line:84%
For example, the Templar
headquarters at Philae in Egypt

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:39.590 align:middle line:90%
was the Temple of Isis.

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And in this Temple of Isis
not only on the temple walls

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:49.550 align:middle line:84%
but also on the altars, there
were these black basalt statues

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:55.070 align:middle line:84%
of the goddess Isis nursing
the young child Horus.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:28:01.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is identical to images
of Mother Mary nursing Jesus.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.480 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly, right.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars brought
that iconography over.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:07.640 align:middle line:90%
They gave it a new facelift.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And to preserve
the memory of it,

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.550 align:middle line:84%
they carved what were to
become known as the Black

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Madonnas, which were this same
iconography but painted black,

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.480 align:middle line:84%
so they looked like
the statues in Egypt,

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and placed them in the
crypts under the cathedrals

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:90%
that they were building.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.375 align:middle line:84%
>> So Tim, here's
what I think we have.

00:28:27.375 --> 00:28:30.510 align:middle line:84%
We go back to the time of
the Younger Dryas period.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:32.220 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, we
had a high culture

00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:84%
that exists that preserved
ancient knowledge just

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.600 align:middle line:90%
in case something happened.

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
it was just in case.

00:28:39.630 --> 00:28:42.900 align:middle line:84%
I think they knew something
catastrophic was coming.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I think Gobekli Tepe
being covered up

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:84%
is a powerful piece of
evidence to support that.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And so they preserve
this information.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And the survivors of that
catastrophe lived on.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, the tradition,
the Templar tradition

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.710 align:middle line:84%
starting around the year
1000 or just after acquired

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:03.600 align:middle line:84%
this knowledge,
knew that they had

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:84%
to form a Templar order
that would go in and align

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:10.890 align:middle line:84%
with the Roman church,
go into Jerusalem,

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:12.840 align:middle line:84%
round up the stuff
that they needed,

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:84%
find that old hidden knowledge
and information, technology

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:21.510 align:middle line:84%
that was left by the
Atlanteans, take that knowledge,

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:27.310 align:middle line:84%
use it to acquire the strength,
the power to eventually bring

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.810 align:middle line:90%
it over to North America.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.370 align:middle line:90%
Is that a decent synopsis?

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:33.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Not only that, but they
wanted to re-establish

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:42.120 align:middle line:84%
the Atlantean tradition in order
to recreate what had once been.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.310 align:middle line:84%
It had been lost but
now had been found.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:48.160 align:middle line:90%


00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.940 align:middle line:84%
>> So really Francis Bacon
was the one who wrote the new

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Atlantis.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.890 align:middle line:10%
>> He was a Templar, and that
whole book that he wrote was,

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.860 align:middle line:10%
specifically, an outline to
rebuild these technologies that

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.750 align:middle line:10%
had been discovered
by the Templars.

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:05.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So Francis Bacon, he was
in on the secret, wasn't he?

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.160 align:middle line:90%
>> He was yeah.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what that means is
the United States of America is

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:12.250 align:middle line:90%
the new Atlantis.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm Scott Wolter.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm Timothy Hogan.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.360 align:middle line:84%
