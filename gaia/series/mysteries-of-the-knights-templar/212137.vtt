>>SCOTT WOLTER: What
evidence is there

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.120 align:middle line:84%
that supports the
Templars' interactions

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.060 align:middle line:84%
with ancient cultures
found around the world

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.590 align:middle line:84%
and their mission to
reestablish the new Atlantis?

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.575 align:middle line:90%
I'm Scott Wolter.

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY HOGAN: And
I'm Timothy Hogan.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.765 align:middle line:84%
And this is Mysteries
of the Knights Templar.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.650 align:middle line:10%
>>SCOTT: I think we've already
established that the Templar

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:10%
mission to establish
the new Atlantis

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.470 align:middle line:10%
was going to be
in North America.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.270 align:middle line:10%
>>TIMOTHY: Yeah.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:10%
So they had to map it.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:10%
They traveled the whole
site, and they left artifacts

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:10%
all throughout it.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Possibly one of
the most important artifacts

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:84%
in the world, in my opinion,
is the Kensington Runestone.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.550 align:middle line:84%
The world to this
day still thinks

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.760 align:middle line:84%
that it's a hoax that was
perpetrated by the farmer who

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:90%
found it back in 1898.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.440 align:middle line:84%
But we now know that
that's impossible.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:84%
And after taking a careful look
at it, from my perspective,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.160 align:middle line:84%
I followed the evidence
trail from Minnesota

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.520 align:middle line:84%
where the artifact was found
all the way back to Europe.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence trail took
me right to the Cistercians,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:84%
the White monks and
the Knights Templar who

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.110 align:middle line:90%
were also Cistercian.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.420 align:middle line:10%
>>TIMOTHY: Yes, the Templar
order really came out

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:10%
of the Cistercian order.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Saint Bernard of Clairvaux was
the main architect of both.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.710 align:middle line:84%
He was an incredible scholar and
leader within the Roman church

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.580 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.610 align:middle line:84%
He was secretly a
practicing druid.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
He was friends with
Rashi of Troyes

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.320 align:middle line:90%
who was a very famous kabbalist.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.860 align:middle line:10%
And he took all this
information, infused it

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.830 align:middle line:10%
into the Cistercian order, which
became the scholarly body that

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.150 align:middle line:10%
began to translate and catalog
all the things that then

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:10%
the Templar order was finding.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So the Templar order would go
out, find this information,

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.009 align:middle line:84%
bring it back for
the Cistercians

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.690 align:middle line:90%
to start to catalog.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Now remember when I
was talking about the Templars

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:84%
finding those ossuaries with
the scrolls, the technology,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.270 align:middle line:84%
the gold, and the remains
of John the Baptist?

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, later on in
the narrative, we

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.210 align:middle line:84%
know that those original
Templar Knights with Hugh Dupin

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.330 align:middle line:84%
took those scrolls
and the devices which

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
included a cryptex to decode
those encrypted documents.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%
And they gave them to Bernard.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And he was the one that
decoded them and learned

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.770 align:middle line:84%
about other sites
around the world that

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:84%
had been hidden
in those documents

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and carefully encrypted
to protect them.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.650 align:middle line:84%
But Bernard was a scholar,
he was a charismatic leader,

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:90%
and he was also--

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.170 align:middle line:84%
secretly venerated
the sacred feminine.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.940 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: Certainly,
Bernard, he was

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:90%
a defender of the Albigensians.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.620 align:middle line:84%
The Albigensian Cathars,
which were, again,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.980 align:middle line:84%
those Gnostic families that
most of the Templar Knights

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.880 align:middle line:90%
had come out of.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.550 align:middle line:84%
And the Albigensians
as Gnostics,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.500 align:middle line:90%
they venerated the feminine.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the goddess
Sophia, which

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.440 align:middle line:84%
just meant wisdom, from which
the word philosophy comes from

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.190 align:middle line:84%
or lover of wisdom, was
one of their main goals.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:84%
It represented the human
soul and its fall to matter.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And then its growth and
development and the freedom

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.330 align:middle line:90%
to learn.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately,
different goddess figures

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.260 align:middle line:90%
became aspects of this Sophia.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:84%
And even beyond that, the
Gnostic church at the time

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:90%
had women leaders.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
They had women priests, women
bishops, which they still

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.910 align:middle line:90%
do to this day.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
very equal system,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and it was something
that Bernard of Clairvaux

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.220 align:middle line:84%
was familiar with,
and he suddenly

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.905 align:middle line:84%
tried to put that into the
Roman Catholic doctrine.

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: I've read
a lot about Bernard.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.410 align:middle line:84%
I've studied him
pretty extensively.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
in my opinion,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.660 align:middle line:84%
he is one of the most
important historical figures

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.100 align:middle line:90%
in the history of the world.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knows who he is.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.770 align:middle line:84%
You say Templars, they
raise their hands.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.209 align:middle line:90%
Cistercians, who are they?

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.430 align:middle line:84%
But you have to remember when he
joined the order with 30 family

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
members, including two of
his uncles, one of them being

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.140 align:middle line:84%
the Grand Master, Hugh de
Payens, came from this region

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that you're talking about,
these Burgundian families.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And he joined the order when
there was one abbey at ChÃ¢teau.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.940 align:middle line:84%
And then he founded
two years later in 1115

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:84%
the first daughter
Abbey of the Cistercians

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.340 align:middle line:84%
at Clairvaux, hence
Bernard de Clairvaux.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
understand by the time

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
he died in 1153, the Cistercian
order had grown from one

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:90%
Abbey when he joined to 300.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And then by the
time the Templars

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.450 align:middle line:84%
were put down in 1307, a
little under 2 centuries later,

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:84%
there were over 750
Abbeys across Europe

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.650 align:middle line:84%
into the Holy Land, into
Scandinavia the British Isles.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about
that meteoric growth.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.100 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing success story
that nobody knows about.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.920 align:middle line:84%
And here's the other thing a
lot of people don't know about,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
is that Bernard de
Clairvaux was the one who

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.990 align:middle line:84%
wrote the charter for
the Knights Templar order

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.710 align:middle line:84%
that was based on the Cistercian
charter of prayer and work.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.580 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: Not only that,
but that original rule

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.870 align:middle line:84%
of the Templar order was
composed of 72 articles.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.510 align:middle line:10%
And each of these
articles, quote,

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.250 align:middle line:10%
"was said to correspond" to
one of the 72 cabalistic names

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.120 align:middle line:10%
of God that he had learned
from Rashi of Troyes who

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:10%
he was friends with.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And this brings us back
into this universality

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.850 align:middle line:84%
of what the Templar
order was trying to do,

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:84%
what Bernard of
Clairvaux recognized,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and this importance of
the sacred feminine.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.750 align:middle line:84%
So when the Templars
who recognize the divine

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.480 align:middle line:84%
spark within everybody,
that everybody

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.300 align:middle line:84%
was connected to
that divine source,

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.050 align:middle line:84%
and that there was a
feminine aspect to this.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:84%
As they traveled
into the new world

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and began to encounter
Indigenous tribes,

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.660 align:middle line:84%
the Indigenous tribes had their
own version of this same idea.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.315 align:middle line:84%
So they were able to
connect very easily.

00:06:26.315 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, they're
all matriarchal,

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:84%
the Indigenous cultures
of North America.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And I've had a little
bit of experience

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:84%
with the Algonquin
nation, specifically

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.880 align:middle line:84%
the Ojibwe tribe and some
of their spiritual teachings

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.530 align:middle line:84%
and some of their
rituals that they

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:84%
practice their own form
of Freemasonry that's

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:90%
called the Midewiwin.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And several years
ago, I was invited

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.830 align:middle line:84%
to participate in
a Midewiwin sweat.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And it took time for me to earn
the right from the medicine man

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:90%
to ask my questions.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And when my time
came and he said,

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.697 align:middle line:90%
Scott, ask your questions.

00:07:01.697 --> 00:07:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
would like to talk

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.620 align:middle line:84%
to you a little bit about
the medieval Knights Templar.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at me
and he said, Oh, you

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:90%
mean our blood brothers?

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:84%
But basically, what
it boiled down to

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.910 align:middle line:84%
is that when the Vikings
came over here starting

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.580 align:middle line:84%
in the ninth century,
the late 1800s up

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.060 align:middle line:84%
until the very beginning
of the 11th century,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
they didn't get along with
the natives very well.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.320 align:middle line:84%
They just sort of
did what they wanted.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like
what we're doing,

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:90%
then screw you essentially.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.120 align:middle line:84%
But when the Templars came
over shortly after that,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.680 align:middle line:90%
they were completely different.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And they respected
the Indigenous people

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.390 align:middle line:90%
because this was their home.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:41.980 align:middle line:90%
And they understood that.

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And they bonded through
ritual because the Freemasonry

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.500 align:middle line:84%
that the natives practiced
is the same as the Templars

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is how they were able to
achieve a deep spiritual bond,

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.590 align:middle line:90%
and through intermarriage.

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:84%
And this is what allowed the
Templars to operate and pretty

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.130 align:middle line:84%
much go wherever they
wanted for 400 years

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.660 align:middle line:84%
before Columbus
"discovered" America.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.660 align:middle line:90%
>>TIMOTHY: "Discovered."

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, the Templars protected
the sacred in all traditions.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:84%
And it made it
very easy for them

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:90%
to associate with other groups.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:84%
One of the other groups in
North America that the Templars

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:90%
encountered was the Mayans.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.370 align:middle line:10%
>>SCOTT: So I'm really
glad you brought that up,

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.070 align:middle line:10%
because in this Cremona
document material,

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:10%
not only do we have maps and
letters and encrypted messages,

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:10%
but we do have artifacts.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:84%
One of those artifacts
is a brass seal that's

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:90%
actually a navigation device.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
Inside of it, there
are some metal inserts.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle line:84%
One of those metal inserts is
a small nail about this big.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.977 align:middle line:84%
And what's inscribed on it
is the word Quetzalcoatl.

00:08:48.977 --> 00:08:49.810 align:middle line:90%
>>TIMOTHY: Oh, Yeah.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: You know
something about that?

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.810 align:middle line:10%
>>TIMOTHY: Yeah,
Quetzalcoatl was

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.500 align:middle line:10%
the deity, one of the main
deities of the Mayans.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he was the Osiris
figure, if you will.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.860 align:middle line:84%
He was the one who had
died and was raised.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:90%
He had set up civilization.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.880 align:middle line:84%
The Templars recognized
in this myth something

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.590 align:middle line:84%
that they were familiar
with themselves.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.140 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, but the
Mayans and other Nahuatl

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:21.230 align:middle line:84%
cultures, the Nahuatls included
the Aztecs, the Mayans,

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
the Olmec, others
in there, they all

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:27.800 align:middle line:84%
had a myth that they had come
from a previous civilization

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.860 align:middle line:84%
that had been
destroyed by cataclysm.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.060 align:middle line:90%
You've heard this before.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:32.690 align:middle line:90%
They escaped--

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:33.530 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Something
vaguely familiar.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: They escaped in
boats and came to this area.

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this civilization,
according to them

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:90%
was known as Atzlan.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's not too
much of a stretch

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:90%
to connect Atzlan with Atlantis.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.260 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And the Nahuatl word
for Itzel really

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.580 align:middle line:90%
meant like water wizards.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
connection there.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:84%
Between these
connections and then

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.490 align:middle line:84%
there were certain
hand grips that

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:84%
were being exchanged that the
Templars knew about, that they

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:90%
had exchanged with the druids.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.450 align:middle line:84%
These were recognized
by the Mayans

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:16.520 align:middle line:84%
who had similar grips,
similar initiation ceremonies.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.340 align:middle line:84%
So they recognized
each other as brothers.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So this is a
really important point,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:84%
because you're talking
about people previously

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.170 align:middle line:84%
that as far as even
they knew, there

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.980 align:middle line:84%
was no connection, at least
in memory or anything that

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.400 align:middle line:90%
had been written down.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.920 align:middle line:84%
But yet when they
get together, they

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.120 align:middle line:84%
have the same hand gestures,
same signs of recognition

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.527 align:middle line:84%
that must go back to
pre-Younger Dryas.

00:10:41.527 --> 00:10:42.860 align:middle line:90%
>>TIMOTHY: That's exactly right.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:44.783 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Atlantis again.

00:10:44.783 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: And you could
try to say, Oh, maybe

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:90%
a collective consciousness.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.200 align:middle line:84%
But there's too many
exact similarities.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Specific things.

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: Which suggests
that the same tradition

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.225 align:middle line:84%
was being passed down on
both sides of the Atlantic.

00:10:58.225 --> 00:10:59.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: No question.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: The Templars
had inherited this.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
They recognized right
away, hey, we're all

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.310 align:middle line:90%
passing on the same tradition.

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.750 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Hopis talked
about before the last shaking

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.970 align:middle line:84%
of the Earth that
the great spirit

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:84%
had given them a
hand grip that they

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.290 align:middle line:90%
could recognize each other by.

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And as they were
separated, they knew

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
that if they gave
this hand grip,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.480 align:middle line:84%
they would recognize
each other again.

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And so later on when
the Conquistadors

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.200 align:middle line:84%
came across the plains,
they met the Hopi.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.260 align:middle line:90%
The Hopi went to give the grip.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:90%
And they didn't have it.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.040 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: And they got nothing.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.082 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: And they knew
there would be problems.

00:11:34.082 --> 00:11:39.130 align:middle line:84%
But when they encountered groups
like the Templars, they had it.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: OK.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So based on all of this, let's
just stick with the Maya,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.900 align:middle line:84%
and let's just talk about
cultures around the world that

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:84%
build these amazing
temples that seemingly were

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.240 align:middle line:84%
impossible to be built
in the distant past,

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.640 align:middle line:90%
but yet here they are.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And what we're finding
archeologists saying

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:00.240 align:middle line:84%
more and more is that
they're pushing the origin

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.160 align:middle line:90%
dates back farther and farther.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.540 align:middle line:84%
Now in North America, we
have the Earth mounds.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:10%
And we actually have a pyramid,
an earthen pyramid in Cahokia

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.843 align:middle line:10%
that has a larger base footprint
than the Great Pyramid of Giza.

00:12:16.843 --> 00:12:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: Yeah,
Collinsville, Illinois.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:84%
Along with many
other different types

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.430 align:middle line:84%
of mounds at that
amazing city that

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.730 align:middle line:84%
was believed to have over
50,000 people living there

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:30.120 align:middle line:84%
around 1,400 AD,
which would have been

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.130 align:middle line:84%
about the same size
or even smaller

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.260 align:middle line:90%
than London at the same time.

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.570 align:middle line:84%
But the prediction
that I want to make

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:42.400 align:middle line:84%
is that there has been some
scientific work done at Monks

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.860 align:middle line:90%
Mound, it's called, in Cahokia.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.000 align:middle line:84%
That there's actually stone
work in the center of it.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.650 align:middle line:84%
They've been able to use
certain GPR to document that.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:57.790 align:middle line:84%
These structures are going
to be older and older.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:59.467 align:middle line:84%
And they're going
to go back, and I

00:12:59.467 --> 00:13:01.300 align:middle line:84%
believe they're going
to predate the Younger

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.088 align:middle line:84%
Dryas at about 13,000 years
ago, and maybe even older.

00:13:06.088 --> 00:13:07.630 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: It's
looking more and more

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:84%
like a lot of the dates that
archeologists have put for when

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.000 align:middle line:84%
these things were built was
actually the date in which they

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.563 align:middle line:90%
were restored.

00:13:18.563 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:84%
According to the cultures,
this is what they say they did.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.090 align:middle line:84%
We just haven't necessarily
listened to that.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:90%
But the Templars listened to it.

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:28.810 align:middle line:84%
They recognized, Oh, Yeah, we
know that to be true from back

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:30.770 align:middle line:90%
in Europe as well.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And then the Templars began
to set up their own artifacts

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:37.420 align:middle line:84%
around North
America to document,

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.788 align:middle line:84%
not only create
land claims, which

00:13:39.788 --> 00:13:41.705 align:middle line:84%
we think is what the
Kensington Runestone was.

00:13:41.705 --> 00:13:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: That's what it says,
acquisition business/taking up

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.920 align:middle line:84%
land from Vinland,
which is the Northeast

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.873 align:middle line:90%
coast far to the west.

00:13:50.873 --> 00:13:53.290 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: So tell me about
some of these other sites that

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.462 align:middle line:84%
are established
around North America?

00:13:55.462 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well,
first of all, you're

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:59.830 align:middle line:84%
talking about what I believe
are Templar artifacts,

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:04.090 align:middle line:84%
the Kensington Runestone
being one, dated 1362,

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.750 align:middle line:84%
which is 130 years before
Chris who never set foot

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.728 align:middle line:84%
on the land we now call the
United States of America that

00:14:10.728 --> 00:14:12.520 align:middle line:84%
already had millions
of people living here.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:84%
The whole premise of
his discovery of America

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.030 align:middle line:90%
is ridiculous.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.160 align:middle line:84%
But this is why
it was dismissed,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.170 align:middle line:84%
because this narrative
was so entrenched.

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But we also have things like
the Spirit Pond Runestones

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
which are three more
Templar artifacts that

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.380 align:middle line:90%
are dated 1401 and 1402.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.300 align:middle line:10%
We have the
Narragansett Runestone,

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:36.640 align:middle line:10%
we have the Newark Holy stones,
which actually are Hebrew.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.650 align:middle line:84%
We have the Bat
Creek stone, which

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.160 align:middle line:84%
was found in a Cherokee
Burial Mound that

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.060 align:middle line:84%
has possibly first
century Paleo-Hebrew

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.550 align:middle line:84%
that the Smithsonian Institute
didn't recognize right away.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And so they published
it, but it wasn't

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.490 align:middle line:84%
realized that it was
actually Paleo-Hebrew

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:90%
almost 100 years later.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what was
their immediate reaction?

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, no, no, that's a fake.

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's
something going on here.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.520 align:middle line:90%
But this is just the beginning.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.890 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, I'm known for
the Kensington Runestone,

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:10.728 align:middle line:90%
and I called it a land claim.

00:15:10.728 --> 00:15:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It was found on the
North South Continental

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Divide of North America.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:17.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
would put it at that time

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.600 align:middle line:84%
if you were placing
a land claim.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.470 align:middle line:84%
But perhaps the most interesting
and fascinating artifacts,

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:84%
at least in my
opinion, were found

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:29.770 align:middle line:84%
near Tucson, Arizona called
the Tucson-led artifacts.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And those things are
self-dated to the 8th, 9th,

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:90%
and 10th centuries.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.460 align:middle line:90%
And they are filled with Latin.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:90%
They have Hebrew.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.400 align:middle line:84%
They have all kinds
of interesting imagery

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.660 align:middle line:84%
that suggests that there was
an ancient Hebrew culture that

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:84%
came from Europe at that time
probably under persecution

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.770 align:middle line:84%
to a place where
they knew that they

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:84%
would be accepted
and treated well

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
just like the Templars
did as long as you

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:90%
gave the proper handshake.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So I think what this means, at
least the way I interpret this,

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:09.390 align:middle line:84%
is that the Americas were really
a sanctuary for the people that

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:84%
were living in other
parts of the world

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.820 align:middle line:84%
when they suffered persecution
for their ideological beliefs,

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.730 align:middle line:84%
they knew there was a
place where they could go,

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:21.390 align:middle line:84%
and they would be respected by
people that had like ideology

00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.320 align:middle line:90%
and welcome them.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.170 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: Well, and we
find this also suggested

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:29.870 align:middle line:84%
on the Overton Stone, where you
actually have a Templar cross--

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:30.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: In Nova Scotia.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: In Nova Scotia
next to native iconography.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.100 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's a feather, right?

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:41.070 align:middle line:10%
There's cross tobacco
leaves, and then there's

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:10%
a crescent moon.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:46.200 align:middle line:10%
So I'm sure an Indigenous
person could help us understand

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:10%
exactly what that message says.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Of course, right next to it
is a Knights of Christ style

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Portuguese temple cross.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:53.670 align:middle line:90%
>>TIMOTHY: Right.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:55.340 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, Tim, I
think it's important

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
that we make the
point that there's

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.310 align:middle line:84%
an ancient tradition
that goes back

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:06.839 align:middle line:84%
to the Atlanteans of
respect of other people,

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:84%
of those inalienable rights
that everybody is born with.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:12.329 align:middle line:90%
Signs of recognition.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So you know who
your friends are.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.099 align:middle line:84%
And more importantly,
who your enemies are.

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:20.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we
had in North America.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.800 align:middle line:84%
The Indigenous
people embraced that.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.260 align:middle line:84%
The more you learn
about Indigenous people,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.680 align:middle line:84%
the more you realize they've
had it figured out all along,

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.040 align:middle line:84%
how to live in balance,
how to live with nature.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.580 align:middle line:84%
And this has to go
back to the Atlanteans.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: And not only
that, but if you recall,

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:84%
the Templars were trying to
establish a new Atlantis.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And in Francis Bacon's book
later on, The New Atlantis,

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.990 align:middle line:84%
he talks about this land where
there's these people that live,

00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:84%
just as you're describing,
and they know the world,

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:55.760 align:middle line:84%
but the world doesn't
know about them.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
sanctuary for them

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:01.180 align:middle line:84%
to preserve the knowledge
and the tradition.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars, finding
that they themselves

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.830 align:middle line:84%
are being persecuted
throughout Europe,

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.480 align:middle line:84%
except for in a few small
places, including Portugal

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and Scotland, they found
refuge themselves in this area

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:18.340 align:middle line:84%
that they could then
work with the natives

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.170 align:middle line:90%
to build a new system.

00:18:20.170 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, they knew
all about North America.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.580 align:middle line:84%
They knew about the
Indigenous people.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And they had already
begun to set the table

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.440 align:middle line:90%
before the put down in 1307.

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So they had an escape
route already set to go.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And this to me, is part of
the brilliance of all this.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.890 align:middle line:84%
And it really just
goes all the way back

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:42.370 align:middle line:84%
like everything does to
this Atlantean culture

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.990 align:middle line:90%
that they had rediscovered.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And by the time of
the put down, they

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:84%
understood what that
tradition was all about.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:50.480 align:middle line:90%
It was their heritage.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And it was something that
they wanted to continue.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't going
to be in Europe,

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:57.160 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't going to be
in the Middle East,

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.620 align:middle line:84%
it was going to
be far to the West

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:03.720 align:middle line:84%
to that sanctuary,
that new Atlantis.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.730 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: Tell me
about the Newport Tower

00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
and its association
with how does it

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:84%
connect with these other
monuments and the Kensington

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Runestone and the Templars?

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:13.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Well--

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: I think,
I mean, I think

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.300 align:middle line:84%
if anybody could talk
about it, it's you.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, getting back
to the Cremona document,

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.260 align:middle line:84%
the Newport tower
is all through it.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.940 align:middle line:90%
It's documented on the maps.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:27.150 align:middle line:10%
It talks about when the
astronomical alignments

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:10%
were laid out prior
to its construction.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.090 align:middle line:10%
There's also discussion
in the Cremona document

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:35.970 align:middle line:10%
about an agreement with
the Indigenous people

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.240 align:middle line:10%
that they would be allowed
to build this structure here.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:90%
It was all about mutual respect.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.870 align:middle line:84%
You just didn't come over
here and do as you please.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:48.720 align:middle line:84%
You sat down with your brothers
and you made an agreement.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But this tower is
absolutely incredible.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:90%
It's two stories tall.

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:90%
It's about 26 fit in diameter.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:84%
It's around stone and
mortar structure that

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
sits on eight round
heavy pillars that

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:84%
have round Romanesque arches,
and the eight archways that

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:09.550 align:middle line:84%
have capstone ledges that were
designed for structural support

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:84%
for a first story wooden
ambulatory that went around it.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, the current narrative
is this thing is--

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:20.140 align:middle line:84%
I have a hard time saying this
because it's so ridiculous,

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.640 align:middle line:90%
a windmill, right?

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>>TIMOTHY: No.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: I mean,
even my son, Grant,

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:84%
who is a structural engineer
in his early 30s, I asked him.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
I said, could this stone
and mortar structure

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.230 align:middle line:90%
serve as a windmill?

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And he chuckled a little
bit and said, no, dad.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:37.180 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the lateral forces
would tear it apart.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:90%
There's no steel reinforcement.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.370 align:middle line:90%
Forget it.

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.050 align:middle line:84%
It couldn't have
been a Windmill,

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.380 align:middle line:84%
but yet that's what the
world is being told today.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:90%
This was built by the Templars.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was used as that
first stake in the ground.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And we know it started
in the latter part

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.370 align:middle line:90%
of the 14th century.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:84%
The Runestone is also
dated 1362, the latter part

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.260 align:middle line:90%
of the 14th century.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.330 align:middle line:84%
And they're
absolutely connected.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:84%
And I have to tell you
how they're connected,

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.840 align:middle line:90%
literally connected.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And that is there are two
keystones in that tower.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.280 align:middle line:84%
One is egg-shaped, which
is not a coincidence.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.600 align:middle line:84%
The other is a mark
master masons keystone,

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.830 align:middle line:90%
a notched keystone.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:22.150 align:middle line:84%
And they are back to back in
the West Northwest archway.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.170 align:middle line:10%
But they are not
centered in the archway.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:10%
No self-respecting medieval
stonemason would do that.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.780 align:middle line:90%
So what does logic tell you?

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.940 align:middle line:90%
They did it for a reason.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I first went there and
discovered this illumination

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:44.230 align:middle line:84%
event that happens on the
winter solstice-- at 9 o'clock

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, a light
box from the South window

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:84%
creates a light box that
goes down and frames out

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.830 align:middle line:90%
that egg at exactly 9 o'clock.

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Now this shadow
play or light play

00:21:56.710 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:84%
as it were, is something that
the Templars were known to do

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:84%
and ancient
traditions were known

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:84%
to do with standing stone sites
found all around the world

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:06.410 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.440 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: Even in the
cathedrals themselves.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.400 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Absolutely.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.200 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:90%
A place called Saint-Sulpice.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:90%
>>TIMOTHY: Oh, Yes.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Saint-Sulpice, I've seen
it at Chart cathedral.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Charts, Yep.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.290 align:middle line:10%
But probably the
most amazing thing,

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:22.360 align:middle line:10%
the next day I
went outside and I

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.000 align:middle line:10%
was looking up at that
keystone on the outside

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.650 align:middle line:10%
back to back with the egg.

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:29.270 align:middle line:84%
The only two keystones
in that tower.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And then I turned and
I looked to the west,

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.700 align:middle line:90%
and it hit me just like that.

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I went home,
I went on my computer.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you draw a line from
the center of the tower

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:84%
through the only two
keystones and extend that line

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.770 align:middle line:84%
into space, it goes to
Kensington, Minnesota.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Now you can't make
that up, right?

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:90%
>>TIMOTHY: Correct.

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Now here's the thing.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.280 align:middle line:90%
I published that in 2009.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.260 align:middle line:84%
And you know and
I both know there

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
are a lot of people
in this world that

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:84%
don't like this research,
they don't like Templars,

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.530 align:middle line:90%
they don't want any of it.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And don't you think if
those skeptics could

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:84%
have proven that alignment
wrong that I wouldn't

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:90%
have heard about it by now?

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:90%
You know what I've heard?

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>>TIMOTHY: Nothing.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Crickets.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%
That is amazing.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>>TIMOTHY: That's right.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk now about--

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:84%
we mentioned Christopher
Columbus earlier.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
really important about him

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
that I feel like
we need to put out.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Columbus, he
had his own ambitions.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.960 align:middle line:84%
He began to figure out
that there was probably

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.780 align:middle line:84%
something going on, on the
other side of the Atlantic.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.740 align:middle line:84%
There had been whispers that the
Templars had secured artifacts

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:44.300 align:middle line:84%
and had taken them
somewhere else.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.450 align:middle line:84%
So the church had
a vested interest

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:49.150 align:middle line:84%
in trying to find where
these treasures were.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.730 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know that
the Templars had already

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
made pacts with the tribes on
the other side of the Atlantic

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.490 align:middle line:84%
and were securing these
things away and putting them

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.890 align:middle line:84%
in secret vaults,
actually, at the time.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:06.310 align:middle line:84%
But what Columbus did
was he figured out

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:08.750 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars had
something to do with all this.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:12.100 align:middle line:84%
So he went to the Grand
master's daughter who

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:16.300 align:middle line:84%
was in a convent at the time, he
pulled her out of the convent,

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:84%
he married her to
secure certain maps

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:90%
that her father had given her.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.020 align:middle line:84%
Columbus got hold of
these maps, figured out

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:29.020 align:middle line:84%
that there was something
across the water,

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and he went to Portugal, the
King of Portugal and said,

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:36.700 align:middle line:84%
hey, fund to go
across the ocean.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.902 align:middle line:10%
King of Portugal was like,
we're not going to fund you.

00:24:39.902 --> 00:24:41.860 align:middle line:84%
We already know there's
something on the other.

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:44.152 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: You're not telling
us something we don't know.

00:24:44.152 --> 00:24:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: Yeah, Portugal
or Port of the Grail

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:51.100 align:middle line:84%
had been founded by the Templars
as a Templar state initially.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.890 align:middle line:84%
Templars were using
Portugal as a place

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
to travel back and forth to
the New World from there.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So they said no, we're
not going to help you,

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Christopher Columbus.

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And so Christopher
Columbus said fine,

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and he went to Portugal's
enemy, which was Spain.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Spain was a very
Catholic country.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.830 align:middle line:84%
They had already kicked
the Jews and the Muslims

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.620 align:middle line:84%
and other what they believed
were undesirables out

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.050 align:middle line:90%
of the country in 1492.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:24.980 align:middle line:84%
And he went to Queen
Isabella and said fund

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.810 align:middle line:90%
to go across the ocean.

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.430 align:middle line:90%
I will find your treasure.

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:30.020 align:middle line:90%
I'll find the artifacts.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:84%
You will be the hero
of the Roman church.

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:35.450 align:middle line:84%
It'll secure your faith
and secure your country.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.610 align:middle line:90%
So they funded him.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:41.690 align:middle line:84%
When Christopher Columbus
started to go across the ocean

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:46.280 align:middle line:84%
then, he knew that
there were going

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.400 align:middle line:84%
to be people there
who had already

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.230 align:middle line:90%
associated with the Templars.

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:84%
So he had to create a
ruse to be accepted.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.360 align:middle line:90%
So what did he do?

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.780 align:middle line:84%
He put giant Templar crosses
on his sails as an announcement

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.770 align:middle line:84%
that when he came across,
they would think--

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:05.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: I'm back.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:07.430 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: "I'm
one of you guys!"

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So they would think
he was a Templar.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And of course, then
he tricked them.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:14.540 align:middle line:84%
And then from there on,
it was unfortunately

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.150 align:middle line:84%
genocide for a lot
of Indigenous people

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:21.170 align:middle line:84%
as they were trying to find
these treasures that had been

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:90%
brought over by the Templars.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And thank God,
the Native people,

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.810 align:middle line:84%
the Indigenous people who
had established these pacts

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:35.090 align:middle line:84%
with the Templars worked
to preserve these artifacts

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:36.920 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars
had brought over,

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.490 align:middle line:84%
and that the Templars
still had association with.

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:84%
Once they discovered that there
was, in fact, this territory

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:46.490 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of the Atlantic,

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and that the Jerusalem treasures
probably were hidden there,

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:53.210 align:middle line:84%
that became the main
focus of the Roman church

00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:56.360 align:middle line:84%
to bring in Conquistadors
and Inquisition

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.700 align:middle line:90%
to try to secure them.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, Tim, I think
we've established and made

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.110 align:middle line:84%
it very clear that the Templars
had deep spiritual bonds

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:09.020 align:middle line:84%
and connections with
cultures worldwide.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And that their ultimate
mission was in North America

00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:15.500 align:middle line:90%
to establish the new Atlantis.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But it was also called
the New Jerusalem.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>>TIMOTHY: Yeah, the
Templars recognized

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:84%
the divine spark, the divine
flame within everybody.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:84%
It allowed them to associate
with these different cultures,

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.840 align:middle line:84%
get along with
them, work with them

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:90%
to establish these new ideas.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.290 align:middle line:90%
And you're right.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.270 align:middle line:84%
They decided they
needed to establish

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:39.440 align:middle line:84%
a new heavenly Jerusalem
or a new Atlantis

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:41.270 align:middle line:90%
in the area of North America.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.670 align:middle line:84%
They began this
task of doing it.

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.350 align:middle line:84%
They worked with
the other cultures

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:middle line:90%
to try to establish it.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And their success
in that is still yet

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.163 align:middle line:84%
to be determined because
we're still working at it.

00:27:53.163 --> 00:27:54.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Oh, that's
a whole other story.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:56.990 align:middle line:90%
But we'll get to that.

00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:58.410 align:middle line:90%
I'm Scott Wolter.

00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.910 align:middle line:84%

I'm Timothy Hogan.
