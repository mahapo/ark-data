00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.820 align:middle line:90%
>> What is alchemy?

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And how did the Templars
become proficient

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.910 align:middle line:90%
in the practice of it?

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.270 align:middle line:10%
I'm Timothy Hogan, Grandmaster
of the Knights Templar.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.420 align:middle line:10%
>> And I'm Scott Wolter,
a forensic geologist

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.920 align:middle line:10%
and a Knights Templar.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.145 align:middle line:10%

of the Knights Templar."

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:84%
One of the main technologies
that the Templars rediscovered

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and implemented was
the science of alchemy.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:90%
But what is alchemy?

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Alchemy was the
precursor to chemistry.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.410 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word chemistry
comes from alchemistry.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:10%
And the word alchemy
or alchemistry

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:10%
itself comes from
chem or chemit, which

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.650 align:middle line:10%
was the ancient name for Egypt.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.260 align:middle line:10%
It was believed to be
a science from Egypt

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:10%
that had to do with the
science of transmutation

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.750 align:middle line:10%
or taking something
of lesser value

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:10%
and transmuting it
into greater value,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.410 align:middle line:10%
whether that be taking lead
into gold, which is the most

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:10%
popular conception of it.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:90%
But also creating medicines.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Taking an herb and
turning it into a medicine

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:90%
that can heal the body.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it was also a
metaphor for the transformation

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.850 align:middle line:84%
So transforming
the consciousness

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
from a base state to one of
a more enlightened state,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:90%
shall we say?

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.640 align:middle line:84%
Again, one of the things that
the Templars rediscovered

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.920 align:middle line:84%
was this science of producing
monoatomic elements, yes which

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:90%
they referred to as manna.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:84%
They knew this was the
manna of the Bible.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.130 align:middle line:84%
But they also believed that
there are evidence of this

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:84%
all throughout the Torah
or the Old Testament

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
where, for example, Moses
took the Golden calf

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
and burned it into a powder to
feed to the wandering Hebrews.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:84%
Where the Templars
recognized this as, Oh,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:90%
probably this art of alchemy.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a modern scientist would
look at first and be like, oh,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:84%
this is just proof that the
Bible is-- there's nothing--

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.770 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just made-up stories.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.830 align:middle line:90%
>> It's made-up stories.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.470 align:middle line:84%
But the alchemists
understand, so actually,

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.150 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there is a
way you can convert

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.090 align:middle line:84%
metallic gold and other platinum
metals into this white powder.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And other societies have
been working with it,

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.800 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the manna
of the Bible which

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.410 align:middle line:90%
was this monoatomic elements.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:90%
It had a twofold process.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.850 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, it
was superconductive.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And so if it went into something
like a capacitor like the ark,

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.380 align:middle line:84%
it would cause the ark to
produce a tremendous amount

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.350 align:middle line:90%
of electricity.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:59.570 align:middle line:90%
So that was on the one hand.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.480 align:middle line:10%
On the other hand,
it also seemed

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:10%
to make the body
more conductive.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So when people ingested
it, it would heal the body.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this why we get statements
in the Bible talking about

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.590 align:middle line:84%
certain pharaohs and
people living to be 150,

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.010 align:middle line:90%
200 and longer years?

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:90%
Is manna the reason for this?

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.400 align:middle line:90%
And could it actually be true?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there could
be something to it.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, we know
the Egyptian pharaohs

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.400 align:middle line:90%
were producing this substance.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.780 align:middle line:84%
We find it in Egypt being
described on the temple walls.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
All the places that
the Templars set up

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.830 align:middle line:84%
bases of operation
in Egypt, including

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.760 align:middle line:84%
their commander at Philae,
at the Temple of Isis,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.310 align:middle line:84%
at the Temple of
Hathor, Dendera,

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:90%
places like Edfu, Esna, Abydos.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:84%
They all had
depicted on the walls

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.060 align:middle line:84%
this process of not only
extracting this manna, which

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.300 align:middle line:84%
they depicted as conical
cakes, because when

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:84%
it's formed, when it's produced,
when it's extracted out

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.310 align:middle line:84%
of things in a jar, that's
actually the shape it forms.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So not only was it depicted
on these temple walls,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
but it was usually
depicted next to arks

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.700 align:middle line:90%
that were also being depicted.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Now the Egyptians name for
it was they called it mfkzt.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they refer to
it as white cake or white gold

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.540 align:middle line:90%
cake.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.280 align:middle line:10%
And we find this in the
hieroglyphs as well.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>> When I think about
gold in the ancient world

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.830 align:middle line:84%
and the treasures that
included gold, I mean,

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.570 align:middle line:84%
we automatically think
that it has monetary value.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.510 align:middle line:84%
But now we have to
rethink that because it's

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.180 align:middle line:84%
a lot like having
a stack of wood

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:84%
that eventually you're
going to set fire to that's

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.350 align:middle line:90%
going to create warmth.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.000 align:middle line:10%
So you see this
wood pile as energy.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, isn't that
the same thing now?

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:84%
Shouldn't we be thinking
of metallic gold

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:84%
as really a wood pile of energy
that's going to power the ark

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.310 align:middle line:84%
and be ingested into bodies to
help prolong heal and extend

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.650 align:middle line:90%
life?

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.910 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a great analogy.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And we see this same idea
being incorporated and passed

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.310 align:middle line:90%
on by other ancient cultures.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in ancient Sumer, the
science of alchemy was known

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:90%
as gra.al, G-R-A.AL.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:10%
Probably the origin
of the word Grail.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, even in Wolfram
von Eschenbach's book, Parzival

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
that was published in the
1200s, it specifically

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.200 align:middle line:84%
says that the Knights Templar
are the Guardians of the Holy

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.810 align:middle line:90%
Grail.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.010 align:middle line:10%
And it describes the
Grail as a stone that

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.650 align:middle line:10%
burns the Phoenix to ashes after
which it comes back renewed

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:10%
and it restores
health and vitality

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:10%
to the Templars
who live off of it.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is an
alchemical metaphor.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's literally
talking alchemy.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it's describing
the processes of alchemy.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It's exactly right.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.040 align:middle line:84%
What we know is manna
amongst the Hebrews

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.200 align:middle line:84%
is found amongst the Sumerians
as being called shi mana.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.200 align:middle line:84%
And the shi mana was
also said to help

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:36.240 align:middle line:84%
power the flying crafts that
the Anunnaki, or the gods,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.440 align:middle line:90%
were flying around in.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And again, remember,
the equal armed cross

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.680 align:middle line:84%
that the Anunnaki used was
adopted by the Templars

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.480 align:middle line:90%
too for that.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And this goes all the way
back to being the national

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.700 align:middle line:84%
symbol, if you will,
of the Atlanteans.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.760 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:84%
And we find it not only in
this region of the Middle East,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.120 align:middle line:84%
but we find it as
far away as India.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.690 align:middle line:84%
In India, we find it
being called mani.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So instead of manna, it's
mani or sometimes Cintamani.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.910 align:middle line:84%
And in some of the
Vedic texts, it also

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:18.070 align:middle line:84%
talks about Vimanas, which was
these same flying craft, as we

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.860 align:middle line:90%
find in the shi manas of Sumer.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.395 align:middle line:84%
But this is the Vedic
tradition of it.

00:07:23.395 --> 00:07:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But the commonality
here is the word manna.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Now the Templars, they came
out of Albigensian families,

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.460 align:middle line:90%
the original Templars.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:10%
Those Albigensians, or Cathars,
they had a ceremony as well,

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:10%
which was a
communion rite, which

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.040 align:middle line:10%
involved using this manna
in the form of communion.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:84%
And they called it the
Manisola Ceremony, which

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:90%
of course, again mani, manna.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And then in the
Polynesian cultures,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
ancient Polynesian cultures,
we find the same idea being

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:90%
utilized in the name of manna.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same
substance being described

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
in all of these
ancient cultures, which

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:11.880 align:middle line:84%
suggests quite
strongly that there was

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.640 align:middle line:90%
a common root for this science.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is what brings
us back to Atlantis.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:19.740 align:middle line:84%
It's just another
piece of evidence

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.770 align:middle line:90%
that ties this thing together.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:25.260 align:middle line:90%
Tim, if I may.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I have a beautiful
green tablet here,

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and this is something
that is actually

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.100 align:middle line:84%
mentioned in our treasure list
that is in some other documents

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.059 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:08:39.059 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:84%
And it mentions
the Emerald tablet.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.330 align:middle line:84%
So I know that this has
a connection with Egypt.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.590 align:middle line:90%

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, according to
tradition, this tablet is known

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:53.690 align:middle line:90%
as the Emerald tablet of Hermes.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.250 align:middle line:84%
It's an instruction
panel for how

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
to produce something known
as the philosopher's stone.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
The philosopher's
stone was said to be

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:07.050 align:middle line:84%
able to transmute base metals
into gold, heal the body,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and awaken consciousness
more, which

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:84%
if you were able to
do all these things,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.300 align:middle line:84%
you would truly be a
master of this world.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So that was one of
the goals of alchemy.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:24.150 align:middle line:10%
But this tablet was said to
have been produced in antiquity

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:10%
by Hermes or Hermes
Trismegistus,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:10%
as he's sometimes called, Hermes
the Thrice Great or Thrice

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:10%
Illustrious, which this
character, by the way,

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:10%
we also find in Parzival.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.080 align:middle line:84%
In that story Parzival by
Wolfram von Eschenbach,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.260 align:middle line:84%
there's a character known
as Treves the Hermit who

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:90%
helps to guide Parzival.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, Trevrezent means
threefold knower.

00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And Hermit comes from Hermes.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
So Hermes the threefold
knower is Hermes Trismegistus.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So obviously, this
is a reproduction.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.440 align:middle line:84%
This is not an original
Emerald Tablet.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's certainly not
made of real emerald.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So what exactly is it that
this tablet is made from?

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.630 align:middle line:90%
And where is it now?

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so the actual Emerald
Tablet of Hermes was said

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.040 align:middle line:84%
to have been discovered
at Siwa in Egypt.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Some say it was discovered near
Abydos at the Osirion, which

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.910 align:middle line:84%
was a place where the alchemical
process was being implemented

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.860 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Egypt.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And according to
tradition, that's

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.230 align:middle line:84%
also where the god Osiris
was said to be buried.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Supposedly, Alexander the
Great discovered a tomb there

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.430 align:middle line:90%
with this Emerald Tablet.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And Aristotle helped
him to translate it.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And this was part
of his own mission.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:50.230 align:middle line:84%
But the original Emerald
Tablet, we don't think it

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:90%
was actually made of emerald.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was probably
made of a copper acetate,

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.630 align:middle line:90%
which looks like emerald.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>> That was made using
an alchemical process.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.900 align:middle line:90%
>> An alchemical process.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And this was significant
because if you take copper

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.410 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to convert
it to a copper acetate,

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:84%
then by heating
that copper acetate,

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:84%
you could actually
very easily extract

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.550 align:middle line:84%
copper monoatomic atoms from
it or copper manna, which

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.860 align:middle line:84%
was said to help restore
youth and other things

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:90%
of that nature.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So the Emerald
Tablet that was said

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.880 align:middle line:84%
to have been brought
over in the records

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.050 align:middle line:84%
and put into one of the
vaults in the Americas

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
here by the order is said
to be of this copper acetate

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:90%
substance.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So it's not a real
emerald, but it

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.700 align:middle line:84%
fits as an emerald in
terms of a description.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.430 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, even
in again going back

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:10%
to Wolfram von
Eschenbach's book Parzival,

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:10%
it describes the
Grail as an emerald

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:05.440 align:middle line:10%
that fell out of Lucifer's crown
when there was a war in heaven.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was brought to
Earth by neutral angels,

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:90%
is what they say.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:13.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Could that be a metaphor
or an allegory for maybe

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.590 align:middle line:84%
an extraterrestrial impact that
brought in different chemistry

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.090 align:middle line:90%
than we have here?

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>> It absolutely could.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.986 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's also alluding
to this emerald tablet,

00:12:25.986 --> 00:12:28.850 align:middle line:84%
this emerald copper
acetate process.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's talk about the process.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:35.360 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe the
various stages of alchemy?

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Different alchemical
texts describe

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.160 align:middle line:90%
the process in different ways.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.480 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes there are seven steps,
sometimes there are 12 steps,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.150 align:middle line:10%
depending on how detailed
you want to get in it.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And what you're doing, right?

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:51.572 align:middle line:90%
>> And what you're doing.

00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, it
can be broken down

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.300 align:middle line:84%
into three main steps
which were known

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:03.660 align:middle line:84%
as digestion, in which the
thing was dissolved in a liquid.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Basically, a liquid
menstruum, a solvent.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.300 align:middle line:84%
So if you were
working with a metal,

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
you wanted to dissolve
it in an acid.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:84%
If you're working
with an herb, you

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.340 align:middle line:84%
might want to use
alcohol or even water.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:90%
You're trying to digest.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Break it down.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Break it down, just like your
stomach does with digestion.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.970 align:middle line:84%
The second stage
was distillation.

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.720 align:middle line:84%
By heating the
liquid, you extract

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:35.790 align:middle line:84%
the heart and vital parts of
the thing you're working on.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:90%
And it turns into a steam.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.600 align:middle line:84%
By heating it, the liquid
turns into a steam,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and then can be collected
into another vessel, which

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:47.460 align:middle line:90%
was fundamental to this.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it helped to
remove the impurities.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, the Emerald
Tablet itself mentions,

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:84%
it says you must
separate the subtle

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:90%
from the thick and gross.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the things
it says on the tablet.

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And so it's talking
about, how do you liberate

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.850 align:middle line:84%
these subtle essences,
the beneficial ones

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
from the things that
aren't good for us.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So this was one of
the ways to do it.

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.760 align:middle line:84%
The final stage of
the alchemical process

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.160 align:middle line:84%
then would be calcination,
in which the remaining dross

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.070 align:middle line:84%
body that was at the
bottom of the flask

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:90%
had to be burnt down to ashes.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And those ashes scattered
to the four winds of heaven.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the manna
or the monoatomic elements,

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.930 align:middle line:84%
as well as other
beneficial minerals

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:40.575 align:middle line:90%
could be extracted from it.

00:14:40.575 --> 00:14:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you
got your white stone.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.250 align:middle line:84%
And it was believed that
there are allusions to this

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:90%
in the New Testament as well.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:52.420 align:middle line:10%
For example, in
Revelations, it says,

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:10%
"To he who overcometh will
be given the hidden manna

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:57.940 align:middle line:10%
in the precious white stone."

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:01.660 align:middle line:10%
Well, again, it's probably
alluding to this process.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And there are other things too.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Many of the symbolism associated
with even the birth of Jesus

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.250 align:middle line:84%
had alchemical undertones
to it that the Templars

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.050 align:middle line:90%
came to associate with.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.330 align:middle line:84%
One of the places
you can extract

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:19.840 align:middle line:84%
these monoatomic elements
is from sea salt.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes this
manna was also

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.900 align:middle line:84%
referred to as bread,
manna bread or shewbread

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:90%
is another name for it.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
But in the story of Jesus,
you have the Virgin Mary.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Mary or Maria means
sea or salt water.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you heat seawater,
what do you get?

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:84%
You get an immaculate
conception of salt.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:90%
It suddenly crystallizes--

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It crystallizes.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Seemingly out of thin air.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:50.380 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:52.810 align:middle line:90%
And salt is a salt cube.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you unfold the
cube, you get a cross.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>> You get a cross.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And hidden within that
cross then is this manna.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, in the story
of the virgin birth of Jesus,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.050 align:middle line:90%
he's born in Bethlehem.

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:15.600 align:middle line:84%
And Bethlehem literally
means house of bread.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So here we have this allusion to
this entire alchemical process.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:90%
And it goes even beyond that.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.590 align:middle line:84%
But the Templars saw
this and recognized

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:84%
there was alchemical metaphors
all throughout the Bible.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And that it alluded
to these processes.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:36.450 align:middle line:84%
The Templars saw
that the Egyptians,

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:84%
as they were studying
the temple walls in Egypt

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:84%
and they saw the alchemical
processes on the walls.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And it had been preserved
for thousands of years.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>> So it wasn't
an original idea.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:49.260 align:middle line:90%
>> It wasn't an original idea.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Following in the footsteps
of what they had discovered

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:90%
in Egypt.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:59.170 align:middle line:84%
They knew that they could
imply Pythagorean ideas,

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:01.270 align:middle line:84%
sacred geometry,
and other things

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:06.099 align:middle line:84%
to build new temples or
cathedrals throughout Europe.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And on them, they could
preserve this knowledge.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.740 align:middle line:10%
And we know one of the things
that scholars have never really

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:10%
been able to get their
head around is the fact

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.760 align:middle line:10%
that, Yes, there are alchemical
processes being outlined on all

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:10%
the Cathedrals,
there was a author

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.270 align:middle line:10%
by the name of Fulcanelli
who was an alchemist who

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.400 align:middle line:10%
wrote a book called
Mystery of the Cathedrals

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.270 align:middle line:10%
that gets into this very well.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:10%
But the only people
that were translating

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:40.120 align:middle line:10%
alchemical Greek and Roman
alchemical texts at the time

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.370 align:middle line:10%
were groups like the
Sabians and the Druze

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.780 align:middle line:10%
and certain mystic Islamic
groups in the Middle East.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So we need to ask ourselves,
how did this knowledge

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.250 align:middle line:84%
that was being translated
in the Middle East

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:01.900 align:middle line:84%
find its way onto the
buildings in places like France

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.280 align:middle line:90%
And Medieval France?

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer
is the only people

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.810 align:middle line:84%
that were associating
with these other groups

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and building these
cathedrals were the Templars.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:16.210 align:middle line:84%
If we go back to
the Emerald Tablet,

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:84%
the Emerald Tablet
literally starts out

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:90%
saying as above, so below.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.470 align:middle line:84%
That there was a relationship
between the heavens

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:24.790 align:middle line:90%
and the Earth.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.680 align:middle line:90%
This was fundamental to alchemy.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:90%
The study of the stars.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:34.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word Templar
itself comes from Temple.

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And the word temple comes from
templum, which means time.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.590 align:middle line:84%
But with time comes
from measuring

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.980 align:middle line:84%
the stars, the
procession of the stars.

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.250 align:middle line:84%
So the Templar order
was very concerned

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
with following the stars, not
only for alchemical operations.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.320 align:middle line:84%
But these same
ideas then started

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
to get applied to
things like navigation.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.580 align:middle line:84%
One of the other groups that the
Templars were associating with

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:08.500 align:middle line:84%
and learning alchemy and
astronomy and astrology from

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.630 align:middle line:90%
was the Sabians.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:14.440 align:middle line:84%
They existed primarily
in Northern Turkey,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.820 align:middle line:84%
in the area of Harrans
near Gobekli Tepe.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And their name, Sabian, probably
comes from the Egyptian word

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:30.610 align:middle line:90%
Saba, which means stargate.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And throughout Egypt and
all of these locations

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.630 align:middle line:84%
where these alchemical
processes are being depicted,

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:42.520 align:middle line:84%
the other thing we also find
is this word Saba or stargate

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
being depicted in the
sanctum sanctorum or Holy

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.470 align:middle line:90%
of Holies of these temples.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:51.340 align:middle line:84%
When we factor in the
other uses of alchemy

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:55.540 align:middle line:84%
found around the ancient world
with the shimana, the vimanas,

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:90%
these flying crafts.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:10%
And let's not forget too
that even Solomon himself,

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.100 align:middle line:10%
according to the
Kebra Nagast text,

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:10%
which is an
Ethiopian text, talks

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:10%
about how King Solomon
had a flying ship that he

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:14.840 align:middle line:10%
used to fly around to go visit
from Jerusalem to Ethiopia

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.120 align:middle line:10%
to visit the Queen
of Sheba regularly.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:21.260 align:middle line:10%
And we also know, according
to the Torah's, would

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:27.380 align:middle line:10%
receive 666 talents of gold
a year in exchange for bread.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, bread is a
metaphor for the manna.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And that number 666
in the ancient world

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.360 align:middle line:84%
was really the number
of transformation.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking about here
is transforming or transmuting

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.820 align:middle line:90%
gold into the manna.

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And this manna, of
course, was stored

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:84%
in the ark, which was in
turn stored in the temple.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:84%
The temple was built
to store the ark.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:52.880 align:middle line:90%
>> To house the ark.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.750 align:middle line:84%
But it could also be used
for Solomon's flying ship.

00:20:56.750 --> 00:21:00.500 align:middle line:84%
This goes back to that
levitation properties of manna.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>> So let me ask you this.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:07.250 align:middle line:84%
When-- well, in church when they
talk about the wine represents

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.090 align:middle line:84%
the blood of Christ and the
bread represents his body,

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:14.300 align:middle line:84%
is this going back to this
whole alchemical process

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:17.160 align:middle line:90%
of manna and transmutation?

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.450 align:middle line:10%
According to the
Templar tradition,

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:10%
the original communion
rites, the Eucharist that's

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:27.740 align:middle line:10%
practiced within Christianity
and was practiced

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:31.010 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient world by
the ancient Egyptians,

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:34.280 align:middle line:10%
the Babylonians, and
others, the Mithraic cults,

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:10%
they all had these
similar communion rites.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.480 align:middle line:84%
But originally, we believe based
on what we see in the temple

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.190 align:middle line:84%
walls that the bread, the
original bread for this

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.440 align:middle line:84%
was this manna, these
monatomic elements.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you tweak those
elements that particular way,

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:84%
you can transmute
them and turn them

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:59.450 align:middle line:84%
into this red substance,
which the Templars came

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:84%
to call the Red Lion or
sometimes the blood of Christ,

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:84%
because it looks and
tastes like blood.

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And it was said
it heals the body.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.160 align:middle line:84%
So this was the
original communion.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Ingesting it helped to heal
the body, awaken consciousness

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.920 align:middle line:90%
to the bigger order.

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And again, this
is something found

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:90%
throughout the ancient world.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.020 align:middle line:84%
Another example of
this, the Cintamani

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.990 align:middle line:84%
that's found within the
ancient Indian traditions.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And also ancient Chinese
and Manichaean traditions

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:39.280 align:middle line:84%
that moved up into Tibet
also make reference to it.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.920 align:middle line:84%
But what it suggestive of is
that the ingestion of this

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.480 align:middle line:84%
actually helps to stimulate
the pineal gland, which

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:53.130 align:middle line:84%
is the radio receiver
for the environment.

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:57.240 align:middle line:84%
The pineal gland, as it
picks up subtle vibrations

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:84%
from the environment around
it, it releases melatonin.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.220 align:middle line:84%
Melatonin is the body's
best natural antioxidant.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:10%
But it's also the chemical
messenger for serotonin.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.060 align:middle line:10%
And serotonin is what
regulates all the other glands

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.340 align:middle line:10%
of the body to respond
to the environment.

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.260 align:middle line:84%
So by stimulating
this area, which

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:84%
was also known as the third
eye in some traditions.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It heightens awareness.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It heightens awareness.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, in
Aramaic, it was referred

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:32.340 align:middle line:84%
to as the nazar or the
third eye, the brow.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we believe was
really the origin of the word

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Nazarene.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus the Nazarene
would have been

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Jesus with an open
third eye, basically.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Of all the things that
the Templars recovered,

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.850 align:middle line:84%
rediscovered when the
order rose to prominence,

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:56.850 align:middle line:84%
the secrets of alchemy are
absolutely the Golden Prize,

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:57.650 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.070 align:middle line:10%
But these secrets of
alchemy were the power

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:03.620 align:middle line:10%
that really allowed
them to become

00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:05.990 align:middle line:10%
so powerful and successful.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:07.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm convinced of it.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:90%
>> And they were universal.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:84%
It allowed them to
associate with groups

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:15.410 align:middle line:84%
all over the world who also
had these secret practices.

00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can't think of a
further, more closed off place

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.450 align:middle line:84%
during the time of the Templars
than Tibet, for example.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And even in Tibet, we
find the famous mantra,

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.990 align:middle line:90%
"Om mani padme hum."

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Om representing the
word of creation,

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:38.155 align:middle line:84%
mani being the precious jewel,
which is the white stone,

00:24:38.155 --> 00:24:39.350 align:middle line:90%
the manna.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Padme being what
was the crown chakra

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:46.940 align:middle line:84%
or the opening of the head
in the Kabbalistic tradition,

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:48.620 align:middle line:90%
referred to as kether.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:90%
And hum was the completion.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.600 align:middle line:84%
So truly by obtaining
this precious white stone,

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.330 align:middle line:84%
this manna, you were
able to overcome,

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:84%
just like revelation says, this
is what the Tibetan stuff says.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
the Grail tradition

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:11.860 align:middle line:84%
has also said, of which the
Templars were the guardians.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.230 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
the purpose of this

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:18.370 align:middle line:84%
was to allow us to be in
harmony with our environment,

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:22.390 align:middle line:84%
with the universal order, with
each other, with the animals,

00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:24.250 align:middle line:90%
and the other people around us.

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And it was believed if you were
able to be in this harmony,

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.400 align:middle line:84%
then everything else
would fall into place.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Government structure
could fall into place.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.090 align:middle line:90%
Democracy could work.

00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:37.930 align:middle line:84%
The power of the
individual could shine.

00:25:37.930 --> 00:25:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And freedom could
be truly expressed.

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's pretty clear to me
that alchemy gave the Templars

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:50.280 align:middle line:84%
the science of Atlantis, which
they then took and applied

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.430 align:middle line:90%
in both old and new ways.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, this was definitely
one of the secrets,

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:59.070 align:middle line:84%
the royal secret, if you
will, that had been passed

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:01.110 align:middle line:90%
on by the Templars.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.500 align:middle line:84%
