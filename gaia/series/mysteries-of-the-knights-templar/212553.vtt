Was there a deal
with the Church?

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm Scott Wolter,
forensic geologist

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.775 align:middle line:10%
and a Knights Templar.

>>TIMOTHY HOGAN: And I'm
Timothy Hogan, grand master

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.810 align:middle line:10%

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci created
a miracle for the Vatican

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.690 align:middle line:84%
in exchange for the Vatican
leaving the underground Templar

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.935 align:middle line:90%
tradition alone.

00:00:49.935 --> 00:00:54.570 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: A deal with the church
involving the Shroud of Turin?

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is very interesting
because the Shroud of Turin

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.140 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most well
known religious artifacts

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.140 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it
has an image of a male

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.410 align:middle line:90%
that's burned into the cloth.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And many people believe that
it represents the cloth that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.310 align:middle line:84%
was covering Jesus, and
then when he ascended,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.440 align:middle line:84%
the image was then
burned into the cloth.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Well, at
least according

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:84%
to the order's records,
what really happened

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:84%
here is the order had acquired
a shroud from the gnostic sect

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.950 align:middle line:84%
of the Druze in the Middle
East, that the Templars had

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:90%
close associations with.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:84%
This shroud actually did
not have any image on it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.140 align:middle line:90%
at all at the time.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But it was just something that
had existed within the records

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.990 align:middle line:90%
and within the archives.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.640 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci was
friends with Pope Leo X.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And he struck a
deal with him and he

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:84%
said, look, I will produce
a miracle for the Church

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.160 align:middle line:84%
if you agree to leave
the underground Templar

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.510 align:middle line:84%
bodies alone to just do
the stuff we need to do.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:90%
And Leo X was open to this idea.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.560 align:middle line:10%
So what he did was
he gave Leonardo room

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.362 align:middle line:10%
within the basement
of the Vatican,

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:09.404 align:middle line:10%
which there was a morgue.

00:02:09.404 --> 00:02:12.110 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Why would they need
to cut a deal with the Templar

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.910 align:middle line:90%
order?

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: It was a
win-win situation.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.670 align:middle line:10%
By striking this deal,
it allowed the church

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.100 align:middle line:10%
to have a miracle,
which could help

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.490 align:middle line:10%
with the faithful of the Church
to give them a renewed faith,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:10%
if you will, and it would
help the underground Templar

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.950 align:middle line:10%
movement to do its work, right?

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.340 align:middle line:10%
Leonardo da Vinci was
already experimenting around

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.410 align:middle line:10%
with camera obscuras.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:10%
What he found is that
with the camera obscura,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.650 align:middle line:10%
he could create
an inverted image.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Really, I mean, you could do
this with a pinhole camera now.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, Leonardo needed
something a little bit more

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.480 align:middle line:90%
advanced.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:84%
So he hired German lens
makers to specifically make

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:84%
special lenses that could be
fitted for this camera obscura.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:10%
His plan was to take
emulsion and put it

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.600 align:middle line:10%
on this shroud that had
been obtained from the Druze

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:10%
to the Templars,
take an emulsion

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:10%
to put on the shroud
using chemicals

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.050 align:middle line:10%
that was produced alchemically
in Leonardo's lab,

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:10%
specifically to burn an
image from the camera obscura

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:10%
onto the cloth itself.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: So wait a minute.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.160 align:middle line:90%
It's not Jesus then?

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: It's not Jesus.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
This was actually the first
photograph in modern history.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: But the reason why
they had to do it in the morgue

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
specifically was
because they needed

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.147 align:middle line:84%
a body that wasn't going to
move for a long period of time.

00:03:41.147 --> 00:03:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Because of
the exposure time.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.030 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: To exposure time in
order to burn the image in.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:84%
What Leonardo did
was he actually

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.160 align:middle line:84%
folded over the area,
which would be the head,

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.980 align:middle line:84%
and he just burned
a body into there.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the German
lens maker saw this,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
they started to get a sense for
what was going on down there.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:90%
They didn't understand it.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:84%
They just saw
these weird images.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:84%
They thought Leonardo
was doing necromancy.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.530 align:middle line:90%
And they accused him of that.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:84%
They said, look, you're
doing alchemy and necromancy.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.375 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to
create lenses for you

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:14.500 align:middle line:90%
if you're going to do this.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.755 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Oh.

00:04:14.755 --> 00:04:15.555 align:middle line:90%
I see.

00:04:15.555 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: But
eventually, Leonardo

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.360 align:middle line:84%
was able to get
the image created

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:90%
through the lenses he had.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, historians know about
this episode in history

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.730 align:middle line:84%
in which he was working
with German lens makers

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.335 align:middle line:84%
while he was working on a
secret project for the Vatican.

00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
They just don't
know what it was.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.355 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: They didn't know
what the project was.

00:04:33.355 --> 00:04:34.522 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: It's exactly right.

00:04:34.522 --> 00:04:37.540 align:middle line:84%
But what it was to
create this shroud.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
And for the final capstone,
if you will, of this shroud

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.112 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo used his own face
for the face of Jesus.

00:04:46.112 --> 00:04:49.047 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So it's not
Jesus, it's not de Molay,

00:04:49.047 --> 00:04:50.005 align:middle line:90%
it's actually da Vinci.

00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:51.430 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: It's Leonardo himself.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.722 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: It's Leonardo himself.

00:04:52.722 --> 00:04:53.522 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Yeah.

00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can see this, even
if you look at the shroud

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
to this day, you can see that
the head is separated ever

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.647 align:middle line:90%
so slightly.

00:05:00.647 --> 00:05:03.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: I've actually
seen photographs of it

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:84%
in one of the
churches in Europe.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:90%
And there is a line.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Yeah.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, not only was
that line from the cloth being

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:90%
folded over, right?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Because they had to put
this head on separate

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.310 align:middle line:84%
from the body like a
Frankenstein monster--

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So there was
a demarcation, right?

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.570 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: But he
left the demarcation

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.770 align:middle line:84%
because of his veneration
of St. John the Baptist.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Who was beheaded.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Beheaded.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.940 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And this is why even to this
day, if you look at the shroud,

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.950 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
face of the shroud,

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.260 align:middle line:84%
you can see there's
a slight fish eye

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:90%
effect that come from the lens.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Oh, right.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.620 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: It also explains
some of the lighting that

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:90%
would happen from the lenses.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And scientists--
modern scientists

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:84%
have figured out that
the shroud was created

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:84%
through some sort
of light emanation

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:90%
but they don't know how or why.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, this is why.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.805 align:middle line:84%
It's because it was the first
photograph in modern history.

00:06:00.805 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Well, you know what?

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.780 align:middle line:84%
That makes perfect
sense because if this

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:84%
was the shroud of
somebody who was dead

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.120 align:middle line:84%
or even if they were dead
and then rose from the dead,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:84%
there would be some
type of organic material

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:90%
that was left in the cloth.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:90%
And that can be dated, right?

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.127 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: That's right.

00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:19.450 align:middle line:10%
Well, and in fact, the
only organic material

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.610 align:middle line:10%
that they have
found on the shroud

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.950 align:middle line:10%
is from Druze DNA that's
dated from the 1300s.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.600 align:middle line:10%
So the 1200s or the 1300s, which
puts it right in the time frame

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:10%
of when the Templars were
associating with the Druze

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.870 align:middle line:10%
where they obtained the
cloth from the Druze.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is a form of
alchemy using light, right?

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.980 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: How specifically
did he do it?

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Do we know?

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Yeah.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.370 align:middle line:90%
He used silver salts.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:10%
Not unlike how early photography
is burnt into images later on,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.530 align:middle line:10%
but it was just happened
to be done on a cloth

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.880 align:middle line:10%
instead of on a piece of paper.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.680 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: And all the ingredients
that was needed to do this

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.180 align:middle line:84%
are found in
Leonardo's notebooks.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he detailed it all,
including the camera obscura.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.177 align:middle line:90%
So it's all there.

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just people haven't
pieced it together.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was very important to
the Templar order at the time

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and to Leonardo that
the family to reveal

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.485 align:middle line:84%
the shroud to the public would
be the de Charney family.

00:07:21.485 --> 00:07:22.475 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Who was--

00:07:22.475 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Geoffroi de Charney,
the former Normandy preceptor

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.210 align:middle line:84%
who was burnt at the stake
with Jacques de Molay.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:33.830 align:middle line:10%
And there's a bad stigma
associated that had this family

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:35.210 align:middle line:10%
member burnt at the stake.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.700 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, especially when
you have the church telling

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.480 align:middle line:84%
the whole world that your family
member was a heretic, that's

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.785 align:middle line:90%
why we burned him at the stake.

00:07:42.785 --> 00:07:43.220 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Right.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Now, they're
not in a position

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.205 align:middle line:90%
to tell people the truth.

00:07:46.205 --> 00:07:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And people wouldn't have
believed it, anyway,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
because in many
ways, they either

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.490 align:middle line:84%
were totally dedicated
to the Church

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.992 align:middle line:90%
or who are you going to believe?

00:07:53.992 --> 00:07:56.450 align:middle line:10%
I got to believed the Church,
I'm not going to believe you.

00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:90%
Why would they burn you?

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that was a tough one.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:03.320 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: So this was a
way to help the de Charney

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.475 align:middle line:90%
family save face.

00:08:04.475 --> 00:08:05.720 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Pope Leo X
certainly went along with it.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.270 align:middle line:10%
So the de Charney
family is the one

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:10%
that was allowed to reveal
the shroud to the public,

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:10%
and it's been deemed
a miracle ever since.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So by giving this shroud
to the de Charney family

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:84%
after Leonardo was
finished working on it,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.920 align:middle line:84%
and then having the de
Charney family in turn

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:33.020 align:middle line:84%
give it to the church, it helped
clear the de Charney family's

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.490 align:middle line:84%
name of having been
associated with this heresy.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.039 align:middle line:10%
And it was of benefit
to the Church,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:41.840 align:middle line:10%
because now the
church had a miracle.

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.770 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, in addition to
that, the win for the tradition

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.280 align:middle line:84%
was Leonardo basically said,
back off the scientists.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Yeah.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: People like Galileo
let them do their work,

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and you can have your
miracle and everybody will

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.763 align:middle line:90%
play nice from here on.

00:08:56.763 --> 00:08:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: That's right.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And you have to remember
Leonardo had been schooled

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.220 align:middle line:84%
with a number of other
Renaissance thinkers

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.050 align:middle line:90%
and alchemists and painters.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
People like Botticelli,
for example, and Raphael.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:10%
They had all been schooled
in the same school who

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.800 align:middle line:10%
were committed to not
only understanding

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:10%
the symbolism and
the mythologies

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.940 align:middle line:10%
and the texts that were being
brought back by the Templars,

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:27.230 align:middle line:10%
but then incorporating it into
artwork of the Renaissance.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:30.230 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Speaking of
artworks and Leonardo da

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:33.200 align:middle line:84%
Vinci and secrets,
there's actually

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.160 align:middle line:84%
a secret that is embedded in
another piece of his artwork

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.780 align:middle line:90%
that is absolutely fascinating.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.232 align:middle line:90%
And what am I talking about?

00:09:41.232 --> 00:09:43.190 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Well, you're
talking about "The Virgin

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:90%
of the Rocks."

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.630 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: That's right.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.470 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.050 align:middle line:10%
And what a lot of
people don't understand

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.950 align:middle line:10%
is da Vinci was actually
asked by the Church

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:54.140 align:middle line:10%
to create a piece
of art that would

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.120 align:middle line:10%
become virgin on the rocks.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at that image, you

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:03.020 align:middle line:84%
see Mary standing in blue in
front of two children, which

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.270 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to be Jesus and
John the Baptist as children.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:07.070 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Correct.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:09.320 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: The only
problem with this artwork

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.190 align:middle line:84%
is there's another person in the
picture on the right-hand side

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.950 align:middle line:84%
dressed in green
and orange, which

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.340 align:middle line:84%
happened to be the symbolic
colors of Mary Magdalene.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Orange representing
the region in France

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that legend says she disappeared
into after the crucifixion,

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and green representing her
Celtic roots and ideology.

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:34.400 align:middle line:84%
So you've got this woman
with Auburn hair sitting

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.070 align:middle line:84%
on the right, and
the problem with this

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.770 align:middle line:84%
is they were all
contemporaries in age.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.990 align:middle line:84%
So if that's Mary Magdalene,
those two children cannot be

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Jesus and John the Baptist,
which begs the question,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.540 align:middle line:84%
if that's not who they
are, then who are they?

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Yeah.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And at least according
to the Templar tradition,

00:10:54.490 --> 00:11:00.310 align:middle line:84%
these were the children of
John the Baptist and Jesus

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:84%
that they both had
with Mary Magdalene.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Wait a minute.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.475 align:middle line:84%
Do you realize
what you just said?

00:11:06.475 --> 00:11:07.330 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Yeah.

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:08.170 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, according to
the tradition, John

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:15.250 align:middle line:84%
the Baptist and Jesus were
both married to Mary Magdalene

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.140 align:middle line:90%
and had children with her.

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Initially, Mary Magdalene was
married to John the Baptist,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:21.880 align:middle line:90%
they had children.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.030 align:middle line:84%
John the Baptist was
meant to be the leader

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:26.470 align:middle line:90%
of this new tradition.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.870 align:middle line:84%
He was certainly the
initiator of Jesus.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And when he was
killed early, Jesus

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:90%
had to take on that new role.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And Mary Magdalene
didn't marry Jesus

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.740 align:middle line:90%
and had children through Jesus.

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So this painting seems to
be suggesting the children

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.600 align:middle line:84%
from both people
and Mary Magdalene.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: My understanding
is in the first century

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
to be a rabbi, the
tradition was not only

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:84%
were they required
to be married,

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:84%
but they were also required
to have a son for succession.

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Apparently according
to the tradition,

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.670 align:middle line:84%
that somebody in the family,
like a cousin in this case,

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:90%
was obligated to marry her.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Because what I've also heard
is that the priestly line

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
of the tradition went
through the feminine.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.060 align:middle line:84%
What this looks like is
something that, first of all,

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:22.190 align:middle line:90%
is heretical to the church.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.520 align:middle line:84%
But to people that are
pragmatic and looking at this,

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.930 align:middle line:90%
it's still shocking.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:84%
But when you understand
the tradition of the time,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.900 align:middle line:90%
it makes perfect sense.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:31.700 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: It does.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.420 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And da Vinci obviously
knew that because my guess is,

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:90%
he's part of this bloodline too.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:84%
So this secret was
passed down and it

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:43.625 align:middle line:84%
was his job to preserve
it, to be revealed someday.

00:12:43.625 --> 00:12:46.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Well, and this
is part of the reason

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:84%
too why he was always so
obsessed with John the Baptist.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, not just this painting,
but in other paintings as well.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:58.320 align:middle line:10%
He has paintings of John
the Baptist himself.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.870 align:middle line:10%
And there's allusions to
John in other paintings.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:02.750 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And let's not forget, it
was Hugues de Payens who

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:10.970 align:middle line:84%
was ordained under apostolic
succession in Constantinople

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:84%
in a Johannite lineage, where
he would have learned about this

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.810 align:middle line:90%
before they went down there.

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars also had
associations with other groups

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:26.720 align:middle line:84%
like the Mandaeans, for example,
in places like Iran and Iraq

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
who venerated John the
Baptist over Jesus.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And this was, again,
a Gnostic tradition.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And if
we want to go back

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:84%
to the first version of that
painting that da Vinci did,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.380 align:middle line:84%
you also see Mary
Magdalene going like this.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Yes.

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:41.980 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: OK.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.760 align:middle line:84%
She's pointing to
John the Baptist.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I make
this hand gesture

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and rotate it 90 degrees,
what do you have?

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:90%
The compass and square.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.380 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Correct.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right?

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Correct.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So when da Vinci
finished this painting

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.870 align:middle line:84%
and he presented
it to the church,

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:84%
they basically
said, sorry, Gunnar.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.190 align:middle line:90%
Do it again.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:02.280 align:middle line:90%
They didn't want it.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.880 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at the second
version of the painting,

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.650 align:middle line:90%
it's quite different.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Mary is still in blue, but all
of a sudden, the two children

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:13.850 align:middle line:90%
have halos over their heads.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:18.200 align:middle line:84%
John the Baptist is carrying
a cross and Mary Magdalene,

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:22.740 align:middle line:84%
now all the colors are gone,
the hand pointing is gone.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.455 align:middle line:90%
We can't have her in that image.

00:14:24.455 --> 00:14:27.710 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Well, and in
the first picture of it,

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:84%
you have one hand
going like this

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.820 align:middle line:84%
while the other
hand is going across

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:36.650 align:middle line:84%
and it's holding an
invisible head and a cut

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:37.450 align:middle line:90%
across the throat.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: And then that
was removed by this,

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.325 align:middle line:90%
time the second painting was.

00:14:41.325 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Of course, it was.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:42.995 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Right.

00:14:42.995 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: OK.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's one
more piece of art

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.010 align:middle line:84%
that we would be remiss
if we didn't bring it up,

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.120 align:middle line:90%
the "Last Supper."

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.425 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Yeah.

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:54.322 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: And there's a lot
of secrets hidden in there.

00:14:54.322 --> 00:14:55.655 align:middle line:90%
What are some of your favorites?

00:14:55.655 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Well, I mean, with the
"Last Supper," first of all,

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:84%
we have all of the perspective
of the painting going

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.030 align:middle line:84%
to Jesus's right
eye, which is kind

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:84%
of interesting from an
esoteric standpoint in terms

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.440 align:middle line:84%
of representing that
eye of deity that

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.860 align:middle line:90%
is emphasized in traditions.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.610 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Like the back
of the dollar bill.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Like the back
of the dollar bill.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
But even beyond that, there are
signs within the painting that

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.700 align:middle line:84%
are reminiscent of secret
signs that you find

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.380 align:middle line:90%
within the Templar tradition.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.140 align:middle line:84%
In the past, there
continue to be passed down

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.710 align:middle line:84%
within Freemasonry to this
day, including distress signs.

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:38.990 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: How about the knife?

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: There's a knife
coming out of nowhere

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:84%
being held at the abdomen
area of one of the disciples.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Then, of course,
obviously, there's

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:53.720 align:middle line:84%
the figure next to
Jesus, which some

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:84%
have said it's supposed
to be John, the beloved.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:02.060 align:middle line:84%
But also tends to look like
Mary Magdalene herself.

00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.340 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, I don't think
it looks like Jon at all.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.170 align:middle line:90%
I think it looks like a female.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's definitely Mary
Magdalene, in my opinion,

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.050 align:middle line:84%
but on that note,
there is something else

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:90%
that's hidden in the painting.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:84%
If you look carefully
on what would

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
be the left side of the
table as you're viewing it,

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.130 align:middle line:84%
the right side from the people
sitting at the table, actually

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:84%
the shoulder and neck
of one of the disciples

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.470 align:middle line:90%
is actually a baby.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a boy--

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Yeah.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: --wearing blue.

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
You can actually pull Jesus
and Mary Magdalene together

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and she'll have her head
leaning against his shoulder.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you can actually
take the baby and bring it in,

00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and it fits right in the
middle with her holding it

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:44.780 align:middle line:90%
in her arms.

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is another secret
that actually dovetails

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.920 align:middle line:90%
with "Virgin on the Rocks."

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.620 align:middle line:84%
But the point is,
Jesus was married.

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.490 align:middle line:84%
He was married to Mary Magdalene
and they had at least one son,

00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:57.690 align:middle line:90%
they had a daughter too.

00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Her daughter was Sarah.

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:84%
This is heretical
to a lot of people.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:84%
But what I'd like to
point out, in 1980,

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:08.520 align:middle line:84%
there was a tomb discovered in
the East Talpiot neighborhood

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.730 align:middle line:84%
in Southern Jerusalem
called the Talpiot tomb.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:15.060 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what happened is
one of these underground tombs

00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:15.880 align:middle line:90%
was found.

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.089 align:middle line:90%
Antechamber, burial chamber.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And inside the burial chamber,
they found 10 ossuaries.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:27.869 align:middle line:84%
Seven inscribed with names,
six in Aramaic, one in Greek.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:33.300 align:middle line:84%
And when the archeologists
translated these inscriptions,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
they had names like Jesus
or Yeshua, son of Joseph.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.820 align:middle line:90%
James, son of Joseph.

00:17:41.820 --> 00:17:43.830 align:middle line:90%
Brother of Jesus.

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
Joseph, Maria, Jose, and the
last one, written in Aramaic

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.380 align:middle line:90%
was Judah.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Son of Jesus.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:84%
So that child in virgin
on the rocks that

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:00.820 align:middle line:84%
was in Mary Magdalene's
lap was Judah.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:04.030 align:middle line:84%
The seventh and the last
ossuary that was pulled out that

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:05.440 align:middle line:90%
was inscribed with the name.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.730 align:middle line:90%
This one in Greek said [GREEK].

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:14.350 align:middle line:84%
[GREEK] is a title of honor
as in Lord, master, or queen.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And there have only been 6
out of about 3,000 to 4,000

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.470 align:middle line:84%
ossuaries that have
been found in Israel

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.810 align:middle line:90%
that have this title on it.

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Three are male, this is the
third one that's female.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.900 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a
tomb in Jerusalem

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%
that the world largely
doesn't know about

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.760 align:middle line:90%
because it's been suppressed.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.540 align:middle line:84%
That appear to contain
the mortal remains

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.960 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, their
son, and other family members.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So the whole notion
of these secrets

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:49.930 align:middle line:84%
that Leonardo was preserving
and now being revealed really

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.475 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't be that
much of a surprise.

00:18:51.475 --> 00:18:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Well, and we should
point out that particular tomb

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.730 align:middle line:84%
was broken into during
the time of the crusades--

00:18:58.730 --> 00:18:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yep.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: --by the order.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.040 align:middle line:84%
The bones were
removed at that time.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.335 align:middle line:84%
It was just the boxes
that were left behind.

00:19:06.335 --> 00:19:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, not
only that, because I've

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:84%
dealt with the people that were
working with those ossuaries,

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.720 align:middle line:90%
the Talpiot team.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.630 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
what I was told is

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:20.990 align:middle line:84%
that when the archeologists
found the ossuaries, I mean,

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:23.130 align:middle line:84%
the tradition talks
about going in there.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, the facts support
that because they said,

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:29.120 align:middle line:84%
largely, there were
very little bones left

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and there was actually--
some of the material was

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.650 align:middle line:90%
welded to the side of the box.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to
get extractable DNA.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.830 align:middle line:84%
They weren't complete
strands but partial strands.

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And let's just say, that's some
very interesting things that

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:84%
doesn't do anything to
pooh-pooh this story

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.120 align:middle line:90%
that we're telling right now.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, talking about the
Templars going into the tomb

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:84%
during the time of the
first crusades, what's

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:84%
interesting about
the tomb is that when

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:58.160 align:middle line:84%
the archeologists went in,
they found that somebody

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.540 align:middle line:90%
had breached the tomb.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And this allowed
terra rossa soil from

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.000 align:middle line:90%
rose gardens up above.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.960 align:middle line:84%
It kind of gives a new
meaning to the phrase--

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Sub rosa.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Sub rosa.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Under the rose.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, the terra rossa
soil flowed into the tomb

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:18.290 align:middle line:84%
and filled it up with up
to 2 feet of this material

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:22.010 align:middle line:84%
because whoever went in,
didn't close the tomb properly.

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:25.760 align:middle line:10%
So when they excavated the
ossuaries and the floor

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.950 align:middle line:10%
of the burial
chamber, they actually

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:35.810 align:middle line:10%
found three skulls placed in
a triangle in the East, South,

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:38.520 align:middle line:10%
and West quadrants of the tomb.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, does that mean
anything to you?

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:43.280 align:middle line:84%
You're a past master
in Freemasonry, right?

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Yeah.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a very typical
layout for guardianship.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.070 align:middle line:84%
What would be known as the
wardens or the guardians

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:54.350 align:middle line:90%
of any type of sacred space.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:84%
It's certainly
something that follows

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:84%
within the Templar tradition
of which later Freemasonry came

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:90%
out of.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, we have
the Tyler who guards

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:90%
the door to the lodge, right?

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.440 align:middle line:84%
To keep out cowards
and eavesdroppers.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And my thought is, these
three skulls were probably

00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.990 align:middle line:84%
three Templar Knights who
died during the initial siege

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.330 align:middle line:84%
of Jerusalem who would
have been honored

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:23.140 align:middle line:84%
to have their skulls placed
at the symbolic guardians

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.205 align:middle line:84%
in the tomb of their
ancestral king, right?

00:21:26.205 --> 00:21:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: It should
be pointed out

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.150 align:middle line:84%
that there are certain mystic
Islamic sects that are now

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:35.320 align:middle line:84%
referred to as Sufi, but who the
Templars had associations with.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And they too set up their
temples with officers

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.680 align:middle line:84%
in the East, the
South, and the West.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And one of their first
forms of recognition

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.960 align:middle line:84%
is to do this to each
other, which, by the way,

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.770 align:middle line:84%
this is what Leonardo da
Vinci later has John doing.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:59.170 align:middle line:84%
It represented the letter I
and a point becoming a line.

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:03.230 align:middle line:84%
This was the countersign, which
was the line then becoming

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:07.400 align:middle line:84%
a set of compasses, and it also
represented the Latin letter A.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
sign that was given

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.920 align:middle line:84%
was this, which
represented the letter O.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And it represented
the compasses forming

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:16.550 align:middle line:90%
a point within a circle.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, this IAO was the
Gnostic name of God.

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:84%
But it was also believed
John the Baptist got his name

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:30.770 align:middle line:84%
from because John, again,
in Greek is Ióannés, which

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.110 align:middle line:90%
was IAO, how it started out.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:37.730 align:middle line:84%
So it was a title saying,
basically, of God.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.570 align:middle line:84%
But not just any God,
God of the first cause.

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:46.970 align:middle line:84%
The creator of the
light that manifested.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.160 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
Leonardo is known for

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.890 align:middle line:84%
is his Vitruvian
Man, which basically

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.410 align:middle line:84%
shows how man is composed of
both the square and the circle.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:23:00.360 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: The square representing
the physical world, the four

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.560 align:middle line:84%
elements, the four directions,
the four sides of the square,

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.290 align:middle line:84%
and the circle representing
spirit because it

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:90%
had no beginning and no end.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right.

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:13.080 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: So by uniting
the square and the circle,

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.650 align:middle line:84%
it represented spiritualizing
the materializing

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:17.450 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:18.250 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Exactly.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Just like the
Templar cross represented.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:24.690 align:middle line:10%
And later, we find
that same symbolism

00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:26.970 align:middle line:10%
being utilized
within Freemasonry

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:31.140 align:middle line:10%
with a square and the compasses
representing the circle.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.870 align:middle line:10%
>>SCOTT: Exactly.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.330 align:middle line:10%
Well, there's one other thing
about the Vitruvian Man.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:40.110 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice that he
has his feet spread,

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.970 align:middle line:84%
but he also has
the feet together.

00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you look at that,
it's a very interesting symbol.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, this particular
hand gesture,

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:84%
if we flip it back like
this, makes what letter?

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.460 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Letter M.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:56.310 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: This is the sign
of a certain tradition that

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:84%
began right after
the put down in 1307.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So I would encourage people
that are watching right

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:05.130 align:middle line:90%
now to look for the M sign.

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:08.280 align:middle line:10%
You will see it in art,
you'll see it in sculpture.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.270 align:middle line:10%
Going back to just before the
put down and all the way up

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.510 align:middle line:10%
through to this day.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.740 align:middle line:10%
But remember, it's not
necessarily the person that's

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.660 align:middle line:10%
being depicted, Columbus.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.370 align:middle line:10%
That's one of my favorites.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.040 align:middle line:10%
And the first image
that usually comes up

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.890 align:middle line:10%
is him standing here
doing the M sign,

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:27.760 align:middle line:10%
and it's not subtle at all.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But of course, if
you don't know what

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.350 align:middle line:84%
to look for you
don't see it, but now

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.860 align:middle line:84%
you'll never not see
it going forward.

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And remember, it's not
Columbus that was the initiate,

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:39.970 align:middle line:84%
it was the artist that
drew the painting.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Yeah.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we can
say that the Templar

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:47.950 align:middle line:84%
order has been very good at
creating these secret signs.

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.010 align:middle line:84%
They've left landmarks
for centuries.

00:24:51.010 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:84%
And the work of Leonardo was
fundamental to some of this.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he really gave
birth to the Renaissance.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Templars had
acquired this knowledge

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:04.180 align:middle line:84%
from the Middle East
and other places.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.190 align:middle line:90%
They brought it into Europe.

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Europe was shut down
until Leonardo created

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:14.680 align:middle line:84%
this miracle, which then
allowed all these documents

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and everything else
to be celebrated

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.360 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
in art and for

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.520 align:middle line:90%
new scientific breakthroughs.

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.620 align:middle line:84%
New texts were allowed
to be published.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is really what
created the Renaissance.

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo was the
consummate diplomat.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.980 align:middle line:84%
He's the one who negotiated
this win-win situation that

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.040 align:middle line:84%
helped both the Church
and the Templars,

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:40.080 align:middle line:84%
even though they
had goals, which

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.430 align:middle line:84%
may have been diametrically
opposed to each other.

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:48.160 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: So in the end, this
worked out best for everybody.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:84%
