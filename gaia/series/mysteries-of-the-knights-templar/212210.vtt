>>SCOTT: The Templar
founders originated

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.260 align:middle line:90%
from Gnostic families.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Whenever I think about the true
founding of the Templar order,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.510 align:middle line:90%
I always go back to Bernard.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:10%
In 1113, he joined
the Cistercian order

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.150 align:middle line:10%
with 30 family members.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.330 align:middle line:84%
They all came together,
including two of his uncles

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.970 align:middle line:84%
who were part of the
original Nine Knights

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:84%
that founded the Templar order
in Jerusalem, which would

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.740 align:middle line:90%
be only a few years later.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously, there's
something going on here.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.370 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, I look at this
as a deliberate event.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.780 align:middle line:90%
This was intentional.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.480 align:middle line:84%
30 family members,
that's not a coincidence.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:84%
What this sounds like to me is
the beginning of a coup d'etat.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Yeah, Bernard
was also responsible for--

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.110 align:middle line:84%
he had sent by the church
to go down and investigate

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:84%
a group of Gnostics in
Southern France known

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
as the Albigensians, also
known as the Cathars,

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.700 align:middle line:90%
another name for them.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.355 align:middle line:84%
These were the Gnostic families
that the Templars came out of.

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:49.210 align:middle line:84%
His mission was he was supposed
to go down and condemn them.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:84%
But he actually came back and
praised their way of life,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.960 align:middle line:84%
saying that they were
even more Christian

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:90%
than the Christians of Rome.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right, right.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So isn't there a
very famous saying

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:84%
that goes back to the
Albigensian crusade

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.910 align:middle line:84%
when the church mounted a
crusade against the Cathars

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:90%
and these Albigensian families.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
this happened around 1204,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I believe to 1244 not
long too many years

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.490 align:middle line:90%
after Bernard died, right.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And there were groups
of Knights that

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.700 align:middle line:84%
were sent down there by
the church, not the Knights

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Templar, by the way.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.775 align:middle line:84%
But there's an old story that
goes that one knight said

00:02:32.775 --> 00:02:34.150 align:middle line:84%
to another knight,
when they were

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
about to raid one of
these Cathari families

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:90%
and kill them all.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And he'll say--
he basically said,

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.430 align:middle line:84%
how do we know the
good Christians

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:43.630 align:middle line:90%
from the bad Christians?

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And the other Knight
said, kill them all

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:90%
and let God sort it out.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Yeah, it
was a brutal crusade.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.940 align:middle line:84%
It was actually one of the
first Crusades of Europe,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and it was against
other Christians.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to note that
the defender of the Cathari

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:84%
families of the
Albigensian families, a man

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Lord
Raymond, he was actually

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.820 align:middle line:84%
taken into hiding by
the Templar order.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And after he died, he was
buried on Templar properties,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.530 align:middle line:84%
actually in the Templar
preceptory in Toulouse

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
because he was denied
burial in Holy Land

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
amongst the Roman
Catholics of the time.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So this
Albigensian crusade

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.300 align:middle line:84%
was Christians
against Christians.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.260 align:middle line:84%
What was it that the
church was upset about?

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Why did they kill these people?

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:84%
What were they practicing that
was perceived as a threat?

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Well, there was a
number of things going on.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.570 align:middle line:84%
One was Toulouse was bigger
than Paris at the time.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:90%
So this was prime real estate.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:84%
But the people that
were practicing

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.620 align:middle line:84%
in this area of Southern France,
their form of Christianity,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.010 align:middle line:84%
which was a Gnostic
Christianity,

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.590 align:middle line:84%
was different than what
was being practiced

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.000 align:middle line:90%
other places in the world.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.800 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: OK.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: In fact,
the word gnosticism

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:84%
or and when I refer
to a Gnostic family,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:84%
it really comes from the
Greek word gnosis, which means

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:90%
divine experiential knowledge.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
belief that anybody,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.260 align:middle line:84%
through their own efforts, could
attune with the greater God

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, sometimes
referred to as the Christos,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.650 align:middle line:90%
the collective consciousness.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.060 align:middle line:84%
The word gnosis would be
equivalent in the Eastern

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.080 align:middle line:84%
traditions to enlightenment
or even nirvana.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.390 align:middle line:84%
But it was a state of
experiential knowledge

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.290 align:middle line:84%
in which the individual,
through their own efforts,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.510 align:middle line:90%
attained this illumination.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: OK, now we're getting
to the meat of the matter,

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.030 align:middle line:90%
really to the core of the issue.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.770 align:middle line:84%
And basically,
what you're saying

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.260 align:middle line:84%
is to achieve a connection
with deity, whoever

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and whatever you call
it, that was something

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
in their version of
Christianity this achievement

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.720 align:middle line:84%
or striving to achieve
Christos, right,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:84%
or this spiritual
enlightenment, they

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.330 align:middle line:84%
could do all by themselves,
whereas the Roman church

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.220 align:middle line:90%
required a human conduit.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, this would
be a big problem.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And now, I think we're starting
to see where the issue is.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.050 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Yeah, the Gnostics,
while they had priests,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.330 align:middle line:84%
their job was more as a
facilitator to initiate people

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:90%
into experiences.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.210 align:middle line:84%
But it was believed
that the divine spark,

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.530 align:middle line:84%
the sacred flame within
was within everybody.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:48.358 align:middle line:90%
So anybody--

00:05:48.358 --> 00:05:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: We were
born with it, right?

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.025 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: We were born with.

00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:52.870 align:middle line:90%
It was an inalienable right.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.630 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: This goes back
to these God given rights

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.870 align:middle line:90%
that we were born with.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: That's exactly right.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it came from the
creator, came from source.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Because we are all
connected to that,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:90%
anybody could attune with it.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Whereas within the
Roman church, you

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:84%
needed the intervention of
a priest to get to there.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is why the priests
would perform sacraments

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.190 align:middle line:84%
of different kinds
in order to basically

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.070 align:middle line:84%
be the middleman
between you and heaven.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.453 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Within the
Gnostic tradition,

00:06:29.453 --> 00:06:30.705 align:middle line:90%
there was no middleman.

00:06:30.705 --> 00:06:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Because you were already
connected into that,

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.240 align:middle line:84%
which is great if
you're a free person.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.240 align:middle line:84%
But it's really bad
for business if you're

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.737 align:middle line:90%
trying to act as the middleman.

00:06:41.737 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Well, yeah.

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And I think we see
the conundrum here.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.810 align:middle line:90%
This is the crux of the issue.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: The other thing
that separated gnosticism

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
at the time from some
of the Eastern Orthodox,

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and Roman Catholic,
and other traditions

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.760 align:middle line:84%
was the Gnostics interpreted
the crucifixion, death,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.700 align:middle line:84%
and resurrection of
Jesus as a metaphor.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Right.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: They didn't
believe that he actually

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.970 align:middle line:84%
physically died and
came back from the dead.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:14.620 align:middle line:84%
They interpreted
it as a metaphor.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word
Resurrection in Greek

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.530 align:middle line:84%
is anastasius, which
just means to wake up.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.870 align:middle line:10%
And so they interpreted
this as waking up

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.420 align:middle line:10%
to gnosis, the death
of the old self

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.920 align:middle line:10%
that was attached to
the physical world

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:10%
and the awakening to the
new realization of gnosis.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:84%
They saw metaphors
of, for example,

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Plato's description
of his cave for those

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.120 align:middle line:84%
who are familiar with that
philosophical model in which

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:84%
a person is born into a cave,
looking at shadows on a wall,

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:84%
and is interpreting
those shadows as reality.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And every once in
a while, somebody

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.350 align:middle line:84%
will come into the
cave and say, hey,

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.800 align:middle line:84%
there's a whole other
world out there.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And the people either revile
them and say, you're crazy,

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.232 align:middle line:90%
or they'll go out.

00:08:08.232 --> 00:08:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And if they go out of
the cave, then they

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.940 align:middle line:84%
have a responsibility
to help liberate others.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.810 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: If you go back and
you look at depictions of Jesus

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:84%
on the cross with Mary
Magdalene sitting at the base,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:84%
right, if you look at the
position of their heads

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.820 align:middle line:90%
relative to each other.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.420 align:middle line:84%
This is the position
of both Venus

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and the sun on a particular
point on the winter solstice.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Yeah, there were
layers of this metaphor.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:10%
I mean, from the
Gnostic standpoint,

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.419 align:middle line:10%
these theragnostics also
looked at Mary Magdalene

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:49.420 align:middle line:10%
as representing the Sophia,
which was the goddess of wisdom

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:54.340 align:middle line:10%
and that Jesus
represented the Christos

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.440 align:middle line:10%
or the universal consciousness.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And according to the
Gnostic cosmology,

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:03.640 align:middle line:84%
Sophia also represented
the human soul that

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.340 align:middle line:84%
incarnates on down
into this world,

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
becomes trapped in
matter, and it's only

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:84%
through her wedding
of the Christos,

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:16.740 align:middle line:84%
the universal consciousness,
that she's in turn liberated

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:90%
and experiences gnosis.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:26.610 align:middle line:84%
So this whole play takes
place also within the story

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.890 align:middle line:84%
of Mary Magdalene
and Jesus, which

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
if we accept that
the wedding of Cana

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:37.020 align:middle line:84%
was actually the wedding
of Mary Magdalene to Jesus.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.350 align:middle line:84%
According to the Gnostics,
this was the story

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.180 align:middle line:84%
of how the soul weds itself with
the universal consciousness.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.650 align:middle line:84%
Really, the soul
represented the Sophia,

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and the Universal
consciousness was the Christos.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.240 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus, representing the
universal consciousness,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:84%
marrying Mary
Magdalene, represented--

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Sophia.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Sophia, represented
the individual soul

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:90%
coming to illumination.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we even
see this alluded

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:15.490 align:middle line:84%
to again in going back to
the death and raising story.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
Who's the first to witness
the resurrected Christ?

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.050 align:middle line:90%
Mary Magdalene.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Mary Magdalene.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.948 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: She's there at the
tomb when he is resurrected

00:10:23.948 --> 00:10:25.240 align:middle line:90%
according to the church, right.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:25.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: That's right.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.700 align:middle line:10%
>>HOGAN: And not only
that, but Jesus was also

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:10%
known for doing things like
liberating seven demons

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:10%
from Mary Magdalene.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, to the Gnostics,
this was a metaphor

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:41.230 align:middle line:84%
for opening the blockages of
the seven chakra, the seven

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:84%
psychic centers, are also
known as the Seven seals

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.570 align:middle line:90%
before revelation.

00:10:46.570 --> 00:10:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And with the opening
of each seal,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:84%
our old perception of
the world dies, and then

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:84%
our new perception of who
we really are opens up.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.720 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Well, and the
fact that Mary Magdalene

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:84%
was present at the time of the
resurrection, if we go back

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to that metaphor of the
sun on the winter solstice

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:12.090 align:middle line:84%
when the son comes back,
who is always there?

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Venus.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Venus.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Even though
you can't see her

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:18.550 align:middle line:84%
when the sun is above the
horizon, she's always there.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: It's also
believed that there

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:26.110 align:middle line:84%
were initiation rites that were
designed to illustrate this.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.290 align:middle line:84%
And it may even be that
Jesus himself was performing

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.565 align:middle line:90%
these initiation acts.

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:31.940 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Exactly.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.130 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: An example
I like to point out

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:90%
is the story of Lazarus.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:42.200 align:middle line:84%
In the story of Lazarus,
he said to have died.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.860 align:middle line:84%
He was put in a
tomb for three days.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:50.320 align:middle line:84%
And then Jesus resurrected
him in the town of Bethany.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, the word Lazarus
in Hebrew is El'azar.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And it should be pointed out
that El in Hebrew means God.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:59.710 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yes.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.680 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: And Azar was
the ancient Egyptian name

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.480 align:middle line:84%
for Osiris, the God Osiris, who
also went through this death.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.970 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Same death and
resurrection ritual.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.380 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: And the town of Bethany
in Hebrew came from Betanu.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Bet means house
in Hebrew, and Anu

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.200 align:middle line:84%
was the ancient Egyptian
abode of the dead.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
So here, you have
Jesus raising the God

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.430 align:middle line:84%
Osiris in the house of
the dead, which is either

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.940 align:middle line:84%
a metaphor that he was
passing on this earlier

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:36.070 align:middle line:84%
ancient Egyptian tradition
or the person represented

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.860 align:middle line:84%
a candidate who is
symbolically being initiated.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
And it was tied into this
idea of the soul attaining

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.230 align:middle line:90%
this new level of awakening.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Let me just jump
on something for a second

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
that I think might add a little
something to the argument

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:84%
that maybe we are
talking about Jesus

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
was performing a ritual as
opposed to physically really

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.890 align:middle line:90%
dying.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.450 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
14 stations of the cross

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
when you go to a Catholic
Church, three of those stations

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.725 align:middle line:84%
talk about Jesus
stumbling, right.

00:13:12.725 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And then he gets
back up on his way

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:84%
to where he's ultimately
going to be crucified.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, as you know,
within Freemasonry,

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:28.980 align:middle line:84%
we have a degree where there
are three stumbles, if you will,

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.660 align:middle line:90%
that the candidate goes through.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.660 align:middle line:84%
I find this an
interesting parallel.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:37.310 align:middle line:10%
I also find it interesting
that the grand architect

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.070 align:middle line:10%
of the building of the
temple, a guy whose name was

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.700 align:middle line:10%
Hiram Abiff, who is
killed, and then his body

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.900 align:middle line:10%
is buried out in the
mountains for 14 days.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.940 align:middle line:84%
I find this to be a very
interesting connection

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and I think supports the
argument that maybe this

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:58.760 align:middle line:84%
is allegorical, and it
represents a ritual rather

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.160 align:middle line:90%
than an actual death.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, having said that, I
think it's very important

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.880 align:middle line:84%
that you and I both
make it clear to people

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:84%
watching this show that
we are not advocating

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:12.530 align:middle line:90%
one position for another.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:84%
We're not saying this
is that or that is that.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
I think that's for the
individual to research it,

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.325 align:middle line:84%
hear what we say, look into
it yourself, and then decide

00:14:23.325 --> 00:14:24.125 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:14:24.125 --> 00:14:26.700 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Again, the
hallmark of templarism

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
was this belief that the
divine, spark the sacred flame

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.090 align:middle line:90%
was in everybody.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is again what
allowed them to associate

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.320 align:middle line:84%
with so many people
of different faiths.

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.920 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:84%
But they did find that
within a lot of the faiths,

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.080 align:middle line:84%
there was always this mystic
element that understood

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:52.820 align:middle line:90%
these things metaphorically.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And it's part of what
allowed the Templars

00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:01.490 align:middle line:84%
to travel and associate with
groups all over the world.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:84%
There were Jewish
kabbalists that represented

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:06.990 align:middle line:90%
a Gnostic tradition.

00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:12.020 align:middle line:84%
There were Druze in the
Middle East or Tawhid Mudun.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:15.710 align:middle line:84%
They were Gnostic
Unitarians, they still are.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And they had very close
relationships with the Templars

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:84%
in the past and
still do to this day.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many
Druze are Templars.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: So I think it's
really important for us

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.790 align:middle line:84%
to try to make a distinction
between gnosticism

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.350 align:middle line:90%
and religion.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:35.510 align:middle line:84%
And if the Templars were truly
Gnostics, is that a religion?

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:90%
How do we define that?

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.040 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: For some gnosticism
were a religion, for others,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.900 align:middle line:90%
it was more of a philosophy.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And there were some
that will say, well,

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.790 align:middle line:84%
there's no evidence that
the Templars were Gnostics.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.430 align:middle line:84%
You can sit here and
say they were Gnostics.

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:53.810 align:middle line:90%
But where's the proof?

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
where the proof is.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:10%
If you look at old
Templar documents,

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.300 align:middle line:10%
they used a wax
seal on many of them

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:05.090 align:middle line:10%
of a figure known as Abraxas.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:10%
Abraxas was a Gnostic talisman.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Abraxas was a strange
looking figure.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:84%
He had a rooster
head, a human body,

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:90%
where he was holding a whip.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.560 align:middle line:84%
He wore an apron, and
he had snake legs.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And he was said to
be the son of Sophia,

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:28.087 align:middle line:90%
again, the goddess of wisdom.

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: So what does that mean?

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that seems like
an apparent contrast,

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
this freaky creature
with Sophia.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:35.810 align:middle line:90%
What's the connection?

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: According to
the Gnostic cosmology,

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Sophia gave birth to
four main children.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Three of them were known as
faith, hope, and charity.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.990 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and then the
fourth one was Abraxas.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, Abraxas was
said to originally

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:90%
be known as an archon.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And what the
archons were is they

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.160 align:middle line:84%
were like prison
guards that kept

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:84%
people enslaved to
this planet until they

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:05.460 align:middle line:90%
had attained illumination.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:84%
And so their job
was to test people,

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:13.920 align:middle line:84%
to try to put
people in situations

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
to see if they would really
practice what they were

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.710 align:middle line:84%
preaching, if they
were really practicing

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:84%
from the sacred flame
within or if they

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:26.089 align:middle line:90%
were going to act out of fear.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:30.140 align:middle line:10%
According to the Gnostic
myths, Abraxas attained

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.460 align:middle line:10%
illumination himself.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.050 align:middle line:84%
He started out as
a prison guard,

00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:90%
trying to keep people enslaved.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:90%
He came to gnosis.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.750 align:middle line:84%
He found gnosis, this
divine revelatory knowledge.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And then he became a
liberator of others.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:10%
Now, the stages of
his body were said

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:49.520 align:middle line:10%
to represent the
stages of initiation

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:52.130 align:middle line:10%
that in fact, the
Templars practiced.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:57.950 align:middle line:84%
The snake legs represented
being bound to the Earth.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:01.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's no animal that
crawls closer to the Earth

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.210 align:middle line:90%
than a snake

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Yeah.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.090 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: That
represented the people

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.790 align:middle line:90%
of an Earth bound personality.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:11.210 align:middle line:84%
The people who are completely
ruled by the physical,

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:90%
and that's all they think about.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:84%
They don't really appreciate the
consequences of their actions.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:25.370 align:middle line:84%
They live for titillations,
and to avoid pain, and seek

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.820 align:middle line:90%
pleasure, and that's it.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SCOTT: Otherwise
known as hedonist.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:31.290 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Otherwise known
as hedonism, correct.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
But then initiation within
the Gnostic tradition

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.970 align:middle line:84%
first involved a baptism
by water or some sort

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.380 align:middle line:90%
of illustration of water.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.880 align:middle line:90%
Water represented the emotions.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was believed that all
the liquid functions of the body

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:84%
are generated in the abdomen, at
the place where the apron hung

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.410 align:middle line:90%
in Abraxas' body.

00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:84%
So this represented the first
stage of initiation, this apron

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.353 align:middle line:90%
that Abraxas wore.

00:19:02.353 --> 00:19:03.270 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: First degree.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:90%
>>HOGAN: Right.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Then the goal of
this was the initiate

00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:10.380 align:middle line:84%
had to learn to subdue
their passions at this stage

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.210 align:middle line:90%
within the Gnostic tradition.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:16.530 align:middle line:84%
They taught that not to
get rid of your passions

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:21.030 align:middle line:84%
but rather to use them as an
energy for transformation.

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:84%
They believed that metaphors in
the Bible like walking on water

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:30.090 align:middle line:84%
was symbolic of learning
to stabilize your emotions

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.040 align:middle line:90%
and not drowned in them.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.310 align:middle line:84%
So use your emotions
for transformation.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Because then the next stage
was associated with air.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is where you
have Abraxas with his whip

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.520 align:middle line:90%
that cracks in the air.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:84%
And it represented the
intellect, and the mind,

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
and the studying of
the arts and Sciences

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.910 align:middle line:84%
that were things
of the mind, not

00:19:56.910 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose of being
able to prove how smart you

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.460 align:middle line:90%
are at memorizing facts.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't the purpose.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of it was
to see the bigger order

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:13.120 align:middle line:84%
and recognizing that all of
these sciences of the mind

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.600 align:middle line:84%
pointed to the fact
that all of our minds

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.990 align:middle line:84%
are connected to
a universal mind.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:22.210 align:middle line:90%
This was the Christos.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And getting to this place
was where you experienced

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:90%
gnosis or enlightenment.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, the final stage within
the Gnostic traditions

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:84%
of which the Templars
were passing this on

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:39.130 align:middle line:84%
was between the air
stage and then going

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:41.740 align:middle line:90%
to the rooster head of Abraxas.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:46.230 align:middle line:84%
The rooster head of
Abraxas represented fire.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.770 align:middle line:84%
And it represented
the calling forth

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:55.570 align:middle line:84%
to the experience of
gnosis of illumination.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:57.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what is
a rooster do when

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.586 align:middle line:90%
it sees the light of a new day?

00:20:59.586 --> 00:21:02.780 align:middle line:90%
[ROOSTER CLUCKING]

>>SCOTT: --the crows.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:07.280 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: So this
was the experience

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.960 align:middle line:84%
of recognizing the light,
the source of light,

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.950 align:middle line:84%
which was meant
to be the gnosis.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But before that could
happen, the Gnostics

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.750 align:middle line:90%
would usually have--

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:84%
perform a ceremony in
which the candidate

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:29.000 align:middle line:84%
had to symbolically die to their
old self and then be raised.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.050 align:middle line:90%
>>SCOTT: Resurrected.

00:21:30.050 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:84%
>>HOGAN: Resurrected to the
new light of understanding.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.120 align:middle line:84%
This is what was
found within all

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.270 align:middle line:84%
the different Gnostic
traditions of the ancient world.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.630 align:middle line:84%
It probably came from Egypt,
where they were performing

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:90%
the same initiations.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And even before that,
going back to Atlantis.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Because we know that
even other groups

00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:52.940 align:middle line:84%
on the other side
of the Atlantic,

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:55.580 align:middle line:84%
like the Mayans
and such, were also

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:90%
performing these ceremonies.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:03.450 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars inheriting
this understood what it meant.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:05.120 align:middle line:90%
They utilized it.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And when they encountered these
other cultures that were also

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:84%
practicing these
initiation rites,

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.800 align:middle line:84%
they immediately recognized
them as brothers and sisters

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.310 align:middle line:84%

foundation of the gnosis.

>>SCOTT: It just seems
to me the evidence keeps

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:36.320 align:middle line:84%
building that it comes down
to philosophy, ideology,

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately this death
and resurrection ritual,

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and gnosis, and
enlightenment that

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.970 align:middle line:84%
was this connecting thread
between these cultures,

00:23:12.488 --> 00:23:13.890 align:middle line:90%
And they have five altars.

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:16.230 align:middle line:84%
They have four at the
Cardinal directions

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.760 align:middle line:90%
and one in the center.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And the candidates, they
have to offer sacrifices

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:84%
of earth, water, air, and fire
at the four Cardinal directions

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.540 align:middle line:84%
after which they're led
to the center altar.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:84%
They're given an oath
that they have to take.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They have to take an oath,
then symbolically killed

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:44.800 align:middle line:84%
after which they're
raised from the dead.

an all seeing eye painted

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.300 align:middle line:90%
on his chest.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:57.390 align:middle line:84%
It's done with a
particular handshake

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:84%
that just happens to be
the same handshake that's

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.670 align:middle line:90%
used by Templars.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.450 align:middle line:90%
It's used by Druze.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.820 align:middle line:90%
It's used by Hopi.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.580 align:middle line:84%
It's used by a whole
number of other traditions

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.340 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
again, which according

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.340 align:middle line:84%
to all of their
traditions goes back

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.190 align:middle line:84%
to Atlantis or in the
Mayan case Atzlan.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And this ties in ultimately
with some of the mysteries

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:23.770 align:middle line:90%
of the Holy Grail.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about the Grail
a number of times already.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.680 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were said to be
the Guardians of the Grail.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.390 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Gnostic traditions,

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.680 align:middle line:84%
the Grail was the
meeting point between

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:40.760 align:middle line:84%
the individual consciousness and
the collective consciousness.

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.180 align:middle line:90%
That was the point.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
So to drink from that
Grail symbolically,

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:50.870 align:middle line:84%
we meant to drink from that
universal consciousness.
