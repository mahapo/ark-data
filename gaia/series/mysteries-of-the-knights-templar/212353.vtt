>> So everyone has heard about
bad luck being associated with

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.000 align:middle line:84%
Friday the 13th, but very
few people realize that

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.400 align:middle line:84%
it's directly connected
to the Knights Templar.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
The question is,
how is it connected?

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we need to realize that
the Templar Order while they

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.280 align:middle line:84%
grew in fame and fortune and
influence throughout Europe,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:84%
there came a point where there
were other powers that became

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.530 align:middle line:84%
jealous of the
influence that they had.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.410 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, you
had the Roman Church

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.430 align:middle line:84%
who was getting very
uncomfortable with the Templar

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.580 align:middle line:84%
association with groups
outside of the Roman influence.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other hand,
you had King Philip the Fair,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
who was looking
to start new wars

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:90%
and needing money to do it.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he had owed the
Templar Order lots of money

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:90%
that he had borrowed previously.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to set himself
up as the new war king.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And in order to do that,
he needed to get money.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.030 align:middle line:84%
He knew that the Templars had a
rich depository in their Paris

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.870 align:middle line:90%
commandery.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.630 align:middle line:84%
He owed them money
and he figured why not

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.205 align:middle line:90%
kill two birds with one stone--

00:01:54.205 --> 00:01:58.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Or best way to get rid
of the debt is to get rid

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.350 align:middle line:90%
of the debtor, right?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So he could take
care of his debt

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.370 align:middle line:84%
while getting more money for
his wars, and as a result,

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
he decided he needed to
stage a coup, if you will,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.230 align:middle line:84%
or an overthrow of
the Templar Order.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
In September, he signed arrest
warrants for all Templars

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
in France, which was to go
into effect a month later.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately on
Friday, October 13th,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:84%
the Templar Order was
rounded up in what

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.555 align:middle line:84%
was hoped to be a surprise
suppression by Philip the Fair.

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:41.965 align:middle line:90%
>> But it wasn't a surprise.

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>> It wasn't a surprise.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.020 align:middle line:84%
de Molay had already knew that
this was going to be happening.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:84%
The Templar Order, trying
to figure out what to do,

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.890 align:middle line:84%
decided that they could actually
send most of their Knights

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
outside of Paris with the
treasures and everything

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.490 align:middle line:84%
else that was being held
at the Paris commandery.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.600 align:middle line:84%
Get them out of France, and
leave a few Templars behind

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.010 align:middle line:90%
to be rounded up.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And of course, de
Molay, Jacques de Molay,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:84%
the Grandmaster of the
Templars at the time,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.130 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going to sacrifice
other people to this

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.030 align:middle line:84%
without he himself also being
willing to be sacrificed.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:84%
He thought, I'm sure that
he could talk his way out

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.620 align:middle line:90%
of this situation.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he had had a long
history with Philip the Fair

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.070 align:middle line:84%
and he thought he
could get out of it.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, as it turns out
he didn't get out of it.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
They ended up getting rounded
up, tortured for seven years.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And by March of 1314,
Jacques de Molay

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:84%
as Grandmaster, Geoffroi de
Charney, the Norman preceptor,

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.050 align:middle line:84%
were burnt at the stake in front
of Notre Dame Cathedral, one

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:84%
of their great creations
of the Templar Order.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
This really sealed
the idea that Friday

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
the 13th, which was when the
date they were rounded up,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.305 align:middle line:90%
became an unlucky day.

00:04:08.305 --> 00:04:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And from then on, it
was demonized, right?

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.300 align:middle line:10%
Now, we run into
this situation where

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.500 align:middle line:10%
most people think that this was
the end of the Templar Order.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:84%
In fact, many historians
will try to play it out

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.640 align:middle line:84%
like with the dying breath
of Jacques de Molay,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:90%
the Templar Order was finished.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:10%
In reality--

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.640 align:middle line:10%
>> You and I both
know different.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>> We both know different.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:84%
At this point, the Templar
Order had to go underground.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.370 align:middle line:90%
So where did they go?

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is one of
the burning questions

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:90%
that historians have asked.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, Scott, you and
Tim are telling us

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:90%
that the Templar survived.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:49.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:90%
Where did they go?

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they went
several places.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.150 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of all,
we have to remember

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:84%
they had established an entire
Templar nation in Portugal.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So in Portugal, they
weren't even rounded up.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:10%
They just changed their names
to the Knights of Christ.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:10%
Very easy solution,
everything was OK.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It was to appease the
Pope at the time, right?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I've read
is that at the time,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.430 align:middle line:84%
the Templars had basically been
hired to defend them from being

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.440 align:middle line:84%
attacked by the
Moors from the South.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.182 align:middle line:84%
And basically the
King of Portugal said,

00:05:22.182 --> 00:05:23.140 align:middle line:90%
wait, what do you mean?

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get rid
of my fighting force?

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.555 align:middle line:90%
No, I'm not.

00:05:25.555 --> 00:05:26.005 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:26.830 align:middle line:90%
>> But you know what?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.747 align:middle line:90%
I'll throw you a bone.

00:05:27.747 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:90%
We'll change the name.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.310 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.000 align:middle line:84%
We had some Templars we just
went back to the Holy Land

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.410 align:middle line:90%
and converted to Islam.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they had already
established relationships

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.480 align:middle line:84%
with Islamic families,
also Druze families,

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Sabian families.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So they just went back
to the Middle East.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And the spiritual pursuit
of the Christos didn't matter

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.740 align:middle line:84%
if it was Christianity
or the Muslim faith.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.710 align:middle line:84%
They could still do what they
had done all along, right?

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, some Templars
found it most convenient

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.857 align:middle line:84%
to just absorb themselves
into their orders.

00:06:02.857 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the things
that happened when the Templar

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.430 align:middle line:84%
order was suppressed is
most of their properties

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
had been reconfiscated
by the Roman Church

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:84%
and then distributed to
the Knights Hospitaller who

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.740 align:middle line:90%
was a rival order at the time.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:84%
The Knights Hospitaller
later became

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.150 align:middle line:90%
known as the Knights of Malta.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So many Templars just went
into the Knights Hospitaller

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and tried to maintain business
as usual if they were able to.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Still, others we're
told, at least

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.370 align:middle line:84%
according to our tradition,
fled up to Scotland

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:84%
because Robert the
Bruce at the time

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.470 align:middle line:84%
had already been
excommunicated by the church.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Not long before that.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Not long before that because
he was having problems with

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.520 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And so he was trying to set
up his own Scottish state.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And who better to help him
with this but the Templars.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And the legend says that
Templars went up, fought

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.910 align:middle line:84%
at the Battle of Bannockburn
and helped the Scots win

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:90%
the day for independence.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, not only is that part
of the legend but we actually

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.025 align:middle line:10%
have documents that
speak exactly to that,

00:07:12.025 --> 00:07:14.380 align:middle line:10%
that the Templars did
serve at Bannockburn.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And because of that,
King Robert the Bruce

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.210 align:middle line:84%
and the Scottish
earls were obligated

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:84%
to protect the surviving
Templars and the treasures

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.850 align:middle line:90%
that they brought to Scotland.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting
fun fact when

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.200 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about
Scotland is let's

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:84%
go back to Hugues de Payens
when the order was first founded

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.010 align:middle line:84%
and the year was 1129 when
the order became official.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:84%
We know that they certainly
were founded before that.

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.550 align:middle line:84%
But in 1129, the
Grandmaster Hugues de Paynes

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.920 align:middle line:84%
went to the British
Isles and met

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.620 align:middle line:84%
with leaders in
England and Scotland,

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.330 align:middle line:84%
and planted the seeds for what
would eventually germinate

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:90%
almost 200 years later.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:84%
When the Templars
did go to Scotland,

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Robert the Bruce certainly
had memory of that

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:90%
and it worked out for them.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And it worked out for the
Scots because the Battle

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.200 align:middle line:84%
of Bannockburn was
the single greatest

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:84%
day in the history of Scotland
which is still celebrated

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:09.850 align:middle line:90%
like our Independence Day--

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Independence Day.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>> --right?

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.403 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:08:11.403 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, some Templars
also fled to the area

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.370 align:middle line:90%
of what is now Switzerland.

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Was said to have helped
fight a peasant's revolt

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.160 align:middle line:84%
there to establish
independence in that area.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.140 align:middle line:84%
We know that some Templars
went into the area of now

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.180 align:middle line:90%
Germany, the Württemberg area.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:34.870 align:middle line:10%
And in fact, they just
eventually recalled

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:38.530 align:middle line:10%
themselves the Militia
Crucifera Evangelica,

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.480 align:middle line:10%
which was this underground
body that ended up

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:10%
becoming very instrumental in
Protestant revolt happening

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.270 align:middle line:10%
in Germany at the time in
the Black Forest of Tübingen

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:54.120 align:middle line:10%
and in other areas like that.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.620 align:middle line:84%
By 1598, 1599, they were
very well-established.

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.420 align:middle line:10%
Frederick, the Duke
of Württemberg,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:04.260 align:middle line:10%
was the Grandmaster of the
order there in Germany and--

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Martin Luther played
a role in that, too.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Martin Luther was protected
by families in that tradition.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And even Queen Elizabeth I was
also a member of the Militia

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Crucifera Evangelica.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.500 align:middle line:84%
So this Templar strain had
fingers going out everywhere.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:90%
>> All over.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.990 align:middle line:84%
>> But one of the places where
it became the most fertile

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:33.000 align:middle line:84%
survival, the Templars had built
all of these cathedrals and all

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:84%
of these structures
across Europe,

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:38.010 align:middle line:84%
over 1,000 different
structures in 200 years.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.440 align:middle line:84%
And most people think of
the Templars as Knights

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
but they also had sea
captains, they had clerics,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:84%
they had farmers, and
they had stonemasons.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:10%
So it was very easy for them
to switch over into stonemason

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.570 align:middle line:10%
guilds in order to survive.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.730 align:middle line:84%
They already had the
ability as a stonemason

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.410 align:middle line:84%
to travel from one
place to another

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and so they just took on a
new identity in that regard.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.680 align:middle line:10%
And we know this
because, for example,

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:11.830 align:middle line:10%
the cathedral builders are
known as the "compagnons"

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.550 align:middle line:10%
within the French tradition, and
they're composed of two guilds.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
They're known as the
"children of Solomon"

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and the "children of
the master Jacques."

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, the children
of Solomon say

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.560 align:middle line:84%
they got their name from
the Poor Knights of Christ

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.130 align:middle line:84%
of the Temple of Solomon,
which was the Knights Templars.

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And the children of the
master Jacques said they got

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:84%
their name from the
master Jacques de Molay,

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:35.830 align:middle line:84%
the Grandmaster of
the Knights Templar.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So both of these guilds that
are responsible for building

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.640 align:middle line:84%
the cathedrals have
a common origin.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.560 align:middle line:10%
They say they trace
their origins back

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.760 align:middle line:10%
to the Knights Templar.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:10%
>> So it sounds to me like this
whole notion that the Templars

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.570 align:middle line:10%
disappeared into history, they
grew old and died and that was

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:10%
the end of it, is
anything but that.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.020 align:middle line:90%
In fact, it is the opposite.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And what I find the
most interesting

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:02.130 align:middle line:84%
is in the last 20
years or so, there

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:04.560 align:middle line:84%
has been so much new information
that has come forward

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:84%
that has shed light on the
darkness of this whole question

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:84%
of what happened to the Templars
after the suppression on Friday

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.180 align:middle line:90%
the 13th, 1307.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and we have to
remember the night before

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:20.010 align:middle line:84%
the suppression as well, there
was an entire fleet of Templar

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.420 align:middle line:90%
ships that disappeared.

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:25.620 align:middle line:84%
>> From the Port of La Rochelle
on the Western Coast of France,

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and disappeared
into history, right?

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:27.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:28.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Not hardly.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>> So where did they go?

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:31.740 align:middle line:90%
And who did they become?

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars started
going to all these places.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.130 align:middle line:84%
We know they went into London
in places like Royston Cave,

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:84%
but they also hung out in
different places in Scotland.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:84%
And do you want to
talk about that more?

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:84%
I mean, other than just the
battle with Robert the Bruce,

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.140 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there was
more going on there.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.807 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about what
the documents say.

00:11:49.807 --> 00:11:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, well, yes, we do have
some pretty important documents

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.650 align:middle line:90%
the Cremona document.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
We also have what we call
the Sinclair/Weems journals.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But within the Cremona
Document, we actually

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.210 align:middle line:84%
have a message
that was encrypted

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:07.810 align:middle line:84%
that we were able to decode
that talks about the order being

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:84%
made by Jacques de
Molay of preparing

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:90%
to get the treasures out.

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:15.520 align:middle line:84%
We've talked a lot about
where the Templars went

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.950 align:middle line:84%
but we didn't talk about
where the treasures went.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And we know the treasures
were sent North because we

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.210 align:middle line:90%
have a document that says so.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.060 align:middle line:10%
And the order was
actually given by de Molay

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.330 align:middle line:10%
according to this
message in 1304.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:10%
So this is consistent
with the thesis

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.550 align:middle line:10%
that you and I have
had for a long time,

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:10%
that the long range goal was the
new Atlantis in North America.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.480 align:middle line:90%
So they set the table early on.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.470 align:middle line:84%
But what the document says
is that three ships carrying

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:49.210 align:middle line:84%
gold, silver,
jewels, and something

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:90%
called the relic was taken.

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.640 align:middle line:84%
And the first stop when
they left La Rochelle

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:90%
was the Isle of Man.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And these three ships stopped
at three different ports

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:90%
which of course, is brilliant.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.920 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to put
all your eggs in one basket

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:84%
if there are French
ships waiting for you,

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:90%
you're screwed.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.050 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how long they were
but the message says they then

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.110 align:middle line:84%
went to the West Isle
in Northern Scotland.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, along the way, is a
place called the Isle of Arran.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And on the Isle of Arran is
a place called King's Caves.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.910 align:middle line:90%
And these caves are massive.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.430 align:middle line:90%
I visited them myself.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.860 align:middle line:10%
And what was very
interesting is that there

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.090 align:middle line:10%
are carvings on the inside
of interesting depictions.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.240 align:middle line:10%
There's one with two
hands going up in the air

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:10%
that we think is connected
with the symbol of Virgo.

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at the
constellation of Virgo,

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.660 align:middle line:84%
it looks like a goddess with
their hands up like this.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And the fish, the Christian
fish, the Vesica Pisces

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.600 align:middle line:84%
is carved in the cave,
there's a Christian cross

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:84%
that on the lower part has
ovaries on the lower side.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are
esoteric symbols.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.040 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing there.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, it seems to me this would
have been the perfect hiding

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.910 align:middle line:84%
place to put those treasures
for at least a short time.

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And directly across the bay
to the North on the Peninsula

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.790 align:middle line:84%
from the Isle of
Arran, and you can

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.520 align:middle line:84%
see when you look
out King's Cave

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:84%
is a Cistercian Abbey called
Saddle Abbey that today

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:90%
is in ruins.

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:24.850 align:middle line:84%
But there is a shelter
that Scotland heritage,

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:29.770 align:middle line:84%
the government has built and
they have about a dozen Templar

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.970 align:middle line:90%
grave slabs that are preserved.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.450 align:middle line:84%
So what it looks like is
when the Templars left

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:37.180 align:middle line:84%
the Isle of Man, they came
and brought the treasures

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.890 align:middle line:90%
to King's Cave.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:41.350 align:middle line:84%
And the Knights
stayed at an Abbey.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they got a
hotel right there.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Who they're already
associated with.

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Who they're already
associated with.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And so the other thing
that really to me

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
is a piece of evidence that
really helps support this idea,

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.090 align:middle line:84%
is that in the interpretive
materials at King's cave,

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.610 align:middle line:84%
it says that King
Robert the Bruce

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:05.710 align:middle line:84%
visited King's Caves three
months before October 13

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:90%
in 1307.

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.790 align:middle line:84%
What is he doing
visiting these caves?

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.588 align:middle line:84%
I think he was setting the
table for what he already

00:15:12.588 --> 00:15:13.630 align:middle line:90%
knew was going to happen.

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, for sure.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:15.530 align:middle line:90%
For sure.

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And what better allies
than the Templar Order

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:90%
who was used to severe--

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.410 align:middle line:84%
>> A fighting force, a
trained fighting force.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:23.930 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
But this was only the beginning
of the trail of the treasures.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.270 align:middle line:84%
They kept going West
and eventually they

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.042 align:middle line:90%
made it far to the West.

00:15:33.042 --> 00:15:34.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that was
always the goal, right?

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.042 align:middle line:90%
>> That was the goal all along.

00:15:36.042 --> 00:15:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> --to establish
the new Jerusalem,

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:40.940 align:middle line:84%
the new Atlantis and the
Americas and they had already

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:44.435 align:middle line:84%
established those connections
with the tribes in order to do

00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:45.235 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:15:45.235 --> 00:15:48.975 align:middle line:84%
>> And they also called it
the "Free Templar State,"

00:15:48.975 --> 00:15:49.775 align:middle line:90%
which I love.

00:15:49.775 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I agree.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.500 align:middle line:84%
So really, what
we're saying here

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
is this was not the end
of the Templar order.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.200 align:middle line:84%
It was just the end
of the Roman Catholic

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.960 align:middle line:90%
patronage of the Templar order.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.210 align:middle line:10%
And that the Templar
order continued

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:09.550 align:middle line:10%
to exist while crippled from
this horrible suppression,

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.100 align:middle line:10%
they already had
everything in place

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:10%
to establish this new land,
this new Atlantis to the West.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And they just, were going to
move forward from this point

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.145 align:middle line:84%
on without the Roman
Catholic patronage.

00:16:24.145 --> 00:16:27.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess the way we could
sum up Friday the 13th

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
and the suppression of
the Templars is that it

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.600 align:middle line:90%
wasn't the end.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.970 align:middle line:84%
It was just the
end of that chapter

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.535 align:middle line:84%
and it was the new beginning
of the next chapter.

00:16:36.535 --> 00:16:40.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, they rose strongly
like a phoenix in the--

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:41.650 align:middle line:90%
>> From the ashes.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.845 align:middle line:84%
>> From the ashes
of de Molay, yeah.

00:16:44.845 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:84%
