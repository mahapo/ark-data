I'm Timothy Hogan, grandmaster

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.110 align:middle line:84%
The Templars went
on to help establish

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
democratic governments and
revolutions around the world,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.830 align:middle line:84%
including in the United
States of America.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.380 align:middle line:90%
But it began in Europe.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The Templars, one of their
primary goals from the very

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:84%
beginning was to wrestle
power out of the hands

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.010 align:middle line:84%
of the monarchies and the
Church that were controlling

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.520 align:middle line:90%
everything at the time.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.690 align:middle line:10%
By setting up the first
banking systems of Europe,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.330 align:middle line:10%
this allowed them
to start to control

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:10%
some of the commerce,
which allowed them

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.520 align:middle line:10%
to wrestle some
of this power away

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.680 align:middle line:10%
from the Church
and the monarchy.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.460 align:middle line:84%
Even though this got them
in trouble in the long run.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But after their
suppression, they

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.860 align:middle line:84%
concerned themselves
with a number

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.550 align:middle line:84%
of revolutionary activities,
including the Peasants' Revolt

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.180 align:middle line:90%
in England.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that, they
had been involved

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.630 align:middle line:84%
in the creation
of the Magna Carta

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.580 align:middle line:84%
to try to give
the people rights.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:10%
And it was-- always been
fundamental doctrine

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:10%
because they recognized
that the human soul was

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:10%
connected to the Creator.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.040 align:middle line:84%
They recognized that everybody
was born with certain rights

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.250 align:middle line:84%
and should have the
freedom to express them.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Freedom of speech, freedom of
assembly, freedom of religion.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And this was
important to Templars

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
because they came from
all different backgrounds.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.690 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, this
had to culminate

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
into what was to become the
American Revolutionary War.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.890 align:middle line:90%
Things came to a head in 1776.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.270 align:middle line:84%
But before you can go to war,
you have to be prepared for it.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.430 align:middle line:90%
You have to have weaponry.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to have men,
too, to fight the war.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly,
you need money.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Now the Templars had
been keeping treasure

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:84%
that they had kept
over the years,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.790 align:middle line:84%
slowly bringing it
over to the New World.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Putting this treasure
in different vaults

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.480 align:middle line:84%
to be used for the creation of
a new Jerusalem, a new Atlantis,

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:90%
a new Templar state, eventually.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:84%
This was part of
the New Covenant.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.250 align:middle line:84%
So by 1770, things
were really ramping up.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:84%
>> It was time to evaluate the
treasure and figure out what

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.940 align:middle line:90%
needed to be used.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.840 align:middle line:90%
Isn't this right?

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Well that's right.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.670 align:middle line:10%
And we read that one
entry where Ben Franklin

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.530 align:middle line:10%
said those inspiring words to
motivate the 46 young men who

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:10%
were all Freemasons, the
six slaves, to go up and get

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.520 align:middle line:10%
those treasures.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, they did that, and
they brought them back.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And we actually have
a treasure list.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't mind, let's
see what this treasure is.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's
time to read this.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>> "July 14."

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:84%
You might remember the previous
entry I read was May 6.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
So this is a couple
of months later.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:90%
>> In 1770.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>> 1770.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:84%
"It has taken the
greater part of the day

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.450 align:middle line:84%
to transfer all the cargo up
the blank River to blank Island.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to give
away specific information.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:90%
I know you can appreciate that.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:10%
I was enlisted to
inventory the cargo,

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:10%
and it was placed
in the vault, and I

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:10%
was surprised at the amount
of treasure we had recovered.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:10%
In total, there are more
than 40 chests of coin.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:10%
25 gold crucifixes
of varying sizes.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:10%
12 menorah of varying sizes.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Numerous parchments
and paintings

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
kept in tubes of
crushed lime and clay.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
Only a few of them have
been opened to the weather,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.350 align:middle line:90%
and all seem in good repair.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:10%
There are also six arks of gold
and silver of varying sizes.

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Three heavily decorated with
filigree and winged creatures.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Four stone boxes that
contain remnants of bone."

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Ossuaries, perhaps?

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:84%
"A stone box of
broken stone tablets.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.190 align:middle line:90%
An emerald tablet."

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.750 align:middle line:90%
That rings a bell, doesn't it?

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, right back to
the alchemical tradition.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.400 align:middle line:84%
"Several bloodied swords
and lances, two of which

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.540 align:middle line:90%
are broken.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:84%
One stone box contains flasks
of mysterious substances.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But I am reluctant to ask
what magical solutions

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:90%
they contain."

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Alchemy?

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.420 align:middle line:84%
"Several casks of jewels and
numerous other gold and silver

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:90%
artifacts fill the empty space."

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:24.580 align:middle line:84%
Let me just finish
this last part.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.280 align:middle line:84%
"It was late in the evening
before we closed the door

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.570 align:middle line:84%
to the vault, which was
then sealed with mortar made

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.580 align:middle line:90%
of crushed lime and shells.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:84%
The entrance was then
covered with soil

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and made invisible to those
who know not where it lay.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.030 align:middle line:84%
A group of 10 and 14 masons--"
I might point out those numbers

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.030 align:middle line:84%
also appear on the Kensington
Runestone inscription,

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.820 align:middle line:84%
and they appear
within our rituals,

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:90%
"--encircled the tomb--"

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Thus implying that,
yeah, there are remains.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:84%
>> There are remains
there, exactly.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:04.730 align:middle line:84%
"--the tomb, and we blessed the
vault and asked Heavenly Father

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:84%
to bless and protect this place
against time and the ravages

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.370 align:middle line:90%
and greed of war."

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's something
else very interesting.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
They invoke the Holy Father
when it's associated with death.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Every other entry, when
they mention deity,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.280 align:middle line:90%
they talk about the goddess.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.530 align:middle line:84%
This is the only time the
Holy Father is mentioned.

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And the stage is
set at this point.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.230 align:middle line:90%
They have the treasure.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.880 align:middle line:84%
They know the
revolution is coming.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Ben Franklin was instrumental
in some of this planning

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:90%
and direction related to it.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, my great grandfather
several generations back,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.130 align:middle line:84%
General Joseph
Warren, got involved.

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
He was grandmaster at the
time, the first grandmaster

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.590 align:middle line:84%
of the forming in
the United States.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And he was also a martyr of
the American Revolutionary War.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But he initiated people
like Paul Revere.

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And he helped to organize
what was a little event known

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.640 align:middle line:84%
as the Boston Tea Party that
Saint Andrew's lodge was

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.790 align:middle line:84%
involved in pulling off
on that fateful evening.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:84%
Which led to what was to
become the Revolutionary War.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, it led to the
fighting to break out.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.670 align:middle line:84%
My great grandfather died at
the Battle of Bunker Hill.

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But it was at this point that
other Masons were stepping up

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.410 align:middle line:84%
to take the revolution
to the next level.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.340 align:middle line:10%
People like George
Washington, people

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.380 align:middle line:10%
like Lafayette,
Marquis de Lafayette.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:84%
>> All of these people
were Freemasons.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.080 align:middle line:90%
They were Templars.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:55.550 align:middle line:84%
And they were committed to
establishing this new republic.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.670 align:middle line:84%
We have to remember at
this transition period,

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Freemasonry really had
become this new expression

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.650 align:middle line:90%
of Templarism.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And it was a continuation
of the Templar tradition.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:14.580 align:middle line:84%
So while it was still veiled
somewhat as being masonry,

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.340 align:middle line:84%
ultimately this
was Templarism that

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.610 align:middle line:90%
was coming back to the fore.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:22.440 align:middle line:10%
And that would also explain
why they wanted Bonnie Prince

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.220 align:middle line:10%
Charlie to be the king
or the grandmaster

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:28.680 align:middle line:10%
until we had our
government figured out.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.860 align:middle line:90%
That makes perfect sense.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:30.930 align:middle line:90%
It all fits.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:31.730 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And even people like Randolph,
the very first president

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.850 align:middle line:84%
of the Continental
Congress, was a Mason.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>> They were all Masons.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was because they
were trying to establish

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.200 align:middle line:90%
this new free Templar state.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Now ultimately, we know that
the revolution was successful.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:10%
Out of this revolution
also included by 1775

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.610 align:middle line:10%
the establishment
of the Navy, what

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.980 align:middle line:10%
was going to become the
Navy of the United States.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.270 align:middle line:10%
John Paul Jones, who
founded the US Navy,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.880 align:middle line:10%
actually he was
also a Freemason.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:12.470 align:middle line:84%
He was known for being
a bit of a pirate and--

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Bit of a free
spirit, as it were.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And bringing in pirates--

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:84%
>> --who had been part of
this Templar free state nation

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.950 align:middle line:84%
on the seas to help out in
also forming the United States

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:90%
of America.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, think about it.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
form a navy, which

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:34.100 align:middle line:84%
is a military force, who better
than a maritime culture that

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:84%
was a military order
than the Templars

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.950 align:middle line:84%
or the Templar tradition that
continued on that John Paul

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.010 align:middle line:90%
Jones was part of?

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:41.973 align:middle line:90%
Sure makes sense to me.

00:09:41.973 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right, yeah.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.620 align:middle line:84%
And then other people
like Decatur and others

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.570 align:middle line:84%
who were an early
part of the Navy,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
they were, again, they
were all Freemasons.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:84%
There was a huge
influence from Scotland.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.730 align:middle line:90%
Help from Scotland.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And it proved
to be successful.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:84%
Now shortly after
this revolution,

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.090 align:middle line:84%
other revolutions
began around the world.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:04.118 align:middle line:90%
>> Like France, right?

00:10:04.118 --> 00:10:05.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Particularly
France, that's right.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And in France, it
should be pointed out

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
that the people who formed
the Encyclopedia of France

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.010 align:middle line:84%
during the revolution,
they were all Freemasons.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.980 align:middle line:84%
The Enlightenment philosophers,
including people like John

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:90%
Locke, were all Freemasons.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:84%
So this was all part of
this Templar movement.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:32.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's even said that
when the king was finally

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:84%
beheaded during the
French Revolution,

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:40.500 align:middle line:84%
someone jumped up on the stage,
took the blood from the king's

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:84%
head, flung it into
the audience and said,

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:84%
"Jacques de Molay,
thou art avenged."

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:10%
So this was really
the culmination

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.060 align:middle line:10%
of after the Templars had been
suppressed, them coming back

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.220 align:middle line:10%
and to reestablish themselves.

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:59.310 align:middle line:84%
This Templar free
state experiment

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.520 align:middle line:84%
with the base of operations
in the new Atlantis,

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.480 align:middle line:90%
the United States of America.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So these ideals and
these principles of freedom

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and individual rights, I don't
think we can overstate it

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.770 align:middle line:84%
enough, this is
what Templarism is.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But they weren't the
ones that created it.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:84%
This goes back to
Atlantis and beyond.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah this was
the old tradition.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.610 align:middle line:90%
It was just reestablishing it.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, there was
still pushback at this time.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:28.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, of course.

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> From the Roman
Church, from monarchies.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:84%
They recognized who
was behind this.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:39.120 align:middle line:10%
They started to create their own
propaganda against Freemasonry.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.360 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they even said that
this was the Templars coming

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.750 align:middle line:84%
back trying to destroy
the system that they

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.040 align:middle line:90%
were in charge of.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they were
right about that.

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>> They were right.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.550 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't just Freemasons.

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:90%
There were other groups.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Went under the name
of Rosicrucian.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Louis Claude de Saint-Martin
was another Templar initiate

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.030 align:middle line:84%
from around this time
period who established

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.340 align:middle line:84%
a branch of Templarism
called Martinism

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.940 align:middle line:84%
that had a huge influence
on the French Revolution.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:09.190 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, though,
particularly in France,

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.490 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot
of back and forth

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.280 align:middle line:84%
on what was happening in
this, which ultimately

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.730 align:middle line:90%
led to the rise of Napoleon.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.160 align:middle line:84%
We can't do this without
talking about Napoleon.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And also his relationship
with Thomas Jefferson.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, but let's talk
about his lineage, OK?

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Who were his parents
and grandparents?

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Where does that fall
into this story?

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So according to
Templar documentation,

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.650 align:middle line:84%
as you pointed out in
a previous episode,

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:47.270 align:middle line:84%
Bonnie Prince Charlie was
a Templar grandmaster.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:50.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he had been
offered the opportunity

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.340 align:middle line:90%
to be king of the United States.

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
He ultimately ended
up turning it down.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:13:01.100 align:middle line:84%
But his grandson-- illegitimate,
but still his grandson.

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:02.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Bonnie Prince
Charlie's grandson.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Bonnie Prince Charlie's
grandson was, in fact,

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Napoleon Bonaparte.

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:84%
And this was the
reason why he always

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%
claimed to be of good blood,
which is, in fact, what

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Bonaparte means.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Of good--

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.085 align:middle line:90%
>> Through the Stuart line.

00:13:16.085 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Through the
Stuart line, yeah.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So if this is the case,
which we know it to be,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Napoleon was, in fact--

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Stuart royalty from Scotland.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Does that mean he
would automatically be

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:30.460 align:middle line:84%
the grandmaster of the
Knights Templar as well?

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he certainly fought
his way into that position.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.520 align:middle line:84%
When he came to power, one
of the first things he did

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:84%
was he also married Josephine,
who was a Merovingian princess.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have to remember
that the Merovingians, which

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.870 align:middle line:84%
were the royal line of France,
they trace their history back.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And it has been suggested that
part of their bloodline lineage

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:84%
was part of this bloodline
tied to Mary Magdalene

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.380 align:middle line:90%
and to Jesus--

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And John the
Baptist, of course.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.210 align:middle line:90%
>> And John the Baptist.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:10%
And even before that,
the Merovingians

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.840 align:middle line:10%
had a legend of having come
to the shores of France

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:10%
from the sea.

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And this seemed to be
pointing to the Atlantean--

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I was going to say, this
is the Atlantean story that we

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.760 align:middle line:90%
talked about earlier.

00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.480 align:middle line:10%
In fact, even the Merovingian
symbol is the fleur-de-lis.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is a three-pronged
flower which really gets its

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
shape from the trident, which
was the symbol of Poseidon,

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:84%
the God of Atlantis,
according to Plato.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well what's also interesting
about the fleur-de-lis is

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:84%
it's also symbolically
representing the bee, right?

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And the bee is very
important in Templarism.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Cistercians'
symbol is the beehive,

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and that was picked by
Bernard de Clairvaux.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was supposed to
symbolically represent

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:00.030 align:middle line:84%
the bees that are working
together in honor of the queen

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.990 align:middle line:90%
bee, right.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:10%
The Cistercian monks
were all working

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.850 align:middle line:10%
within the monastery
for the goddess

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:10%
that they venerated, right?

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's a beautiful analogy.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:12.100 align:middle line:84%
But as it turns out, it's
much older than we thought.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:12.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, even the Templar Grand
Commander in Constantinople

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
that Hughes de Payens
and Godfrey de Saint-Omer

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.050 align:middle line:84%
had been initiated in the
foundation of the order,

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.580 align:middle line:90%
was built like a giant beehive.

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.410 align:middle line:84%
So this was an old
concept going way back

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that was being reinstituted
by the time of Napoleon.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.230 align:middle line:10%
Now what most people don't
realize about Napoleon

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:41.140 align:middle line:10%
is after this he
declared himself

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.340 align:middle line:10%
the head of all Masonic
lodges, in France,

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:48.700 align:middle line:10%
he declared himself as
an honorary grandmaster.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:84%
He was largely
recognized as such.

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And then Napoleon
began his campaign.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.330 align:middle line:84%
The first thing he did was he
went and he raided the Vatican.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, the Vatican.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Napoleon had already
raided the Vatican archives.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.750 align:middle line:84%
He brought them
all back to France.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:06.500 align:middle line:84%
They were brought
to Saint-Sulpice.

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:07.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>> In Paris.

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And specifically, he
set up certain people.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:16.810 align:middle line:84%
He put them in charge to
look for Templar documents

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.740 align:middle line:90%
above everything.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is part of what
he was looking for.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why he
was looking for it is he

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:84%
knew that the order had
preserved information

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.630 align:middle line:84%
about an advanced
civilization previously,

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.570 align:middle line:84%
the pre-Diluvian
civilization of Atlantis.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And that this information
had been stowed away.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.180 align:middle line:84%
And when the Templar
order was suppressed,

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:43.270 align:middle line:84%
a large amount of it was
captured by the Vatican.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah.

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.957 align:middle line:84%
So he was just taking back
what was already ours, right?

00:16:46.957 --> 00:16:48.790 align:middle line:84%
>> He was taking back
what was already ours.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, he knew
he needed to go to Malta.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:84%
The Knights of Malta
was the new face

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.810 align:middle line:84%
for the Knights'
Hospitaller, which

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:84%
had been one of the enemies
of the Templars back

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.650 align:middle line:90%
during the Crusades.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:06.160 align:middle line:84%
Napoleon knew he could get
the remaining documents

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:11.109 align:middle line:84%
that he needed from Malta if he
was to go to that headquarters.

00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:14.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So going through these
documents that he took from

00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:15.010 align:middle line:90%
the Vatican--

00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, I think you said
he recopied them and then gave

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:18.880 align:middle line:90%
them back, right?

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct, yeah.

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:20.485 align:middle line:90%
>> I think that's fair to say.

00:17:20.485 --> 00:17:20.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> This must have led him-- what
he learned in those documents--

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:90%
to Egypt.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:84%
And isn't he the one that
discovered the Rosetta Stone?

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, one of the most
important artifacts

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:90%
ever discovered.

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.970 align:middle line:84%
From there, I mean,
he did go to Egypt.

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:38.030 align:middle line:84%
He brought his savants with
him to catalog everything

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.370 align:middle line:84%
they could possibly
find in Egypt.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And by 1799, Napoleon
himself was initiated

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.400 align:middle line:90%
in the Great Pyramid--

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>> During a special Templar
initiation ceremony that had

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.930 align:middle line:84%
been being practiced
since ancient times.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's still
practiced to this day

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.450 align:middle line:90%
within the Great Pyramid itself.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.030 align:middle line:84%
After he arose from
this experience,

00:18:05.030 --> 00:18:08.000 align:middle line:84%
it's recorded people asked
him, "Well, what happened?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.710 align:middle line:84%
What happened when
you were in there?"

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And his response was,
"You wouldn't believe me

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.380 align:middle line:90%
even if I told you."

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.950 align:middle line:90%
That was the end of it.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:84%
But he brought all of that
knowledge back to France,

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:25.100 align:middle line:84%
to reestablish France as
this new Democratic Republic

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.320 align:middle line:90%
with him as emperor.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Now around this same time in
the United States of America,

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.700 align:middle line:84%
the New Republic
was getting going.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.940 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson had
become president.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Thomas Jefferson was also an
initiate of this tradition.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Thomas Jefferson, was he
a Mason, or was he a Templar?

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.090 align:middle line:90%
Was he both?

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.200 align:middle line:90%
>> He was both.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And not only that,
but there were

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.280 align:middle line:84%
certain Rosicrucian
ciphers that were

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.010 align:middle line:90%
found in his private writings.

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:58.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So what's this famous
phrase that's in his monument

00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.320 align:middle line:90%
in Washington, DC?

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.370 align:middle line:84%
He says, "I have sworn on the
altar of God eternal hostility

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:09.070 align:middle line:84%
against every form of tyranny
over the mind of man."

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, first of all, we
need to ask what altar of God

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:90%
is he swearing on?

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:16.200 align:middle line:84%
The only organizations
that have altars of God

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
that people swear at are Templar
based organizations, first

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.750 align:middle line:84%
of all, which is the first
clue that he's a Templar.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.870 align:middle line:84%
>> But secondly, that
mission that he is stating is

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.280 align:middle line:90%
the mission of the Templars.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:90%
It always has been.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:84%
So he was intimately
connected to all this.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, we
should not be surprised

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:10%
that it was Jefferson who in
turn purchased the Louisiana

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.570 align:middle line:10%
Purchase from Napoleon.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:90%
>> From Napoleon.

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:84%
He negotiated a
pretty good deal.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.795 align:middle line:10%
Wasn't the purchase price
somewhere around $2.5 million?

00:19:48.795 --> 00:19:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, something like that.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.520 align:middle line:84%
Napoleon had his rise to
power and was falling.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Some people say that
there was concern

00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:00.150 align:middle line:84%
Napoleon was going to invade
the United States eventually.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
There's really no
evidence of that.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:08.490 align:middle line:84%
But definitely that property
was purchased by Jefferson.

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And at least according to
the temple of tradition,

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:15.750 align:middle line:84%
he purchased it to secure
certain vaults that

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:90%
contained these holy treasures.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
The first thing he
did was he sent out

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:25.810 align:middle line:84%
two explorers, one who was a
Mason at the time, Meriwether

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:26.610 align:middle line:90%
Lewis.

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Clark was not a
Mason at the time.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.730 align:middle line:90%
He would later become one.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But here's the interesting
thing that ties Lewis and Clark

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:35.640 align:middle line:84%
to these secret vaults
that you mentioned

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.160 align:middle line:84%
that obviously
Napoleon knew about as

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.720 align:middle line:90%
well as our Founding Fathers.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.133 align:middle line:90%
And I would argue--

00:20:41.133 --> 00:20:43.050 align:middle line:84%
although we're not going
to find this anywhere

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle line:84%
and it's not going to
be anywhere because they

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.390 align:middle line:90%
don't want us to know this.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:50.910 align:middle line:84%
But I believe that the primary
mission of Meriwether Lewis

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.300 align:middle line:84%
was not just to check
out the land, make it

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:84%
to the West Coast, but also
to secure the location--

00:20:58.740 --> 00:20:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Of one of the vaults?

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.130 align:middle line:84%
>> --Of one of the vaults
that were not disturbed.

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Because on the way back--

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:84%
and I think it was
in July of 1806--

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:11.710 align:middle line:84%
he split off from Clark
and part of the party

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.620 align:middle line:90%
and went with nine brothers.

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.990 align:middle line:84%
They were all
Freemasons, and he was

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:19.410 align:middle line:84%
the 10th, 10 being the number
of perfection in Freemasonry.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And they diverted up the
Little Big Fork River.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.810 align:middle line:10%
And they crossed the
Continental Divide,

00:21:24.810 --> 00:21:28.110 align:middle line:10%
which is apparently where
one of the secret vaults is.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And you and I are both
aware of this location.

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:33.250 align:middle line:90%
And this is right in that area.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
But for those four days when
he was crossing the Continental

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Divide, those pages of his
personal journal are missing.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.020 align:middle line:84%
But later on six weeks
later, he rejoined with Clark

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.030 align:middle line:90%
and then they finished the trip.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think at the end of the
day, if you look at the tenants

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.720 align:middle line:84%
in our Constitution, like
freedom of religion, right--

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of the
fundamental tenets.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Freedom of speech, right.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:03.570 align:middle line:84%
And freedom from the tyranny
of the monarchs of Europe.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:06.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you don't have to
think hard at all to see

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:90%
where all of this came from.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:12.180 align:middle line:84%
This is an outgrowth of the
persecution and destruction

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.570 align:middle line:90%
of the Templar order.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, the supposed
destruction of the order.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:84%
But yet, just like
that phoenix that

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.530 align:middle line:84%
rises from the
ashes of de Molay,

00:22:22.530 --> 00:22:27.720 align:middle line:84%
it survived and now it thrived
in the founding of the United

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.040 align:middle line:90%
States of America.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.540 align:middle line:84%
But the big question is now,
do people really understand

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:35.460 align:middle line:90%
that in this country today?

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And is this republic
going to hold together?

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Is this great experiment
that our Masonic brothers,

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:47.850 align:middle line:84%
our Templar brothers, going back
270 years, whatever it is now,

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.810 align:middle line:90%
is it going to hold?

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:50.650 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:51.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Time will tell.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:53.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Time will tell.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for joining us
