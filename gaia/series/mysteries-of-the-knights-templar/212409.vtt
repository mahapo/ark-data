00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:84%
When the Templars were
forced underground

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.160 align:middle line:84%
during the years 1307 to
1314, various other orders

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.360 align:middle line:84%
were established to
continue the Templar work.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and this was a very
important time in the history

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:84%
of the Templars, in the
history of establishing the new

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis or United
States of America.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.550 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
important that we also

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:84%
want to track the
movement of the treasures

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:84%
that we know went to
King's Cave in Scotland.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And what happened after
that we're pretty sure

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.660 align:middle line:90%
is it moved east.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Eventually getting
to Wemyss Caves.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:84%
But the myths, the
legends, and the evidence

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.910 align:middle line:84%
suggests that the
treasures spent some time

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
at Kilwinning Abbey,
which we now call Lodge 0,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.690 align:middle line:90%
right, at Kilwinning.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So we think it went there
and then eventually would

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
make its way to
the Firth of Forth

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:90%
on the east side of Scotland.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And on the northern side of the
Firth, we have Wemyss Caves.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.990 align:middle line:10%
And this is where the
treasures were hidden,

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:10%
and this is where the actual
Templars and their descendants

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.600 align:middle line:10%
were protected by the Scottish
earls for almost 80 years.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.480 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back to 1314 and
you talked about Bannockburn,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:84%
this is a very important
event in this whole story

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:84%
because, as you said, the
Scots had been excommunicated

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:84%
and Robert the Bruce was
more than happy to take

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:84%
on this excellent
fighting force that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.230 align:middle line:84%
helped turn the
tide at Bannockburn

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
and really establish
things for not just

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:84%
Scotland, but for these
fugitive Templars.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And because they had
served, the Scottish earls

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.060 align:middle line:84%
were really indebted
to protect them.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
what they did.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So you've got the
Wemyss clan, and you

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
have the Sinclair clan that's
playing a dominant role

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.700 align:middle line:90%
in this history.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.300 align:middle line:10%
And as it turns out,
there are a group

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.800 align:middle line:10%
of journals that actually
came to me in 2016 that we

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:10%
have been vetting ever since.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:84%
But what is written
in those early books

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.990 align:middle line:84%
by Earl Henry Sinclair
is the details

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%
about exactly what
happened to those treasures

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.520 align:middle line:84%
during this time that it
stayed in Scotland until they

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.830 align:middle line:84%
were ready to bring
the treasures over

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.480 align:middle line:90%
to North America.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Earl Henry brought eight
ships twice, once in 1395,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:90%
once in 1398.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
And not only did they
bring those treasures

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.020 align:middle line:84%
and hide them in multiple
places in North America,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:90%
primarily in Nova Scotia and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>> The New Scotland.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The New Scotland, and
including Oak Island,

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:84%
but this was part
of a tradition,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:84%
something that was the ultimate
goal of establishing the new

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Atlantis, what they
called at that time,

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.640 align:middle line:90%
a free Templar state.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into the
details more about this.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:84%
But it's an amazing hundreds
of years long project

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:90%
to establish this new Jerusalem.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And that project was
called the Covenant.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So this Covenant was maintained
within a very secretive group

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.910 align:middle line:84%
of families and people that were
members of the Templar Order

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.890 align:middle line:84%
and the order that
grew out of that

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and actually morphed
into modern Freemasonry.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:84%
>> This was a critical
point in the shift,

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:84%
where one of the expressions
that the Templars had

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.320 align:middle line:90%
to survive in was Freemasonry.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.330 align:middle line:84%
If you recall, the Templars
had an entire building force

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.510 align:middle line:84%
of masons, along
with everything,

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.670 align:middle line:84%
practical masons versus
speculative masons.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Templar
rules of the 1200s talk

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
about how the only people
allowed to wear gloves

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.470 align:middle line:84%
in the Templar Order are the
priests and the stonemasons

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Templar Order.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.070 align:middle line:84%
But what ended up happening
was as they went underground,

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:84%
they already were surviving
in these stonemason guilds.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And at somewhere along the
line, those stonemason guilds

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.080 align:middle line:84%
started to become
more speculative.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:84%
They were able to
hide the tradition

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:90%
through Freemason symbology.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of made sense when
you look at the main working

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:90%
tools of a mason at the time.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:84%
You had the plumb, the
square, and the level.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, the plumb dealt
with verticals, the level

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.360 align:middle line:90%
dealt with horizontals.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.680 align:middle line:84%
>> And the square
united the two.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.420 align:middle line:84%
This literally gives you the
geometry of the Templar cross.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:90%
>> The Templar cross.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so it was an
easy place to hide it.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And then speculative
Freemasonry became

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:84%
one of the main and
most important bodies

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.910 align:middle line:84%
for preserving this
Templar tradition.

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it had to go that
way when you think about it

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.290 align:middle line:84%
because think of
what they're doing.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.960 align:middle line:84%
This is a very, very
dangerous mission,

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.790 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to know
who's on your side.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And Freemasonry and
the sign, symbols,

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:84%
and tokens, the
signs of recognition

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.400 align:middle line:84%
that we still use to this
day is purely symbolic today.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:84%
But back then, it was literally
a matter of life and death.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.210 align:middle line:84%
So when you gave a
handshake to somebody,

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.420 align:middle line:84%
you're going to do something
and he'd better give it back,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:90%
or he's not on your side.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And he better have the
right dialogue as well.

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, right.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>> And this all came from
the earlier Templar tradition

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.890 align:middle line:90%
of transporting money.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.180 align:middle line:84%
You could deposit money
in Scotland, for example,

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
within the Templar commandery,
travel to Jerusalem,

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.365 align:middle line:84%
give the right forms of
recognition and dialogue--

00:06:41.365 --> 00:06:42.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And the passwords.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.820 align:middle line:84%
>> --and the right passwords,
and then they would be able

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.650 align:middle line:84%
to retrieve money for you in
Jerusalem that you could then

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:48.450 align:middle line:90%
use.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:84%
This way, you wouldn't
be robbed on your way

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.653 align:middle line:90%
from Europe to Jerusalem--

00:06:52.653 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Carrying a bunch of cash.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>> --carrying a bunch of cash.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is really how part of
how the Templar Order initially

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.680 align:middle line:90%
became wealthy.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But after the suppression
of the Templar Order,

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:84%
it became a very
useful tool in order

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.370 align:middle line:84%
to hide and figure out
who your friends were

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:90%
and places you could go.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:15.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So this became a critical
device, if you will,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.360 align:middle line:84%
that allowed this whole
mission, this covenant

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.960 align:middle line:90%
to actually take place.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So what's really interesting
about these journals,

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:84%
though called the
Sinclair Wemyss journals

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.640 align:middle line:90%
is a total of 20 books.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:34.210 align:middle line:84%
There are 13 that
are written in Latin,

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.490 align:middle line:84%
2 that are written
in Old English,

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:84%
and the last 5 are
written in modern English.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And they span a time
period from the first entry

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:90%
to the last of 417 years.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is this critical period
when really the groundwork

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:84%
was laid for what would
eventually become the United

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.120 align:middle line:90%
States of America.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's really beautiful
how some of the entries

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:58.360 align:middle line:90%
are crafted.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:10%
But there's two things
that are omnipresent

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:02.980 align:middle line:10%
throughout these journals.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:84%
One is that this was
a secret mission.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.520 align:middle line:84%
It was of the utmost
importance and everybody

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.290 align:middle line:84%
had to guard the
mission with their life.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.010 align:middle line:84%
The other thing was--
is that they constantly

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:20.000 align:middle line:84%
referenced the goddess, who
was blessing and protecting

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:84%
this work, and everything
was done in her honor.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is an
outgrowth as we talked

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:28.940 align:middle line:84%
about earlier of the true
ideology of the Templars

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.880 align:middle line:84%
and the ideology of
the Indigenous people,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.820 align:middle line:84%
who were their brothers
on the other side,

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:84%
that not only they
met with, but helped

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
them bury those treasures,
and probably, more

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:84%
importantly, for
the next 400 years,

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:90%
they guarded those treasures.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.110 align:middle line:84%
So eventually, when
we get to the point

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.480 align:middle line:84%
that the treasures
were recovered and used

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle line:84%
to fund the revolution,
it's not only important

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.260 align:middle line:84%
that people nowadays
understand the important role

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.560 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars played
in American history,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.050 align:middle line:84%
but that the Scottish
earls played,

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.720 align:middle line:90%
but the Native Americans played.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of the Templar mission
from the beginning was this

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:84%
idea of a free state even
before they were suppressed.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
I mean, in Wolfram von
Eschenbach's "Parzival"

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:84%
from the 1200s,
specifically says,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:84%
"If any Templar who were the
grail guardians in this story--

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:27.020 align:middle line:84%
if any Templar should become
ruler of a foreign peoples,

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.450 align:middle line:84%
let him ensure that they
are given their rights.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was a completely
foreign concept of the day.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, previously, your rights
only came from the church

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.560 align:middle line:90%
or from the monarchy.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And here's a document
from the 1200s saying, no,

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.830 align:middle line:84%
people have God-given
rights they're born with.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And that the Templar's
job is to ensure that this is

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:55.050 align:middle line:90%
celebrated and protected.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:84%
They did the Peasants'
Revolt in England.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:90%
They helped out with that.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.430 align:middle line:84%
They were instrumental
in creating the Magna

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Carta in Britain, so that there
would be rights for the people.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And now, as they're
moving to the New World,

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
the final stage
of their mission,

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:84%
in order to create a new
Templar state that was free,

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.260 align:middle line:84%
that had these states, could
start to be accomplished.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And tied to this, of course,
was that whole Gnostic concept

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.770 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars were
perpetuating-- the idea

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that the sacred flame,
the inner spirit that's

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.340 align:middle line:84%
connected with the
creator's within everybody.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So, therefore, we
should celebrate that.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:90%
The spirit of god is within you.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Or the power of god.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The power of
god is within you.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.620 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
>> That's one of the anagrams
and cipher phrases that is used

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:47.540 align:middle line:84%
in some of the secret messages
in the Cremona document.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And I find that
very apropos, right?

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've been saying
that throughout the series.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And then we find out
that it was so important.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.980 align:middle line:90%
It was used as a cipher phrase.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:01.130 align:middle line:10%
And I'm sure they did that
for superstitious reasons

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:05.180 align:middle line:10%
as well or reasons to
pick a phrase like this

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle line:10%
to honor and protect
these sacred messages.

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, so now, let's
fast forward a little bit

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:84%
because the treasures are moved
over here to North America.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.690 align:middle line:84%
The groundwork is starting to be
laid for a free Templar state.

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:25.960 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
finally break off

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.900 align:middle line:84%
the husk of the Old
World, as it were,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.720 align:middle line:84%
we needed to ultimately,
unfortunately,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.280 align:middle line:90%
have a revolution.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.770 align:middle line:84%
And that costs a
lot of money, right?

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.860 align:middle line:84%
The Templars had also
established the Kingdom

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:90%
of Portugal at the time.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.100 align:middle line:84%
They had somewhat autonomy
there because when the Templar

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Order was suppressed in 1307
throughout the rest of Europe,

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:52.720 align:middle line:84%
except for Scotland, the only
other place where they weren't

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:84%
suppressed was in
Portugal because they

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
had established the Port
of the Grail, The Portugal,

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.070 align:middle line:90%
this kingdom.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And it was a seafaring
base of operations.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:06.260 align:middle line:90%
So it made a lot of sense.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.070 align:middle line:84%
They just changed their name
to the Knights of Christ.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:90%
They became a seafaring nation.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Magellan, being one of the
most famous Knights of Christ,

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:90%
who sailed all over the world.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Southern tip of
South America, right?

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:22.760 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:26.180 align:middle line:10%
And ultimately, there
were these other ships

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:10%
that had escaped
from La Rochelle that

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:10%
involved hiding these artifacts
and hiding Templars, when

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.270 align:middle line:10%
really, this was the start
as well of the whole pirate

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:10%
tradition.

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:41.090 align:middle line:10%
>> And the privateers.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.780 align:middle line:10%
>> And the privateers, right?

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.710 align:middle line:84%
This would be a good point to
talk about the pirate flag--

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:90%
the skull and crossbones.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.990 align:middle line:84%
It really starts
with understanding

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:84%
the ossuary culture of the
First Century of Jesus and Mary

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene and John the Baptist
and their Essenic sect.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.850 align:middle line:84%
But basically, what happened
is when somebody died,

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:09.810 align:middle line:84%
only the family of the deceased
could process the body.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And so what they would do is
they would take the deceased

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:90%
into an underground chamber--

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:19.340 align:middle line:84%
a family tomb, if you will, that
was comprised of two spaces.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.620 align:middle line:84%
One was called the
antechamber that

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.030 align:middle line:90%
was open to the southern sky.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they
would perform rituals.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:30.320 align:middle line:84%
They would anoint the body
with perfumes and oil.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And then they would
wrap it in a shroud.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Then they would
take the body and go

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.360 align:middle line:84%
inside a small door at the
back of the antechamber

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:84%
into the burial chamber,
the second room.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:84%
And inside there,
cut into the walls,

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:84%
were benches that they
would put the body on.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And they would leave it
there for one to two years.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Then they would come back
and collect the bones.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Bring it back into
the antechamber.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And then they would put the
desiccated body-- the bones--

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.820 align:middle line:84%
inside a bone box, that
was only big enough so

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:04.220 align:middle line:84%
that the two largest
bones in the body--

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.950 align:middle line:84%
the femurs-- would
fit in crossed.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the skull
would go in last.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And now you know the origin
of the skull and cross bones.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
At that point, they
would take the ossuary,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:84%
go back into the burial chamber,
and underneath those ledges

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:90%
that were cut-- those benches--

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:90%
were tunnels called kuhim.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is where they
would take the ossuaries,

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
put a stone lid in, put
it inside these tunnels,

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
and that's where you would
be interred in perpetuity

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.190 align:middle line:90%
inside the family tomb.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's the origin of
the skull and crossbones.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:40.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and related to
that with the cross femurs

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:46.250 align:middle line:84%
in the heraldry of this time
period of the 1200s through

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:90%
the 1300s.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:52.110 align:middle line:10%
When a Templar served in the
Holy Land, when he was buried,

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:55.350 align:middle line:10%
he was buried with an effigy of
himself with his legs crossed.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:56.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Legs crossed.

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:15:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And the legs being crossed
was a symbol that he had served

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:90%
in the Holy Land.

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.470 align:middle line:84%
So the Templars as
they were suppressed,

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.650 align:middle line:84%
they were killed
off, or at least they

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.090 align:middle line:90%
tried to kill them off.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.410 align:middle line:84%
This new symbol became a
perfect symbol for saying, hey,

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:90%
we're still around.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:84%
We're the people from Jerusalem
who served in Jerusalem.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And we're transporting
this history.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Some have also looked to it as
the skull and crossbones are

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.510 align:middle line:84%
very similar, as well,
to the symbol of the chi

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:32.270 align:middle line:84%
rho, the Greek
letters chi and rho,

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.210 align:middle line:84%
which stood for
Cristos that you find

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.210 align:middle line:84%
within the Christian
iconography.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.630 align:middle line:84%
And so it all ties in, and
it made a perfect symbol

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.600 align:middle line:84%
for the Order, as it was
trying to reinvent itself.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, as they became
pirates, they

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.510 align:middle line:84%
created their own
seafaring nation.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:54.020 align:middle line:84%
They had their own
democratic system out at sea.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.980 align:middle line:84%
There was an elected
captain, usually.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:90%
There were wardens.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:84%
There were stewards, the
officers within the ship.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of sounds like a
Masonic lodge, doesn't it?

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.680 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the Order
began to attack back

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:84%
at the countries that
had suppressed them

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.050 align:middle line:84%
in order to try to get
some of their wealth back.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.200 align:middle line:84%
>> We know that the skull
and crossbones was used.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.620 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the First
Century and Jesus and Mary

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene and all that.

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.230 align:middle line:90%
But what's the connection?

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a bloodline
that came out of them, correct?

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And out of that
bloodline, this lineage

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.880 align:middle line:84%
was a group of people who were
preserving these mysteries--

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.800 align:middle line:84%
these mysteries that
went back to Atlantis,

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
had gone through places
like Egypt, Jerusalem.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the Templar
Order became a repository

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and a protector
of these mysteries

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:51.170 align:middle line:84%
and of this bloodline
of people who

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.150 align:middle line:90%
were preserving the tradition.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And this became a
perfect symbol going back

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:90%
to that point in time.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So the treasures are
sitting over in North America.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:84%
They were brought
over and checked on

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.920 align:middle line:90%
by these Scottish families.

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a very interesting
story that a lot of people

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.940 align:middle line:84%
don't know in the lead
up to the revolution,

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.430 align:middle line:84%
when these treasures would
eventually be recovered.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.890 align:middle line:84%
And that was the
Battle of Culloden

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:24.480 align:middle line:84%
in Scotland, where the
Jacobites who were thought

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.400 align:middle line:90%
to be Roman Catholic.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.220 align:middle line:84%
But when you go back
and look at King James,

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.410 align:middle line:90%
he was actually quite tolerant.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:35.340 align:middle line:84%
Even though he was
supposedly a Roman Catholic,

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.450 align:middle line:84%
he didn't care about what
religions people were, right?

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:43.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And he gave great patronage
to the Masonic systems that

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:90%
were developing at that time.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Bonnie Prince Charlie who
was the one that was the heir

00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.300 align:middle line:84%
to the throne, that
got kicked out,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and was the leader
of the Jacobites.

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:56.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people
don't know this,

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:84%
but Bonnie Prince
Charlie was actually,

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.250 align:middle line:84%
six months before
Culloden, in 1746,

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.090 align:middle line:84%
was made the grandmaster
of the Knights Templar.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.100 align:middle line:84%
But here's the part
of the story that

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
is fascinating that very
few people know about.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:14.490 align:middle line:84%
As we were in the lead
up to the revolution,

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
George Washington
sent a contingent

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:84%
of three men, Freemasons, to
go meet with Bonnie Prince

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.600 align:middle line:84%
Charlie, to offer
him the kingship

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.120 align:middle line:84%
of the new republic had we
won the war with the Brits.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:28.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, he refused.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:90%
And as it turns out--

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, he was felt--

00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:35.130 align:middle line:84%
because he felt he
was too old and he

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
didn't have an heir and that
could cause the whole thing

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.150 align:middle line:90%
to fail.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, and as it turns out
after the revolution when they

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:46.410 align:middle line:10%
won the war, and I
believe it was in 1782,

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:50.580 align:middle line:10%
another contingent was sent by
George Washington to see Bonnie

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.210 align:middle line:10%
Prince Charlie again and offer
the kingship to him again.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:10%
And they had already won.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
But, again, he turned
them down and eventually,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.880 align:middle line:90%
died a few years later.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It was purely a
symbolic gesture, right?

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:06.460 align:middle line:84%
They knew he wasn't going to
live long, as it turns out.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.220 align:middle line:84%
It took a while for us to
finalize our government.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So we weren't really ready
to become the republic

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:90%
we eventually would.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:17.050 align:middle line:84%
But the other reason is
installing Bonnie Prince

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Charlie, who people
didn't realize

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.440 align:middle line:84%
was the grand master of the
Knights Templar, symbolically,

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.630 align:middle line:84%
that's a very
powerful statement,

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:28.990 align:middle line:84%
as well as putting
back into power

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:33.130 align:middle line:84%
the kingship of the guy who had
been defeated by the British

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that we just defeated
in the revolution.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.060 align:middle line:90%
So that was a big--

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:38.860 align:middle line:90%
to them.

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the
buildup to all that

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:84%
with the Revolutionary
War, war costs money.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:51.820 align:middle line:10%
>> And fortunately, there had
been assets put away over this

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.940 align:middle line:10%
long period of time that had
been brought over to be used

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:10%
specifically to bring about this
new Templar nation as needed.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And you're exactly right.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.810 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, this
covenant of coming,

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:07.590 align:middle line:84%
once with your father, once
with your son, tradition,

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:11.980 align:middle line:84%
to check on the treasures
ended with the last person

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:13.840 align:middle line:84%
to write in the
journals was a guy

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.360 align:middle line:84%
by the name of John
Wemyss We call him junior

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.340 align:middle line:90%
because his father was senior.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:21.490 align:middle line:90%
May 6, 1770.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:10%
My father having been raised
to the status of Master

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.280 align:middle line:10%
Mason in the 46th
British Regiment,

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.650 align:middle line:10%
presided over the meeting,
which was attended

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:33.550 align:middle line:10%
by William Ball of
Philadelphia and Benjamin

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:38.240 align:middle line:10%
Franklin, the former provincial
grand master of Pennsylvania.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we weren't
a country yet.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:90%
There were no states.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So the brethren gathered
in the schoolhouse.

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And for three hours
were impressed upon

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.530 align:middle line:84%
by the presiding brethren the
importance of their mission.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:53.110 align:middle line:84%
We were each divided
into groups of five

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.960 align:middle line:84%
and told to embrace each
other in the coming journey,

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and to learn to trust and
depend upon each other

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:84%
as it would become vitally
important in our task.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:84%
The presiding brethren also
imparted their knowledge

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:84%
of current political
events and told us

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.300 align:middle line:84%
that it was important that
the Templar treasure find

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:84%
its way back to the Grand Lodge
to assist in the upcoming war.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.500 align:middle line:90%
There you have it right there.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.400 align:middle line:84%
We would soon lose control of
the territory in Nova Scotia.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And the brethren
feared it would be lost

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:30.610 align:middle line:90%
if not retrieved straight away.

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:32.940 align:middle line:10%
They also reiterated
that secrecy

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.910 align:middle line:10%
was of the utmost important
and that we would always

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.850 align:middle line:10%
be surrounded by British
troops and subjects who

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:10%
might report our every move.

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Brother Franklin reminded
us that no matter

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.150 align:middle line:84%
what our political or
religious leanings,

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:52.110 align:middle line:84%
our loyalty to the brethren
was most important.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.590 align:middle line:84%
We must honor our commitment
and remember our vows

00:21:55.590 --> 00:22:00.520 align:middle line:84%
or the burgeoning nation of free
men might never come to pass.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.850 align:middle line:84%
After a brief supper was
served and prayers were said,

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:84%
we left to return to
our bunks at Abington,

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:11.080 align:middle line:84%
knowing that the future of
the nation lay in our hands.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.510 align:middle line:10%
I prayed that I would
be a capable leader

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:15.550 align:middle line:10%
and said as much to my father.

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
He responded that
leaders are not born.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.930 align:middle line:90%
They are created.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
The Lord would guide
me in my journey.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:84%
I must only have faith
in him as he does in me.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Father made the sign of a cross
on my forehead with his thumb

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.260 align:middle line:90%
and gave me his blessing.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.790 align:middle line:90%
I leave with a lighter heart.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.760 align:middle line:90%
This guy is 28 years old.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And he's leading this group
of 46 men and 6 slaves.

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So these six slaves were
to be given their freedom

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.990 align:middle line:84%
after completing this
mission, of helping

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:51.110 align:middle line:84%
recover those treasures
to found this nation.

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:55.280 align:middle line:84%
They need to be honored
and remembered too.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Benjamin Franklin
in his own words--

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:84%
this is one of those
secret meetings that

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:04.130 align:middle line:90%
was attended by all Freemasons.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is the lead
up to the revolution.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And it was the money
that they needed.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Estimates I've seen say
that there was $160 million

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.480 align:middle line:84%
that was spent on the
American Revolution.

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But only 60 million of
it can be accounted for.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:23.090 align:middle line:84%
The big question is, where
did the rest of that money

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.770 align:middle line:90%
come from?

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:30.590 align:middle line:84%
This was a Freemasonic mission
to found this nation, that

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.450 align:middle line:90%
started with the Templars.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Tied in right with that,
I can speak personally from

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.950 align:middle line:90%
a family lineage to your point.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:37.880 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:84%
My great, great, great
grandfather seven generations

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.570 align:middle line:84%
back was General Joseph
Warren, one of the architects

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:45.980 align:middle line:90%
of the American Revolution.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, he's the one who
initiated Paul Revere

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:50.445 align:middle line:90%
into Freemasonry.

00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:51.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's incredible.

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And we know then it was these
Masonic lodges that then took

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.990 align:middle line:84%
the role in starting
to make this happen.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:10%
I mean, the Boston
Tea Party itself was

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.750 align:middle line:10%
performed by a Masonic lodge.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.840 align:middle line:10%
The key figures,
including Franklin

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.090 align:middle line:10%
himself, who created this
new atmosphere in order

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.750 align:middle line:10%
to bring about the revolution,
we're all brothers.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.490 align:middle line:84%
They were all brother
Freemasons that

00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:84%
were passing on this
Templar tradition.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.560 align:middle line:10%
The American Revolution
was, in fact,
