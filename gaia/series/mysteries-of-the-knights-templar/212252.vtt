Who knew the legends of
the Holy Grail originated

with the Knights Templar?

And that begs the question,
what is the Holy Grail?

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:90%
Tim, what is it?

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, traditionally it's
always been sold to the public

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.900 align:middle line:84%
as the cup that Jesus either
used at the Last Supper,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.129 align:middle line:84%
or in some traditions, it
was the cup that collected

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.090 align:middle line:84%
the blood that came out of
the wounds of Jesus as he was

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.230 align:middle line:90%
on the cross.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Either way, it was
the cup of Jesus.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.310 align:middle line:90%
>> A physical cup.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
>> A physical cup according
to some traditions.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.730 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's the
popular perception of it.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.285 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, there was a
lot more to this concept.

00:01:24.285 --> 00:01:26.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, indeed.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say for a
second for argument's sake

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.790 align:middle line:84%
that the Grail is the cup that
was used at the Last Supper

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.100 align:middle line:84%
or to collect the
blood of Christ.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:90%
But then where did it go?

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:84%
It seems to have
disappeared to history.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:90%
Or do the Templars have it?

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, this is the deal.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.840 align:middle line:84%
People, from this
point forward, then

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.590 align:middle line:84%
hear about the Grail quest, or
the quest for the Holy Grail

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:90%
to find it.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.150 align:middle line:84%
These ideas were popularized
in the Grail romances that

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.130 align:middle line:84%
were associated with the legend
of King Arthur and the round

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.930 align:middle line:90%
table.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>> And the story is also really
emphasized in some of the early

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.180 align:middle line:84%
medieval romances like the
story Parzival by Wolfram Von

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.220 align:middle line:90%
Eschenbach in the 1200s.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.890 align:middle line:10%
And specifically,
in "Parzival," it

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:10%
says that the Grail was
guarded by the Knights Templar.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:10%
He said the Grail
story was told to him

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.780 align:middle line:10%
by a certain Kyot of Provence.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.570 align:middle line:84%
And we actually know
who this Kyot is.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:84%
His real name was
Guiot of Provence.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.160 align:middle line:84%
He was someone who probably
knew Wolfram Von Eschenbach

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.810 align:middle line:90%
in the German courts.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.620 align:middle line:84%
And they discussed
these Grail stories.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.800 align:middle line:84%
And the evidence
suggests that they

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:90%
were both Templars themselves.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So they were trying to pass
on this Grail tradition.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
There were other Grail stories
though there was a person

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Chrétien de Troyes, who

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.320 align:middle line:84%
created one of the other
first Grail stories.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Chrétien de Troyes also talked
about the Grail, the quest

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.690 align:middle line:90%
for the Grail.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.610 align:middle line:84%
It should be pointed
out that Chrétien

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.230 align:middle line:90%
lived this town of Troyes.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:84%
This is where the Templars
had their rule created.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.905 align:middle line:90%
By Saint Bernard of Clairvaux.

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
>> By Saint Bernard
of Clairvaux.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1129 on January 13, a
papal bull was signed making

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:84%
the Knights Templar
an official order.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously, they existed
before that, but I digress.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, and Chretien just happened
to be the cousin of Catherine

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:90%
de Saint Clair.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:84%
And Catherine de Saint
Clair was the wife

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.990 align:middle line:84%
of Hugh de Paynes, the first
grand master of the Knights

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.790 align:middle line:90%
Templar.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So whether you look to Wolfram
Von Eschenbach or Chrétien

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.570 align:middle line:84%
de Troyes, either
way, these stories

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.965 align:middle line:90%
go back to the Templars.

00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:49.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:90%
So let's just talk for a second.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:84%
The Holy Grail being
the cup of Christ

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
is certainly a
plausible possibility.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.035 align:middle line:90%
What else could it be?

00:03:58.035 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the other names
for the Holy Grail according

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.070 align:middle line:84%
to these early romances,
particularly Sir Thomas

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.820 align:middle line:84%
Mallory's from his "Le
Morte d'Arthur" series,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.110 align:middle line:84%
it refers to the Holy
Grail as the Sangreal.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And if we divide this name
up, it suggests holy blood.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Which some have suggested
could represent this holy

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.390 align:middle line:84%
bloodline between Mary
Magdalene and Jesus.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.630 align:middle line:84%
But the one thing we
know is this bloodline

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.520 align:middle line:84%
has a history of
passing on a tradition.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is the tradition
of the spiritual ideas,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.650 align:middle line:84%
which seem to go
back to Atlantis.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there's
even a suggestion

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.210 align:middle line:84%
within French traditions
that the bloodline married

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.370 align:middle line:90%
into the Merovingian King line.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.925 align:middle line:84%
>> And Merovingian, of course,
means the vine of Mary, right?

00:04:54.925 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:90%
>> The vine of Mary, right.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And I don't think they're
talking about the Virgin Mary

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.825 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:04:58.825 --> 00:04:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It's Mary Magdalene.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
They have myths talking
about how this goes back

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.290 align:middle line:84%
to some sort of a sea monster
that came out of the sea.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Some have interpreted
this as going back

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
to the tradition
of the Atlanteans

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:84%
arriving on the shores of France
and bringing their tradition.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And having their own
traditions surviving

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.950 align:middle line:84%
there, then the Bloodline
of Mary and Jesus,

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.805 align:middle line:84%
which would have also
recognized it led into later on.

00:05:33.805 --> 00:05:36.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about
something that is, again,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.970 align:middle line:84%
getting back to some factual
information that most people

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.290 align:middle line:84%
are not aware of that supports
this whole bloodline possibly

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:90%
being the Holy Grail.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, at the time of Jesus and
Mary and John the Baptist,

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.460 align:middle line:90%
it was part of the tradition.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was a requirement
to be a Hebrew priest,

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:90%
you were required to be married.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.380 align:middle line:84%
And you were required to
have a son for succession.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.840 align:middle line:84%
So this whole idea of Jesus
being married and having

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:84%
children that is so
heretical to some people

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.495 align:middle line:84%
was, in fact, the
required tradition.

00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:17.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Tied into this, of course,
the Holy Grail is full of other

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:90%
symbolism.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.880 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we talked at
an earlier episode

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.940 align:middle line:10%
about how the word
grail probably

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:10%
comes from gra.al,
G-R-A dot A-L, which

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.880 align:middle line:10%
was the science of
transmutation or alchemy

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:10%
from ancient Sumer,
which had been inherited

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:10%
from the Atlanteans.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.780 align:middle line:84%
We find the same idea in Egypt
where it's called gradal.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.640 align:middle line:84%
And it was said to be a science
which produced the healing

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.190 align:middle line:84%
manna and the red
waters of life,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes known as the
blood of Osiris, which

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.130 align:middle line:84%
would in fact be later
known in alchemical texts

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
as the red lion or
the blood of Christ.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>> So here, we have
this tradition.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:84%
In "Parzival," we certainly
have the Grail also being

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle line:84%
mentioned as an emerald
but was knocked out

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.470 align:middle line:84%
of the crown of Lucifer
during the war in heaven

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.245 align:middle line:84%
and was brought to
Earth by neutral angels.

00:07:17.245 --> 00:07:18.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Could it be this?

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.970 align:middle line:10%
Which seems to be suggesting
the Emerald Tablet.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:84%
There was certainly a
hermetic mystery there.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.090 align:middle line:84%
In the Grail legends,
it talks about how

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.365 align:middle line:84%
there's a Fisher King who
represents the age of the fish.

00:07:32.365 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Pisces the fish.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Pisces, who's wounded.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.460 align:middle line:84%
He's received a wound where
he's torn between dualities.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.560 align:middle line:84%
He can't sit, but
he can't stand.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:84%
He's not alive,
but he's not dead.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.680 align:middle line:90%
He's in this state of limbo.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's only the Grail
that's able to heal him

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.590 align:middle line:90%
from this state.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Some have suggested that
the Grail in this instance,

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.310 align:middle line:84%
as he is sick, the land
becomes sick as well.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:05.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's as-within-so-without
relationship

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:84%
or as-above-so-below
relationship that we also find

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:90%
in the Emerald Tablet.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.610 align:middle line:84%
But we also have the fact
that if he represents

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.330 align:middle line:84%
the age of Pisces, then
who's the Grail maiden

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:90%
with the Grail?

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.610 align:middle line:90%
What does she represent?

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to suggest she
can also represent the science

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.640 align:middle line:84%
and philosophies
of the Grail, which

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.800 align:middle line:84%
are to come to expression
during the new age of Aquarius.

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's talk about that for
a sec because you hear people

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:84%
talk about ages, you
talk about progressions.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think we have to take
a step back and help people

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
understand that this is
really about astronomy,

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and probably, in
my opinion, serves

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:84%
as the basis for this whole
concept of as above, so below.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And what we're talking
about is the Earth

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:84%
is surrounded by a
zodiacal belt of the 12

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:84%
primary constellations
of the Zodiac.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And on the morning of
the spring equinox,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:84%
the zodiacal belt goes
through the Eastern sky.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And at any point
in time, you will

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.520 align:middle line:84%
have one of those constellations
sitting on the horizon.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And then when the sun rises
through that constellation,

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
this is sacred and
considered part

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
of that age, whatever
constellation it is.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:29.050 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the
12 constellations,

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:84%
because of the
Earth's slight wobble,

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:84%
it causes that belt to
rotate around the Earth.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, obviously,
it's not rotating.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:38.710 align:middle line:90%
We are.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And it gives the
appearance of that.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.270 align:middle line:90%
So that's why this thing moves.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's been
calculated that it takes

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.480 align:middle line:84%
26,000 years for
the zodiacal belt

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.700 align:middle line:90%
to make one complete rotation.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's an
awfully long time.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you divide it by 12,
you get about 2,168 years.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, the time that
one constellation

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.000 align:middle line:84%
spends in the Eastern
sky before it descends

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:84%
and then the next
one cycles through

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.620 align:middle line:90%
is not exactly 2,168 years.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.485 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the size
of the constellation.

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:15.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And also then as we move
forward into Aries during

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:19.750 align:middle line:84%
the time of the end of Aries,
this is where we have Abraham

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.155 align:middle line:90%
sacrificing the ram--

00:10:21.155 --> 00:10:21.955 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> --symbolically ending
the age of Aries the ram.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.977 align:middle line:84%
>> And then what
did we move into?

00:10:27.977 --> 00:10:29.305 align:middle line:90%
Pisces.

00:10:29.305 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> When they talk about Jesus,
they say that he was born

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.480 align:middle line:90%
of the Lamb of God.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, what it means is he
was born in the last four

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:44.050 align:middle line:84%
years of Aries the ram, and
then he is initiated by--

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>> John the Baptist.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Who calls him.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:84%
He now becomes the
Fisher King, right?

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And the fisher of
men refers to Pisces.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
Christian fish that we

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.862 align:middle line:90%
see on the back of the cars.

00:10:54.862 --> 00:10:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And the disciples
are fishermen.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Fishermen.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.000 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.950 align:middle line:10%
So this is a very
profound thing.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And when people think about
from that perspective,

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.290 align:middle line:90%
I think it changes a few things.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.540 align:middle line:84%
What we are living
through right now

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.900 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most profound
moments in human history.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.560 align:middle line:84%
Everybody here making this
episode, everybody watching

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.900 align:middle line:90%
this episode is part of this.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
here is we are not just

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.890 align:middle line:84%
living through the transition
from the age of Pisces

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:84%
to Aquarius, which happens 12
times during this cycle, right?

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.530 align:middle line:84%
What's happening now
is we are experiencing

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:84%
the end of that 26,000
year long cycle,

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.525 align:middle line:84%
one of the most profound
moments in human history.

00:11:40.525 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the symbols for
the age of Pisces is two fish

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.955 align:middle line:90%
swimming in opposite directions.

00:11:45.955 --> 00:11:46.755 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:11:46.755 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It represents dualities.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:51.230 align:middle line:84%
But they're in constant
struggle with each other.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Everything is black or
white, good or evil,

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:90%
these extreme dualities, right?

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the symbol
for Aquarius is two

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:90%
streams flowing together.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.130 align:middle line:84%
The dualities are still
there, but they're

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
learning to work within
harmony with each other.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is one of the ideas
that we find within this story

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.440 align:middle line:90%
of "Parzival."

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.260 align:middle line:10%
Some have interpreted
the name Parzival itself

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.200 align:middle line:10%
as meaning "to pierce
between the two valleys,"

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:10%
in other words,
the two dualities.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:90%
To balance those dualities.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:25.150 align:middle line:84%
So you're right, we are
going into this period.

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we find
even in the Grail legends,

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:84%
it's only the Grail
maiden holding

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:84%
the chalice representing
this age of Aquarius who's

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
able to heal the dualities
that are taking place

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.815 align:middle line:84%
within the Fisher King,
representing the age of Pisces.

00:12:42.815 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
>> What do we need to do to
get that opposing fish going

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:50.540 align:middle line:84%
in opposite directions
to come together as one?

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have to find
that middle term that unites

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.820 align:middle line:90%
everybody.

00:12:55.820 --> 00:13:00.260 align:middle line:84%
So the goal is to work
through those dualities

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:03.920 align:middle line:84%
to the center pillar, which
will take us ultimately

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.890 align:middle line:90%
to the kingship or keter.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Or promised land.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Crown.

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.250 align:middle line:90%
The promised land, yeah.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is all part of the
plans of the Templar work

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.140 align:middle line:84%
is to try to get people
to this balanced state,

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.770 align:middle line:84%
unite science and
spirituality, to be

00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:26.390 align:middle line:84%
able to unite these
dualities and bring us

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.920 align:middle line:84%
into better harmony
with ourselves,

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.290 align:middle line:90%
with our environment.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, the hope is to
set up governmental structures.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we find
the same structure

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.145 align:middle line:84%
with the setting up of the
United States of America.

00:13:39.145 --> 00:13:41.265 align:middle line:84%
>> Which came from
the Iroquois nation--

00:13:41.265 --> 00:13:42.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:42.065 --> 00:13:43.880 align:middle line:90%
>> --system of governance.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And Ben Franklin
spent time with them,

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and he was really the main
architect behind that.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:49.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So there was this
democratic idea

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:55.250 align:middle line:84%
that was set up on a three
pillar government, you know,

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.190 align:middle line:84%
which had these same
multiple levels like we

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:59.600 align:middle line:90%
find in Kabbalah.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:04.590 align:middle line:10%
So the Kabbalistic tree and
then the Iroquois system

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:09.710 align:middle line:10%
and this idea of freedom of
the individual going back

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:10%
through the Gnostic
traditions, all the way

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:16.220 align:middle line:10%
back into Atlantis really
is found in this idea,

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.880 align:middle line:10%
this blueprint, if you will.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.660 align:middle line:84%
With the founding
of North America,

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:26.360 align:middle line:84%
really, by the Templars, one
of the significant artifacts

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:30.710 align:middle line:84%
in relation to this was
the Kensington Runestone,

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.850 align:middle line:90%
which has the word Grail on it.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, when I first
got involved in it,

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:84%
I looked at it strictly from
a geological standpoint.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
Never heard of the Runestone,
didn't know anything

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.490 align:middle line:84%
about the controversy,
and frankly didn't care.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.690 align:middle line:84%
But after I was convinced
by the evidence,

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:84%
the rock told me it was
an authentic artifact.

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:90%
But I knew that it was real.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
somebody carved it.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:90%
They came from someplace.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.860 align:middle line:90%
They came here for some reason.

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:90%
And that sent me on this--

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.640 align:middle line:84%
pardon the pun-- Grail
quest, if you will,

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.880 align:middle line:84%
to try to figure
out who carved it.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, the trail led to
Gotland and the Cistercians

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:90%
and the Knights Templar.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
who were the Templars

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and the Grail legends
and everything else?

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.340 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:90%
What is the Runestone?

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And what is in here to
tie it to the Templars?

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, first and
foremost, on line 2,

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.240 align:middle line:84%
it tells us "acquisition
business taking up land."

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.210 align:middle line:84%
But it also has codes
embedded within it.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Another code that we
have is a dating code.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know we have the date
1362 carved in pentadic numbers

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:90%
in Arabic placement.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And that encrypted date within
the inscription is 1362.

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Which begs the question,
why would they do that?

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, if somebody took
a chisel and, say,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
added another bar to the 3,
you've added 100 years, right?

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.310 align:middle line:90%
Ah-ah.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:84%
You can't do it because we
protected the date by embedding

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.160 align:middle line:90%
a code within the inscription.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:90%
But who did this?

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:90%
The Templars.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.735 align:middle line:84%
>> We've already
established their brilliance

00:16:09.735 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:84%
by the rediscovery of
the Atlantean mysteries,

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.740 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about, what
could the Holy Grail be?

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:21.260 align:middle line:84%
I think another candidate that
has to be added to our list

00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.290 align:middle line:84%
is the ultimate
goal of the Templars

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.680 align:middle line:84%
by placing that land claim
was the establishment

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:31.220 align:middle line:84%
of the new Atlantis,
the new Jerusalem,

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
or what they also called a free
Templar state that we now call

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:38.150 align:middle line:90%
the United States of America.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.856 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.856 --> 00:16:45.000 align:middle line:84%
>> This reminds me even within
the Grail legends themselves,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.160 align:middle line:84%
the Grail was this
elusive object,

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
which you had to have the right
heart to even hang onto it.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that Parzival
shield had a heart on it

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:90%
for this very reason.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And if people did not
have the right focus,

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.440 align:middle line:84%
the goal of their quest
exceeded their grasp.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.550 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.980 align:middle line:90%
It was that Grail disappeared.

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:84%
But it was only
when we ourselves

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:15.450 align:middle line:84%
had the right focus and
the right intentions

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:19.530 align:middle line:84%
that we ourselves become
the new Grail king.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:24.359 align:middle line:84%
And we have the responsibility
of protecting it at that point.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:27.099 align:middle line:84%
In a way the Grail
is all these things.

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:84%
It represents the truth
that we all quest for.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.560 align:middle line:84%
But certainly,
this new expression

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.050 align:middle line:84%
that was set up in the
government of the United

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:84%
States of America was a means to
preserve, protect, and idealize

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.920 align:middle line:84%
the greatest potential
within us that we

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.430 align:middle line:84%
should be striving for not
only individually, but also as

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:90%
a nation.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's ours to
have as long as we're

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:59.740 align:middle line:84%
able to be responsible with
it and we don't let it go.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:90%


00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:84%
