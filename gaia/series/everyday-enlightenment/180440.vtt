00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.860 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey, I'm Ashleigh Sergeant
and welcome to "Everyday

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.950 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment."

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.970 align:middle line:10%
This is your go-to show
that offers practical tips

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:10%
from expert guests at
the end of every episode

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.159 align:middle line:10%
to help you be more
conscious in the midst

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:10%
of your busy modern life.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Today, more than ever, the
rise of the female power

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:90%
seems to be awakening.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.730 align:middle line:90%
But what does that mean exactly?

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.210 align:middle line:84%
The imbalance of masculine
energy so prevalent

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.370 align:middle line:84%
in patriarchal systems
is being questioned.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.330 align:middle line:84%
But what would a matriarchal
system look like?

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.710 align:middle line:84%
And how can we take steps to
get to a more balanced power

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:90%
dynamic?

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.940 align:middle line:10%
Several prestigious journals,
like "Forbes" and "Time

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.460 align:middle line:10%
Magazine" are boldly
reporting with headlines

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:10%
such as "The Future
is Female," placing

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.660 align:middle line:10%
the voice of the feminine
message on a global stage.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Today my guest is the
great Sally Kempton.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.150 align:middle line:10%
In the '70s, Sally had
a flourishing career

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.920 align:middle line:10%
as a New York
journalist, writing

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.100 align:middle line:10%
on popular culture, the
arts, and feminist issues,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.230 align:middle line:10%
for "Esquire," "New
York Magazine,"

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.640 align:middle line:10%
and the "Village Voice."

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Today, Sally offers
a wide variety

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:84%
of classes on moving through
psychological obstructions

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.370 align:middle line:84%
and applying spiritual
principles to relationships,

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.020 align:middle line:90%
work, and life.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Sally, thanks so much
for being here today.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a total
pleasure, Ashleigh.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So I know this is a
topic super near and dear

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:84%
to your heart, being that
you have been writing on some

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.360 align:middle line:84%
of these concepts
for many, many years.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.589 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation is big
again in modern culture.

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think there's actually
a lot of controversy

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.540 align:middle line:90%
around what it actually means.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, first of all, we are
starting to recognize that when

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.090 align:middle line:10%
we talk about
masculine and feminine,

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:10%
we are actually not talking
about people in male bodies

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.340 align:middle line:10%
and people in female bodies,
and the confusion about that is,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:10%
I think, being
cleared up these days.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Because traditionally,
we've tended

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.360 align:middle line:84%
to assume that what we call
masculine qualities are

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.910 align:middle line:84%
essentially associated with
the male sexual anatomy.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.590 align:middle line:84%
In other words, men are
phallic, they thrust--

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.020 align:middle line:84%
sorry for this
language, but they

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:90%
thrust forward into action.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Whereas women sexual anatomy
is a space, a womb, a hole.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the feminine
is understood to be receptive,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.010 align:middle line:84%
passive, not acting
in the world.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, masculine
has been associated

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:84%
with strength, assertion,
domination, feminine

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.060 align:middle line:84%
with passivity, receptivity,
and nourishment.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to realize
that these qualities exist

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
The receptive quality
is not confined

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.695 align:middle line:90%
to people in female bodies.

00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:06.330 align:middle line:84%
The assertive quality
is not confined

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.890 align:middle line:90%
to people in male bodies.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And we're starting to
really look at, OK,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:84%
what do we mean when we
say masculine energy?

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.810 align:middle line:84%
What do we mean when
we say feminine energy?

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And that, to me, is the
most interesting part

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:90%
of the conversation.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think so too, and
with everything happening

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.850 align:middle line:84%
in the world today
with, finally,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:84%
a much more broad recognition
of gender, gender equality,

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.290 align:middle line:84%
gender identification, and
really what does that mean when

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:84%
we talk about these energies as
being masculine and feminine.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.995 align:middle line:84%
You always describe it as
trans personal qualities,

00:03:40.995 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:84%
as they go far beyond not
even just the physical body

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.270 align:middle line:84%
or sexual anatomy, but
even beyond personality

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.100 align:middle line:90%
characteristics as well.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And what we call traditional
masculine qualities,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
which would be assertion,
the capacity for independent

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.030 align:middle line:84%
action, autonomy, leadership,
the sense of being the ruler

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
of the family and the ruler of
the state, which is, of course,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.690 align:middle line:84%
what traditional
patriarchy consists of.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, the woman is again
traditionally seen as the space

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.600 align:middle line:90%
within which action happens.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So the woman is
identified with the earth,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.530 align:middle line:84%
the man is identified
with the sky, with spirit.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Woman is identified
with the body,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.600 align:middle line:84%
the masculine is
identified with intellect.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So there's this sense of a
split between the active, which

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:84%
is identified with the
male, and the passive, which

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.820 align:middle line:90%
is identified with the female.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And what we now know
is that it's actually

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:84%
not like that at all, that
men, people in male bodies,

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.930 align:middle line:84%
can be receptive, can be
nurturing, can be vulnerable.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
And that people in female
bodies can be assertive,

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:84%
can be leaders, can
have a strength that

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:84%
seems to be very similar
to masculine strength,

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.700 align:middle line:84%
can go into combat,
can do physical tasks

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.890 align:middle line:84%
that for generations we
thought were only for men.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're starting
to realize that

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
these traditional qualities,
like assertion and receptivity

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.350 align:middle line:84%
are not really
anchored to gender.

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And they're not really
anchored to our hormones

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.750 align:middle line:84%
or our physical equipment,
even though they obviously

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
have a lot to do with how our
biochemistry is operating.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.680 align:middle line:84%
The qualities that I think
we'd like to talk about

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.250 align:middle line:84%
and that we really need
to bring into balance

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
have something to do
with bringing together

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.400 align:middle line:84%
the sense of self-awareness,
consciousness, the ability

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:84%
to abstract from
the physical world,

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and give direction
to our experience,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:84%
which has traditionally been
called a masculine quality.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And the capacity to be open,
receptive, nourishment,

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to create a kind of holding
space within which action can

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.090 align:middle line:84%
happen, and kind of
heart based compassion,

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:84%
which have traditionally been
regarded as feminine qualities.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:84%
I think what's more important
now, what's most important now,

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
is to understand how
a man can bring forth

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.420 align:middle line:84%
his own nurturance, his
capacity for vulnerability,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.740 align:middle line:84%
a woman can bring
forth assertiveness

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.480 align:middle line:90%
that's not overly aggressive--

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --and how we live
as human beings,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
who have a combination
of these qualities,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.330 align:middle line:84%
that that's really the
question that we're facing now.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that's a really
important and big point too,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
because being in a woman's
body and being very connected

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:54.040 align:middle line:90%
to female aspect of my identity.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.220 align:middle line:84%
I would say that
I, most of my life,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.020 align:middle line:84%
been more identified
with my masculine energy

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:90%
in a lot of ways.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm pretty fiery.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.730 align:middle line:90%
I will go and get things done.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
And I've no problem
kind of being

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.930 align:middle line:84%
in this linear,
like power forward.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And I actually identified
for such a long time,

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.620 align:middle line:84%
once I understood those,
that, oh, this is a problem.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.940 align:middle line:90%
I need to chill out.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.430 align:middle line:90%
I need to soften down.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I need to not express this
masculine side so much.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I need to actually
really be connected

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.890 align:middle line:84%
to who I am as a woman,
which isn't incorrect,

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.620 align:middle line:84%
but I think that still keeps
us stuck in this paradigm as

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.270 align:middle line:90%
of one or the other.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:34.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And that we need to
connect with one or the other,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
or that we even just
need to balance them out.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But I think it's a
little bit more, actually,

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:44.100 align:middle line:84%
that both of these qualities,
and all of the aspects that

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:84%
these qualities
hold within them,

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:84%
all exist within each
of us, and, therefore,

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.170 align:middle line:90%
within the world around us.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not so much
even a balancing of these.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:84%
It's a being present
to or an embodying

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.340 align:middle line:90%
both at the same time.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that's
beautifully said.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And what you said about
identifying yourself

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
with masculine qualities is,
I think, a characteristic

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:84%
of educated contemporary
women, that once women

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:84%
started being
seriously educated,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and started holding
jobs, that the way

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.400 align:middle line:84%
we knew how to do it was the
way that the men in our lives

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.460 align:middle line:90%
had done it.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.830 align:middle line:84%
So I would say
women are learning

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:84%
how to be powerful, assertive,
linear, get things done,

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:39.809 align:middle line:84%
be efficient, and also
be receptive, embodied,

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:43.630 align:middle line:84%
and literally stay
in our hearts,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:84%
stay in our interior, which
is the thing that men kind

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:53.430 align:middle line:84%
of didn't figure out, which is
how we got into this imbalance

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:54.510 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And that women, as
the feminist movement

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:84%
came to the fore, one
of the first things

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.050 align:middle line:84%
that feminists
realized was, oh, we

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:90%
can do anything a man can do.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:12.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So women began to nurture the
qualities traditionally called

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.140 align:middle line:90%
masculine.

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And then, men said, but I
don't like it when women are

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
so assertive,
because it doesn't--

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.540 align:middle line:84%
they're not creating the space
that I need to feel held.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.952 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
beginning to realize,

00:09:26.952 --> 00:09:28.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm certainly
beginning to realize,

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:84%
is that we all need
to be held, we all

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.620 align:middle line:84%
need that holding space that's
been traditionally called

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.430 align:middle line:90%
feminine.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And we all need assertion,
we all need strength,

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
protection, and the
ability to lead.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:43.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So what do we do to free
these qualities in ourselves?

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I actually think
it's a life work

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.250 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to be
appropriately aggressive

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:84%
and how to be appropriately
receptive, how

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:84%
to find the situations, in which
it's important to be linear,

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:84%
forge ahead, and where
it's important to hold

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.370 align:middle line:90%
back and allow.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.742 align:middle line:90%
>> And these are human--

00:10:11.742 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:90%
these are human issues.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:16.484 align:middle line:84%
They're not really men's
issues or women's issues.

00:10:16.484 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Or even masculine
or feminine issues.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Or masculine or
feminine issues.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.850 align:middle line:84%
>> When we're talking those
trans-personal energies.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Because this brings
up another topic,

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.385 align:middle line:90%
which is this idea that--

00:10:26.385 --> 00:10:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and this is very popular
in modern culture

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.510 align:middle line:84%
right now, like
we must tear down

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.900 align:middle line:84%
the patriarchy and this
imbalanced masculinity,

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.790 align:middle line:84%
we must take it down, and the
rise of the feminine energy.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're seeing that in
such a kind of aggressive

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
and combative way, which
ultimately is actually just

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.660 align:middle line:90%
women acting in the patriarchy.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Or the feminine energy kind
of taking on those qualities

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:59.100 align:middle line:84%
of the masculine energies, but
in the guise of femininity,

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:90%
because of the revolution.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.633 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have some
things to say about that, which

00:11:02.633 --> 00:11:04.470 align:middle line:90%
I think is really important.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And we asked that
question in the beginning,

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.720 align:middle line:84%
what would a matriarchal
system look like?

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I want to say
that I don't think we want

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:84%
a matriarchal system any more
than we want a patriarchal

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.730 align:middle line:84%
Because both those words,
they imply hierarchy.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.020 align:middle line:90%
They imply domination.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.821 align:middle line:90%
>> And difference.

00:11:22.821 --> 00:11:23.620 align:middle line:90%
>> And difference.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Me and you, and separation.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> But patriarchy implies
men are in charge.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:84%
Matriarchy implies
women are in charge.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And there's something-- I mean,
we all-- most of us anyway,

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.980 align:middle line:84%
grow up as children in
matriarchy, not everybody,

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.960 align:middle line:90%
but generally speaking.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.520 align:middle line:90%
Our mothers run our childhood.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So we know what it feels like
to have a dominant female figure

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:84%
telling us what to do
and we know how we feel,

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:90%
both protected and pissed off.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.220 align:middle line:84%
So to a certain
extent, we grow up

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:90%
and we rebel against matriarchy.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.100 align:middle line:84%
That's part of
human individuation.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And so when we think about
creating a new society,

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:13.830 align:middle line:84%
I would say that it's
always in the model of what

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:17.036 align:middle line:84%
it was like to be a child with
all-powerful parents who force

00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:18.660 align:middle line:84%
you to do things you
didn't want to do,

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.030 align:middle line:84%
and our understanding
of patriarchy

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.970 align:middle line:84%
is based on it being men who
make the laws and tell us

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:25.770 align:middle line:90%
what to do.

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.460 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of matriarchy
is based on, oh, my god,

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.835 align:middle line:84%
am I going to be a child again
and my mother's bossing me

00:12:30.835 --> 00:12:32.161 align:middle line:90%
around.

00:12:32.161 --> 00:12:34.660 align:middle line:90%
And they're both kind of scary.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But because we're
comfortable with patriarchy,

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.970 align:middle line:84%
that is with the idea of
the president being a man,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:84%
of the head of the
corporation being a man,

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:84%
so many of us are not
comfortable with female

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.360 align:middle line:90%
authority.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a
political aspect of it,

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:59.400 align:middle line:84%
where we're now at that time
where it's been important,

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's been going on
for the last 100 years,

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:06.030 align:middle line:84%
where women, to agitate for
equal pay, and the right

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:10.120 align:middle line:84%
to be in a workplace
without being sexualized,

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:84%
all the different
political aspects of what

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
we could call gender politics
that we're working out now.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:21.450 align:middle line:84%
>> But on the other hand,
we're not going to solve

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental con of human
life if we just try to do it

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.840 align:middle line:84%
a sociopolitical level, because
what it's really about is

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:36.690 align:middle line:84%
the improper use of power, and
how we call that out in others,

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.070 align:middle line:90%
but especially in ourselves.

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:43.920 align:middle line:84%
And what comes to me
when I think about this

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.280 align:middle line:84%
is something that
Scott Peck, who

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:84%
was a very, very smart
psychotherapist, Christian,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:54.540 align:middle line:84%
who wrote a book called,
"People of the Lie," which

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.930 align:middle line:90%
is about evil.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.670 align:middle line:84%
And he defined evil
as using your power

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.310 align:middle line:84%
to avoid spiritual
growth, which I think

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.720 align:middle line:84%
is the most brilliant
definition of that concept

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:09.190 align:middle line:84%
that we call evil
as I've ever heard.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:13.890 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at yourself,
at the situations in which, you

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.540 align:middle line:84%
know, you've done
something unkind,

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.210 align:middle line:84%
or you've pushed
somebody else around,

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:84%
it's almost always
because we don't

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
want to admit our
own limitations

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.710 align:middle line:90%
or our own vulnerability.

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So we use our power to
make ourselves right

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:27.930 align:middle line:84%
or to make ourselves
the winners.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Or because it's scary.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:30.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Or because it's so scary.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's the question,
I think that yoga addresses,

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:42.240 align:middle line:84%
that you and I are most
interested in, how do we grow

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.803 align:middle line:84%
spiritually in these
challenging situations?

00:14:45.803 --> 00:14:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to right
the imbalance, each of us

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.100 align:middle line:84%
has to be willing to
take responsibility

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.850 align:middle line:84%
for our own
relationship with power.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.650 align:middle line:90%
>> And the truth is with--

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say something that
maybe sounds fairly radical,

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.600 align:middle line:84%
but women are socialized
to get approval

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and to be beautiful,
to be protected,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:17.450 align:middle line:90%
to be alluring and attractive.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:84%
And men are socialized to
be winners and successful.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.610 align:middle line:84%
So nowadays, women are
also being socialized

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:28.020 align:middle line:90%
to be assertive and successful.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:33.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet, women want to hold
on to our feminine power

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.770 align:middle line:90%
of attractiveness.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:84%
So we get very mixed up about
when to yield and when to push.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, this
happens in the family,

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.660 align:middle line:90%
it happens in the workplace.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.980 align:middle line:84%
It happens-- it's, I think,
the source of the confusion

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:90%
that women are experiencing.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And men feel that
they are not receiving

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
the nurturance and the space
that they need in order

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.360 align:middle line:84%
to succeed, because the life
of a man in this society

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:90%
is very tough.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just as tough, if
not more so, than the life

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.000 align:middle line:90%
of a woman.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.220 align:middle line:90%
We both have our problems.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Both genders have
serious, serious things

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:90%
they have to work through.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So the question really is how
can we support each other?

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:84%
How can we discover
what it means

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
to be-- to live
with an open heart

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.870 align:middle line:84%
and yet be realists about
how we live our lives?

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, so these are lots
of really big topics.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:41.050 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, we could talk
about this for probably days.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:44.980 align:middle line:84%
But in these confusing
times, and when

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.080 align:middle line:84%
so many of these
fundamental beliefs

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.840 align:middle line:84%
are starting to be reorganized
and we have the ability

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.110 align:middle line:84%
to really question paradigms
we've grown up with,

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
socializations
we've grown up with,

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.290 align:middle line:84%
structures we've
grown up with, what

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:03.580 align:middle line:84%
are some specific things
that we can do to start to--

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:84%
I like what you said about
not necessarily having

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:10.880 align:middle line:84%
a matriarchal
leadership or culture.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But what are some things we
can actually do right now

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:84%
to begin to integrate both
the matriarchal, patriarchal,

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:84%
masculine and feminine
qualities into our daily life,

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:84%
within us, because it
really is about us bringing

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.790 align:middle line:84%
the balance and the awareness
of those energies within us

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:33.780 align:middle line:90%
more than anything.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I mean, obviously, one
thing that really is important

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:84%
is that we be able to talk
about difficult issues.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.210 align:middle line:84%
So the ability to
set up a conversation

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and create a space for a
conversation in which nobody

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.350 align:middle line:90%
is being judged for their--

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:55.300 align:middle line:84%
let's call it politically,
socially, academically correct

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.610 align:middle line:84%
perspectives, but in
which people can really

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:84%
be open about where they
are, where they're confused,

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.300 align:middle line:90%
is a big part of it.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's part
of what we're doing now.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:84%
But to some large
extent, it feels to me

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:14.710 align:middle line:84%
like we need to be able to
be honest with ourselves

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.320 align:middle line:84%
about our feelings
of vulnerability,

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:20.260 align:middle line:84%
about the fact that we
don't have it together,

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:24.530 align:middle line:84%
and we're desperately trying to
act like we have it together.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
So we need to learn how to find
spaces, interior spaces, spaces

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.350 align:middle line:84%
for ourselves, where we
can ask these questions.

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And we need ways to hold one
another in those safe spaces.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So that a man can say, I feel
really vulnerable when I'm not

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:55.000 align:middle line:84%
making it to the top
of my profession,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.180 align:middle line:84%
or I feel bad that
I've just lost my job

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and I don't know how I'm
going to support my family.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And this goes to my
feeling of my own manhood.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
And a woman needs to be
able to say, I'm aging,

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and I don't feel so
pretty, and therefore, I

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.020 align:middle line:90%
feel less feminine.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
need to have space

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:20.740 align:middle line:84%
to discuss the myths of
masculine and feminine,

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and come to the place where
we can start to see, OK,

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.040 align:middle line:90%
who am I as a human being?

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:34.270 align:middle line:84%
How is my interior capacity
for nourishing others

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:90%
being activated in my life?

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:41.920 align:middle line:84%
How can I be more
assertive in the situations

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm in, without being
overly aggressive?

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:51.580 align:middle line:84%
How can I, as a woman, make
it clear what I want and need,

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.080 align:middle line:90%
without being a nagging bitch?

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:84%
And how can I as a man say,
I'm working really hard,

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and I actually need support,
without coming across

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:02.470 align:middle line:90%
as a patriarchal bastard?

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:03.700 align:middle line:90%
So you know what I mean?

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:84%
I like to some extent,
in our communication,

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:11.500 align:middle line:84%
we need to notice our rage,
and our hurt, and our fear,

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.220 align:middle line:90%
and hold space for it.

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And that's a feminine quality,
that capacity to hold space.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think that when we
talk about how the future is

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:84%
feminine, I feel that
what we're really saying

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:29.890 align:middle line:84%
is that our society needs
a capacity for holding

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:33.760 align:middle line:84%
space for each other, for
compassion, that it needs

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.070 align:middle line:90%
to be not just done by women.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:84%
The emotional labor
of holding space

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.430 align:middle line:84%
needs to also be
done by both genders,

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:84%
because in a certain
sense, that's

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:84%
what's going to allow
new paradigms to emerge.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the way I
think the future is feminine,

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
by our really
understanding what it

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.130 align:middle line:84%
is to be present
with each other,

00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:01.450 align:middle line:84%
to feel into presence
within ourselves,

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and to connect to the
presence in us and in others.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, we actually
do need to go inside.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.790 align:middle line:84%
We need to pay
attention to our breath.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And we need to meditate,
to actually experience

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.540 align:middle line:84%
our consciousness turning
backwards, feeling

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
into our own body,
where there is

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.350 align:middle line:84%
space, where there
is compassion,

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:90%
where there is kindness.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Once we're able to accept the
fact that we can bring it out

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:90%
from inside.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And I would say
that's the feminine work.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because the
feminist movement,

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:49.330 align:middle line:84%
or I should say actually the
overemphasis on the masculine

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:52.780 align:middle line:84%
or the patriarchy, this is
probably contentious for some

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.280 align:middle line:84%
people, but it hasn't
just happened to women.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>> No, exactly.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:90%
>> It's happened to men too.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:02.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And so these techniques that
we're talking about and this

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.350 align:middle line:84%
ability to hold space,
and to connect with that,

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.930 align:middle line:84%
and to be able to really
acknowledge what's going

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.440 align:middle line:84%
on within us, is not just
something that women have

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.010 align:middle line:84%
the right to do or need to
do, but also that men have

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:18.380 align:middle line:84%
the right to do, to process,
and the need to do as well.

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:21.010 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about these,
it's for men, and women,

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:23.830 align:middle line:84%
and all of the energies
working within us.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and Warren
Farrell, who's a theorist--

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:36.010 align:middle line:84%
he's a gender theorists, always
says that women have choices.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:39.100 align:middle line:84%
A woman can-- and this is not
true of all women, obviously,

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:90%
but middle class women--

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.900 align:middle line:90%
have more choices than men.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:47.185 align:middle line:84%
It's OK for women to take
time and work on ourselves.

00:22:47.185 --> 00:22:50.290 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very difficult
for men to do that,

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:52.110 align:middle line:84%
because of how
men are expected--

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Expectations.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so if we could allow
men to be more like women

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:84%
in that way, it would allow
women to be more like men

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:06.070 align:middle line:84%
in ways that women need
to be more like men.

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, we
will find a place

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:11.020 align:middle line:84%
where we're all just
human, which seems

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:90%
to be where we want to go.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:14.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, Sally, would you
mind enlightening us

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.424 align:middle line:84%
with a tip or two that
anyone can do, really

00:23:20.424 --> 00:23:22.090 align:middle line:84%
at any time throughout
the day, to start

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:25.840 align:middle line:84%
to work on harmonizing these
energies within ourself

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:27.310 align:middle line:90%
and the world around us?

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, I'd love to.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:35.710 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm about to say is
very, very basic meditation

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.420 align:middle line:84%
practice, the practice
of turning within.

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
And it has to do
with the breath.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:44.200 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I want to talk
about this practice as opposed

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.020 align:middle line:10%
to the many, many other
practices we could talk about,

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.920 align:middle line:10%
is because this is
the bottom line.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So what we have
to do is actually

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:84%
discover the inner
source of the breath.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.300 align:middle line:10%
And if you follow your breath,
what you will start to notice

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:05.680 align:middle line:10%
is that the diaphragm,
this muscle that

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:10%
runs across the bottom
of your rib cage,

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.270 align:middle line:10%
is actually rising and
falling with the breath.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you allow
yourself to tune

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:15.800 align:middle line:84%
into the diaphragm
as your breathing,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.250 align:middle line:84%
you begin to
recognize that breath

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.590 align:middle line:90%
starts from inside the body.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.240 align:middle line:10%
We think that
breath is something

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:10%
you take in from outside
through your nostrils.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.880 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the gesture of
breathing starts inside.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:32.110 align:middle line:10%
And if you're focused here in
this region, between the heart

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:35.380 align:middle line:10%
and the solar plexus,
and allowing the breath

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:40.690 align:middle line:10%
to come in while your
focus remains there,

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:43.970 align:middle line:10%
something opens up
in your inner body.

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:10%
And you start to recognize that
there's a wisdom and a power

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.830 align:middle line:10%
that you're carrying
inside you that

00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:52.990 align:middle line:10%
is deeper than the
mind, which is literally

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.170 align:middle line:10%
the source of your breath,
which is your own life force.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:58.840 align:middle line:10%
And that's where true power is.

00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.940 align:middle line:10%
That power is fearless.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:03.460 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
it can hold steady

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of the most
challenging external situation.

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's all about
learning to find

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:14.200 align:middle line:84%
the source of your own breath,
which we do by literally

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.680 align:middle line:84%
following the breath, until
we can discern the place where

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.570 align:middle line:90%
the breath starts.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:24.410 align:middle line:84%
And then letting it rise,
fill our lungs, go out,

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:84%
do what it does,
and then coming back

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:30.590 align:middle line:84%
to that place which is the
source of the inhalation.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:84%
It will, over time, change your
whole relationship to yourself.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
act, when you speak,

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.230 align:middle line:84%
when you interact
with others, it

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:84%
will be from a place
of interior connection.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.790 align:middle line:10%
And you'll be able to find
that same interior connection

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:52.010 align:middle line:10%
in other people.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.780 align:middle line:10%
And it's at that
point that we start

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:10%
to realize what
human equality really

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:01.460 align:middle line:10%
is, what the connection
between you and your wife,

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.670 align:middle line:10%
and you and the tree, and you
and the person next to you

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:14.750 align:middle line:10%
on the bus really is, which is
to say aliveness, awareness,

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.260 align:middle line:10%
energy, breath, we all have it.

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:21.970 align:middle line:90%
And that's where the balance is.

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:24.760 align:middle line:84%
