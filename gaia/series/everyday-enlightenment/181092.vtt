>> Hey, I'm Ashleigh Sergeant.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.220 align:middle line:10%
And welcome to "Everyday
Enlightenment."

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.270 align:middle line:10%
This is your go-to show
that offers practical tips

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.360 align:middle line:10%
from expert guests at

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.820 align:middle line:10%
to help you be more
conscious in the midst

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.820 align:middle line:10%

The spiritual ideas and
methods of different Eastern

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and Western traditions
are being assimilated now

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.770 align:middle line:90%
into popular culture.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.800 align:middle line:84%
Systems of yoga,
meditation, and shamanism

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.900 align:middle line:84%
have been around for
thousands of years.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.990 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they still hold
profoundly relevant and helpful

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
tools for the issues
we struggle with today.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And all three use
archetypal energies along

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:84%
with the power of myth as tools
for healing and transformation.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Today my guest is one of
my teachers, Sally Kempton.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Sally studied for 30 years
in an Eastern tradition

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.970 align:middle line:84%
and spent 20 years as an
initiated monk in the Saraswati

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Order.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.590 align:middle line:10%
Sally's book "Awakening Shakti
the Transformative Power

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.830 align:middle line:10%
of the Goddesses of Yoga"
teaches modern seekers

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.710 align:middle line:10%
the tantric path of
the sacred feminine.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Sally, thanks so much for
being here with me today.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm so delighted.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well as you know, your
book "Awakening Shakti"

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:84%
has been one of my nearest and
dearest books for at least five

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.570 align:middle line:90%
years now.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And you are definitely
one of the leaders,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.920 align:middle line:84%
I think, in this
conversation around how

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.880 align:middle line:84%
these traditions of the Indian
spiritual culture, particularly

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.910 align:middle line:84%
around the divine feminine
can help the modern woman

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.250 align:middle line:90%
and modern man.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.440 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, and the discovery of
archetypal goddess energies

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.730 align:middle line:10%
or of the sacred feminine as
a guiding force in nature,

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:10%
in culture, and in
the human organism

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.940 align:middle line:10%
has been completely radical
and life changing for me.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And I have learned
to understand it

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.810 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a group
of feminine energies

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.270 align:middle line:84%
that come out of the Hindu
tradition whom we call Shakti.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Shakti is a word that means
energy or feminine power.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But they are the
same energies that

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.390 align:middle line:84%
have been described
with different faces

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and different forms
in other cultures.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and who was it?

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.420 align:middle line:84%
Was it Joseph Campbell who
coined the term archetype?

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, Joseph Campbell,
who is, of course,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:84%
one of the great mythologists of
all time is certainly of modern

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.380 align:middle line:90%
times.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And Carl Jung came up
with the understanding

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.300 align:middle line:84%
of the archetype
as a collective-- a

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.090 align:middle line:90%
quality that's transpersonal.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.120 align:middle line:84%
You know, it transcends
the human individual.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.000 align:middle line:84%
But it's expressed
through human individuals.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that Jung
says and that I've actually

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:84%
heard Jean Houston, who's
also a mythologist talk about

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.710 align:middle line:84%
is that everyone who's ever done
something really great in life

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:84%
has had some kind of
conscious connection

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.260 align:middle line:90%
to an archetypal energy--

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:90%
that to a sense of guidance.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And many people, of
course, think it's God.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.960 align:middle line:84%
They-- you know, they call
that guiding consciousness God.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.370 align:middle line:90%
But if you really look into--

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.630 align:middle line:84%
so say, for example, Abraham
Lincoln's relationship with

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.850 align:middle line:84%
personal deity-- you
realize that there--

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.280 align:middle line:84%
he was acting-- he was relating
to an archetype that stood

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.629 align:middle line:90%
for justice, truth, compassion--

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:46.170 align:middle line:84%
you know, that was
a sacred archetype

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.090 align:middle line:90%
that he held very close.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that, as
human beings, this--

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.020 align:middle line:84%
the ability to connect
to archetypal energies

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
is very important
for our development

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.060 align:middle line:84%
and for our sense of connection
to the world and each other.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you define the word
archetype-- the concept of it?

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, an archetype is--

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:14.220 align:middle line:84%
it's a principle that
encompasses certain qualities

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.300 align:middle line:90%
in the cosmos.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.019 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, one of
the classic archetypes

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:84%
is that I would call it the
Aphrodite archetype that which

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.220 align:middle line:84%
everyone in Western
culture understands

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.580 align:middle line:84%
to be the archetype of
beauty, eroticism, sexuality.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And we see certain
human beings who

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.450 align:middle line:90%
carry the Aphrodite archetype.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And we immediately recognize
that transpersonal quality.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.210 align:middle line:84%
You know, for instance,
a great example

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
is Princess Diana,
who so incarnated

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:84%
the qualities of feminine beauty
not just as an individual.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.680 align:middle line:84%
But she was tuned in--
tapped into something

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that millions of
people felt. I would

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.170 align:middle line:84%
say you know not to deny
Diana's individual qualities.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:84%
But what we felt when we
loved her was goddess,

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.670 align:middle line:84%
a particular form of
the divine feminine

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:84%
that acted through her form
when she was at her best.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
You know, obviously she
was also a human being

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:90%
with all her stuff.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So that to understand that
there are archetypal energies

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.430 align:middle line:84%
that we as humans can tune
into and get strength from

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.330 align:middle line:84%
and experience guidance through
is a very, very empowering.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and another one just
to relate because it's slightly

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.660 align:middle line:84%
more connected to
the masculine is--

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.535 align:middle line:84%
someone brought this up
to me the other day--

00:05:39.535 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:90%
is the archetype of Peter Pan.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Which I love as an archetype,
because it's this quality

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:53.590 align:middle line:84%
and this energy of young
childhood, kind of freewill,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:84%
lightness, happiness,
adventure, curiosity,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of mischievousness
and exists within each of us.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, right on.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the
king and the queen

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
and the archetype of the
husband and the wife--

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean marriage, for
instance, you know,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:90%
is an archetypal relationship.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And when I was
married I discovered

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.610 align:middle line:84%
that I could walk right into
that marriage archetype.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:90%
I knew how to act.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:90%
I knew how to be.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.564 align:middle line:84%
People knew how to relate to me,
because both I and my husband

00:06:24.564 --> 00:06:26.230 align:middle line:84%
had fit right into
that archetype, which

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.410 align:middle line:84%
has been part of human
life, you know, forever--

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:30.680 align:middle line:90%
for such a long time.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And so this connects
right in to mythology.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And what role in your
experience does mythology play

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.270 align:middle line:84%
obviously in the tradition that
you're initiated into and that

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.890 align:middle line:84%
you've been studying
for a long time?

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:47.440 align:middle line:84%
But we see mythology
also show up

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.620 align:middle line:84%
in the Native
American traditions,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:84%
the aboriginal traditions
of Australia, South America.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:84%
It seems this thread
of myth and story

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
as a way to tap into this
collective consciousness

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and these energies
of archetypes is

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.740 align:middle line:84%
prevalent in many,
many different cultures

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and now becoming more common
or more understood and explored

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:90%
in the modern world.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and it also goes to
the recognition that every one

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.344 align:middle line:84%
of us has a story
that guides us.

00:07:23.344 --> 00:07:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And we may not be
conscious of it.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.900 align:middle line:84%
But you know, for instance,
the American story, right,

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.880 align:middle line:84%
is that these adventurous
souls came to this country--

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.620 align:middle line:84%
to this empty country,
because it tends to leave out

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:84%
the Native Americans--
and create--

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:84%
and explored this
continent and stood

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:90%
for freedom and democracy.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:90%
And this is the American story.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.690 align:middle line:84%
This is a tremendously
inspiring story.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.355 align:middle line:90%
Now it's not true.

00:07:48.355 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.610 align:middle line:90%
It has some truth to it.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.730 align:middle line:84%
But it's not-- that story
does not really describe

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:90%
the American experience.

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:84%
But it's inspired
us for generations.

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And when we lose that
story in a certain sense

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.800 align:middle line:90%
we lose our raison d'etre.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.990 align:middle line:84%
We lose our sense
of groundedness.

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:90%
And I would say myth does that.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.180 align:middle line:84%
The narrative with which we see
our personhood and our lives

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.420 align:middle line:84%
will govern how we
experience our life.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing the great
religious cultures understood

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:90%
is that you need a story.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.180 align:middle line:84%
You know, and so
you need a story

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:34.600 align:middle line:84%
of that famously as
Jung and Campbell both

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:84%
said that there is this ancient
story about the goddess who

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.940 align:middle line:90%
gives birth to a son.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the son goes up and
becomes the goddess' consort

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and then is killed in
order for a new son

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:84%
to be born, a new
consort to come.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And of course,
mythologists explain

00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:59.890 align:middle line:84%
this is connected to
the agricultural cycles.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.080 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the seed
going into the Earth

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and you know, apparently
disappearing and then the plant

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.400 align:middle line:90%
growing.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:84%
But that archetype of the
goddess and the young god who

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.760 align:middle line:84%
is killed then becomes
the Jesus story

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Aha.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So in other words, there's
so many parallels between

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:24.790 align:middle line:84%
the story of Christ on the cross
and the stories say of Isis

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and her murdered husband
whom she brings back to life.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
So these stories become
the heart of religion.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.060 align:middle line:90%
And we take them into ourselves.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And they express something
that's very deep in our psyche

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.880 align:middle line:84%
that we can't express
in a linear way.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:90%
We need a story.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.130 align:middle line:90%
We need an image.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:48.940 align:middle line:84%
We need something that
connects to our emotional body.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.680 align:middle line:90%
And myth does that.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So yeah, the power of
myth and archetype and this

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:59.110 align:middle line:84%
collective consciousness
runs really deep.

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And how do you think this
is applicable and relevant

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:08.140 align:middle line:84%
to the modern person and
in our modern culture?

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all I would
say we all agree that we need

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.230 align:middle line:84%
a narrative to make
sense of our lives.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.880 align:middle line:84%
But in terms of archetypes,
mythic figures, deity figures--

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I would say they
function in several ways

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:84%
that we kind of
can't do without.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:30.039 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is that the
myth tells us how to live.

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:84%
You know, for instance
there's a myth

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:84%
that I teach about a lot, which
is the story of how the goddess

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:90%
Durga defeats a whole army--

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.150 align:middle line:90%
several armies of demons.

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And the story is that bad guys
have taken over the world.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:90%
And the good guys are powerless.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:90%
They can't defeat them.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:90%
So they go to the goddess.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.110 align:middle line:90%
They ask her for help.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And the goddess comes, takes
the form of a beautiful woman,

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and single handedly
defeats these armies.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:84%
But the thing that I always get
from that story and that has--

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.580 align:middle line:84%
that I think generations
of people have gotten--

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.850 align:middle line:84%
is that first of all,
there is divine protection.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:84%
There is something watching
over the world and that

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.410 align:middle line:84%
no matter how bad things
get evil will eventually

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.770 align:middle line:90%
be defeated.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
And so the goddess Durga
stands for that power in nature

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
that will right imbalance
and that we can actually

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.430 align:middle line:84%
count on no matter how
it feels at the moment.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
that myth gives us

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.940 align:middle line:84%
is this understanding
about feminine strength.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:41.720 align:middle line:84%
You know, for women to connect
to an archetypal warrior figure

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.330 align:middle line:90%
is tremendously empowering.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:50.450 align:middle line:84%
So every myth-- I would say
that every really core myth has

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.540 align:middle line:84%
an empowerment in it, you know,
whether it's for instance,

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:84%
the Hanuman stories about
Hanuman leaping over the ocean

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and bringing back--

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:84%
being so strong he can pick up
a mountain and bring it back.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.980 align:middle line:84%
It just-- it's a story
about how we can do anything

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.130 align:middle line:84%
we want to do if we have
enough commitment, you know,

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:14.420 align:middle line:84%
how we have the power
to overcome obstacles.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And that Hanuman
story has given heart

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:84%
to generations and generations
of people who love that myth.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:90%
So we-- I think we need them.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.230 align:middle line:84%
I think we need ways of
making our personal experience

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.440 align:middle line:90%
transpersonal.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think being a
Westerner and having started

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:41.180 align:middle line:84%
to dive into those tales I first
had a pretty big resistance

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.820 align:middle line:84%
to it, because I was
raised very Catholic.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.030 align:middle line:84%
And I really never
resonated with this idea

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:52.070 align:middle line:84%
of there being something
external from me that I needed

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:57.680 align:middle line:84%
to be worried about watching
me and taking hash marks

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.000 align:middle line:84%
as to whether I was
doing good or bad,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
Santa Claus or God.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It just never
felt quite right.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.530 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
I really started

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:84%
to study with you that I
really started to understand,

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
oh, OK, these myths are not
about something external

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:90%
from our ourselves.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's not some other far
off God from another land

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:90%
that I'm trying to worship.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.739 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and I think
that mythology,

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:29.030 align:middle line:84%
especially when you have a
non-dual understanding about

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:33.650 align:middle line:84%
it, when you realize that these
are not just stories about

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:84%
something that might have
happened some time in mythic

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
time but that they actually
describe the way the universe

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.240 align:middle line:90%
works.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look
at war and peace,

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:49.790 align:middle line:84%
if you look at
hunger and thirst,

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:84%
you realize that
all of these are--

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.910 align:middle line:84%
they are actually
archetypal energies

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:58.550 align:middle line:84%
that we experience in
our lives in certain ways

00:13:58.550 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:90%
but that are always--

00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
they're always happening
on the collective level.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we understand that,
then we can start to realize

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that, OK, there is
no God out there--

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.480 align:middle line:84%
you know, that there
is a sacredness that's

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.120 align:middle line:90%
embedded in life.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.070 align:middle line:84%
There is-- you know, that's
at the heart of life.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.340 align:middle line:84%
That's inside,
outside, everywhere.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Everywhere.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, and that we can--

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and I think the thing
about personalizing

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
these energies is that
they actually give us a way

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.630 align:middle line:84%
to relate to energies
that would otherwise

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.220 align:middle line:84%
feel abstract and much too
big for us to connect to.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's go there
a little bit deeper too,

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:84%
because as we start
to talk about, OK,

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:84%
how do we actually take
these things into life?

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.412 align:middle line:84%
What do we-- with
all this information,

00:14:55.412 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:84%
whether we know just a little
bit about the goddesses

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.110 align:middle line:84%
or we're really
deep within it, how

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.290 align:middle line:84%
do we start to take these
things into practical life?

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:05.537 align:middle line:84%
And how do we connect
to these energies?

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:06.620 align:middle line:90%
And where can we see them?

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And are they just for
women since we're talking

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.600 align:middle line:90%
about goddesses specifically?

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And how can we connect
to these energies

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:84%
as tools for personal
transformation?

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and of course, there
are several different ways that

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.470 align:middle line:90%
we can do that.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
There is a paradigm
that I like very much,

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:84%
which is the understanding
that subtle energy exists

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.960 align:middle line:90%
on several different levels.

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.820 align:middle line:84%
So there are the
subtle energies that we

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.710 align:middle line:84%
feel in the atmosphere around
us in nature in the awe

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:84%
that you might experience
when you're in the Rockies

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.380 align:middle line:84%
and looking out over
a mountain landscape.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.650 align:middle line:84%
There are also the energies
that you experience in yourself

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:84%
as you meditate, as
you do yoga, as you

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.290 align:middle line:84%
start to realize
that in you which

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:03.750 align:middle line:84%
is eternal, which is you know,
peaceful, which is powerful.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And then there are what we
call deity energies-- that

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:14.570 align:middle line:84%
is, there are archetypes
that are not human

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and that are not
the physical world

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.850 align:middle line:84%
but are actually
energies in the universe.

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people call
them God, guides.

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:90%
Some people call them spirits.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Some people call them deities.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:32.540 align:middle line:84%
But if we tune in sufficiently
to the subtle energy around us,

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.550 align:middle line:84%
we start to realize
that we actually

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.770 align:middle line:84%
can feel that there
are times when

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:41.250 align:middle line:84%
there are helpful energies that
make a difference in our lives.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:90%
Some people call them angels--

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.120 align:middle line:90%
that those energies are real.

00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:48.110 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
give names to them.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:84%
But if we open to
them, we realize

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:84%
that we are constantly getting
help from the world around us

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.750 align:middle line:84%
and that if we know
how to call on them,

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:03.760 align:middle line:84%
they are available to us and
also that we carry them inside.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
the thing that you

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.460 align:middle line:84%
are getting at-- that
each human being carries

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:84%
certain archetypal
energies that are expressed

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:17.300 align:middle line:84%
through the personality and
that when we can connect them

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.900 align:middle line:84%
to something, let's say,
greater than our than ourselves,

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.849 align:middle line:84%
greater than our
personal lives, then

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:27.770 align:middle line:84%
we start to realize, for
example, that when you get

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:33.860 align:middle line:84%
angry at injustice, that this is
not just personal-- that you're

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:39.320 align:middle line:84%
tapping into a field of force
in the universe that wants

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:43.140 align:middle line:84%
to right injustices, that
as Martin Luther King says,

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.560 align:middle line:90%
that bends towards justice.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And when we experience
beauty that it's

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:84%
because we carry
beauty inside us

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and that if we really get to
know ourselves and understand

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.310 align:middle line:84%
our personalities
and our tendencies,

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
we start to realize that we
as humans with personality

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:13.280 align:middle line:84%
qualities are connected to
these transpersonal energies.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So and if we can skillfully
recognize that, then we

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.880 align:middle line:84%
can draw on those
energies in our actions

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.590 align:middle line:90%
and in our relationships.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And they enhance
everything about our lives.

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to think
of there's someone out there.

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:34.530 align:middle line:84%
There's you know-- there's
Jehovah or Durga whom I'm--

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.100 align:middle line:84%
you know, or Jesus
or Mary who I'm

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:42.740 align:middle line:84%
going to pray to and
they'll help me but more

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:84%
that if I'm willing to open
myself to the presence of grace

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.180 align:middle line:84%
and of helpful energy
coming from within

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and also coming from other
people, coming from around,

00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:01.540 align:middle line:84%
we start to see how
deity energies work.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:06.470 align:middle line:84%
They are the forces of love in
action in the universe really.

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:84%
But they come in
different forms.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are fierce.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are
compassionate and embracing.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:18.200 align:middle line:84%
But they're always trying to
uplift us to make things better

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.230 align:middle line:90%
to empower the good.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:26.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So Sally, would you give us
some tips on how to work with

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.690 align:middle line:84%
these goddess
archetypal energies?

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I'd love to.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm going to offer you
is an actual visual meditation

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:84%
practice that you can do
to invoke and call forth

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.470 align:middle line:90%
a sense of the divine feminine.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And you can do this
practice with any deity.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't even
have to be a deity.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:84%
You can do it with your
grandmother if it--

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:52.160 align:middle line:84%
so the idea is that
you call on a higher

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:57.410 align:middle line:84%
power in a very specific
form and feel your connection

00:19:57.410 --> 00:19:59.900 align:middle line:90%
and ask for help.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Dialogue whatever
feels right for you.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.940 align:middle line:90%
So you can close your eyes.

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And ground yourself
so that you actually

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.640 align:middle line:84%
feel the contact of your
sit bones against your seat.

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Feel that you're taking
the support of the seat.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And inhale grounding through
the base of the body.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Exhale lifting
through the crown.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that you're sitting
in a very, very beautiful

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:37.970 align:middle line:84%
mountain grove with
overhanging trees and very

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.460 align:middle line:90%
beautiful flowers and bushes.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:46.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a green lawn in
front of you around you.

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:48.800 align:middle line:90%
And you're feeling very relaxed.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.640 align:middle line:90%
The air is warm.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.380 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:84%
As you sit you become aware
that there is a radiant energy

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:84%
that's moving towards
you over the mountains

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.310 align:middle line:90%
coming closer and closer.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And when it becomes close
enough for you to distinguish

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:11.580 align:middle line:84%
the features you see
that it is the form

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:84%
of an exquisitely
beautiful woman

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:84%
with golden skin
with long dark hair

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.470 align:middle line:90%
and very bright large eyes.

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And as you discern
her features you

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle line:84%
feel that her energy is flowing
towards you as deep compassion

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.440 align:middle line:90%
and love.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:43.880 align:middle line:84%
She seats herself in front of
you looking into your eyes.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And you allow yourself
to breathe her energy,

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:52.340 align:middle line:84%
to take in her energy
with every inhalation

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and to exhale it
through your body.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:90%


00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:08.610 align:middle line:84%
As you watch this
feminine figure

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:84%
you become aware
that from her heart

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.580 align:middle line:90%
is flowing a radiant blue light.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:84%
It's flowing from her
heart into your heart.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And as you take in the
rays of blue light coming

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:84%
from her heart you feel that
light opening your heart,

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.340 align:middle line:90%
opening your entire inner body.

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that there
are depths of compassion,

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:41.760 align:middle line:84%
depths of love, depths of
sweetness that are literally

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:84%
being breathed into
you by a goddess.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.610 align:middle line:90%
She's breathing grace into you.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:52.500 align:middle line:90%
She's breathing love into you.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.630 align:middle line:90%
She's breathing power into you.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.420 align:middle line:90%
She's breathing safety into you.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.010 align:middle line:84%
She's breathing
awareness and insight.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.670 align:middle line:90%
And you draw it in.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And you breathe it
back out until you

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.410 align:middle line:90%
realize that you're in a dance.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.000 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.617 align:middle line:90%
You're breathing in her light.

00:23:11.617 --> 00:23:12.950 align:middle line:90%
You're breathing it back to her.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:16.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And as you sit with this
sacred feminine presence

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:31.790 align:middle line:84%
you hear from her, is there
anything you want and need

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:90%
in this moment?

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.630 align:middle line:84%
It's an invitation to speak
your desires or your fears.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And you take a moment to say
whatever it is that you're

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:48.170 align:middle line:90%
moved to say or to ask for.

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:56.060 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps some wisdom
or insight flows

00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:04.070 align:middle line:90%
in this moment from this being.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Or perhaps you just speak
or ask your question

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.600 align:middle line:90%
and let yourself be.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.570 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
this moment when

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.790 align:middle line:84%
you realize that
you are being asked

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:20.240 align:middle line:84%
to breathe her into your
body, into your heart.

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And you literally feel as though
this sacred feminine figure

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:84%
dissolves into particles
of light, which

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:36.740 align:middle line:84%
flow in with your breath and
become part of your own energy

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.290 align:middle line:90%
field.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:48.830 align:middle line:84%
So as you move as you speak
you have been empowered

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:55.790 align:middle line:84%
to move and speak with
the love with the grace,

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
with the presence of this energy
which has become a part of you.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.270 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And you can return to this
contemplation any time.

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:07.790 align:middle line:90%
Refresh it.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Deepen it.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.850 align:middle line:90%
Ask questions.

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.980 align:middle line:84%
And this practice is
really a wonderful way

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:84%
to invoke the help of the
divine forces that are literally

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:33.587 align:middle line:84%
present around us just
waiting to be asked.

00:25:33.587 --> 00:25:34.420 align:middle line:90%
They're not distant.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.290 align:middle line:90%
They're not far off.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:36.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to be good.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.430 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to be successful.

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.730 align:middle line:84%
We just have to open
ourselves and ask

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:48.940 align:middle line:84%
to know that there are countless
loving sacred presences that

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.950 align:middle line:84%
really want to help us
navigate this world.

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:54.970 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:56.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Sally.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:58.824 align:middle line:90%
That was so beautiful.

00:25:58.824 --> 00:26:01.040 align:middle line:90%
And we can do that with any--

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:01.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Any--

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Archetype.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Any archetype.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:07.574 align:middle line:84%
>> Anyone, any energy that we
wish to call into ourselves

00:26:07.574 --> 00:26:08.740 align:middle line:90%
or awaken within ourselves--

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:09.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Or awaken within ourselves.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it is
not outside of us.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well and doing this
practice will awaken our sense

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.630 align:middle line:90%
of those energies.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Often when I teach
this in a group people

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.030 align:middle line:84%
will share that what
comes to them is not

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:26.730 align:middle line:84%
an official deity
but a light or a--

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, someone who's
been very meaningful to them

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.980 align:middle line:90%
who's no longer in the world.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So in a certain sense what we
are doing in this practice is

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:34.900 align:middle line:90%
calling on--

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:90%
let's call them guardians--

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:41.330 align:middle line:84%
the-- if some people
would call them ancestors.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.780 align:middle line:90%
They take many forms.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:49.990 align:middle line:10%
And the thing is to
know that this world--

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:56.830 align:middle line:10%
the subtle world is present
for us and wants to help.

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And once you start to get that
then your whole relationship

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.730 align:middle line:90%
to the world starts to change.

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Lovely.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Well thank you for being here.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.778 align:middle line:84%
It's always amazing
to be with you.

00:27:07.778 --> 00:27:09.000 align:middle line:90%
>> You are so welcome.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm so delighted to talk
to you and to really feel

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.050 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom with which you
offer these sessions for so

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:90%
many people.
