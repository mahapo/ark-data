>> Hey, I'm Ashleigh Sergeant,
and welcome to "Everyday

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.050 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment."

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.040 align:middle line:10%
This is your go-to show
that offers practical tips

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:10%
from expert guests at the
end of each episode that

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.350 align:middle line:10%
will help you be more
conscious in the midst

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.450 align:middle line:10%
of your busy modern life.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
According to the National
Alliance on Mental Illness,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:84%
nearly 62 million
Americans suffer

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.890 align:middle line:90%
from mental illness per year--

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.830 align:middle line:90%
that's one in four adults.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:84%
The American Academy
of Pain Medicine

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.310 align:middle line:84%
reports that more than 1.5
million people worldwide

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:90%
suffer from chronic pain.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.920 align:middle line:84%
How are mental illnesses
related to emotional imbalances?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And how do neglected
and unprocessed emotions

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
contribute to diseases
like chronic pain, anxiety,

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.600 align:middle line:90%
weight gain, and depression?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.200 align:middle line:10%
Today, my guest
is Sujatha Reddy--

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:10%
an Ayurvedic practitioner
for more than 25 years.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.830 align:middle line:10%
Sujatha has a master's in
mental health counseling,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:10%
is a licensed
professional counselor,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.210 align:middle line:10%
and specializes in
Ayurvedic psychology.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
She works with
individuals who suffer

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.430 align:middle line:84%
from anxiety and depression
and are diagnosed

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:90%
with a multitude of diseases.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.834 align:middle line:84%
Sujatha, thank you so much
for being here with me today.

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:31.000 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome, Ashleigh.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to be here.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Can you tell us a little bit
about Ayurveda as a practice--

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:10%
for people who maybe you're
not familiar with Ayurveda.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And also, according to the
tradition of Ayurveda-- why

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
are we having such massive
disturbances in mental illness

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and chronic pain in our
culture and society today?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Ayurveda is a holistic entire
system of medicine from India,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:10%
which is 5,000 years old.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.200 align:middle line:10%
And it helps us
understand who we are.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:84%
And how we need to live in the
rhythm of nature in balance

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.180 align:middle line:84%
to maintain good health
in mind, body, and spirit.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's really
totally holistic.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.360 align:middle line:90%
>> It is very holistic.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we suffer today
from either mental or physical

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.300 align:middle line:84%
illnesses is because
we are out of balance.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
Out of balance with
our own constitution.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, there are
three main constitutions

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.370 align:middle line:90%
that are described.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.520 align:middle line:84%
It is called the vata,
the pitta, and the kapha.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And this stems from
the five elements

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
which are in nature, in
which the whole existence is

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:90%
manifested from--

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.870 align:middle line:84%
which is the fire, water,
air, aether, and Earth.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Every atom and matter also has
all of those five elements.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.940 align:middle line:84%
In our body, every cell is
made up of those five elements.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.290 align:middle line:84%
And so we really are not
different from the nature

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and the whole
universal existence.

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:90%
We are part of the whole.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.220 align:middle line:84%
And we are born with this
unique constitution--

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
depending on our
genetic makeup, you

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.290 align:middle line:84%
could have either just a
dominant vata constitution

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.230 align:middle line:84%
or a pitta constitution,
or a kapha constitution.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:84%
Or you could have a combination
of vata-pitta, pitta-kapha,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.050 align:middle line:90%
or the kapha-vata constitution.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.910 align:middle line:84%
The vata constitution has the
air and the aether element

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:90%
dominant.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
The pitta constitution has
the fire and the water element

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:90%
dominant in it.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And the cover kapha
constitution has the water

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.140 align:middle line:90%
and the Earth element dominant.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
We do have all
five constitutions,

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.870 align:middle line:90%
but these are the dominant ones.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:84%
And we are defined by the
dominant constitution.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Depending on our
dominant constitution,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.620 align:middle line:84%
we have certain tendencies
and certain imbalances

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.270 align:middle line:84%
that we are born with in
our genetic blueprint.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So they're not that just
happened to us by the way we

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.520 align:middle line:90%
live.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.720 align:middle line:84%
They're also part of how we
naturally come into this world.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And where were born, in terms
of a country, or regions,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.459 align:middle line:90%
or environment--

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.750 align:middle line:90%
all those matter.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.290 align:middle line:10%
And even at the time of
conception, the mindset

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.110 align:middle line:10%
and the health of
the parents matter.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.150 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes very important if
a child has to be conceived--

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.670 align:middle line:84%
how they lived in balance
in their mind and body.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And that formation of the
fetus is all defined by that.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So our health depends
not just with us,

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
but with our parents
and our experiences

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.020 align:middle line:84%
that we have had in
our past lives, too.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Those impressions are embedded
in our genetic protocols.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:10%
And when we live
life in balance,

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.140 align:middle line:10%
you can actually postpone
those or completely eliminate

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.480 align:middle line:10%
those genetic tendencies.

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.890 align:middle line:84%
>> This is a big study in
science right now epigenetics,

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:90%
and things--

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
>> It's called epigenetics and
we've been hearing a lot about

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.160 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.576 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us a little bit more
about that and how it relates

00:05:23.576 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:90%
to Ayurveda.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Because what I'm
hearing you say is

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:84%
that, there's a lot
of different factors

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.600 align:middle line:90%
that could cause us imbalance.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of hard to think
like, oh, my gosh-- well,

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.630 align:middle line:84%
maybe my parents were in
a really difficult space

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:38.680 align:middle line:90%
when they conceived me.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Or my mom was sick
during pregnancy

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.640 align:middle line:84%
and I've lived in really
stressful environments.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:50.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of easy to feel
that there's so many factors

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.050 align:middle line:84%
working against us
where maybe we don't

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.060 align:middle line:90%
feel like we have free will.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.640 align:middle line:84%
Or we don't feel like
we have the power

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:90%
to actually make change.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:84%
But with this study
of epigenetics,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.790 align:middle line:84%
it's actually
confirming what Ayurveda

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
has been saying for a long time,
which is by actually making

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.930 align:middle line:84%
lifestyle choices, we can start
to reverse and change things

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.850 align:middle line:84%
that we before, used
to think were not

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.530 align:middle line:90%
possible to be changed.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:90%
>> You're so right.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.990 align:middle line:84%
You are who your
grandmother was.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:84%
So what your grandmother
did in her lifetime

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:90%
can affect the grandchild.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.110 align:middle line:84%
During pregnancy, it's
not about just the fetus,

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:84%
it's also about the
ovaries of the fetus--

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.320 align:middle line:84%
that everything is
transpired into.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And the granddaughter
inherits even a cancer gene

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:90%
because of that.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.220 align:middle line:84%
If the grandmother was taking
hormones and unhealthy eating

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.050 align:middle line:90%
and unhealthy lifestyle--

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.170 align:middle line:84%
that can actually
cause a blueprint

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.660 align:middle line:84%
to the grandchild,
not just the mom.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
So it goes as long
as three generations.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.790 align:middle line:84%
By taking responsibility, by
having that knowledge today--

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.820 align:middle line:84%
what we have is we
can change that.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.800 align:middle line:84%
If not for us, for
our next generation.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.980 align:middle line:84%
We can give them that
gift of living healthy

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
so it becomes so important
to live in this true self,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:21.370 align:middle line:90%
in this rhythm.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And eating healthy
foods, exercising,

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.800 align:middle line:84%
and not putting
chemicals in our body.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.260 align:middle line:84%
And not getting
carried away with

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.610 align:middle line:84%
a lot of foods that
are pushed on us,

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.062 align:middle line:90%
which is completely not natural.

00:07:35.062 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And let's talk about that
a little bit because one

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.390 align:middle line:84%
of the things that you said in
the beginning is we learn to be

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.620 align:middle line:84%
able to live in greater
connection with nature.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And that when we're not
connected with nature,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.410 align:middle line:84%
it's one of these reasons that's
causing us to be imbalanced.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And I can think of so many
ways that that's happening.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.420 align:middle line:90%
On the computers all the time.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.850 align:middle line:90%
Living mostly indoors.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:03.370 align:middle line:84%
Living in these big
metropolitan cities

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.280 align:middle line:84%
where we can't even really,
actually see the sunrise

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:90%
or the moon rise or set.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And we're constantly
around stimulation.

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Like what you said-- we're
eating processed foods.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.730 align:middle line:84%
How do all of these contribute
to having mental illness

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.240 align:middle line:90%
and chronic pain manifesting?

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything what we are doing
today is a sensory overload.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:84%
When we say sensory overload,
it is through our five senses.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:39.390 align:middle line:84%
We are eating what we
are not supposed to eat.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.480 align:middle line:90%
>> And too much of it.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:90%
>> And too much of it.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And we are hearing music
that the decibel levels still

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.740 align:middle line:90%
unproportional levels.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And we are not actually
doing things in sync

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.250 align:middle line:84%
with the nature, which
is especially the sun--

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:90%
the day and the night.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.050 align:middle line:90%
The bio rhythm of the nature.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Everyday when we wake up,
we see that the sun is up.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:90%
The birds are up.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.520 align:middle line:90%
Why aren't we up at that time?

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.130 align:middle line:84%
So the sun actually
is a metaphor

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.540 align:middle line:84%
for how our metabolism
runs in our body.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.410 align:middle line:84%
When there is a
sunrise, it's not

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.440 align:middle line:84%
very hot in the morning
and talking about doshas--

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.260 align:middle line:84%
the elements-- the water element
is very high in the morning.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle line:84%
The fire element is low--
the energy is still low

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:90%
when the sun is rising.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>> So we need to slowly wake up.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:40.970 align:middle line:84%
>> We need to wake up and then
slowly get into the rhythm.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is we are
not really hungry that early

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:90%
in the morning.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So it takes at least
two hours for us

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.180 align:middle line:90%
to even feel the hunger--

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:52.960 align:middle line:84%
that's why we eat
a light breakfast.

00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And as we go on in the day, the
sun is at its peak from 11:30

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.150 align:middle line:90%
to 2:30 or 3:00 PM--

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.660 align:middle line:84%
that's when our
metabolism is very high.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.590 align:middle line:84%
That is when we are supposed to
eat the highest protein so we

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.580 align:middle line:90%
can digest our food properly.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And during that time, we
should not be eating ice.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually going
to damper the fire--

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
the digestive fire-- and it does
not digest the food properly.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And the food only stays for
a limited time in the stomach

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:36.590 align:middle line:90%
and it moves on.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.210 align:middle line:84%
As much as possible, we have
to enhance the digestion.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, we don't
recommend drinking ice

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:48.462 align:middle line:84%
water between meals and when
we are eating meals, actually.

00:10:48.462 --> 00:10:50.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it dampens
the digestive fire.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And especially, ice-- maybe
you can sip a little bit

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.640 align:middle line:90%
so you can push the food down.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
Drinking water is usually
after half hour of eating--

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:84%
that's when your
food is well-digested

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and then it moves on to the
duodenum and small intestine

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.060 align:middle line:90%
for absorption.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're not actually
developing any toxins.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And if we do not
follow these rules,

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.930 align:middle line:84%
then we are only
accumulating toxins,

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.355 align:middle line:84%
which then is absorbed
and then moves along

00:11:25.355 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:84%
our bloodstream and
manifests into disease.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Then you have
tendencies, especially

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:90%
with your constitution--

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So really, the same
type of imbalances,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.800 align:middle line:84%
meaning if we don't
get enough sleep,

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.480 align:middle line:84%
if we eat at the
wrong times of day,

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
if we're not in
sync with nature--

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.060 align:middle line:84%
all of these same
factors can actually

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.770 align:middle line:84%
start to express themselves as
many different things based off

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:90%
of our tendencies.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Meaning for one person,
the same kind of imbalances

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.200 align:middle line:90%
may manifest as depression.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Where for another
person, the same causes

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.350 align:middle line:84%
might actually
manifest as anxiety.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:07.280 align:middle line:90%
Correct?

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And not just the food, you're
also absorbing emotions, too.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:19.835 align:middle line:84%
There are impressions
that you have--

00:12:19.835 --> 00:12:24.770 align:middle line:84%
our body has this built
in survival mechanism.

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.440 align:middle line:84%
What it does is when
there is danger,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:90%
it is going to warn you.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It is the amygdala--
the midbrain--

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:34.100 align:middle line:84%
that really is built in
since thousands of years

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:84%
ago when human beings in
the caves how they survived.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:46.520 align:middle line:84%
When there was danger, they
would either fight or flight.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It used to be wild
animals in those days.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's true.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:84%
And our body, our
physiology actually--

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
even though we've evolved
past really having

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
to be worried about wild animals
or be worried about being eaten

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.570 align:middle line:84%
by a saber tooth tiger or
something along those lines--

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.140 align:middle line:84%
but actually, our
physiology still

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.430 align:middle line:84%
responds to those same potential
threats in the same way, right?

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:12.740 align:middle line:84%
So if we're worried
about money--

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.540 align:middle line:90%
I can't make my rent.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:90%
Or a job, my boss.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.610 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, my gosh, I need
to lose more weight.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Or oh, my gosh, I'm not
going to have enough time

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:90%
to get this report in.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Those same types of
perceived dangers

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:84%
cause that same type of
reaction in our body, right?

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.070 align:middle line:90%
The same fight or flight.

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So these days, it's
not the wild animals.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.280 align:middle line:84%
It is all the other
dangers in the society,

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.690 align:middle line:90%
in the environment.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Whether it is stress.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is artificial
foods or processed foods.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Whether it is toxic
relationships.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:51.525 align:middle line:90%
Whether it is toxic friendships.

00:13:51.525 --> 00:13:54.710 align:middle line:90%
It's all of that, that our--

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:58.580 align:middle line:84%
there's a threat to
our body and mind

00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:84%
that it tells us in
the form of disease,

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:06.260 align:middle line:84%
in the form of anxiety,
in the form of depression.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.130 align:middle line:90%
All of that.

00:14:07.130 --> 00:14:12.635 align:middle line:84%
And the happiness index and
the fear operated by fear

00:14:12.635 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:84%
is so high that
people have become

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.530 align:middle line:90%
so vigilant and so fearful.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:27.140 align:middle line:84%
They are living life in a very
subconscious, unconscious way.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And not really in
a conscious way.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:84%
Almost like victim
to our circumstances

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.080 align:middle line:90%
and our environment.

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's time that we
take responsibility

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:84%
to understand and listen
to our body, first,

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:50.870 align:middle line:84%
and see and go access that
deep calm space within us.

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:54.380 align:middle line:84%
And really be vigilant about
what we put in our body.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And what we are actually
bombarding ourselves

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.042 align:middle line:90%
with that we don't need to.

00:15:00.042 --> 00:15:02.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the things
that I've always found

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:84%
so fascinating with Ayurveda
is from PTSD, to infertility,

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.970 align:middle line:84%
to postpartum, to perimenopause,
to anxiety, to depression--

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
in Western culture, we look at
these as being very individual

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:90%
and separate different issues.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Where we have
specialists that need

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.090 align:middle line:84%
to help with each
specific one as

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:28.330 align:middle line:84%
if there were different
imbalances within each one.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:31.030 align:middle line:84%
But what's amazing
about Ayurveda--

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:36.610 align:middle line:84%
how does this connect to the
collective consciousness?

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So that when we start to
do some of this healing

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves,
that we actually

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.840 align:middle line:90%
are really healing everyone?

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.960 align:middle line:84%
The collective consciousness--
all of our brothers,

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.090 align:middle line:84%
and sisters, and ancestors
of humanity on the planet.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:84%
We've heard about
environmental pollution.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And how much
everything gets dumped.

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And how things get
imbalanced in nature.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.340 align:middle line:90%
We are hearing about the fires.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.820 align:middle line:84%
We are hearing about
the floods these days.

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And all of those are the
imbalances of nature.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, you can classify them as
vata, pitta, kapha imbalances.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle line:84%
The same base--
nothing different.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:84%
What we do to our
own body that we

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:21.040 align:middle line:84%
can cause imbalances of those
three doshas in our body.

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:90%
And what can we do?

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we have
to reduce pollution.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Not put toxins out
there in the environment

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:90%
to protect our Earth.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Not just that, we
have to also see

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.170 align:middle line:84%
how we are taking care
of us and the imbalances.

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.280 align:middle line:84%
If there is a completely
kapha imbalance in our body,

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.450 align:middle line:84%
then we are going to experience
respiratory problems, weight

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:45.490 align:middle line:90%
gain issues, diabetes--

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:90%
all of those tendencies.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Those imbalances and
diseases are caused.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:84%
In Ayurveda, a common theme
is like increases like.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.730 align:middle line:90%
And then opposites balance.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:02.590 align:middle line:84%
So when like
increases like-- say

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:84%
you have a tendency--
you have a sweet tooth.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:84%
If you over eat and keep
eating those sweets--

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:15.400 align:middle line:84%
we are going to develop
diseases with that.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And our constitution--
if we have

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:84%
a kapha constitution--
a tendency is to

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.079 align:middle line:90%
crave for sweets.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:27.349 align:middle line:84%
If we become mindful
about that and then say,

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:29.890 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is my
body constitution.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.160 align:middle line:84%
I am not actually supposed
to be eating any of this.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I can taste
it a little bit.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
We always need all
the sixth tastes

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:40.090 align:middle line:90%
for our body to be in balance.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:44.080 align:middle line:84%
But the proportions change
from how much a vata person has

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:84%
to eat of which taste and a
pitta person of which taste,

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.410 align:middle line:84%
and the kapha person
of which taste.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Because each taste
has its own property

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.640 align:middle line:84%
that has an effect
on our health.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And so really, what you're
saying is that we have to be

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.720 align:middle line:84%
able to find our natural rhythm
and reside in our constitution

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:12.520 align:middle line:84%
If we think of mothers or
we think of relationships--

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.850 align:middle line:84%
if we don't find that
natural rhythm and balance

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.940 align:middle line:84%
within ourselves, if we
don't process our emotions,

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:23.860 align:middle line:84%
give ourself enough time to wake
up to digest food and emotions,

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.090 align:middle line:90%
to sleep enough--

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:31.360 align:middle line:84%
then we're automatically
passing that off to others.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.820 align:middle line:84%
We have to stabilize
ourself, first,

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:84%
to be able to make that help
with someone else, including

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.030 align:middle line:84%
family members,
people around us.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about starting
to really understand ourselves.

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:46.266 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we
actually have the ability

00:18:46.266 --> 00:18:48.640 align:middle line:84%
to see how we can help balance
things around us, as well.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to
emotions and stress,

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:55.970 align:middle line:84%
there are people who can
take a lot of stress.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Stress is when the body is
not agreeing with what you do.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:90%
So loving what you do--

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.950 align:middle line:84%
you can work hours and days on
end, you're going to be happy.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Stress is when your body
is not connecting to that

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.470 align:middle line:90%
and it's not liking that.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So recognizing that and
being mindful, doing mindful

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.520 align:middle line:84%
practices becomes
very important.

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
And what is palatable to you,
in terms of your environment,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:90%
your works, situation--

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:26.113 align:middle line:90%
>> Knowing your threshold.

00:19:26.113 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And knowing your threshold
as how much can you work?

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:35.350 align:middle line:84%
What one person can do, another
person may not be able to do.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.820 align:middle line:84%
So we have to understand
each one of us are unique.

00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.900 align:middle line:84%
And what we can take on and
what we can not take on.

00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Some people like their own
space, like being introverted,

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:90%
is good for them.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Some people love
being extroverted

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.452 align:middle line:90%
and it's good for them.

00:19:53.452 --> 00:19:55.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that's
an important point.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
It's like we don't have
to change from that.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:57.480 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't have to change.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> If you like to be introverted
and you need to be quiet

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:03.452 align:middle line:84%
and have space in order to
feel like you have energy to be

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.410 align:middle line:84%
in the world-- there's
nothing wrong with that.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There's nothing
wrong with that.

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.637 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you get energy from
being out and moving around--

00:20:08.637 --> 00:20:09.970 align:middle line:90%
there's nothing wrong with that.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.428 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one
of the things we

00:20:11.428 --> 00:20:13.270 align:middle line:84%
see in our society
is everyone's trying

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.890 align:middle line:90%
to fit in a particular mold.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.305 align:middle line:84%
But really, it's about
learning to deal with yourself

00:20:17.305 --> 00:20:18.430 align:middle line:90%
and give you what you need.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:21.010 align:middle line:84%
And also, the
society is dictating

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:24.910 align:middle line:90%
how an individual should look.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not about that.

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:28.150 align:middle line:90%
It's about your constitution.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:33.670 align:middle line:84%
We have to be healthy according
to our own constitution.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we have to wear
a size two or a size zero.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.790 align:middle line:90%
It's about being healthy.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of mental health--

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
girls, especially,
are affected by this.

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Teenagers developing
eating disorders.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Just not being comfortable
with their body image.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:84%
And being told that you
are fat or you are too thin

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.890 align:middle line:84%
is not defining who
they really are.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:06.490 align:middle line:84%
We all have immense
potential to unleash.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.250 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing is that we have

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:90%
to be happy with who we are.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And we have to understand
how we treat this one

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:18.760 align:middle line:84%
vessel that we're born
with just for this life.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.820 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to worry about
anything more than that.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Sujatha, we talked
about so many things

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and all these wide
variety of ways

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:30.910 align:middle line:84%
to be able to help to
manage our emotions

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:90%
and keep ourselves in balance.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Would you enlighten us with
a couple of really clear tips

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.890 align:middle line:90%
that anyone can use?

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Depending on their imbalance,
it doesn't necessarily

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:45.490 align:middle line:84%
really matter that they could
apply some specific things

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.720 align:middle line:84%
to their day to help
them remain in harmony.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.060 align:middle line:84%
>> In the morning
when you wake up,

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:59.440 align:middle line:84%
give gratitude to the day
that you are awake today.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And decide how you
want your day to flow.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.630 align:middle line:84%
In front of the mirror,
check on how you're doing.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.700 align:middle line:90%
How beautiful you are.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:84%
During the day, when
you feel stressed--

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.560 align:middle line:90%
take a deep breath.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:21.190 align:middle line:90%
Sit with yourself on the hour.

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:26.440 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to be so
productive just with that.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Have dinner three hours
before you go to bed.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat, eat your
half stomach with solids.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.680 align:middle line:84%
One fourth of your stomach
has to be with liquids.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
fourth has to be empty.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:49.690 align:middle line:84%
So you're actually having
all the five elements

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:54.610 align:middle line:84%
in the stomach for
the digestive process.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.060 align:middle line:90%
Sleep between 10:00 and 11:00.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And get a good night's sleep, at
least for seven to eight hours.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Just these few tips will
help you become more mindful

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.250 align:middle line:84%
and fall into the
rhythm of your day.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much, Sujatha.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Super helpful and I think
really appropriate for everybody

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:90%
in our modern day.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:19.990 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.500 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for having me.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.200 align:middle line:84%
I hope these tips
have been helpful.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And now, you have some new
tools for your daily life.

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.260 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.010 align:middle line:90%
