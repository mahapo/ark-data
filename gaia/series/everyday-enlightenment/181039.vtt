00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey, I'm Ashleigh Sergeant,
and welcome to "Everyday

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.190 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment," your go-to show
that offers practical tips from

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.830 align:middle line:10%
expert guests at the
end of every episode,

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.770 align:middle line:10%
designed to help you be
more conscious in the midst

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.180 align:middle line:10%
of your busy modern life.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.830 align:middle line:84%
We've all noticed how our mental
state and breathing changes

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.380 align:middle line:84%
when we exercise or move
our body in some way that

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.830 align:middle line:84%
challenges us and maybe
you've also noticed that when

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.250 align:middle line:84%
you get anxious, scared,
or angry, that your breath

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:84%
pattern changes and usually
becomes jagged and unbalanced.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, if physical
movement changes

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:84%
the mind and the breath,
is it also possible

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.190 align:middle line:84%
that controlling our
breath can drastically

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.390 align:middle line:84%
change the conditioning of
our mind and of our bodies?

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Today, my guest is Dr.
Joe Dispenza, a doctor,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.060 align:middle line:10%
a scientist, and a
modern-day mystic

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.190 align:middle line:10%
known for sharing
altering discoveries

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:10%
of quantum science
and the deep teachings

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.750 align:middle line:10%
that adepts of
the past dedicated

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:10%
their entire
lifetimes to master.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Joe, thanks for
being here today with me.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm very happy
to be with you.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I loved reading
in your most recent book,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:84%
"Becoming Supernatural," one of
the chapters specifically where

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:84%
you talk about a breath that
helps us pull the mind out

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:90%
of the body.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Well we have a body in our
mind, mapped in the brain,

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:90%
and we have a mind in our body.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.190 align:middle line:10%
And Descartes kind of separated
the two but there's never

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.990 align:middle line:10%
a time where the body
isn't influencing the mind

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.570 align:middle line:10%
and there's never time where
the mind isn't influencing body.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they're
one and the same.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
So the majority of
people's thoughts

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:84%
are connected to
certain feelings

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:84%
that influence very specific
hormonal centers in the body.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you
think an angry thought,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
you are going to release
certain chemicals that

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.449 align:middle line:90%
activate your adrenal system.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.260 align:middle line:84%
You're going to begin to
activate survival systems.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.530 align:middle line:84%
If you feel suffering or if you
feel pain or you feel guilty,

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
you produce a different
biochemical reaction

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.750 align:middle line:84%
that produces different hormone
centers to be activated.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So most people's
thoughts and feelings

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.740 align:middle line:84%
are taking most of the
energy of those thoughts

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
and storing them in
the first three energy

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.323 align:middle line:90%
centers of the body.

00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:33.430 align:middle line:90%
People call them chakras.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.970 align:middle line:84%
But the first three centers
are centers of survival.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And the procreation,
consumption,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and fight-or-flight is how
most people have survived

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:90%
the majority of their lives.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.920 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
in survival, it's

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.140 align:middle line:84%
not a good time to
open your heart,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.060 align:middle line:84%
so very little
people actually make

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.706 align:middle line:90%
the effort to open their heart.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:84%
And most of their
thoughts and feelings

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
are activating
these lower centers,

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.750 align:middle line:84%
so the majority of
the body's energy

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.240 align:middle line:84%
is stored in these
first three centers.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.900 align:middle line:84%
So then 95% of that
energy stored in the body

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
has to be liberated and
driven back to the brain.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.770 align:middle line:84%
So we do this breath as a way
to pull the mind out of the body

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:90%
or send the energy.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And yogis would probably
love this breath

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
because they have a lot
of conscious control

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
over the intrinsic
muscles of their body.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.310 align:middle line:84%
So the breath is
about contracting

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:90%
those intrinsic muscles--

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
the muscles of the perineum,
the front and back muscles

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.844 align:middle line:84%
we use for elimination, the
muscles of our lower abdomen

00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:33.760 align:middle line:90%
and our upper abdomen.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.930 align:middle line:84%
When we inhale through our nose
and we squeeze these muscles,

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.210 align:middle line:84%
what we're doing is
we're pulling that energy

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.500 align:middle line:84%
from those lower centers
up into the brain.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.989 align:middle line:84%
Now when you inhale
normally, when we're just

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
hanging out and breathing,
when you inhale,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.780 align:middle line:84%
the sutures of your
skull slightly open up

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.680 align:middle line:90%
and your bone--

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
the base of your spine called
your sacrum, that upside down

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.510 align:middle line:90%
triangle, actually flexes back.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.820 align:middle line:84%
So when you inhale and
those sutures open up

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.290 align:middle line:84%
and your sacrum flexes back,
the spinal fluid drains.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:84%
When you exhale, the
sacrum flexes forward

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and those sutures close
and it pushes the fluid up.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And so inhaling and exhaling
begins to propagate a wave.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's go into that for
a moment here because I think

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people in
the Western world,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.700 align:middle line:84%
or definitely in
the modern world,

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.800 align:middle line:84%
think that in order to really
make change in our body that we

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.744 align:middle line:84%
have to do these big drastic
movements, whether it's yoga,

00:04:30.744 --> 00:04:33.910 align:middle line:84%
but big, sweeping,
hard yoga classes,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:84%
or fitness or cross fit or
P90X or some of these really

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.450 align:middle line:84%
somewhat aggressive forms of
movement tend to be looked

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.020 align:middle line:84%
at as the major way to
make physiological--

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:84%
not just physical,
but physiological

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.050 align:middle line:90%
change inside the body.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And just by you
articulating the way

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.272 align:middle line:84%
that these really
delicate systems

00:04:54.272 --> 00:04:56.230 align:middle line:84%
of the cerebral spinal
fluid and the connection

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.655 align:middle line:84%
between the skull
and the sacrum,

00:04:58.655 --> 00:05:00.640 align:middle line:84%
that's some pretty
profound effects

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.400 align:middle line:84%
that we're talking about
simply by breathing.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.710 align:middle line:84%
That's naturally
happening all the time.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Now cerebrospinal fluid
is made of proteins and salts

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.780 align:middle line:84%
in solution, and proteins
and salts in solution have

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.681 align:middle line:90%
a charge.

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.180 align:middle line:84%
When you drop them
in solution, they

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.170 align:middle line:84%
have a negative or
positive charge.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So now when you begin
to inhale and you

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.310 align:middle line:84%
begin to pull that cerebrospinal
fluid up towards your brain

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:84%
and you accelerate
those charged molecules,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.400 align:middle line:84%
according to physics, when you
accelerate a charged molecule,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.729 align:middle line:84%
you create an invisible field
called an inductance field.

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
So now there's information going
from your brain to your body

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.412 align:middle line:84%
and from your body to
the brain all the time,

00:05:38.412 --> 00:05:39.870 align:middle line:84%
but when you do
this breath and you

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.750 align:middle line:84%
start accelerating
those charged molecules,

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.690 align:middle line:84%
you create this inductance field
moving in a certain direction.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, all that
energy from those lower centers

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.030 align:middle line:90%
start moving up to the brain.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
If you do this properly and
you have a little passion

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
and you start moving
this fluid, there

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.130 align:middle line:84%
will come a moment where the
sympathetic nervous system

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.620 align:middle line:84%
will switch on and merge with
the parasympathetic nervous

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.420 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.180 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, all of
a sudden, all the energy you

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:84%
use to make a baby, all the
energy you use to digest

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle line:84%
a meal, all the energy you
use in a stress response,

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:84%
instead of it
being released out,

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:84%
chemically, it's being
drawn up to the brain.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.190 align:middle line:84%
All that energy goes right
up into the limbic brain

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and it hits a gland
called the pineal gland.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And the pineal gland is
a very specific gland

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
that makes serotonin
and melatonin,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.560 align:middle line:84%
and when that energy strikes
that gland, all of a sudden,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
it begins to produce very
powerful metabolites-- system

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.270 align:middle line:90%
molecules.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
now, the brain

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
becomes super lucid
and the brainwaves

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.530 align:middle line:84%
that we start to measure
are very, very high

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.010 align:middle line:90%
gamma brainwave patterns.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:84%
Now the person is
super conscious.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Now there's more
energy in the brain.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:52.830 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, whatever
is happening between their ears

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:84%
becomes more real,
and in a sense,

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
they're having an
orgasm in their brain.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.030 align:middle line:84%
They're going into
a state of ecstasy.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.100 align:middle line:84%
So then you're transmuting
anger, you're transmuting fear,

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.980 align:middle line:84%
you're transmuting
guilt or suffering.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you use pain as well, too?

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Pain as well.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And so then the liberation of
that energy, all of a sudden,

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.980 align:middle line:84%
from this center all the
way to the top of the brain,

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.620 align:middle line:84%
begins to create a
powerful polarity--

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.560 align:middle line:84%
a positive charge at the
head, a negative charge

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.412 align:middle line:84%
at the tail-- and the body
becomes like a magnet.

00:07:25.412 --> 00:07:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
you start to produce

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.000 align:middle line:84%
this invisible
electromagnetic field.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.640 align:middle line:84%
Now the body is
liberating energy.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, once the pineal
gland is signaled,

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.190 align:middle line:84%
it sends a direct
signal to the pituitary.

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:43.170 align:middle line:84%
The pituitary begins release
two very powerful metabolites

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.500 align:middle line:90%
called oxytocin and vasopressin.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.360 align:middle line:90%
Oxytocin signals nitric oxide.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Nitric oxide causes the arteries
in the heart to begin to swell,

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.670 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, you feel
an incredible amount of love.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.950 align:middle line:90%
Oxytocin is the love chemical.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:84%
When you feel love and
gratitude, all of a sudden,

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.980 align:middle line:84%
you're in a state
of receivership.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a reverse
field that begins to come

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:84%
in the other direction--
we've measured this--

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.310 align:middle line:84%
and that second chemical
is called vasopressin.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And what vasopressin does is it
causes the cells to draw water.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:84%
So people with chronic
bladder infections, people

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
with diverticulitis, people with
food allergies and indigestion,

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.694 align:middle line:90%
acid reflux--

00:08:26.694 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:84%
>> You have them all
do the same breath.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.485 align:middle line:90%
>> They do the same breath.

00:08:29.485 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the
liberation of energy.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.878 align:middle line:84%
And once that energy
starts to move

00:08:33.878 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
and it starts to travel up to
the brain-- we've measured this

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.549 align:middle line:84%
on so many brain
scans, we can actually

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:84%
predict when it's
going to happen.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you seen differences
with how quickly this

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:84%
up-leveling happens when people
actually have this added layer

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.590 align:middle line:84%
of intentionality to it, like
you mentioned about having this

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
intention of making
love to your brain?

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.887 align:middle line:84%
Or are you drawing the
energy and the intention

00:08:56.887 --> 00:08:59.220 align:middle line:84%
from something else that maybe
you would do with passion

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.170 align:middle line:84%
and infusing it
into the practice?

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:07.380 align:middle line:84%
We play really, really inspiring
music and we motivate them.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And so when they assign
meaning to what they're

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:84%
doing-- in other words, when
they inhale and they pull

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:14.740 align:middle line:84%
that energy all the way
up into their brain,

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.690 align:middle line:84%
I ask them to hold
their breath and squeeze

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.917 align:middle line:90%
those muscles a little bit more.

00:09:20.917 --> 00:09:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And when you hold your breath
and squeeze those muscles,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.270 align:middle line:84%
you increase what's called
intrathecal pressure.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And intrathecal
pressure is what you

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.890 align:middle line:84%
use when you lift
something up and you

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:90%
push against your insides.

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Well the pineal gland
sits right at the base

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.510 align:middle line:84%
of the third ventricle and
inside the pineal gland

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:42.930 align:middle line:84%
are these tiny little
calcium carbonate crystals.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.150 align:middle line:90%
They're stacked rhombohedrans.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:84%
They're stacked on
top of each other.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you find the
research-- and I've found it--

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.360 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland has been called
a neuroendocrine transducer

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.010 align:middle line:90%
with piezoelectric properties.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Now those are just big words,
but piezoelectric effect

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.010 align:middle line:84%
is when you take a
mechanical stress

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:04.230 align:middle line:84%
and you apply it
to some crystals

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.050 align:middle line:84%
and it begins to produce
an electric charge.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So then the act of inhaling
and bringing that breath all

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:84%
the way to your brain with
passion and squeezing those

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.290 align:middle line:84%
muscles-- and yogis can
do this really well--

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and holding your
breath, you're exerting

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:18.830 align:middle line:90%
pressure against that--

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:90%
>> To the pineal gland.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.070 align:middle line:90%
>> --pineal gland.

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
And as you start to compress
those stacked crystals,

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:26.580 align:middle line:84%
you begin to produce a
piezoelectric effect.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:28.691 align:middle line:84%
And now you're taking
a mechanical stress

00:10:28.691 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:84%
and you're turning it
into an electrical charge.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.810 align:middle line:84%
Now you're electrically
activating those crystals.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:36.759 align:middle line:84%
And those crystals are very
sensitive to frequency,

00:10:36.759 --> 00:10:39.300 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden, when they
become electrically activated,

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:42.720 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland becomes
like a radio antenna.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And now it can pick
up frequencies faster

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.220 align:middle line:90%
Now why is that important?

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Because your pineal
gland right now

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:52.230 align:middle line:84%
is determining whether there's
enough light in this room,

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.090 align:middle line:84%
and if there's enough
light in this room,

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:84%
it'll make a neurotransmitter
called serotonin.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:59.940 align:middle line:84%
And serotonin gets
your brain up and awake

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.972 align:middle line:84%
and you can function
with conscious awareness.

00:11:02.972 --> 00:11:04.680 align:middle line:84%
But when the light
diminishes and there's

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.080 align:middle line:84%
an inhibition of
light, serotonin

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:90%
is transmuted into melatonin.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And melatonin is the
nighttime neurotransmitter.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.750 align:middle line:90%
It helps us to go to sleep.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.900 align:middle line:84%
But serotonin and melatonin
are directly related

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:18.580 align:middle line:84%
to the wavelength
of visible light.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So then we're producing
certain rhythms and chemicals

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.850 align:middle line:84%
in our normal waking day,
based on our environment.

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:84%
But when the pineal gland
becomes electrically activated,

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
it literally begins to produce a
resonant electromagnetic field.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And now that begins
to send the signal out

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and those crystals stretch until
they can't stretch anymore,

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle line:84%
and then the field reverses and
it compresses those crystals.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you have
a little antenna right up

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.350 align:middle line:84%
in your pineal gland,
and now it can pick up

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.970 align:middle line:84%
frequencies that are faster
than the wavelength of light.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:50.340 align:middle line:90%
That's called the quantum.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
now, it will pick up

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.725 align:middle line:84%
a frequency and transduce--
and a transducer

00:11:55.725 --> 00:11:57.060 align:middle line:90%
is like a television.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It takes a frequency and
turns it into a picture.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, the
person has an inner vision.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And that inner vision is
more real than the world

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:90%
we're sitting in right now.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And melatonin, then, starts to
turn into some very powerful

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:11.640 align:middle line:90%
chemicals.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.430 align:middle line:84%
One of them-- or two of them are
the most powerful antioxidants

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.550 align:middle line:90%
known to man.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Anti-cancer, anti-aging,
anti-heart-disease,

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.670 align:middle line:84%
anti-stroke,
anti-neurodegenerative,

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:23.460 align:middle line:90%
anti-inflammatory.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:84%
Another chemical is
the same chemical

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.745 align:middle line:90%
found in hibernating animals.

00:12:26.745 --> 00:12:27.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm, interesting.

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:31.000 align:middle line:84%
>> No sex drive, no appetite,
no preoccupation with the outer

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:31.800 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:84%
The inner world starts
to become more real.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.490 align:middle line:90%
The body moves into stasis.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.800 align:middle line:84%
It's the same chemical
where the caterpillar

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:90%
becomes the butterfly.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Take the molecule,
tweak it again,

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:90%
you have a benzodiazepine.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.700 align:middle line:90%
It fits in the same receptors.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.860 align:middle line:84%
What it does is it
suppresses the survival

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.970 align:middle line:90%
centers in the brain.

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.830 align:middle line:84%
Take the molecule,
tweak it again,

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and now you have
the same chemical

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.510 align:middle line:84%
found in electric eels-- a very
powerful biophospholuminescent

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:56.310 align:middle line:90%
chemical.

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Tweak it one more time and now
you have dimethyltryptamine,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.250 align:middle line:84%
the most powerful
hallucinogenic known to man.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.062 align:middle line:84%
And now the person's
going on a vision.

00:13:05.062 --> 00:13:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it's
called the third eye.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.770 align:middle line:84%
I call it the first eye because
now it's releasing its elixirs

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
and we start having very
profound dimensional

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:13.530 align:middle line:90%
experiences.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So pulling the mind
out of the body

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.340 align:middle line:84%
is beginning to liberate
energy and it begins

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.020 align:middle line:90%
to produce a magnetic field--

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic field-- when
the latent systems switch on,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.480 align:middle line:84%
now we're going to
access information

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.827 align:middle line:84%
no longer from our
three-dimensional reality.

00:13:26.827 --> 00:13:28.410 align:middle line:84%
We're going to access
that information

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:84%
from the field and
the brain is going

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
to begin the transduce
that frequency,

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:84%
carrying information into
very profound imagery,

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:84%
and the person's going to have
a full-on sensory experience

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.590 align:middle line:84%
without their senses
and it's going

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.930 align:middle line:84%
to be more real than the
world we're sitting in.

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:48.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And having had some
pretty visual experiences

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:84%
in meditation as well, I have
had experiences also that

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.410 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed that not everyone's
nervous system is necessarily

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.680 align:middle line:84%
always ready for
this kind of charge.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And you mentioned
it earlier on, that OK,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.451 align:middle line:84%
the nervous system really
needs to be able to hold this

00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:03.771 align:middle line:90%
charge-- this frequency.

00:14:03.771 --> 00:14:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Can you talk a little
bit about that and--

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:05.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:07.362 align:middle line:84%
>> --preparation
people may need?

00:14:07.362 --> 00:14:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I've been knocked
unconscious, I don't know,

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:11.670 align:middle line:84%
maybe hundreds and
hundreds of times.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.620 align:middle line:84%
I see a flash of light,
that energy goes right

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.210 align:middle line:84%
into my brain, and wow, it's
the most blissful experience

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:18.010 align:middle line:90%
of my life.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I remember,
sometimes I don't, and my body

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.980 align:middle line:84%
will do all kinds
of crazy things

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:84%
because it's information
coming into the body

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and it's got to be able
to process that frequency.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:84%
So where there's
energetic blocks

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.300 align:middle line:84%
or there's a pathway that
it can't move through,

00:14:33.300 --> 00:14:35.950 align:middle line:84%
that energy is going to
have its way with the body.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to cause
the body to do all kinds

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:90%
of wild and crazy things.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's just information.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.170 align:middle line:90%
I mean, our ability--

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:84%
we really have two choices
when this happens, I mean

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.420 align:middle line:90%
from my experience, anyway.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.640 align:middle line:84%
When something unusual
happens-- people always say,

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.840 align:middle line:90%
oh, I want the unknown.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.510 align:middle line:90%
I want the unknown.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:84%
When the unknown comes, a lot
of people aren't ready for it

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.104 align:middle line:84%
because it scares the living
daylights out of them.

00:14:59.104 --> 00:15:00.270 align:middle line:90%
You have one of two choices.

00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:02.400 align:middle line:84%
In our brain scans,
we've actually seen this.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:06.840 align:middle line:84%
A person who gets afraid will
move from that elegant state

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:09.570 align:middle line:84%
into a high beta brainwave
state-- a stress state--

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:11.240 align:middle line:90%
and they'll disconnect.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.470 align:middle line:84%
They'll come back to
their body and they'll

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.330 align:middle line:90%
lose the experience.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Others, they relax
and surrender into it.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.535 align:middle line:84%
And the more you relax
and surrender into it--

00:15:20.535 --> 00:15:23.610 align:middle line:84%
the less you resist it, the
less impedance there is,

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.400 align:middle line:84%
the less physiological
conditions we have.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So when it happens, we have to
literally surrender and relax

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:30.630 align:middle line:90%
into it.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:34.752 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds very easy,
but a lot of times, it's not.

00:15:34.752 --> 00:15:36.210 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times,
it's more difficult

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.430 align:middle line:84%
than we think because it's
a very powerful frequency.

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And the feeling that you have
is a tremendous amount of love

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:84%
if you can fully
surrender to it.

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's not chemical,
it's electric,

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel it in every
single cell of your body.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:56.550 align:middle line:84%
The side effect of that, we've
seen, is a biological upgrade.

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:00.240 align:middle line:84%
We've seen people's
eczema, tumors,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.730 align:middle line:84%
Parkinson's,
rheumatoid arthritis,

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Hashimoto's syndrome,
literally go away

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.500 align:middle line:90%
after one biological upgrade.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.530 align:middle line:84%
All diseases
lowering of frequency

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.690 align:middle line:84%
in an incoherent message, and
you can say, in that moment,

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:84%
when that latent
system switches on

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:84%
and those microtubules
start vibrating,

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.350 align:middle line:84%
you feel such a level
of coherence and order.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.260 align:middle line:84%
You feel connected
to something greater

00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:24.210 align:middle line:84%
that you want to have
that experience again.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And so then the next
time you do that breath,

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:28.482 align:middle line:84%
you have more intention,
you have more passion,

00:16:28.482 --> 00:16:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and you're literally drawing
that energy up into your brain

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.330 align:middle line:90%
and literally-- one woman said--

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.414 align:middle line:84%
her brain scan
was off the chart.

00:16:35.414 --> 00:16:37.830 align:middle line:84%
She said, another one of these
and I don't need a husband.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, she had so much
energy in her brain

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
it was a full on
ecstatic experience.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:84%
So people are doing
it and the side effect

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.300 align:middle line:84%
is that the body begins
to change dramatically.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Super cool.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So can you tell us this breath
or maybe an abridged version

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:54.990 align:middle line:90%
of this breath?

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Would you be able to leave
us with a tip of some version

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.050 align:middle line:84%
of this breath that people
can try on their own

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:84%
at home to maybe get a
little flavor of what

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.981 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about here?

00:17:03.981 --> 00:17:04.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.369 align:middle line:84%
If you could use the same
muscles right now-- contract

00:17:08.369 --> 00:17:13.770 align:middle line:84%
the muscles you use for
elimination, front and back,

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:84%
and you were to lift
those muscles up,

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.079 align:middle line:84%
you would be lifting up your
pelvic floor, your perineum.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:84%
Those are the
muscles we're going

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.530 align:middle line:84%
to use to contract the energy
related to the first center.

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:28.950 align:middle line:84%
If you were to pull your
abdomen in and touch your belly

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.190 align:middle line:84%
button to your spine,
you would be contracting

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:33.960 align:middle line:84%
the second center,
where you would

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:84%
begin to milk the energy
out of the second center.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.850 align:middle line:84%
If you contract
your upper abdomen,

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.580 align:middle line:84%
now you're contracting
the muscles that

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:90%
are related to that center.

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:84%
The act of inhaling
through your nose

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:84%
while you contract
those muscles,

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.390 align:middle line:84%
coupling those together, is
the act of pulling that energy.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Where do we want it to go?

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Right to the top of our head.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.324 align:middle line:84%
So if you took
your finger and you

00:17:56.324 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:84%
were to place it on
the top of your head

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.637 align:middle line:84%
and work your
finger now in there

00:18:00.637 --> 00:18:02.220 align:middle line:84%
and then take your
finger away, if you

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.189 align:middle line:84%
can keep your attention there,
where you place your attention

00:18:05.189 --> 00:18:06.480 align:middle line:90%
is where you place your energy.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.500 align:middle line:90%
So that's your target.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:84%
So the idea, then,
is to close your eyes

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and to inhale, and at the exact
same time that you inhale,

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:21.480 align:middle line:84%
to lift those muscles up and in,
with the intention of pulling

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:84%
the mind out of the body
and liberating energy

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:27.360 align:middle line:84%
and pulling that energy all
the way up into your brain.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.660 align:middle line:84%
As you inhale, one,
slow, steady breath.

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Follow it from your perineum
through your lower abdomen

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:36.300 align:middle line:84%
through your upper
abdomen through your chest

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.012 align:middle line:84%
through your throat
through the brain all

00:18:38.012 --> 00:18:39.720 align:middle line:84%
the way to the top of
your head, and when

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
you get to the top of your
head, hold your breath

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and now squeeze those
muscles a little bit more

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.410 align:middle line:84%
and just pump that fluid up
against the back of your brain

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:90%
and hold it.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And then you exhale,
relax, and feel.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the beginning,
when you learn anything,

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.300 align:middle line:84%
you have to practice
it and it's mechanical.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
But as you keep
practicing, it will

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
become more intuitive
and less step by step.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:90%
It will become one motion.

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:90%
So the act is inhale.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.700 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, perineum,
lower abdomen, upper abdomen.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.430 align:middle line:84%
And as you inhale,
you follow that breath

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.800 align:middle line:84%
all the way up through your
chest, through your throat,

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.710 align:middle line:84%
keep inhaling through your
brain to the top of your head.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:84%
When you get to the
top of your head,

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:84%
drop your shoulders down,
straighten your spine,

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.280 align:middle line:84%
squeeze those muscles
a little bit more.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.410 align:middle line:84%
Put your attention on
the top of your head

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and just push that
fluid a little bit,

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.730 align:middle line:84%
compressing the crystals
of the pineal gland.

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Hold for a few seconds
and then relax and feel it

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:37.270 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Now I would recommend when you
do this to play some music that

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.860 align:middle line:84%
has no lyrics but
has some drums or it

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.530 align:middle line:84%
has some music that
you can interpret

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.720 align:middle line:90%
as the movement of energy.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:84%
If the energy strikes your
brain, don't be afraid of it.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.170 align:middle line:84%
It's just the
liberation of energy.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:90%
Let it happen.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment, keep your
eyes closed, and do it again.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
I would recommend 5
minutes in the beginning

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.430 align:middle line:90%
and work your way up to 10.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.837 align:middle line:84%
Usually, people
who do it properly

00:20:04.837 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
have a very significant amount
of energy in their brain.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.850 align:middle line:84%
We now know that this breath
creates more brain coherence,

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.370 align:middle line:84%
it increases the amount
of energy in the brain,

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:16.680 align:middle line:84%
it activates the
autonomic nervous system,

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and our brain scans show that
it stimulates the pineal gland.

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And those are all
the important things

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.129 align:middle line:90%
to have a mystical experience.

00:20:23.129 --> 00:20:24.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Well thank you so
much for sharing that.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.400 align:middle line:90%
That is--

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.540 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a lot of content.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a lot of information
and the disclaimer as well.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.147 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it takes work
and energy awakenings--

00:20:35.147 --> 00:20:37.730 align:middle line:84%
in the yoga tradition, they may
call them Kundalini awakenings

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
or Kundalini experiences, or
just the new movement of energy

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.620 align:middle line:84%
can be really frightening to
people and can also sometimes

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:47.870 align:middle line:84%
be discouraging if people
are feeling like they're not

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.864 align:middle line:90%
getting it right away.

00:20:49.864 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:90%
I'd say stick with it.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:52.100 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like you're
saying that as well.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.294 align:middle line:90%
And train yourself into it.

00:20:53.294 --> 00:20:54.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it's a skill.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:55.110 align:middle line:90%
You just practice it.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And just like anything else,
you start off like snowboarding.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.480 align:middle line:84%
You've got to lose a lot of
muscles in the beginning,

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and then when you
figure it out, it just

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.970 align:middle line:90%
