[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.390 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey, I'm Ashleigh Sergeant,
and welcome to "Everyday

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.660 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment," your go-to
show for tips on how to be more

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.950 align:middle line:10%
conscious in the midst
of your busy modern life.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:84%
In our Western society,
we're typically not

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.850 align:middle line:84%
taught crucial skills to
work with or process energy,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
culturally we are more
familiar with terms

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:84%
like "man up," "big girls
don't cry," and "fake it

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.770 align:middle line:90%
until you make it."

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:84%
But euphemisms
like this actually

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.220 align:middle line:84%
cause us to ignore our
fundamental human emotions

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:90%
and energies.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Then, these
unprocessed experiences

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:84%
often show up as
unchecked anger,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
irrational fear, chronic
anxiety, and deep sadness.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.700 align:middle line:84%
My guest today, Kevin Courtney,
has dedicated the last 20 years

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to the pursuit of
awakening consciousness.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
He works as an executive
consciousness consultant

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.900 align:middle line:84%
for business and thought leaders
through his program, Insight.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And his work has been featured
in Well and Good, Vogue,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:90%
The New York Times, and Vice.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Kevin, thank you so much
for joining me today.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>> So happy to be here.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so some of the
things that we're conditioned

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.760 align:middle line:84%
to in our Western society,
our modern society,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:84%
I never even looked at them or
had a second thought that these

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
might be things that are
actually causing some

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:84%
of the suffering or some of
the challenges that I had.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:84%
And until I started to
really understand the body,

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
the mind, emotions
through the lens of yoga--

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times we've
been taught in the past,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.220 align:middle line:90%
your mind's up here.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:90%
Just stop thinking about it.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:90%
It'll go away.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:90%
Stop paying attention to that.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's not really
the case, is it?

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.669 align:middle line:10%
>> From the traditions
perspective,

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:10%
it would look at the body really
as a vessel for the whole human

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:10%
So we're looking at--

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.950 align:middle line:10%
or coming to see, through
the practice of yoga,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.180 align:middle line:10%
that this vessel
contains both energy,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.840 align:middle line:10%
thought, feelings, and
then, on a deeper level,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:10%
this essential nature
of consciousness itself.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And so I think, from
the cultural perspective

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:84%
of how we're kind of
governed in so many ways

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:84%
to be external in our attention,
that both the practices of yoga

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.580 align:middle line:84%
themselves and then the
philosophy turns all of that

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
upside down or inward so
we reorient our awareness

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
to really get a sense of what's
going on inside ourselves.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>> These particular
quotes that I talked about

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.550 align:middle line:84%
in the beginning, these concepts
of like, oh, just man up,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.729 align:middle line:84%
or big girls don't cry, we can
kind of be laissez-faire with

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:12.020 align:middle line:84%
it, and joke, and say, oh,
they're just kind of Western

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.050 align:middle line:84%
cultural idioms or sayings,
and it doesn't mean anything.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:84%
But really, actually, they
have some pretty serious

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.560 align:middle line:84%
implications when we think about
them, in the sense of, oh, you

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:84%
can't cry, or just
man up and do it.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.520 align:middle line:84%
It's really a numbing to or a
disregarding of our experience

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.390 align:middle line:84%
of ourselves, of both thoughts,
and then thoughts that

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.750 align:middle line:84%
trigger feelings and
emotions, and then

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:84%
emotions that manifest
energy in the body.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.340 align:middle line:90%
And so it's all connected.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you'll just tell
us a little bit about how

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.120 align:middle line:84%
you see that, and some
of the struggles people

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.590 align:middle line:90%
are having with that today.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I think the most
relevant thing that I see

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.080 align:middle line:84%
in my work is first, just people
coming to a place where they

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.290 align:middle line:84%
can come to terms with how
they feel, and accept it,

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and be OK with it, which
is in relationship to what

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle line:84%
you're talking about, kind of
being conditioned to think that

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.900 align:middle line:84%
it's not OK for me to feel
this, or it's not OK for me

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.230 align:middle line:84%
to express this, which
is so naturally built

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.630 align:middle line:84%
into our culture
in so many ways.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
I think the first
order of business

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.310 align:middle line:84%
is really to become
aware of what's present,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:84%
and then to do
whatever work it takes

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.900 align:middle line:84%
to have a sense of
self-compassion or love,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.300 align:middle line:84%
or understanding, or even
going so far as to accept how

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:90%
you feel at any given moment.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the first
hurdle for most people,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.590 align:middle line:84%
even whether you're
talking about coming

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:84%
into a physical yoga class,
and people coming in,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.720 align:middle line:90%
and going to do the stretch.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.710 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they're
conditioned to really get it.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't get it, then
there's frustration or there's

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
anger, or there's a sense of,
well, I'm not doing this right.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And then going maybe to a more
subtle, more life off the mat,

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.830 align:middle line:84%
how we act in our every
day, this sense of first

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.720 align:middle line:84%
really coming to terms
with what is present.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
tradition would say

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:84%
that's going to come
through awareness.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So pausing at any given
moment to take a pulse of what

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.370 align:middle line:84%
is it that you're really
feeling in the moment.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
And not that that always
needs to be expressed,

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
but when you meet it on your
own, with your own awareness,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.150 align:middle line:84%
with a sense of
acceptance, or kindness,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.120 align:middle line:84%
or compassion, transformation
immediately occurs.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, instead of
trying to push it away.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking of two
examples, of a parent who

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.675 align:middle line:84%
may get really, really,
really angry at their child.

00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:90%


00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.460 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't feel
angry at my child.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:90%
I love my child.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
I've had many friends kind of
share this experience, that we

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.640 align:middle line:84%
kind of shame
ourselves sometimes

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that it's not
OK to feel that, and then

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:90%
just brush it under the table.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.890 align:middle line:84%
But you're saying just
feel it in that moment,

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and address it,
and be aware of it,

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to being aware of it
and pushing away, be with it.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.010 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Come into contact
with what is there.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And what you gain
by doing that is you

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.000 align:middle line:84%
start to acquire skillful
means to be present to whatever

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.290 align:middle line:90%
fluctuation happens.

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a huge
misconception in the yoga world

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:84%
that this state of yoga is
just this sublime stillness.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Or just happiness.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's such a
huge misunderstanding.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, to
me, the depth of yoga

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.290 align:middle line:84%
is most luminous, and exciting,
and radiant when we're

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.600 align:middle line:84%
talking about being
present to what

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.040 align:middle line:84%
is present in the moment
from a human perspective.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.870 align:middle line:84%
If we don't come to terms with
anger, or resentment, or grief,

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
or fear, or all the things
that make us human--

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:84%
we don't come to terms with
that first, and we compress it,

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.250 align:middle line:84%
or we don't meet it,
then that essentially

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
starts to deeply load
our subconscious mind

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.080 align:middle line:90%
or our unconscious mind.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:84%
We begin to see the world in
a completely different way

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:84%
because we're stacked
full of these deeply

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:90%
restrained feelings.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I think, again, when
you look at the system--

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
whether it's yoga, or whether
it's a system like qi gong

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.590 align:middle line:84%
that really looks to start
to dismantle us, or open

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:56.440 align:middle line:84%
us, or create space,
then those feelings

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.490 align:middle line:90%
start to move, and transform.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.540 align:middle line:84%
And we essentially end up
gaining space, or gaining

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:08.890 align:middle line:84%
presence, or acquiring a
better perspective on what's

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:84%
going on in the present
moment, versus having so much

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:19.660 align:middle line:84%
unresolved within ourselves that
then just becomes a projection,

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:84%
and we start to create
a false reality based

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.675 align:middle line:84%
on how we're seeing
things based on things

00:08:24.675 --> 00:08:26.050 align:middle line:84%
that we're holding
that we're not

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:90%
even aware that we're holding.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Like, for example--

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.169 align:middle line:84%
this is one that
I think is pretty

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.650 align:middle line:90%
easy to follow the string of--

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.669 align:middle line:84%
if we have certain
feelings or emotions,

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:41.980 align:middle line:84%
whether it's frustration,
or anger, or guilt,

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:84%
and we don't think
it's OK to feel them,

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.660 align:middle line:84%
and we don't think it's
OK to express them,

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and then we just
keep holding them in,

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.240 align:middle line:84%
after a while, that
can quickly turn to,

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.510 align:middle line:84%
nobody ever listens
to me; I'm all alone.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And that can turn into a
really, really deep sadness.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Nobody hears me, nobody
understands what I'm

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:90%
going through, or screw this.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
People aren't paying
attention/don't listen to me

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.610 align:middle line:90%
can easily turn into anger.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And we see this manifesting
in our world a lot today,

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:84%
where actually that just
becomes a projection of us not

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
having resolved or
come to an honest place

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.110 align:middle line:90%
with what we're feeling.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes all these
things that the outside world

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:90%
is doing to us.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, totally.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And so again, when you
look at the tradition

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and you look at what it's asking
of us as practitioners, what

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.910 align:middle line:84%
it's asking us to do, on a
physical level, we are going in

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:47.770 align:middle line:84%
and we're modifying things like
the energy in our solar plexus.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.690 align:middle line:84%
Twists, forward
folds, back bends,

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
these kind of directly
physical things

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:55.150 align:middle line:84%
we can do to start to
create some release

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.620 align:middle line:90%
or create some movement.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:84%
But then I think
what really I would

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.160 align:middle line:84%
love to point out in
this conversation,

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.640 align:middle line:84%
and exactly what you're
saying, is that there's

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.100 align:middle line:90%
energetic intelligence as well.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:84%
We are so conditioned to think
we're just a body and a mind.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
But then we also have
this vital energy.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:84%
We've got this animating
force within us that,

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.620 align:middle line:84%
again, from the
traditions perspective,

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.880 align:middle line:84%
that vitality, that energy,
has its own intelligence.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about
awakening a power

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:34.070 align:middle line:84%
or awakening a force within
us that, as it begins to move,

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:38.480 align:middle line:84%
it purifies the deficiency,
or it will move the block,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.870 align:middle line:84%
or it will release that
unexpressed emotion,

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:84%
and we'll have a
cathartic experience.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
meant to happen.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So from the practice
perspective,

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:53.090 align:middle line:84%
it's like things are meant
to get a little messy.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
again a big part

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.810 align:middle line:84%
of the misunderstanding
of, well,

00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:90%
yoga should make me feel good.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.845 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, it
probably will eventually.

00:11:00.845 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But it could also really bring
you into some intense material.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.210 align:middle line:84%
We're really looking
at, ultimately,

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.300 align:middle line:84%
a kind of dismantling, all
the way down to the substance

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:84%
of the psyche, which is as deep
as we can get within ourselves.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And from that
place, this emergent

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:26.840 align:middle line:84%
healing awareness and a greater
capacity to see ourselves,

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.290 align:middle line:90%
and to know ourselves.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, therefore, that takes
us into our world in a more--

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:84%
we're poised, and the condition
has been created for us

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:84%
to succeed in how we
live our life in a much

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.330 align:middle line:90%
more skillful way.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And this process that we're
talking about here is one

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.190 align:middle line:84%
of those main reasons
why sometimes,

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:53.450 align:middle line:84%
when people are working out,
or running, or even dancing,

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:58.820 align:middle line:84%
or doing yoga that you might
experience anger come up for no

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.560 align:middle line:90%
real apparent reason.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Or you might find yourself
laying on the mat and crying.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:10.160 align:middle line:84%
Or any emotion that arises,
that exactly we hear that,

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.710 align:middle line:84%
and we are seeing, now
we know if we meditate

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:14.957 align:middle line:84%
we'll be able to--
if we quiet the mind,

00:12:14.957 --> 00:12:16.790 align:middle line:84%
we can start to release
some of these things

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:19.610 align:middle line:84%
like anxiety, which will
start to calm the body.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.830 align:middle line:84%
But it also works directly
with, as we're saying,

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.260 align:middle line:84%
moving this vital life
force through our body

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.090 align:middle line:84%
through movement, particularly
conscious movement with breath.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
things I love about,

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.640 align:middle line:84%
really, these
Eastern traditions--

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:84%
because when you
say, the psyche,

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.435 align:middle line:84%
we are getting into a little
bit of the psychology of it,

00:12:37.435 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and how to heal trauma, pain,
emotions, just regular trapped

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:middle line:84%
things, that when
these energies come up,

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you feel it as
energy or an emotion--

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:84%
anger, frustration,
grief, sadness.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.870 align:middle line:84%
When they come up,
we don't actually

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:90%
need to know where it came from.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
know, why am I crying,

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
what exactly is this
anger connected to,

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.320 align:middle line:90%
in order for it to release.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Like you're saying, you can
just move it, and things change.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And that drops us
into this space

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.000 align:middle line:90%
of presence and receptivity.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:12.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Completely.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I mean, if any of
those things are happening,

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.930 align:middle line:84%
whether it's for myself or
anyone I'm working with,

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.450 align:middle line:84%
it's to be celebrated
as far as I'm concerned.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.090 align:middle line:84%
When the emotional
content starts to move,

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:25.250 align:middle line:90%
we're getting somewhere.

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.130 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:30.180 align:middle line:84%
That can be a scary
thing for people.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And so how then do we
kind of create a structure

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:90%
so we feel safe?

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.830 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the core
axioms of the tradition says,

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.760 align:middle line:84%
where your mind goes,
your vital energy follows.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And so when we think about
the conditioned reality

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.720 align:middle line:84%
of our attention
being outward, there's

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.300 align:middle line:84%
vital intelligence that
is then also getting

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:00.920 align:middle line:84%
expressed outward in a way
that is maybe unconscious.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And so the practices
completely flip that around.

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:09.830 align:middle line:84%
We use our breath, we
use our mind to focus,

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.200 align:middle line:90%
to turn the attention in.

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And that starts to create
this alchemy or this process

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:84%
where the energy starts
to follow the mind.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.520 align:middle line:84%
And so if we direct
our attention to--

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.450 align:middle line:84%
if we feel pain, if we
feel emotional pain,

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
we have the capacity to tune
our awareness to the body,

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
to follow our breath, and to
penetrate that point so that we

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.720 align:middle line:84%
can, in a safe and healthy way,
start to explore transformation

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and healing while we're in
whatever the movement is.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.474 align:middle line:84%
So like you said,
whether it's running,

00:14:49.474 --> 00:14:51.140 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's
dancing, or whether it's

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.730 align:middle line:84%
yoga, or whether
it's martial arts,

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.500 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is, the
notion of moving the body

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.510 align:middle line:84%
to get energy going, to get
that substance freed up,

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:84%
and then having the
intelligence, the presence,

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:11.630 align:middle line:84%
the focus to then direct
it, the opportunity

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:14.150 align:middle line:84%
there is that we can
become kind of masters

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:16.100 align:middle line:90%
in where our energy is.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:17.930 align:middle line:90%
I can feel right now--

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I can say, oh, wow, my energy
is pretty activated right now.

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.390 align:middle line:84%
If I just even place my
awareness in my solar plexus,

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:33.480 align:middle line:84%
and I drop my breath into that
space, I immediately shift.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:35.020 align:middle line:90%
I get more calm.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm more present.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.350 align:middle line:90%
My thoughts are more clear.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm really now tapped
right into the idea

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:84%
that I'm sharing with
you in this moment.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:50.480 align:middle line:84%
And that skill set or that
skill can be practiced and then

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:90%
put to use in so many ways.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So some of it
sounds really complex.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.660 align:middle line:84%
But I know it actually
can be fairly simple.

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.750 align:middle line:84%
So will you show us
a practice that--

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:84%
and I think another
important thing to point out

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:10.610 align:middle line:84%
is that no matter
what experience we're

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:13.730 align:middle line:84%
having energetically,
whether it be sad, or angry,

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.960 align:middle line:84%
or frustrated, or overly
activated, or tired,

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:84%
that there are some practices
that we can do for all of them.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to know all
this different information

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and be a master in all
these different techniques

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.080 align:middle line:84%
in order to know
something really specific

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:84%
that we can do to
totally shift this energy

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.480 align:middle line:84%
and become more
intelligent with it.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, completely.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are some basic
practices that essentially will

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.980 align:middle line:84%
harmonize or balance the
total equation, whether you're

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.434 align:middle line:84%
excessive, or whether you're
deficient in your energy,

00:16:48.434 --> 00:16:49.850 align:middle line:84%
or whether your
energy is blocked,

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:52.480 align:middle line:84%
whether your energy
is all over the place.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I think the practice that I
would love to share today is

00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:84%
just a very simple, short,
three-minute practice that aims

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:08.810 align:middle line:84%
to sort of neutralize,
disperse, harmonize, activate,

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:10.609 align:middle line:90%
illuminate--

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:14.900 align:middle line:84%
all of that, simultaneously,
in a really easy way.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:90%
Awesome, let's do it.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:84%
So what we'll do is just
a few-minute practice.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:23.150 align:middle line:84%
It's borrowed from
the qi gong tradition,

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and it's super
accessible, really easy.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:27.599 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
shaking practice.

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:30.590 align:middle line:84%
So you're just going to take
your shoes off, I would say,

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.300 align:middle line:90%
if you have shoes on.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.884 align:middle line:84%
And it'll be a
standing practice.

00:17:33.884 --> 00:17:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you happen
to be in a chair

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:38.180 align:middle line:84%
and you need to stay in a
chair, that's also fine, too.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.870 align:middle line:84%
You can adapt, and accommodate
the practice for you there.

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:44.660 align:middle line:84%
But we'll go
through the practice

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:84%
to ultimately release,
and awaken, and restore

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.829 align:middle line:90%
the vitality of our energy.

00:17:50.829 --> 00:17:52.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, so again we're
going to just step

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.070 align:middle line:84%
into about a three-minute
qi gong practice right now.

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:90%
And it's a preliminary practice.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.727 align:middle line:84%
And the thing I want
to say is that we're

00:17:58.727 --> 00:18:01.310 align:middle line:84%
going to be shaking our bodies
out for a few minutes, and just

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.140 align:middle line:84%
kind of tapping the
body, and shaking around.

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's very natural if you
feel a little self-conscious

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:90%
about doing that.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.180 align:middle line:84%
If you find that that
comes up for you,

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:13.010 align:middle line:90%
you're probably at home alone.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.480 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.440 align:middle line:90%
Nobody cares.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:84%
Just go for it, and have
the energetic experience

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:84%
of what this is like to
awaken your energy body

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.450 align:middle line:90%
and feel that vitality.

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.500 align:middle line:90%
So let's start.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.300 align:middle line:90%
You ready?

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:90%
You good?

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Ready.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.450 align:middle line:84%
>> So just go ahead
and bend your knees,

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:84%
and kind of get
soft in the body.

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.580 align:middle line:90%
Let the body drop a little bit.

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:36.950 align:middle line:84%
So you're surrendering
to gravity.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll start with
lifting and dropping the heels.

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:44.090 align:middle line:84%
So you pulse the
heels into the ground.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Go ahead and begin to
deepen your breath.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And as you're doing
this, feel the crown

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:57.360 align:middle line:84%
of your head ascend up
towards the ceiling.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead and relax your jaw.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Relax your tongue.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.210 align:middle line:84%
And let's take a few
clearing breaths.

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.822 align:middle line:90%
So just a deep breath in.

00:19:04.822 --> 00:19:05.970 align:middle line:90%

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:84%
or you can kind of lift and tap
the whole foot down, and just

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.200 align:middle line:84%
let the body start to
take whatever rhythm it's

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.640 align:middle line:90%
going to take in the shake.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And let's start at the hands,
now, and shake out your hands--

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:45.425 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.425 --> 00:19:46.225 align:middle line:90%
and the wrists.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.817 align:middle line:84%
And then shake out
your shoulders.

And then let's add a
pulse into the hips.

00:20:11.242 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to bend
the knees here, and come

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
into kind of a deep
squat, and just pulse.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So we're challenging the glute
muscles, the thigh muscles.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
And let's bring the palms
together and rub the hands.

energy in the hands.

And your thighs
might be heating up.

The glute muscles might
be heating up already.

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:84%
We're going to stay for
maybe another 10 seconds.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.984 align:middle line:84%
