00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey, I'm Ashleigh Sergeant
and welcome to "Everyday

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.410 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment," your go-to
show for tips on how to be more

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:10%
conscious in the midst
of your busy modern life.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:84%
In these times where we
see tragedy and conflict

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:84%
on the news just
about every day,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:84%
it's natural to feel
angry, devastated,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.870 align:middle line:84%
and the need to possibly
choose sides and defeat that

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.690 align:middle line:90%
which we think is against us.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.780 align:middle line:84%
But how can we stand
firm on our beliefs

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is
lovingly defiant to that

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.200 align:middle line:84%
which we know is not in service
of the highest good for all?

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.300 align:middle line:90%
My guest today is Matt Kahn.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:84%
He is a highly attuned
empathic healer

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.480 align:middle line:84%
who has become a YouTube
sensation with his healing

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:90%
and oftentimes humorous videos.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.270 align:middle line:84%
Matt, thanks so much for
being here with me today.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:90%
It's an honor to be here.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.180 align:middle line:90%
Great to be with you.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So these are some pretty
big and real things

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.110 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And I know that your teachings
are really profoundly based

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.540 align:middle line:90%
on love and open heartedness.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.069 align:middle line:84%
What's your concept
around working

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.110 align:middle line:84%
with some of these really
challenging things that

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:84%
are going on in the world,
people who are spiritual beings

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and want to remain spiritually
open in the face of some

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.660 align:middle line:84%
of these things happening
in our world right now?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think the first
step is examining the truth

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.260 align:middle line:90%
of self-responsibility.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.590 align:middle line:84%
In the way that I teach in the
open-hearted path as I call it,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%
it really is centered
in self-responsibility.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:10%
And self-responsibility
isn't the guilt of I'm

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.990 align:middle line:10%
creating the world in view.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:10%
But that actually, the way I
feel is not caused by the world

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:10%
that I see, but the
world that I see

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.630 align:middle line:10%
is actually reflecting to me
the depths of a healing journey

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.430 align:middle line:10%
I may not know I'm on.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
When people are in
fight or flight,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.420 align:middle line:84%
when people are in
defensiveness, when they're

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
in judgments, where as you said
before, when they're choosing

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.850 align:middle line:84%
us versus them, or
right versus wrong,

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.720 align:middle line:84%
or even light versus dark,
we're in a state of division.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And if we're in a state of
division, no matter the things

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.970 align:middle line:84%
that we're projecting
our judgments onto,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.210 align:middle line:84%
it is proof and evidence
that our nervous system

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
is going through a
recalibration process.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
When we awaken in consciousness,
our nervous systems

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.460 align:middle line:90%
get recalibrated.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.680 align:middle line:84%
During the process
of recalibration,

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.740 align:middle line:84%
the nervous system is what
triggers the fight or flight--

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.960 align:middle line:90%
is what causes us to take sides.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So in effect, we
have an entire world

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.230 align:middle line:84%
going through a massive
healing and awakening process,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.740 align:middle line:84%
not knowing the inner workings
of the healing process.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And so then judging or
projecting onto the world that

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.930 align:middle line:84%
is showing us the healing
process, the ability

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:84%
to take sides and
maintain an external war,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.310 align:middle line:84%
that is really helping to
bring us into consciousness

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle line:84%
with the inner
turmoil within us.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:84%
And so when I teach
an open-hearted path,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:84%
it is simply because
the opening of the heart

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.480 align:middle line:84%
is what relaxes
the nervous system.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about the
thinning of the veils and unity

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
consciousness awakening
in human beings,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.950 align:middle line:84%
it is actually the veil
is as thick or as thin

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.230 align:middle line:84%
as the density of our
own corpus callosum.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.160 align:middle line:84%
As we awaken in
consciousness, that division

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.620 align:middle line:84%
between the left and right
hemisphere of the brain

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.710 align:middle line:84%
thins to create coherence
between the two opposing

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.240 align:middle line:90%
forces within our own self.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And as that occurs, our
nervous system is rewired

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.412 align:middle line:84%
and our heart has
permission to open.

00:03:52.412 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So the question is,
what allows our heart

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
to open, to relax
our nervous system,

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:84%
to create a perception
of unity, instead

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.660 align:middle line:90%
of a misperception of division?

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And in my teachings, it is
the loving of our own selves,

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:84%
the embracing of our own hearts,
the embracing of the emotions

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:90%
that life brings up in us.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Whether we see it as
us versus them or not,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.660 align:middle line:84%
it is the
self-responsibility of loving

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
what arises in our own self that
allows us to unravel the ego

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and to embody the
light of our soul,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.300 align:middle line:84%
but in the most
heart-centered way.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you're saying
is, if I understand,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.040 align:middle line:84%
is that by instead of kind
of pushing these emotions

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
and things away and
saying, oh, my gosh,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
I shouldn't be feeling
this adversity.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.540 align:middle line:84%
Or what I think I see
talked about a lot

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.460 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual
communities is, I'm

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.250 align:middle line:84%
not even going to pay
attention to that stuff that's

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.240 align:middle line:90%
going on in the world.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.680 align:middle line:90%
It's dark.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.750 align:middle line:90%
It's fear based.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
remain in this heart space--

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.794 align:middle line:90%
is no.

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
We're not talking about
that which could potentially

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.600 align:middle line:84%
be maybe the realm of
spiritual bypassing.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But rather, actually letting
what is happening in the world

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:84%
around us and our experience
with it be that which fuels

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:84%
our internal transformation
and into more openheartedness.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:90%
>> 100%.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's not I'm choosing to
be in love instead of fear.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.210 align:middle line:84%
It is I'm choosing
to be the love that

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:84%
welcomes fear, like
a child in my heart

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:84%
that is only here to
be loved and nurtured

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:84%
and to gain the attention, the
respect, and the acknowledgment

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:84%
that it needs to
complete its journey.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
It's as if all these emotions in
our body like trapped emotions

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.360 align:middle line:84%
haven't had a chance to
fully express themselves.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.170 align:middle line:84%
And we as parents to these
emotions, like parents

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.730 align:middle line:84%
are with their
children, we're here

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:84%
to hold these feelings
in our sacred heart.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
We're here to let them
voice their opinion.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.690 align:middle line:84%
We're here to give them
the unconditional love,

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.810 align:middle line:84%
and attention, and affection
that they truly deserve,

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.970 align:middle line:84%
whether they act in
a loving way or not.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:58.169 align:middle line:84%
Just like with children,
we don't always--

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
we don't withhold our
love, because a child

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.830 align:middle line:90%
isn't being loving.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
We love the children
who often act out

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:90%
when they crave attention.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So in the same way, our emotions
are doing the same exact thing.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And for people who are not in
tune with the emotions that

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.810 align:middle line:84%
need love, we have the
perception of a world around us

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
that will do the spectacular
exquisite job of being

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.680 align:middle line:84%
any particular
environment or injustice,

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.470 align:middle line:84%
to bring our attention
to that within us that

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.240 align:middle line:90%
needs that loving attention.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.340 align:middle line:84%
So we're not trying to
be love instead of fear.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:84%
It's a very old paradigm way
of looking at that shift.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we're actually looking
at love is not an emotion.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Love is that which embraces
the arc of any emotion.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.310 align:middle line:84%
So love is the attention, the
respect, the companionship,

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.350 align:middle line:84%
and the nurturing
affection that we're

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.110 align:middle line:84%
willing to give
all parts of self,

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:84%
knowing full well that any
darkness that lingers within us

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.876 align:middle line:84%
is the light begging
to be recognized.

00:06:58.876 --> 00:07:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And so how do we see that
as it connects to really

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:10.850 align:middle line:84%
if someone is looking for this
pathway to be a path that they

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.620 align:middle line:84%
utilize as one of their
tools in an activism role,

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
or in a role that
we can feel that?

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:84%
How am I actually actively
helping the world,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.590 align:middle line:84%
while not engaging
in this paradigm that

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.190 align:middle line:84%
feels that if I'm really
going to be doing something,

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.634 align:middle line:84%
I have to be in
adversity in some way?

00:07:34.634 --> 00:07:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's my own
words around it.

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.540 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to hear if that's
kind of your perspective

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.670 align:middle line:84%
or if you have a different
way of looking at it.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.110 align:middle line:90%
I would agree with you.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:45.726 align:middle line:84%
And I just think specifically
when-- so we talk

00:07:45.726 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:90%
about two different things.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Sacred activism,
which is external

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:84%
empowered decision-making
that affects

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:52.890 align:middle line:90%
the greater good of all.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:54.477 align:middle line:84%
>> External empowered
decision-making?

00:07:54.477 --> 00:07:56.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Decision-making that affects
the greater good of all.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And will you explain--
break down external empowered

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.780 align:middle line:90%
decision-making?

00:07:59.780 --> 00:07:59.990 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So sacred activism or as I just
said, it kind of came to me.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.480 align:middle line:84%
When we are in that
vibration of sacred activism,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.762 align:middle line:84%
our external empowered
decision-making--

00:08:11.762 --> 00:08:13.220 align:middle line:84%
I love what I bring,
just something

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.750 align:middle line:90%
brand new in the moment--

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.600 align:middle line:84%
is actually
decisions and choices

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
for what we're for
and not against.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:84%
When our decisions are trying
to take down what we're against,

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
that is actually a sign
that our inner activist

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
has become an
inner victim and is

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:84%
a reminder that our nervous
system has got disrupted.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:90%
It is overstimulated.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And we are now trying to be an
activist from a state of fight

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:90%
or flight.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:43.520 align:middle line:84%
That is like an inner
alarm clock that goes

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
off emotionally
that says, I'm not

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.680 align:middle line:84%
going to perpetuate
external war.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to stop and give
time to my inner turmoil,

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
because right now, I'm fighting
against something instead

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:90%
of what I'm for.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So I take the time to be
with my own heart to tune

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:04.550 align:middle line:84%
into my inner child, to
the innocence within me

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:84%
that hurts as a reflection
of those that hurt me.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.300 align:middle line:84%
And how can I be
that for myself,

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.180 align:middle line:84%
which my past
neglected to offer me?

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of times people
get so gung-ho on activism

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
that we don't stop
to decide, am I

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:23.960 align:middle line:84%
making decisions
for what I'm for

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.720 align:middle line:90%
or fighting against something?

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we're
against something,

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:32.570 align:middle line:84%
that is literally the evidence
that we need to pull ourselves

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.130 align:middle line:90%
off of a battlefield.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.550 align:middle line:84%
We need to take time to
really love our own self

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:84%
and not be so attached
to the outcomes we're

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle line:84%
trying to promote,
that we disregard

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:90%
our own internal healing.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:84%
Because sacred activism
is only a change

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:84%
that will be
brought to the world

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:53.630 align:middle line:84%
by a collective force of
aligned heart-centered beings.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So we learn to know
when we're aligned

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:90%
and when we're not aligned.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.530 align:middle line:84%
When we're against something,
we stop right then and there.

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Because no amount of action
from a misaligned place

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
is going to do anything
but promote the very energy

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.600 align:middle line:90%
that many people are against.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.005 align:middle line:84%
And so then we switch sides, not
knowing it, with a wellness--

00:10:12.005 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> That's running our
movements or our actions.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:84%
With a well-intended,
optimistic campaign,

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:18.560 align:middle line:84%
we're actually
feeling the things.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.290 align:middle line:90%
We have more things to defeat.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So whenever we're
against something,

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.230 align:middle line:90%
we stop what we're doing.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:90%
We make time to love ourselves.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:84%
If we can't stop in the
midst of an activist campaign

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:84%
to love ourself, it is proof
that the ego is using activism

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.120 align:middle line:84%
to perpetuate its own
illusionary nature.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if
it's coming from ego,

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.350 align:middle line:84%
it's only going to
perpetuate more ego, which

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:84%
creates a vacuum in the
world for more things for us

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.450 align:middle line:90%
to pose to show up.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So when we are aligned
in sacred activism,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.560 align:middle line:84%
our empowered external
decision-making is about,

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:90%
what am I for?

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:01.210 align:middle line:90%
Our choices are like votes.

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And we vote every day on
the quality of our food.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:84%
We vote every day by how much
compassion we show others.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.270 align:middle line:84%
We vote every day by teaching
the world how to treat us,

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:90%
by how we treat others.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And the moment we
turn against anything,

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:18.910 align:middle line:84%
that's an alarm clock that stops
us in the midst of our activism

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.950 align:middle line:84%
and says, let me make time
to be here for myself.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.150 align:middle line:84%
Because if I don't have
the awareness of what

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.580 align:middle line:84%
I need at any given
moment, then it's

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.280 align:middle line:84%
just another layer
of ego that is

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:34.840 align:middle line:84%
using an optimistic, activist
campaign to perpetuate

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.700 align:middle line:84%
the very thing
that we are trying

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:41.780 align:middle line:84%
as lightworkers to unravel
for the well-being of all.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That's beautiful.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember having an
experience of that a few

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.600 align:middle line:84%
years-- well, for many
years at this point.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:84%
But I had a teacher
share with me

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
that if we have an experience
that someone else's truth--

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:00.430 align:middle line:84%
simply by them
voicing their truth

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.690 align:middle line:90%
is somehow threatening my truth.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.324 align:middle line:84%
And that's an alarm clock
right there to go off.

00:12:07.324 --> 00:12:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like
that's really what

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.699 align:middle line:84%
you're saying there is that
we can actually disagree.

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of an external thing.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:84%
We can disagree
on some things we

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:20.210 align:middle line:84%
want to, have different
fundamental views or opinions.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
But in engaging in a
conversation about that--

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.510 align:middle line:84%
if it becomes that, oh, well,
just by you voicing that,

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.610 align:middle line:90%
my belief is threatened.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:29.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:30.866 align:middle line:90%
>> And I feel smaller.

00:12:30.866 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And I feel like I
have to defend this.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Then this energy comes up.

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:39.310 align:middle line:84%
And we are no longer
just being in the truth

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:44.620 align:middle line:84%
of our belief, our open
heart, our connection

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:84%
to consciousness, our
connection to one another.

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.360 align:middle line:84%
And instead, we're in
defense mode right away.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:52.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Same thing.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I would even add to that and
say if you have a truth that

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.780 align:middle line:84%
if someone could oppose
it, would trigger you

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.710 align:middle line:84%
on the inside, you
haven't found your truth.

00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:04.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Because any person's truth
is their innocent nature begging

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.760 align:middle line:90%
for the right to be passionate.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.300 align:middle line:84%
And most people have lived
such disempowered lives

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.612 align:middle line:84%
where they have been
shut down by others,

00:13:18.612 --> 00:13:20.320 align:middle line:84%
or they shut down
their psychic abilities

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.830 align:middle line:84%
to be more approved
by their families.

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Or they've been told by their
families, please keep quiet.

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:27.280 align:middle line:90%
You're too much.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the feedback
has been, most people

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.770 align:middle line:84%
are begging for the
right to be passionate.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And because they've
been rejected,

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.070 align:middle line:84%
they tend to be passionate about
things that guarantee rejection

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.270 align:middle line:90%
from other people.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:44.200 align:middle line:84%
Because the biggest fear in ego
is if someone connects with me,

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.420 align:middle line:90%
now I have something to lose.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's where everyone
is trying to avoid.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.020 align:middle line:90%
An ego as the threat of loss.

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:55.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you are in the
presence of someone who

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.170 align:middle line:84%
is running a sabotage
program, who believes with all

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:02.590 align:middle line:84%
of their heart that they are
passionate about something that

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:84%
does not match or
mirror the ethics

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.260 align:middle line:84%
and values of your
deepest spiritual beliefs,

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:12.640 align:middle line:84%
you are literally witnessing
a little child in a very adult

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:84%
body, begging for the
right to be passionate,

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.850 align:middle line:84%
but is playing out
a rejection pattern.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Because they're more familiar
with rejection from their past

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:90%
than be accepted by others.

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.830 align:middle line:84%
And if we could
show that people,

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:28.540 align:middle line:84%
no matter what they
say or believe--

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.010 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean
by allowing people

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.340 align:middle line:84%
to be passionate about something
that you do not support.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.020 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't mean you support it.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:38.080 align:middle line:84%
It means you support
that individual's right

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.460 align:middle line:90%
to be passionate.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as people have
the right to be passion--

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.280 align:middle line:84%
or passionate-- their
inner wellspring

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.960 align:middle line:84%
of anger, resentment,
and frustration actually

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:84%
can erupt a new
wellspring of creativity.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And creativity erupts in a
conscious being or an awakening

00:14:57.070 --> 00:14:58.210 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.610 align:middle line:84%
Then the perspective
widens to become

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:04.630 align:middle line:84%
something more vast and
more of unity consciousness.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And we're all inclusive than
what they were defending.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.640 align:middle line:84%
So if we simply give people
the right to be passionate.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was having a
conversation with someone who

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.700 align:middle line:84%
was completely hell
bent on believing

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:90%
in racial stereotypes.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And my response to them is,
thank you for sharing with me

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.070 align:middle line:90%
what you are passionate about.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:84%
Because my conversation was not,
do I or don't I agree with you?

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:84%
My conversation is, you have
a right to be passionate.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And in that conversation
there was a breakthrough.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I was giving their
inner innocence, their soul

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:47.630 align:middle line:84%
permission and not getting
tangled in the conversation

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.100 align:middle line:90%
of right versus wrong.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a beautiful example.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's powerful.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very powerful.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's really time for
all of us as lightworkers,

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.889 align:middle line:84%
as spiritual beings to
really raise the bar.

00:15:59.889 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:84%
Are we really living
in a world where

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.160 align:middle line:84%
someone can come up to us, and
hold an opposing point of view,

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:84%
and it can really
ruffle our feathers?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Is that really all that we
need is for someone on TV

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.170 align:middle line:84%
to play the role of a character
who does things that could be

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:90%
verbally malicious and hurtful?

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:23.630 align:middle line:84%
But as people, can we not
see the opportunity to--

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:25.640 align:middle line:84%
from a more expanded
perspective,

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.090 align:middle line:84%
from the eyes of consciousness,
from the heart of compassion,

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:32.900 align:middle line:84%
can we not see the hurt that
is begging for approval?

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And can we start to
rehabilitate those

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:40.130 align:middle line:84%
that we've opposed, instead
of fighting against the things

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:43.140 align:middle line:84%
that we're perpetuating
by shutting down?

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Matt, I think this
concept of sacred activism

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:84%
and being for something instead
of against something and really

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:84%
making choices in everything
that we do that is

00:16:54.890 --> 00:17:02.300 align:middle line:84%
for our truth is such
a beautiful concept,

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:84%
and that it really is
possible to land it.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.940 align:middle line:84%
But I think it feels intangible
sometimes for people.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:84%
So do you mind sharing with
us a couple really specific

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:84%
and grounded tips
on, how do we stand

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:84%
in this place of sacred
activism with love and instead

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:90%
of adversity?

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.920 align:middle line:84%
Would you share with
us a couple of things

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.910 align:middle line:84%
that we can do anywhere,
anytime to stand

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.950 align:middle line:84%
in this light of the
open-hearted path?

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
Lightworkers,
empaths, friends, we

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.330 align:middle line:84%
are in a time in history
where opening our heart

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:45.410 align:middle line:84%
is a vital necessity, not just
for the happiness of our lives,

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.710 align:middle line:84%
not for the fulfillment of
our everyday experiences,

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.360 align:middle line:84%
but as a way of
raising the vibration

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
for this beloved
planet, as it transforms

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:56.550 align:middle line:84%
into a brand new planet
of unity consciousness.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So when we find ourselves
in these situations

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:84%
where our sacred activism
is really being challenged,

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:84%
there is a couple
of things we can do.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:10%
The first thing is
we have to stand

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:11.490 align:middle line:10%
for a truth that is all for the
free expression of every human

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.290 align:middle line:10%
being.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:10%
We have to learn that
people that oppose

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.027 align:middle line:10%
are just begging to be heard.

00:18:17.027 --> 00:18:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And when you're in a
situation with someone,

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.010 align:middle line:84%
whether a conversation, whether
you're reading something

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:84%
online, maybe someone
posed something

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.430 align:middle line:84%
on social media that is contrary
to your personal belief.

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:84%
The first place
we go is two-fold.

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:10%
The first place is to
adjust our breathing.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:10%
Because when we
breathe slower and more

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.390 align:middle line:10%
mindfully than the
world, we unhook

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:10%
from the collective
unconsciousness of the world.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And by slowing our breath, we're
bringing more life force energy

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.810 align:middle line:84%
into our body, which
we then can radiate out

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:90%
for the well-being of others.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.730 align:middle line:10%
And as we slow our
breath, we focus more

00:18:55.730 --> 00:19:00.980 align:middle line:10%
on listening to those who
project their disempowerment,

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:10%
instead of deciding what our
rhetoric, or our response,

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.450 align:middle line:10%
or our reaction should be.

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.210 align:middle line:84%
So we have to learn
the sacred activist,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.709 align:middle line:84%
that even though
we're going to take

00:19:09.709 --> 00:19:11.900 align:middle line:84%
great external
action in the world,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.190 align:middle line:90%
we're going to band together.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.590 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to create the
world that we want to see.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.530 align:middle line:84%
It actually begins
from the inside out,

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.260 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to pause
when we get triggered.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.670 align:middle line:90%
We're going to slow our breath.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to abide
in a state of listening,

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.290 align:middle line:84%
knowing that anyone
who is attacking,

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:33.830 align:middle line:84%
anyone who is opposing
is fighting to be heard.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And if we let anyone
be heard first,

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.850 align:middle line:84%
there is a space that is created
where more likely than not,

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.300 align:middle line:84%
someone becomes more open to
hearing you shortly thereafter.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.060 align:middle line:90%
So we slow our breath.

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.890 align:middle line:90%
We lead with listening.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.330 align:middle line:10%
And if we still
get triggered, we

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.550 align:middle line:10%
take time to love
our own hearts,

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.920 align:middle line:10%
knowing that any person
is only stirring up

00:19:54.920 --> 00:20:00.260 align:middle line:10%
in us what is here for us to
accept, embrace, and love.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And from that space
of slowing our breath,

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:08.390 align:middle line:84%
leading with listening,
and loving ourselves,

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:12.780 align:middle line:84%
we are vibrationally
teaching the world by example

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:16.910 align:middle line:84%
that we are safe enough to
open our hearts, to come out

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:20.600 align:middle line:84%
of hiding, to take
off the mask of ego,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and to step into
our true identity

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.520 align:middle line:84%
as embodiments of
source in physical form.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.850 align:middle line:84%
From my heart to
yours, I love you.

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Matt, that was
really beautiful.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:39.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Such profound wisdom and
teachings that really have

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:44.710 align:middle line:84%
the capacity to transform
ourselves and the world

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:48.490 align:middle line:84%
in literally every moment,
because our breath is with us

00:20:48.490 --> 00:20:49.670 align:middle line:90%
always.

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:50.470 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:84%
So thank you again for
being here with me today.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:56.050 align:middle line:84%
It's been a great pleasure
and joy to sit with you

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.080 align:middle line:90%
and to speak together.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.230 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm glad.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much for
joining me for "Everyday

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Enlightenment."

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you next time.
