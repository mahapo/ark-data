00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey, I'm Ashleigh Sergeant,
and welcome to "Everyday

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.330 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment," your go-to
show for tips on how to be more

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:10%
conscious in the midst
of your busy modern life.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.299 align:middle line:84%
In our modern age, the
desire for self-improvement

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:36.420 align:middle line:84%
has made its way far beyond the
desire to be physically fit.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.170 align:middle line:84%
Whether we realize it or
not, many of our actions

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.320 align:middle line:84%
are driven by the belief that
getting more of what we think

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:90%
we want--

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.000 align:middle line:90%
like money, power, love--

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.220 align:middle line:84%
from others will
actually be what

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.600 align:middle line:84%
makes us happy, when, in fact,
learning to be present with

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and to love our life
more fully is truly

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:90%
the key to finding joy.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is a scholar
of classical Tantra.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Tantra is oftentimes
misunderstood

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:84%
as being a sexual
practice, when, in fact,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.870 align:middle line:84%
the traditional
teachings of Tantra

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:84%
show that building an intimate
relationship with oneself

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.820 align:middle line:84%
is truly the most profound
pathway to lasting joy

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.410 align:middle line:90%
and happiness.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.200 align:middle line:84%
Christopher Wallis,
also known as Hareesh,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:84%
has spent over 30 years
studying this ancient practice.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Hareesh, thank you
for being here today.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.029 align:middle line:84%
>> Glad to talk
about this with you.

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I think this is a really
pertinent conversation.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:84%
At least in the kind of
yoga meditation communities,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.460 align:middle line:84%
the practice of
Tantra has started

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:84%
to have a little bit
of a resurgence as one

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.650 align:middle line:84%
of these practices,
or one of these very--

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:84%
sometimes really elaborate,
ritual-based practices

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.270 align:middle line:84%
that promises to
really help people

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:84%
live these very
pleasure-filled lives.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.611 align:middle line:84%
And I think we need a little
bit of clarity around it.

00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:00.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And really, there's
so many ideas and so

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.930 align:middle line:84%
many misunderstandings
about Tantra.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:10%
And I would just say,
in the simplest sense,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.720 align:middle line:10%
what it actually
is and always was

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.860 align:middle line:10%
is a technology for
self-realization

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:10%
and for empowerment.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:84%
So becoming empowered
to find your center,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:84%
to experience joy in the
details of everyday life,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
not by transcending or
escaping everyday life.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:84%
Discovering greater and
greater beauty and connection

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:90%
in everyday life.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what it's
really all about.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And so it's always been
a system of practice

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:84%
aimed at that for people
who are living in the world.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's specifically
the yoga that

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:84%
was designed for people with
jobs, families, and so on, as

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.780 align:middle line:84%
opposed to renunciates living
in monasteries or caves.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.996 align:middle line:84%
And can you elaborate
a little bit

00:02:54.996 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:84%
on the concept of it being a
technology and what that means

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.280 align:middle line:84%
in the modern world, where
we associate technology

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:90%
as digital technology?

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.220 align:middle line:84%
I could just call it
a system of practices.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.830 align:middle line:84%
But it is, in a sense, a
technology in the sense

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.150 align:middle line:84%
that there are just this
huge array of practices

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.050 align:middle line:84%
that work on and with
all the different layers

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.460 align:middle line:90%
of our embodied experience.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, it's just
an incredibly rich tradition.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's practices relating to
the body, relating to the mind,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.530 align:middle line:84%
relating to the
imagination, relating

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:84%
to the faculty of attention,
relating to the breath.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
together, sometimes

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:84%
working with all of these at
the same time, or separately.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And so, in this way,
with these practices,

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.030 align:middle line:84%
we actually can start to
have a more and more holistic

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.930 align:middle line:84%
experience of life where
we're no longer feeling

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.630 align:middle line:84%
so much separated or torn, but
rather are integrated and whole

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and responding to the whole
of each present moment

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:84%
with the whole of our being
in a kind of organic flow

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:84%
that has a quality of ease
and lightness and joy,

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.350 align:middle line:84%
even when you're
negotiating challenges.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.870 align:middle line:84%
That's the idea
behind the practice.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we see these self-help
books and promises of things

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
of live in the present
moment, and be present,

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.340 align:middle line:84%
and all of these promises, which
seem to have some serious roots

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:90%
in the practice of Tantra.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:84%
Of simply-- which is
not so simple at all--

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.480 align:middle line:84%
actually cultivating this
awareness in all that we do.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So how do you think
this got so misconstrued

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.610 align:middle line:84%
in the modern world where we
relate the concept of Tantra

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.910 align:middle line:84%
with these elaborate
sexual rituals?

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's a long story.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.830 align:middle line:84%
There's actually
quite a few scholars

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.740 align:middle line:84%
working on that
very issue, what's

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:84%
called the mediation or
transmission of Tantra

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.290 align:middle line:84%
to the West over
the last 120 years,

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.100 align:middle line:84%
and how it's resulted in a
variety of misunderstandings.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.400 align:middle line:84%
The biggest one being that most
people, when they hear the word

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Tantra, think it's,
if not sexual,

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:84%
at least it's an
intimacy practice.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a partner practice.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.580 align:middle line:84%
And original Tantra was
primarily not a partner

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.390 align:middle line:84%
practice, except in certain
specialized contexts.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it's a
practice that you do

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.740 align:middle line:84%
to become more fully
intimate with yourself,

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.100 align:middle line:84%
because that is the
prerequisite for greater

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and more authentic
intimacy with anyone else.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.150 align:middle line:90%
>> And anything else.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>> And anything else, exactly.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:90%
With your whole life.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the main problem being
that we're not fully aware

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.320 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves, in a sense.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.770 align:middle line:84%
So instead of being
present, I like

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.700 align:middle line:84%
to say, paying attention to
the whole of your experience,

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that that's what they're
really talking about.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:90%
Because you're always present.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.760 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking about
the past or future,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.350 align:middle line:90%
you're doing it in the present.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.250 align:middle line:84%
But you can get lost in thought
and abstracted from the whole

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.241 align:middle line:90%
of your experience.

00:06:00.241 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when you're
paying attention

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.770 align:middle line:84%
to the whole of your
experience, and softening

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.100 align:middle line:84%
into an awareness of
all the subtle details

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.460 align:middle line:84%
of your experience,
then intuitive insights

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:84%
can arise that are otherwise
impossible if you're

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.820 align:middle line:84%
lost in a mental
construct about your life

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.657 align:middle line:90%
and yourself and other people.

00:06:19.657 --> 00:06:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you give us
an example of that?

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.760 align:middle line:84%
Of what you said--
opening to the totality

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:90%
of your experience?

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:84%
So there's a form of
meditation in Tantra,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:84%
in Tantric yoga, that it's
not about transcending.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.930 align:middle line:90%
It's not about abstracting.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not even about
witnessing, exactly.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.350 align:middle line:90%
It's about--

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Or stopping the mind?

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.031 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, it's not
about stopping the mind.

00:06:43.031 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:84%
It's rather melting
your awareness

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
into a holistic
encompassing embrace

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:90%
of the totality of the moment.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:90%
So you actually slow down a bit.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:90%
You breathe a bit more.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:90%
You open up.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:02.304 align:middle line:84%
And you're just gently
aware of everything.

00:07:02.304 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Where you're aware
of the thoughts

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.000 align:middle line:84%
that are arising and
subsiding, but not

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.560 align:middle line:84%
any more so than you're
aware of anything else.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:90%
Whether it's bird chirps.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the feeling
of having a body.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.270 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's the temperature
of the air on your skin.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.860 align:middle line:84%
You're just aware of all of
it simultaneously and equally.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, you
start to cultivate

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.220 align:middle line:84%
a sense of the oneness that
actually already is the case.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we think
ourselves out of oneness,

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:84%
when it's really
our natural state.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:39.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And that seems to be a really
powerful anecdote to this major

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.110 align:middle line:84%
misconception that we have
in our modern culture,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:50.340 align:middle line:84%
which is this desire to get more
of what we think we want will

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.840 align:middle line:90%
make us happy.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:57.660 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is Tantra honors desire

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.330 align:middle line:84%
instead of other spiritual
paths and other forms of yoga

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:90%
that kind of demonize it.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
interesting, because it

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.600 align:middle line:90%
says, hey, desire is OK.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:84%
Desire whatever you
want, and you can try

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.040 align:middle line:90%
to fulfill all those desires.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.800 align:middle line:84%
Just don't fall into
the trap of thinking

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:84%
that getting what you want
is the path to happiness.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Because actually
loving what is--

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.870 align:middle line:84%
the whole of what is,
including your desires--

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:90%
is the path to happiness.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you love
what is, you can

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.080 align:middle line:84%
enjoy the feeling
of having a desire

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.940 align:middle line:84%
whether or not it
gets satisfied.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.013 align:middle line:84%
And that's a totally
different paradigm, actually.

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:36.179 align:middle line:84%
>> It's one of the most
beautiful things that really

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.570 align:middle line:84%
resonated for me when I started
getting deeper into my study

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:84%
of Tantra, which is this
true practice of self-love.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And not on a
superficial, like, oh, I

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
love myself, or from an ego
space, necessarily, at all.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:84%
But more of this
embracing and welcoming

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:04.350 align:middle line:84%
back all of the parts of ourself
that we may have cast aside.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I have this terrible habit
from my mother or something,

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and I need to just
get rid of it.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
parts of ourself

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:84%
that we have kind of
almost created fragments

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and tried to push away
in order to be better.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And I can tell you really got
it because you articulated it

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.680 align:middle line:90%
so well just now.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:90%
So beautifully.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And just to add one little
piece is that what we do

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:84%
is we sort of, especially
in spirituality,

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.090 align:middle line:84%
we create an idealized
image of ourself.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And then everything
that doesn't fit

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.750 align:middle line:84%
the idealized
image, as you said,

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:44.910 align:middle line:84%
gets suppressed or
denied in some way.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And so this self-love, it's
this actually welcoming back

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:84%
all those parts of yourself,
and letting them integrate,

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
and realizing it's absolutely
OK to feel whatever I feel.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And even to think
whatever I think.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to place
so much significance

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.890 align:middle line:84%
on this twisted spiritual idea
of thinking the right things.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Only thinking positive thoughts.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:10.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a lack
of self-acceptance.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.265 align:middle line:84%
And if I have a lack
of self-acceptance

00:10:13.265 --> 00:10:15.312 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to
relationship with others,

00:10:15.312 --> 00:10:16.770 align:middle line:84%
there's also going
to be a problem,

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.860 align:middle line:84%
because I'm going to push
the idealized image of me.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
being just totally

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:84%
honest and intimate
with what is,

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:28.460 align:middle line:90%
which is how humans connect--

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.580 align:middle line:84%
sometimes it's uncomfortable,
and sometimes it's comfortable.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.544 align:middle line:84%
But if we don't
connect over what is,

00:10:34.544 --> 00:10:35.960 align:middle line:84%
we're not really
connecting at all

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:84%
except with these mind-projected
images of ourselves.

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:40.610 align:middle line:90%
Which is not fulfilling.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And we set standards that
we just will never reach.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.220 align:middle line:84%
For example, stopping my mind,
or never having a negative

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:90%
thought.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Those are just not
going to ever go away.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:52.470 align:middle line:90%
It's not realistic.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
We can actually start to
address a piece of ourself

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.690 align:middle line:84%
and say, like, aw, thank you
for trying to protect me.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And for me, that was a
really beautiful example

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.930 align:middle line:84%
of what it means to be
intimate with oneself.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.540 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that comes up for
some people when they consider

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.930 align:middle line:84%
this teaching about
unconditional positive

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.870 align:middle line:84%
self-regard or self-love
is they get worried.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:16.040 align:middle line:90%
Well, wait a second.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.640 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to get
overly indulgent

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:84%
with myself, or permissive,
or something like that?

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:28.550 align:middle line:84%
And actually, what happens is,
if you truly are practicing

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:33.840 align:middle line:84%
radical self-acceptance, and you
feel into what's inside of you,

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.600 align:middle line:84%
you realize that,
at a certain point,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
certain things are
ready to fall away.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So instead of needing to
demonize a habit-- oh,

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.710 align:middle line:84%
that's bad, I need
to stop that--

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:44.450 align:middle line:84%
you just do this
radical self-acceptance.

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
And then you realize if
you have love for yourself,

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.100 align:middle line:84%
then naturally less
healthy habits fall away.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can literally feel,
oh, yeah, that's ready to go.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when you had
the negative self-image,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
you kept the unhealthy habit
to reinforce your self-image.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:08.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the ego would rather
be right than happy every time.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.933 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you want to talk
about the ego a little bit?

00:12:11.933 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:18.440 align:middle line:84%
In many spiritual communities,
the ego is demonized.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of misunderstanding,

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.590 align:middle line:84%
because the ego is not
really a thing, per se.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not an entity.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.080 align:middle line:84%
It's just the collection
of all your self-images.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.230 align:middle line:84%
So everything you would put
after the phrase "I am."

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
I am this kind of person,
not that kind of person.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
it's problematic is

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:84%
that when we're invested
in our self-images,

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:48.250 align:middle line:84%
we end up defending them tooth
and nail against all comers.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're super invested
in others seeing us

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.900 align:middle line:90%
as we see ourselves.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that gets in the way
of real human connection,

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:00.680 align:middle line:84%
because self-images
are not where it's at.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.280 align:middle line:84%
All of us contain the full
potential of human beings,

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.080 align:middle line:90%
of humanity.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:84%
We all feel, if
we let ourselves,

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:84%
the full range of
human emotions,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.680 align:middle line:84%
and have the full range
of human experiences.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And we all have the potential
to be a saint or a killer

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:90%
and everything in between.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And so we're much
fuller as beings

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:90%
than we let ourselves believe.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And so the more we cling to and
invest in these self-images,

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:30.950 align:middle line:84%
the more we artificially
limit ourselves

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and don't allow ourselves
to feel whatever

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:35.960 align:middle line:84%
we feel that's not
necessarily in alignment

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.440 align:middle line:90%
with the self-image.

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's a much fuller
experience of life,

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:41.843 align:middle line:84%
a more alive experience of life,
when you become more and more

00:13:41.843 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:90%
free of self-images.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.860 align:middle line:84%
And then you're also
arguing with others less,

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:51.900 align:middle line:84%
because there's less
to defend and justify.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:90%
So the ego is problematic.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.230 align:middle line:84%
But it's nothing but a
series of persistent thoughts

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:58.640 align:middle line:90%
about yourself.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.300 align:middle line:90%
So when you disinvest--

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%
if that's the right
word-- from that,

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
then there's just naturally
this greater sense

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.820 align:middle line:90%
of freedom and ease and flow.

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, would you be open
to sharing with us a couple

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
of really practical tips that we
can do any time to help to tap

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:84%
into this state of
fullness that really is,

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.770 align:middle line:84%
as we're talking about, our
underlying true state of being?

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
So the practice or tip that
I want to share with you

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of emotional
self-care, which is sadly all

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:90%
too rare in our society.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And I call it
digestion practice,

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:84%
meaning you're learning
to fully digest

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.620 align:middle line:84%
your emotions and your
experiences of the day.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:90%
So it's very simple.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometime towards the end of the
day, before you're too tired,

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.320 align:middle line:84%
you can put yourself
in a restorative pose,

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.810 align:middle line:84%
if you've ever done
restorative yoga.

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can put your
hands on your own body.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And you can notice
what emotions are still

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:05.270 align:middle line:84%
lingering from your
day that didn't get

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.630 align:middle line:90%
fully digested or assimilated.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And maybe there
was a moment where

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.420 align:middle line:84%
you felt hurt or
upset by something,

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:14.546 align:middle line:84%
but you didn't have a
moment to process it.

00:15:14.546 --> 00:15:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe there
was a moment where

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.560 align:middle line:84%
you were excited or
overjoyed by something,

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.150 align:middle line:84%
but you didn't have
time to celebrate it.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.040 align:middle line:84%
And so you just
get in touch with,

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.750 align:middle line:84%
for five or 10 minutes
towards the end of the day,

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:28.170 align:middle line:84%
getting in touch
with whatever in

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.950 align:middle line:84%
you wasn't fully felt,
or didn't get a chance

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:34.410 align:middle line:90%
to be fully felt from that day.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And then you just let yourself
fully feel it, and let

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.280 align:middle line:84%
the emotion naturally
dissolve or move through

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:45.300 align:middle line:84%
without pushing it or
manipulating it in any way.

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And with practice, this
becomes such a nourishing thing

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:84%
to do that you wonder how did I
ever even survive without this.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:59.580 align:middle line:84%
And you're able to not carry
so much baggage from one day

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:03.700 align:middle line:84%
into the next when you're
doing this digestion practice.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.930 align:middle line:10%
The second practice or tip
that I want to share with you

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:11.400 align:middle line:10%
is traditionally called feeding
the goddesses of the senses.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.140 align:middle line:10%
And it's a beautiful practice.

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.470 align:middle line:10%
And it's one in which we
are able to actually express

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.420 align:middle line:10%
our love and care for ourselves.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So in this practice,
very simply,

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
for about five
minutes every day,

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.580 align:middle line:84%
you nourish one of your
senses with beauty.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:31.360 align:middle line:10%
Whether that means meditating
on a beautiful piece of music,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.210 align:middle line:10%
whether that means totally
diving into the experience

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:40.710 align:middle line:10%
of a taste of delicious food
and focusing on nothing but that

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.420 align:middle line:10%
for five or 10 minutes.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Or even a smell or a
sensation of touch.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Any of the senses can be
nourished in this way.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh, that sounds
like a great homework.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.846 align:middle line:90%
I totally want to do that.

00:16:54.846 --> 00:16:56.220 align:middle line:10%
But the thing is
to actually make

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.230 align:middle line:10%
it a discipline
where you actually

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:10%
commit to nourishing one
or more of the senses

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:10%
for five or 10 minutes
every single day.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And in this way, the more
we care for our senses,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.210 align:middle line:84%
which naturally long for
these experiences of beauty

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:15.329 align:middle line:84%
and presence, then
we start to feel

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:18.990 align:middle line:84%
more and more that overflows
into the rest of our day.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.960 align:middle line:84%
We notice beauty
where we weren't

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:84%
able to notice it
before when we're

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.250 align:middle line:84%
doing this practice
of nourishing

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.930 align:middle line:90%
the senses with beauty.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:33.090 align:middle line:84%
So it's an actual yogic
practice of Tantric yoga, which

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:38.460 align:middle line:84%
is more open to exploring
the senses and sensuality

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:40.780 align:middle line:90%
than other forms of yoga.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Which is part of
how it developed

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:47.070 align:middle line:84%
some of the misunderstandings
that indeed circulate about it.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
think they don't

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:51.960 align:middle line:84%
have time for a dedicated
spiritual practice.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.760 align:middle line:84%
I would have to sit for
an hour every morning.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:10%
Actually, it's
even more powerful

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:59.730 align:middle line:10%
if you take five
minutes here and there

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.510 align:middle line:10%
throughout your day, maybe two
or three or even four times,

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:10%
to do one of these
practices, or one or more.

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:10.980 align:middle line:10%
And in that way, when you
weave awareness and awareness

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:13.710 align:middle line:10%
cultivation into
your everyday life,

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:10%
it has a more powerful
impact than if you

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:10%
have a spiritual
practice that's separated

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:10%
from the rest of your life.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
So I encourage you to
explore the way in which you

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:84%
can interweave that which you
love and that which you value,

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.650 align:middle line:84%
and care for yourself,
and accessing

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.160 align:middle line:84%
your center into the fabric
of your everyday life

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:84%
in all the nooks and crannies
that are available to you

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:43.890 align:middle line:84%
throughout that
tapestry of life.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> So great.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:45.560 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I love the way you
articulate everything.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important to
be able to even just get

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.310 align:middle line:84%
some space between the
busyness of our days.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And you articulate
it so beautifully

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.100 align:middle line:90%
and make it so clear.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for being here.

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's
wonderful to be here.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.210 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:03.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.650 align:middle line:84%
