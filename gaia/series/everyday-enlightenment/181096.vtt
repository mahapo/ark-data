00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm Ashleigh Sergeant,
and welcome to "Everyday

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.750 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment," your
go-to show for tips

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.910 align:middle line:10%
on how to be more
conscious in the midst

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.160 align:middle line:10%
of your busy modern life.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:84%
Community is a word we
hear now more than ever

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.980 align:middle line:84%
as the digital age rapidly
increases our ability

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.670 align:middle line:84%
to communicate and connect with
one another across the globe.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.430 align:middle line:84%
The rise of online and
social media communities

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
has exploded with an estimated
2.5 billion people currently

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.370 align:middle line:90%
using social media.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.430 align:middle line:84%
This desire to feel
connected to one

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.480 align:middle line:84%
another is an undeniable
trait of humanity, one

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.490 align:middle line:84%
that I truly believe
has the power

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:84%
to heal many of the
sufferings of this world.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.750 align:middle line:10%
How do these expressions of
community help us to heal?

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And what can we do
in our modern world

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:84%
to support this ancient
and necessary cornerstone

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.430 align:middle line:90%
of human connection?

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.900 align:middle line:10%
My guest today is Mary Clare
Sweet, a longtime yoga teacher

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.130 align:middle line:10%
here on Gaia.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.710 align:middle line:10%
M. C. is an activist,
businesswoman,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.870 align:middle line:10%
and superpowered entrepreneur.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.990 align:middle line:10%
She owns and runs five
companies, all of which

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:10%
focus on building community.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.580 align:middle line:84%
These include five yoga
studios in Nebraska,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:90%
as well as a superfoods cafe.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
With her mother
and her team, they

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:84%
run an annual gathering
in the heartland.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Mary Clare, thanks so much
for being here with me today.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much, Ashleigh.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.416 align:middle line:90%
I'm so happy to be here.

00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
>> It's great to be with you
and to talk about community.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're such an amazing
leader in the yoga world

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.930 align:middle line:84%
around this concept of community
and all the different shapes

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and forms that it
takes because it can

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.170 align:middle line:90%
take many different iterations.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just one aspect
or one expression of community

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.930 align:middle line:84%
that we need to really,
I think, help us heal

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.500 align:middle line:90%
and bring us together.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.560 align:middle line:10%
And I think it
should be that way.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.070 align:middle line:10%
There should be lots of
different communities

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.270 align:middle line:10%
that intersect with each other.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.410 align:middle line:84%
All of these amazing
circles of humans

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.360 align:middle line:84%
coming together and very
organic, very life-giving, very

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:90%
living entity is community.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's been talked
about more recently,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.000 align:middle line:84%
I think, in modern culture,
this concept of tribe,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
this concept of community, this
concept of finding a resonance,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.270 align:middle line:84%
finding people that are
not only like-minded

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.000 align:middle line:84%
but are like-hearted, which
is a term I really love,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.750 align:middle line:84%
that we really resonate
with one another

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:90%
around different interests.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.550 align:middle line:84%
We've seen it manifest in pop
culture around like sports,

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.010 align:middle line:84%
around food, around different
dance, around music.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is not something that
is new to our modern culture.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
It has its own expression
in modern culture.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.340 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the amazing
things about social media--

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:84%
and I have all my plenty of
negative things to say around

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.674 align:middle line:90%
social media--

00:03:19.674 --> 00:03:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and there's also a lot of
really beautiful things about it

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.000 align:middle line:84%
that with this new,
advancing technology,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:84%
we actually have the
ability to see and even

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.540 align:middle line:84%
feel through information
online some of the cultures

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and the communities and the
values that have really been

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.310 align:middle line:90%
instilled in humanity forever.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.743 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and I think
you hit it on the head.

00:03:44.743 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:90%
Like, we feel a certain way.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.570 align:middle line:84%
There's a vibration
inside of us.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.930 align:middle line:84%
And where that vibration
becomes activated

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.210 align:middle line:84%
or where it comes from,
we don't really know.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.340 align:middle line:84%
But all of a sudden,
we're feeling something.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And then we look out
and see, wow, maybe

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.120 align:middle line:84%
that person is feeling this too,
and that person is feeling this

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.920 align:middle line:90%
too.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And over the past
hundreds of years,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.780 align:middle line:84%
we haven't had this ability
to really reach out past

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
where we were born
and where we grew up.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And today, we get
to look out into,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.029 align:middle line:84%
you know what, I sometimes call
the eighth chakra because it's

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:24.730 align:middle line:84%
like we're tapping into this
global web of connection

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and going, you
feel this way too?

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:90%
You feel this way too?

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's come together.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, music
is an incredible way

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.470 align:middle line:84%
to do that because
it is vibration.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:84%
But I think that yoga
and consciousness,

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.050 align:middle line:90%
seeking and pursuits--

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:90%
that's a feeling too.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how many
yoga teachers have

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.690 align:middle line:84%
you asked or how many times have
you been asked what is yoga?

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And every time, there's
a different answer.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
No matter who is asking it
or every time I answer it,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.540 align:middle line:84%
it's different because
it's a vibration.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a
concrete, static thing.

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:90%
It's living.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
community is to me.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:90%
It's growing.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:90%
It's changing.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a vibration.

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the things I
love from the really essential

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.430 align:middle line:84%
teachings of not just yoga,
but of Ayurveda, of Buddhism,

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.520 align:middle line:84%
of a lot of the Eastern
traditions is that the true

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.890 align:middle line:84%
reality is that we are one,
is that we are all connected,

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.080 align:middle line:84%
and that suffering and the
myriad of ways that suffering

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.050 align:middle line:84%
manifests in the world is at
its very deepest level caused

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.640 align:middle line:84%
by this lack of seeing and
understanding that we are all

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.440 align:middle line:90%
connected.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And that separation, that
idea that we are separate,

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.270 align:middle line:90%
comes from fear.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:90%
And fear just comes from pain.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So babies are born
into this earth

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.600 align:middle line:90%
and, they don't see separation.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.090 align:middle line:84%
They see that unity
consciousness.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.600 align:middle line:84%
However, as we learn how to be
a human in our own families,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:84%
we start to see, oh,
this is my family.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.840 align:middle line:90%
This is what we do.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.250 align:middle line:84%
This is what my
grandparents did.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:90%
This is what their parents--

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:84%
and it creates this
little wall of separation.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And one thing that you and
I have spoken a lot about

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:84%
is the word compassion and how
compassion utterly dissolves

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.210 align:middle line:90%
that wall of separation.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
When you can sit with someone
else in their own suffering

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel
your own and accept

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:84%
where you are in
that moment, that's

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:90%
where the unification is.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not going, like, you
have this whole journey

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:84%
of your life, and where
you are today, we are one.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:90%
It's going, I see you.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I know that your journey has
been filled with ups and downs.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.705 align:middle line:84%
Mine has too, and let's
be there together.

00:06:49.705 --> 00:06:50.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:50.505 --> 00:06:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And the reality that
that connection brings

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
is a sense of happiness,
a sense of joy.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's not this superficial
kind of, oh, yeah,

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:84%
it's just so happy when
we gather together.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.780 align:middle line:90%
Like, that happens sometimes.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.730 align:middle line:84%
But we also-- and
a lot of things

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:11.340 align:middle line:84%
are built around gathering
together for celebration.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.670 align:middle line:84%
But we also gather together
for the celebration

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.100 align:middle line:84%
of a life that is passed
or the mourning of a life

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that has passed or
the coming together

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.760 align:middle line:84%
for a revolution
against a belief system

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.260 align:middle line:90%
that isn't working anymore.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.070 align:middle line:84%
And that remembrance
is a return.

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:34.224 align:middle line:84%
It's coming back to the truth of
your nature, which is presence.

00:07:34.224 --> 00:07:36.390 align:middle line:90%
Presence is the eternity.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.310 align:middle line:90%
Eternity is right now.

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:90%
Eternity has no history.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Eternity has no future.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.080 align:middle line:90%
Eternity is here.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And when we're present, we
truly make that connection.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And in regard to the
word happiness and joy

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:84%
and feeling those good
vibes, it's only sustainable

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.420 align:middle line:90%
if you're present.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:84%
If you're constantly
chasing after something

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.670 align:middle line:84%
or looking for
some new pleasure,

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:07.620 align:middle line:84%
that's only going to
feed the fire with fire.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:11.250 align:middle line:84%
When you recognize in
the present moment,

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.120 align:middle line:84%
really, right here,
this is eternity,

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.940 align:middle line:90%
that's sustainable happiness.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.390 align:middle line:90%
And that's sustainable joy.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Really being able to--

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and this is one of
the things I feel yoga

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:84%
as a practice has really given
me the ability to really hear

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:84%
and the ability to really listen
and the ability to really see

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and the joy that we get from
actually really seeing someone

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:84%
else or really
hearing someone else

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.929 align:middle line:84%
and really being seen
and really heard.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And that comes from this
concept of community.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.529 align:middle line:84%
We see it, and it can
manifest in interesting ways.

00:08:46.529 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:84%
But we see it in some of
the social media things,

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:53.630 align:middle line:84%
like now everybody has this
ability to share their voice.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And, sure, there can be
shadow sides and things

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.260 align:middle line:84%
around that, which is why I'm
always all for online community

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:84%
and in-person
community because there

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.930 align:middle line:84%
are different aspects
to what we show up

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and what kind of presence
and what kind of quality

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:14.302 align:middle line:84%
we bring to that
type of community.

00:09:14.302 --> 00:09:16.260 align:middle line:84%
But something that you
and I were talking about

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.080 align:middle line:84%
before that I love
is that community

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.320 align:middle line:84%
itself has the ability
to make us stronger,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:84%
to actually fortify us,
to raise our vibration.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.540 align:middle line:90%
And what does that mean?

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when you are in a
situation where you are fearful

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.640 align:middle line:84%
or you are scared
or on the defensive,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
like you're prepared
with some argument,

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.710 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it's this identity
that you're wearing like armor,

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:50.040 align:middle line:84%
you can physically test
your muscles and show that

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
they're not as strong as when
you arrive into the present

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:90%
moment with openness.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.610 align:middle line:84%
The word vulnerability--
we perceive vulnerability

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.940 align:middle line:84%
means I'm open and
vulnerable to an attack.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But, actually, vulnerability
is like the most pure

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and profound element of strength
that a human can experience.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And when we arrive
to the present

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.850 align:middle line:84%
with that vulnerability, our
muscles in muscle testing

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.680 align:middle line:90%
is actually stronger.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.950 align:middle line:84%
Our immune system is
actually stronger.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Our brain is functioning
at a higher cognitive

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.990 align:middle line:84%
level than when we come with
this preconceived armor.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And we can feel it
amongst each other

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.830 align:middle line:84%
even when we arrive at
these yoga festivals

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
or we're watching
a video on Gaia.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
we're like, ahh.

00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
You feel like you can
open and be vulnerable.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:90%
That's your true strength.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.970 align:middle line:84%
So in a community, when we have
a lot of people coming together

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:01.790 align:middle line:84%
like this in that
vulnerable space,

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.820 align:middle line:84%
we actually become a
stronger human species.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.620 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.650 align:middle line:90%
It's so powerful.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:84%
And in that in and
of itself is healing.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Just the ability to be able to
have a reflection with someone

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:22.100 align:middle line:90%
else, a real, like, oh, wow.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:90%
I feel this way.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.870 align:middle line:84%
You've felt that way too to
really be heard is so healing.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.510 align:middle line:84%
And, also, it doesn't
always feel as good,

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:32.960 align:middle line:84%
but one of the beautiful
things about really developing

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.900 align:middle line:84%
community over time
in my experience

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.420 align:middle line:84%
and being vulnerable,
like you said,

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.020 align:middle line:84%
is when you can say to
me like, hey, Ashleigh,

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.800 align:middle line:84%
you're being really
stubborn about this.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.570 align:middle line:90%
You're not hearing me.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.560 align:middle line:84%
You're inappropriate
or some pattern.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think in
some situation too,

00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:84%
we can as conscious leaders and
as conscious friends and family

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:02.281 align:middle line:90%
members even just--

00:12:02.281 --> 00:12:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've noticed this.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.420 align:middle line:84%
But when my daughter
or a good friend

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:84%
or someone in my
family or even myself,

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
but when we're being
really stubborn

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and on that, the more I just
sit and maybe don't even

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:84%
need to say anything but just
sit and listen and just bear

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.510 align:middle line:84%
witness to them
going through that,

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:29.390 align:middle line:84%
usually, three or
four minutes later,

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:90%
they're kind of like, oh.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this isn't
such a big deal.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And that's such a
powerful part of community

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:84%
too is just the ability for
you in my moment of weakness

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.090 align:middle line:84%
to be my security
guard at the gate

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and just to stand there while
I move through my process

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:90%
and really heal myself.

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and all of the infinite
ways that these things can be

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.390 align:middle line:84%
expressed is the healing
power of community--

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:06.480 align:middle line:84%
is the healing power of
community and is so, I believe,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.640 align:middle line:84%
essential because
we can't heal alone.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:90%
We can heal certain things.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
We need to heal ourselves
and really be with ourselves.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.290 align:middle line:84%
But it's when we step
back out into the world

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and when we are living
and breathing and being

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
that the evolution and the
healing really happens.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:25.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.640 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's then the joy.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:84%
That is the joy that you can
put forth into your service

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:35.420 align:middle line:90%
to our world.

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Your greatest gift, each of
our greatest gifts and talents

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
we were brought to
this planet with

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.580 align:middle line:84%
is what we were meant
to give to the world.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And when we can give
those gifts with great joy

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and a high vibration and
feeling really strong in that,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.170 align:middle line:84%
that is what evolves
us as a community.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is what you
were talking about

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:06.710 align:middle line:84%
before that creates legacy is
really we all have this desire

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:84%
to fulfill whatever it is we
are here to do in this life.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:90%
We all have the desire to--

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:19.560 align:middle line:84%
a question that someone
asked me one time.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:84%
I'll never forget the
first time this was asked,

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:27.230 align:middle line:84%
was, when you leave this body
or when you pass, how do you

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.630 align:middle line:90%
want to be remembered?

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a powerful
question to contemplate.

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And I really believe that it is
to feel that we have lived life

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:84%
to its fullest, to feel that
we have experienced connection

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:90%
>> What's your answer?

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>> I know my answer is I don't--

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:57.234 align:middle line:84%
my answer is that I really
hope that people will say--

00:14:57.234 --> 00:14:59.150 align:middle line:84%
because that's what was
the question was like,

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:84%
what will people say about
you and your legacy--

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:84%
that she helped and
inspired me to grow

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:84%
or others to grow and to heal
because it has been my mission

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:84%
and my experience
is to want to heal

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.840 align:middle line:84%
and to grow and to feel
empowered, to know I

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.670 align:middle line:90%
have the ability to do it--

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.170 align:middle line:84%
it's all within
me-- and then to be

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:27.090 align:middle line:84%
able to help others
do the same thing.

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And then we as a community
help empower legacy,

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.130 align:middle line:90%
help to empower great beings.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.860 align:middle line:84%
And doesn't mean we have to
have done these great feats

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.380 align:middle line:90%
or be famous people.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.660 align:middle line:90%
It's were we kind?

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, communities
with unconditional love

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:84%
at their core are the legacy
that I want the next wave

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:84%
of humans to be
able to step into.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.540 align:middle line:84%
We have over the
last 200, 300, 400

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
years in Western
colonialism been very,

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.390 align:middle line:90%
like, these are the walls.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:90%
This is what I'm fighting for.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, every
step along the way

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.270 align:middle line:84%
needed to happen so you
and I could be sitting here

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
speaking to millions of
humans all over the planet.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And because we have
this opportunity

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.790 align:middle line:84%
and we have this
platform, our job

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.330 align:middle line:84%
is to create communities that
the next wave of humans coming

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.410 align:middle line:84%
in can step into and go, oh,
this is how we do things,

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:35.450 align:middle line:84%
where we are all in a symbiotic
relationship with our planet

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and each other and the
elderly and the young people.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.190 align:middle line:90%
We're all working together.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's not that kind of
stereotypical like we're just

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:90%
going to sit around and kumbaya.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.440 align:middle line:84%
No, we get to go on
a great adventure.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And we get to create
new innovation,

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.480 align:middle line:84%
and we get to brainstorm
and create brilliant ideas.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.970 align:middle line:84%
But it's all done in
cooperation with one another,

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:84%
not in a race against
somebody else.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love for you to
share with us a couple of--

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:17.520 align:middle line:84%
you really embody this
energy of high vibes

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.990 align:middle line:90%
and energy of connection.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And you're obviously
doing that and living it

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
in entrepreneurship, which is
amazing and powerful to really

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:90%
weave that into business.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And so if you can tell us
some really powerful ways

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:84%
to do that in daily life,
that would be amazing.

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:35.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:36.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.490 align:middle line:90%
I would love to.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:84%
So there are three
essential tips

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.070 align:middle line:84%
that I'd love to share
with you about how

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.580 align:middle line:84%
to start to connect with
others and build your own

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.490 align:middle line:84%
or connect with an
existing community.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.900 align:middle line:90%
The first step is courage.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.690 align:middle line:90%
Courage comes from your heart.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.900 align:middle line:84%
It comes from the word
cor, which means heart.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And your courage comes
first in listening.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So listen to what people
are saying around you.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:07.190 align:middle line:84%
Listen to what people are
saying on the message boards

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and where they're coming from
and what their journey has

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:90%
held for them.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And then have the courage
to speak your truth.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.150 align:middle line:84%
Have the courage to say
what you mean and mean

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.960 align:middle line:84%
what you say because your
consciousness in every moment

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.900 align:middle line:84%
is arriving at the perfect
place of your truth.

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:29.210 align:middle line:84%
So listen and then speak
and do so with courage.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:90%
Number two is acceptance.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:10%
You have to accept where you
are right here, right now.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.240 align:middle line:84%
Whatever moment you're
in, whatever yoga clothes

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:45.890 align:middle line:84%
you have or don't have, or
whatever state your life is in,

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:90%
accept where you are right now.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.296 align:middle line:84%
That's the most powerful
thing that you can do.

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And once you've
done that, you'll

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.190 align:middle line:84%
be able to accept
everyone else where they

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:84%
are as well in your
workplace, in your family,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.960 align:middle line:84%
in your neighborhood, and
online on social media,

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.450 align:middle line:84%
just being able to
accept that everybody

00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:06.620 align:middle line:90%
is in a different place.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.530 align:middle line:90%
That acceptance starts with you.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.860 align:middle line:90%
And number three is inclusivity.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.700 align:middle line:10%
We have a job as
conscious beings

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:10%
to include people from radically
different walks of life.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:84%
These start with conversations
that are like bridges.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.020 align:middle line:84%
But we can't just
rely on this idea

00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:30.230 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to include
everyone that comes our way.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:32.780 align:middle line:84%
We have to go out
and invite people

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:90%
from different communities.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:84%
So I really think
that inclusivity

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.200 align:middle line:84%
starts with stepping out
of your own comfort zone

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and going to find people that
might be different than you.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:44.870 align:middle line:84%
That might be a
different organization

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:47.450 align:middle line:84%
in your community or a
different yoga studio,

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you go walk or
run a 5K or something.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.260 align:middle line:84%
But step outside of
your comfort zone

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and include and invite
people around you.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.680 align:middle line:90%
Start with courage.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Move to acceptance
and then inclusivity.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That was amazing.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.120 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.524 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it's so important to
make it practical and grounded.

00:20:08.524 --> 00:20:11.711 align:middle line:84%
And we can do it every
moment and every day.

00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for being
here and for sharing your wisdom

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:15.500 align:middle line:90%
and your authenticity.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:16.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Ashleigh.

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Always.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for joining
us, and I'll see you next time.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.370 align:middle line:90%
