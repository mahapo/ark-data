00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a core understanding
in the yoga tradition

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.300 align:middle line:84%
that says, where the
mind goes, energy flows.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.520 align:middle line:84%
The science of yogic
meditation also

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.600 align:middle line:84%
states that prana, energy,
and chita, or thought,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.970 align:middle line:90%
are two sides of the same coin.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Where one goes,
the other follows.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.490 align:middle line:84%
My guest is a leading
scientific researcher

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.730 align:middle line:84%
in the study of meditation
and human potential.

In Dr. Joe Dispenza's
most recent book,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:10%
"Becoming Supernatural,"
he shows us

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.130 align:middle line:10%
how thoughts trigger biochemical
reactions in the brain, which

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.280 align:middle line:10%
then release chemical signals
that cause the body to feel

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:10%
exactly how we were
just thinking, leaving

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.310 align:middle line:10%
us caught in what he calls
the thinking/feeling loop.

>> So being a yoga
teacher for many years,

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested in
the study of meditation,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.880 align:middle line:84%
and how it actually works,
having felt the effects on it.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Your work is extremely
exciting and interesting.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.360 align:middle line:84%
Will you tell us a little
bit about your experience

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.270 align:middle line:84%
of the yoga tradition,
and maybe how

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.460 align:middle line:84%
this has fueled
some of the research

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.480 align:middle line:90%
that you're doing today?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.020 align:middle line:10%
I started this whole journey
because I read a book

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.170 align:middle line:10%
about yoga early on.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.220 align:middle line:10%
And I was in search of
a greater way to be.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And one thing about
yoga is I couldn't

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
get my body in the beginning
to do what I wanted it to do.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.450 align:middle line:84%
So it was now something
that I wanted to master.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So being athletic, and then
all of a sudden breaking

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.374 align:middle line:84%
from competitive sports and
getting involved in yoga,

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:84%
I just read everything
I could about it,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:84%
and spent so much time
doing a lot of yoga.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think we learn a lot
about our bodies when we do it,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.180 align:middle line:90%
intuitively.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.150 align:middle line:84%
But really, for the most part,
it led me to the understanding

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:84%
that Hatha yoga was the
foundational yoga in schools

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:84%
of ancient wisdom, where people
came from all walks of life

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.330 align:middle line:84%
to break down physical
rigidity in their body

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.440 align:middle line:84%
so they could sit for
extended periods of time

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.800 align:middle line:84%
and go within so the body
was no longer problematic.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:84%
The side effect of
that, of course,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.510 align:middle line:84%
is it produces a lot of
benefits and health changes.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But once we start
settling the body down,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
the next thing we have
to address is the mind.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.215 align:middle line:84%
And so if you want to develop
the idea of where you place

00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:47.590 align:middle line:84%
your attention is
where you place

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
your energy, the moment
you have a thought,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
and that thought produces
a biochemical reaction

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:84%
in your brain, and you begin
to feel a certain emotion, when

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
you feel that emotion,
you begin to think

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.030 align:middle line:84%
equal to that
emotional state, which

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:84%
then keeps firing the same
circuits in your brain

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.560 align:middle line:84%
that keeps producing
the same emotions.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
And that loop over
time conditions

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
the body to store that
emotion in it energetically.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So then what happens is
people all of a sudden start

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
to have energetic
patterns in their body

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:90%
that have to be broken down.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And so yoga is a great
way of wringing water out

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:84%
of the washcloth and begin to
create more holism and balance.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.670 align:middle line:90%
So good for the start.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.010 align:middle line:84%
But then you have to
all of a sudden start

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.560 align:middle line:84%
to address where your
thoughts and attention goes.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
For example, the
stronger the emotion

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:84%
that you feel from
something in your life,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
the more you pay attention
to whatever's causing it.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So then if you can't manage
your emotional state,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.770 align:middle line:84%
then, in a sense, you're giving
your power away to that person

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.860 align:middle line:84%
or to that problem, because now
energy is moving away from you.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:84%
>> At the same time, if you keep
living by the same emotions,

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:84%
and you keep your attention
on those emotions,

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.230 align:middle line:84%
emotions are a
record of the past.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.690 align:middle line:84%
They're chemical residue
from past experiences.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
So the more a person puts their
attention on their emotions,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.640 align:middle line:84%
the more they're
thinking in the past.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.330 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you
can't think greater

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.060 align:middle line:84%
than how you feel, or
feelings have become

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
the means of thinking, and you
believe that your thoughts have

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.774 align:middle line:84%
something to do
with your destiny,

00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:84%
then you're thinking
in the past,

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.760 align:middle line:84%
and you keep creating
the same life.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So then thoughts are the
language of the brain.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And feelings are the
language of the body.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And how you think and how you
feel creates a state of being.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So then, if you
think about this,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.340 align:middle line:84%
your body is your
unconscious mind.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know the difference
between an experience

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.770 align:middle line:84%
in your life that creates
an emotion and an emotion

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.870 align:middle line:84%
that you can create
by thought alone.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So when people get
caught in these loops,

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.310 align:middle line:84%
their body is believing
they're living

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.730 align:middle line:84%
in the same past experience
24 hours a day, 7 days a week,

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.220 align:middle line:90%
365 days a year.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:84%
The body literally becomes
conditioned into the past.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:90%
So what does a person do?

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:90%
They get up.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.564 align:middle line:84%
They go through
the same routine.

00:05:01.564 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:90%
They check their cell phone.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.630 align:middle line:84%
They check their texts, their
WhatsApp, their Instagram,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:90%
their Facebook.

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.846 align:middle line:84%
They take a picture
of their feet.

00:05:07.846 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:90%
They post it on Facebook.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.570 align:middle line:90%
They check the news.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.485 align:middle line:90%
They check one email.

00:05:11.485 --> 00:05:12.610 align:middle line:90%
They check the other email.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.526 align:middle line:84%
Then they get up, and
they go through a series

00:05:14.526 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle line:90%
of routine behaviors.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
And they do that
over and over again.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, they are
programming their body

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:22.080 align:middle line:84%
into a predictable
future based on what

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:90%
they've done in the past.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So, in a sense, they've lost
their free will to a program.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
So then yoga, the act
of moving into an asana

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.210 align:middle line:84%
and being present, it takes a
tremendous amount of effort,

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.789 align:middle line:84%
once you're
experiencing discomfort

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.830 align:middle line:84%
to move your attention
away from that discomfort.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So then most people
run from discomfort.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.572 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to look at it.

00:05:45.572 --> 00:05:48.030 align:middle line:84%
But when you're sitting in the
presence of that discomfort,

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and you're being
present with it,

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.510 align:middle line:84%
you're literally
taking that emotion

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:84%
that's stored in the body, and
your liberating it as energy.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
When you change your breathing,
you change your brainwaves.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to
change your brainwaves,

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.972 align:middle line:84%
you move beyond the
analytical mind,

00:06:01.972 --> 00:06:04.305 align:middle line:84%
which separates the conscious
mind from the subconscious

00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:05.105 align:middle line:90%
mind.

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:07.365 align:middle line:84%
Now you're entering
the operating system

00:06:07.365 --> 00:06:09.720 align:middle line:84%
where all those
subconscious programs exist.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can begin to
reprogram the brain and body

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
so that when you open your
eyes, and you step out

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.410 align:middle line:84%
into your life, your brain
and body are changed ahead

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.290 align:middle line:90%
of the environment.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:84%
So now you're in a
new state of being.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And it only requires two
things, a clear intention

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.620 align:middle line:90%
and an elevated emotion.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's brain coherence
and heart coherence.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that properly
now, all of a sudden,

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.370 align:middle line:84%
you begin to produce
measurable changes

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.410 align:middle line:84%
in your inner world
that starts to be

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:90%
reflected in your outer world.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:84%
The synchronicities,
the coincidences,

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the opportunities,
the side effect

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
in your change of energy, change
in attention begins to open up

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:90%
possibilities in your life.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And we move from living in
the known, where everything

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.610 align:middle line:84%
is predictable, to, all of a
sudden, living in the unknown.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.507 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
the magic happens.

00:06:55.507 --> 00:06:56.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
For me this is so
interesting, because this maps

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.180 align:middle line:84%
directly onto the kosha
model in the yoga tradition.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, the kosha is
the five layers of being,

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.570 align:middle line:84%
where we talk about the physical
body, the energetic body.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
layer of being

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:84%
is what they would
call the Manomaya

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:84%
kosha, which is actually
the mind, emotion body.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty
fascinating for me

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.800 align:middle line:84%
that in texts a couple
thousand years ago

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
they're already saying that
there's this mind, emotion

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.850 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Because people sometimes think
that, oh, if I think something,

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and I feel something, and
those two concepts match,

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.610 align:middle line:90%
then it must be true.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> But then the next layer
in the koshic model is

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
the Vijnanamaya kosha, or
the witness consciousness,

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.802 align:middle line:84%
which is as a yoga teacher in
my tradition that I've studied

00:07:40.802 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, that's what
I hear you saying when you say

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm sitting down, and I'm
getting into a place where I

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.610 align:middle line:84%
actually have the ability to
step aside from seeing the mind

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.350 align:middle line:84%
and the emotions happen,
and actually say, OK,

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:55.500 align:middle line:84%
I am not just the
mind and the emotions.

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.690 align:middle line:90%
There is a part of me.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.440 align:middle line:84%
Witness consciousness
some people call it.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> That's actually experiencing
all this that is going on.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But doesn't actually
have to engage.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:05.310 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
it seems that this

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.570 align:middle line:84%
is kind of where you're
saying, that that's where

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.060 align:middle line:90%
the pattern starts to change.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so so many people now
that are gravitating towards

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:90%
this work are yoga teachers.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.900 align:middle line:90%
Cause they understand it.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
In a physical, gut level,
they experience it.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
And there's absolutely
no doubt in my mind

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.030 align:middle line:84%
that if you start
wondering who's

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:84%
doing the observing
of your thoughts,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:90%
that's who you really are.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.440 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.240 align:middle line:84%
So 95% of who we are by
the time we're 35 years old

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.429 align:middle line:84%
is a set of memorized
behaviors, emotional reactions,

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:38.610 align:middle line:84%
unconscious hardwired
attitudes, beliefs, perceptions

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.784 align:middle line:84%
that function like a
subconscious computer program.

00:08:41.784 --> 00:08:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So people want to
change, they use

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.030 align:middle line:90%
the 5% of their conscious mind.

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:46.822 align:middle line:84%
But it's the body that
has become the mind.

00:08:46.822 --> 00:08:47.621 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:47.621 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So the energy is
stored in the body.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So then how do you get
the mind out of the body?

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:52.890 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:84%
How do you begin to
liberate that energy?

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the moment you
start paying attention

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
to how you're thinking, the
moment you start thinking

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.130 align:middle line:84%
about what you're thinking,
the moment you start observing

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:08.700 align:middle line:84%
how you're behaving, how you
speak, the moment you notice,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:84%
my god, I've been feeling
guilt for the last 30 years.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even think
it was guilt. I

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:90%
thought it was just how I felt.

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That's liberating.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The moment you do that,
you're no longer the program.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.503 align:middle line:84%
>> You're the consciousness
observing the program.

00:09:18.503 --> 00:09:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to objectify
the subjective self.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
That's who you really
are when you're not

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:90%
immersed in that program.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So the first step
in really beginning

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:84%
to re-manage your
energy is to be

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.150 align:middle line:84%
able to observe those
states of mind and body

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.310 align:middle line:84%
without judgment,
without reaction.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And sitting in the presence
of that emotional state,

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and not turning on the TV or
getting in your cell phone.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.310 align:middle line:84%
But sitting with it,
and transmuting it

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.850 align:middle line:90%
into something else.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So then your personality
creates your personal reality.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And your personality is made up
of how you think, how you act,

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.200 align:middle line:90%
and how you feel.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So the present personality
who's watching this show

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:84%
has created the present
personal reality

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.520 align:middle line:84%
called their life,
which means if you want

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.480 align:middle line:84%
to create a new personal
reality, a new life,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.850 align:middle line:84%
you have to begin to
change your personality.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:84%
And that means then, you got to
light a match in a dark place.

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And just because
you have a thought

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.900 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily
mean it's true.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:20.480 align:middle line:84%
So those subconscious thoughts
that are happening behind

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.900 align:middle line:84%
the scenes of people's awareness
are always saying, I can't.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.700 align:middle line:90%
It's too hard.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:90%
I'll never change.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.293 align:middle line:90%
I'll start tomorrow.

00:10:26.293 --> 00:10:27.510 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't feel right.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:28.610 align:middle line:90%
I want to take my life.

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Nobody loves me.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:90%
They believe those thoughts.

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.470 align:middle line:84%
But those are just
old circuits that have

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:34.620 align:middle line:90%
been stored in their brain.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.130 align:middle line:84%
So then the moment they
start complaining, blaming,

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.470 align:middle line:84%
making excuses, and feeling
sorry for themselves,

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.480 align:middle line:84%
they all of a sudden
start to see themselves

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.250 align:middle line:84%
through the eyes
of someone else.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
Or they discover,
my god, I am so

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:84%
happy being unhappy that
actually I get attention

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.990 align:middle line:90%
for being this way.

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:84%
The moment they
say that, you see,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.820 align:middle line:84%
most people try to create
a new personal reality

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.220 align:middle line:84%
as the same personality,
and it doesn't work.

00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:84%
You literally have to
become someone else.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.400 align:middle line:84%
So then the model of
meditation says, OK,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:84%
what thoughts do I want to
fire and wire in my brain?

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.610 align:middle line:90%
To put my attention behind.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:84%
What behaviors do I want
to demonstrate today?

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:84%
And the act of mental
rehearsal, of closing your eyes,

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and rehearsing
your actions begins

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:84%
to install the
neurological hardware

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:84%
in your brain to look like
the experience has already

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:90%
happened.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, the brain is no longer
a record of the past.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:90%
Now it's a map to the future.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you keep doing
it over and over again,

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:36.200 align:middle line:84%
the hardware will become
a software program.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:90%
And who knows?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.560 align:middle line:84%
You just may start acting
like a happy person.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.500 align:middle line:90%
No magic there.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.870 align:middle line:90%
You installed the circuitry.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.820 align:middle line:84%
You may start thinking
in more unlimited ways.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, you primed
your brain for that.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.750 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the tough part.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.810 align:middle line:84%
Can you teach your
body emotionally

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.190 align:middle line:84%
what that future
is going to feel

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:84%
like before the
actual experience?

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:84%
So that doesn't mean now you're
going to wait for your success

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:90%
to feel empowered.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.300 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going
to wait for your wealth

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.490 align:middle line:84%
to feel abundance,
or worthiness,

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:08.240 align:middle line:84%
or wait for your healing to
feel gratitude and wholeness,

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:10.370 align:middle line:84%
or your new relationship
to feel love,

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.890 align:middle line:84%
or the mystical
experience to feel awe.

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.530 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of the old model
of reality of cause and effect,

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.200 align:middle line:84%
waiting for something outside of
us to change how we feel inside

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.000 align:middle line:90%
of us.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.160 align:middle line:90%
That's Newtonian physics.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.840 align:middle line:84%
But the quantum
model of reality is

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.670 align:middle line:84%
about causing an
effect, which means

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:84%
the moment you start
feeling abundant,

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.206 align:middle line:90%
you're generating wealth.

00:12:29.206 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:84%
The moment you start
feeling empowered,

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:32.750 align:middle line:84%
you're stepping
towards your success.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.330 align:middle line:84%
The moment you start feeling
gratitude and wholeness,

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.230 align:middle line:90%
your healing begins.

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.740 align:middle line:84%
The moment you're
in awe of life,

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.531 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a mystical experience.

00:12:39.531 --> 00:12:41.281 align:middle line:84%
The moment you're in
love with yourself,

00:12:41.281 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:90%
you're going to find an equal.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:90%
That's causing an effect.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So then it requires
then just a reeducation.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the yogic
traditions, they

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.950 align:middle line:84%
were contemporary
5,000 years ago.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And that language
today no longer fits.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.890 align:middle line:84%
The language to explain
this is science.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.050 align:middle line:84%
So in the workshops
we do there's

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:08.060 align:middle line:84%
a strong element of learning
philosophy, knowledge, theory.

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.280 align:middle line:84%
But then when you turn to
the person next to you,

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:84%
and you explain
it, and you begin

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:84%
to build the model
of understanding,

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.760 align:middle line:84%
you are actually installing
the neurological hardware

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.850 align:middle line:84%
in your brain in preparation
for an experience.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And the more you understand
what you're doing and why,

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.080 align:middle line:90%
the how gets easier.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.384 align:middle line:84%
So you begin to
demystify the process.

00:13:26.384 --> 00:13:28.550 align:middle line:84%
That means then you've got
to modify your behaviors.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:84%
You've got to get your behaviors
to match your intentions.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.293 align:middle line:84%
You've got to begin
to personalize it.

00:13:32.293 --> 00:13:34.200 align:middle line:84%
You've got to begin
to demonstrate it.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.240 align:middle line:84%
You've got to begin to
do something about it.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.059 align:middle line:84%
So when you initiate
that knowledge,

00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
if you do it properly, you're
going to have a new experience.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:84%
An experience then enriches
the circuits in your brain.

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And the end product
of an experience

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:90%
is called an emotion.

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:49.410 align:middle line:84%
But it's not guilt.
It's not unworthiness.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not anger.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:90%
It's not fear.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:53.750 align:middle line:84%
The moment you feel
unlimited, the moment you

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.240 align:middle line:84%
feel whole, the moment
you feel worthy,

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.630 align:middle line:84%
now you're teaching
your body chemically

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:84%
to understand what your mind
had intellectually understood.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:04.640 align:middle line:84%
So you could say that
knowledge is for the mind,

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:90%
and experience is for the body.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.260 align:middle line:84%
Now you're embodying the
truth of that philosophy.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.400 align:middle line:84%
And you're literally signaling
new genes in new ways,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:84%
and changing your
genetic destiny.

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you've done
it once, it means

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.180 align:middle line:84%
you should be able
to do it again.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And if you can repeat any
experience over and over again,

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:25.130 align:middle line:84%
you're going to neurochemically
condition your mind and body

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:26.777 align:middle line:90%
to begin to work as one.

00:14:26.777 --> 00:14:28.610 align:middle line:84%
And when you've done
something so many times

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:31.490 align:middle line:84%
that your body now knows how
to do it as well as your mind,

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:32.960 align:middle line:90%
now it's innate in you.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.900 align:middle line:90%
It's second nature.

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.870 align:middle line:90%
It's familiar.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So then our job is to go from
philosopher, to initiate,

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.340 align:middle line:84%
to master, from knowledge,
to experience, to wisdom,

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.770 align:middle line:84%
from mind, to body, to
soul, from thinking,

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
to doing, to being, to
learning it with your head,

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.590 align:middle line:84%
plying it with your hands,
and knowing it by heart.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And we have all the biological
and neurological machinery

00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:55.190 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be your top
recommendation for people who

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.890 align:middle line:84%
are maybe just starting the
work that you're sharing?

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.479 align:middle line:90%
Especially when they come.

00:15:03.479 --> 00:15:06.020 align:middle line:84%
There's all these ideas that,
oh, my gosh, this sounds great.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:84%
I really want to
be supernatural.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:10.460 align:middle line:84%
I want to change the
way my mind thinks.

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.110 align:middle line:90%
I want to create my own reality.

00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:13.684 align:middle line:84%
But everything I'm
hearing you say,

00:15:13.684 --> 00:15:15.100 align:middle line:84%
which has been
also my experience,

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:90%
is it takes some serious work.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And we do get met up against
some serious resistance

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.520 align:middle line:84%
of personal beliefs,
of challenges.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.030 align:middle line:84%
What would be your top
recommendation for someone

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.830 align:middle line:84%
who is really
entering on this path,

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.480 align:middle line:84%
and still finds
themselves really

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.430 align:middle line:84%
coming up with
some serious blocks

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.900 align:middle line:84%
inside of their own experience,
having to change their mind,

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:39.890 align:middle line:84%
having depressing feelings,
having questions about it all?

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:40.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.020 align:middle line:90%
Number one, never stop learning.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.990 align:middle line:84%
We have to reprogram the
way we think about reality.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.060 align:middle line:84%
When I wrote "You
Are the Placebo,"

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:84%
I was so angry
with myself cause I

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:84%
couldn't believe how programmed
into limitation that we are.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't something
that you do in one bite.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.904 align:middle line:90%
It takes a process.

00:15:59.904 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:90%
But there's a formula.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:90%
We now know there's a formula.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you follow
the formula, you'll

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:84%
begin to make
significant changes.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:90%
So learning.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.910 align:middle line:84%
Learn the science
of transformation.

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.280 align:middle line:84%
Number two, make
time for yourself.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
When you invest in yourself,
you invest in your future.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.940 align:middle line:84%
That means then in the morning
before you start your day,

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.550 align:middle line:84%
ask yourself what is the
greatest ideal of myself

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.760 align:middle line:90%
that I can be today?

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.274 align:middle line:84%
And begin to denature the
programs of those thoughts.

00:16:28.274 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know
what those thoughts are,

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:90%
sit with your eyes closed.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:90%
They'll come up.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:33.190 align:middle line:90%
Write them down.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:37.240 align:middle line:84%
The word meditation literally
means to become familiar with.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what it means.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:42.440 align:middle line:84%
When you become so familiar with
your old self, those thoughts,

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.740 align:middle line:84%
those behaviors, those
emotions that you would never

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.880 align:middle line:84%
go on conscious
again, now you're

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.130 align:middle line:90%
the governor of your thoughts.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Now you're so familiar with
them you know they're not true.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And nerve cells that no longer
fire together, no longer

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.000 align:middle line:90%
wire together.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.465 align:middle line:84%
And it takes an act of
will in the beginning.

00:16:57.465 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:84%
But then if you
say I'm not going

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:04.010 align:middle line:84%
to get up until I am this
person, this is the work.

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.760 align:middle line:84%
So then you begin to
construct a future.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.619 align:middle line:84%
Now, you're believing
in your future

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.990 align:middle line:84%
more than you're
believing in your past.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.819 align:middle line:84%
You're falling in
love with your future

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:14.818 align:middle line:84%
more than you're falling
in love with your past.

00:17:14.818 --> 00:17:16.640 align:middle line:84%
You're telling a
story of your future

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.640 align:middle line:84%
more than you're telling
the story of your past.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And you say, I'm not going to
get up from this meditation

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.040 align:middle line:84%
until I feel like
it's already happened.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, is where the
rubber hits the road.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you get up in
a new state of being,

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:84%
your job is to maintain
that modified state of mind

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:90%
and body your entire day.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:36.850 align:middle line:84%
Independent of the
people in your life,

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.350 align:middle line:90%
the conditions in your life.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Independent of however
your body feels.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:90%
And independent of time.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And doing that properly,
all of a sudden,

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:84%
you start showing up
unpredictable in your life.

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:52.490 align:middle line:84%
People start saying,
something's different about you.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:90%
What's different about you?

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And you're just not
the same person.

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Cause your energy is different.

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Your mind and body
are different.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And your brain and
body are literally

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:84%
in the future
instead of the past.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And people are doing
it all over the world.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:08.810 align:middle line:84%
The side effect is
tremendous healing, new jobs,

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:10.540 align:middle line:84%
new relationships,
new opportunities,

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.550 align:middle line:84%
mystical experiences,
the stuff we

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:15.160 align:middle line:90%
deserve to have in our lives.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So Dr. Joe, will you give
us a tip that people can use

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:84%
anywhere at any time to start
to implement some of these

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:25.390 align:middle line:84%
concepts that you shared with us
today to make lasting changes,

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:84%
and reprogramming and
getting out of this thinking,

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:28.590 align:middle line:90%
feeling loop?

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.233 align:middle line:84%
When you change your breath,
you change your brainwaves.

00:18:31.233 --> 00:18:33.610 align:middle line:90%
It's really simple.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:34.510 align:middle line:90%
Sit down.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:90%
Close your eyes.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.490 align:middle line:90%
Slow your breath down.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.080 align:middle line:84%
Place your attention
in your heart.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.460 align:middle line:84%
That's where your
elevated emotions start.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.830 align:middle line:84%
When your heart begins
to open, and you

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:48.070 align:middle line:84%
start to feel elevated
emotions, like gratitude, joy,

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:53.260 align:middle line:84%
or inspiration, and you breathe
and feel those emotions,

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.750 align:middle line:84%
the heart begins to beat
in a more rhythmic fashion.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to produce a very,
very measurable magnetic field.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.100 align:middle line:90%
That energy is a frequency.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And all frequency
carries information.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So as you begin to elevate
your emotional state,

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:12.790 align:middle line:84%
you're literally
changing your physiology.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to feel elevated,
that energy carries a thought.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So lay the intent of some
experience you want to have.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, that means then, when
you combine a clear intention

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.910 align:middle line:84%
with an elevated
emotion, you're literally

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:29.950 align:middle line:90%
changing your energetic field.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.100 align:middle line:10%
When there's a vibrational
match between your energy

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.040 align:middle line:10%
and some potential in the
future, all of a sudden now

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.440 align:middle line:10%
you don't have to go
anywhere to get anything.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.040 align:middle line:90%
You start to see it come to you.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:90%
So take a couple breaths.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:43.360 align:middle line:90%
Slow your breathing down.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Bring up an elevated
emotion, if you have to do it

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.220 align:middle line:84%
