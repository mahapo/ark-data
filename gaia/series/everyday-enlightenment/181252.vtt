00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey, I'm Ashleigh Sergeant,
and welcome to "Everyday

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment."

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.390 align:middle line:10%
This is your go-to show
that offers practical tips

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.630 align:middle line:10%
from expert guests at the
end of every episode designed

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.880 align:middle line:10%
to help you be more
conscious in the midst

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:10%
of your busy modern life.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Studies show that
loneliness increases

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.180 align:middle line:84%
the risk of early death by 45%
and the chance of developing

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.320 align:middle line:84%
dementia later in
life by almost 64%.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Loneliness is also the
psychological state

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.890 align:middle line:84%
most associated with
suicide, to the point where

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.940 align:middle line:84%
it's safe to say that, while not
all lonely people are suicidal,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:90%
all suicidal people are lonely.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:90%
My guest today is Meg McCracken.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:84%
Together, Meg and I founded
the Alaya Yoga School.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.320 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
compassionate humans

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I know, Meg is passionate about
making the teachings of yoga

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:84%
available and accessible
to absolutely everyone,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.390 align:middle line:84%
including physically, racially,
economically, and religiously

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.190 align:middle line:90%
diverse communities.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Her current desire
is to reach those

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.100 align:middle line:84%
that our current societal
structure has left behind,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.580 align:middle line:84%
including the homeless
and prison inmates.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.975 align:middle line:84%
Meg, thanks so much for
being here with me today.

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, Ash, thanks
for having me.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.565 align:middle line:84%
It's always such a
joy to be with you.

00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> These statistics
are wild, right?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're
actually realizing

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
how much effect this
concept of being lonely

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:90%
is having on our health.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a pervasive issue.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I think I'd be willing to
say it is the pervasive issue

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.940 align:middle line:90%
of our times.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And it is underlying
so many of the issues

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
that we're facing
in this world today.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.180 align:middle line:10%
And even just in my time
for over a decade working

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.750 align:middle line:10%
one-on-one with
people through yoga,

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.541 align:middle line:10%
I've found that a lot
of people were coming

00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:08.350 align:middle line:10%
with different kinds of things.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:84%
But underlying all of it
was a sense of loneliness.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And what was most
effective in our work

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.510 align:middle line:84%
together was not so
much what we did,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.560 align:middle line:84%
but it was more about the
connection that we made

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:90%
and who we became along the way.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
It was really tremendous to see
how loneliness can affect us

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.990 align:middle line:84%
physically, mentally,
emotionally, spiritually

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and how connection can
help to heal that divide.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:90%
It's just incredible.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.408 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit more about,

00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:36.270 align:middle line:84%
how do you, in your
experience, define

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.860 align:middle line:90%
this concept of loneliness?

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Because it's my hunch that it's
really manifesting for people

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
actually in very different ways
that maybe we don't normally

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:84%
think of as being
lonely, which is

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.070 align:middle line:90%
why it's becoming so pervasive.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, and I think that something
that you're pointing to here--

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.768 align:middle line:84%
and that's really,
really important

00:02:54.768 --> 00:02:59.190 align:middle line:84%
to know-- is that there can
be somebody that is surrounded

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:84%
by a lot of people, or maybe
by a family, or what have you.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't necessarily
mean that they're not lonely.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, there are people
who are alone a lot that

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.830 align:middle line:90%
are not necessarily lonely.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Do you know?

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I think maybe one of the
loneliest places in the cosmos

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:84%
is actually within a
relationship or a group

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.680 align:middle line:84%
of people and feeling unseen,
feeling unheard, feeling

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:90%
unworthy, unaccepted.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.570 align:middle line:84%
That's where people really are
feeling lonely, when they maybe

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.100 align:middle line:84%
are in a relationship or
even in a group of people

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
but the truth of who
they are as a human,

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and as a divine being
even, is not acknowledged.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.270 align:middle line:90%
Or somehow, they feel separate.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Or I want to say that there
is a deep sense of inadequacy

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:84%
that people seem
to have in this.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
>> "I'm not good enough"
is present for just about

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.160 align:middle line:90%
everyone.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.710 align:middle line:90%
And so they can't show up fully.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, a lot of people are
in this throes of inadequacy,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and so they don't really
feel comfortable expressing

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:90%
the truth of who they are.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And that is a really dangerous
place for us as humans.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:84%
>> We feel maybe afraid
to express our anger,

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.370 align:middle line:84%
or afraid to
express our sadness,

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:84%
or afraid to express some of
these emotions sometimes that

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.210 align:middle line:84%
we feel that other people
won't be able to accept.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, to be sure.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And then, we
don't express them.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, and we
don't express them.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't express any of those
kinds of things because we feel

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.680 align:middle line:84%
like we're going to be
shunned out, and yeah,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.600 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
difficult emotions.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:90%
They're not even bad emotions.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.680 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to
get away from the idea

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.570 align:middle line:84%
that there's certain
emotions that are good

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and certain emotions
that are bad.

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.870 align:middle line:84%
These are just
difficult emotions.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And so we can't
express those kinds

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.450 align:middle line:84%
of emotions, which then puts
us in a place of isolation

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:90%
with those emotions.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's really,
really interesting

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.130 align:middle line:84%
because, let's say, a lonely
person has some sort of sadness

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of anger
or some sort of fear.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And they will move into
perhaps the state of shame

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.640 align:middle line:84%
because they feel
really isolated

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:90%
in their experience of that.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And then, that anger, that
fear, that whatever it is,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and that sense of isolation
and that sense of shame

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.740 align:middle line:84%
starts to eat at
them physically,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.330 align:middle line:90%
mentally, emotionally.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.800 align:middle line:84%
And they experience it to
be something that is theirs

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.210 align:middle line:84%
and theirs alone,
when in actuality it's

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:90%
a perfectly human experience.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.400 align:middle line:84%
And the pain that they're
calling their pain--

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.980 align:middle line:84%
be it sadness, fear, anger, or
whatever-- is not their pain.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It is the pain of
human existence.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.370 align:middle line:84%
It's just the pain
of being human.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And so a connected
person might notice

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.940 align:middle line:84%
what that's like and just
go, like, oh, right, here's

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.560 align:middle line:90%
the experience of sadness.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And they might be more
willing to reach out

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and not shunned from
the whole group.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So what is-- you know,
we talk about this a lot.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And I know this is a really
deep passion of yours.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.940 align:middle line:84%
But what does it really
mean to be connected

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.020 align:middle line:90%
and to create connection?

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Because just like
you specified--

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.490 align:middle line:84%
especially in a
world today where

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
we're so connected
on social media,

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
we have all these
cellular devices--

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:84%
it's actually quite easy to
be surrounded by community,

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.610 align:middle line:84%
or surrounded by
a lot of people,

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:22.440 align:middle line:84%
or in very busy atmospheres
and to have community.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.460 align:middle line:84%
But what's the difference
between a community

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
that actually is helping to
foster this real connection?

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.930 align:middle line:84%
And how do people kind of get
into these spaces of feeling

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.000 align:middle line:84%
so lonely, when
maybe otherwise it

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.685 align:middle line:84%
looks like they're surrounded
by community or a lot of people?

00:06:37.685 --> 00:06:38.702 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:38.702 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's a few
things that I want

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.350 align:middle line:84%
to pull on that you are
talking about in there.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.300 align:middle line:84%
First of all,
connection, and what

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:84%
does that look like
versus loneliness?

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.780 align:middle line:10%
And I think that connection is
a much more intimate experience

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:57.114 align:middle line:10%
of ourselves and others and
reality and our world as it is.

00:06:57.114 --> 00:06:58.280 align:middle line:90%
It's an intimate experience.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.654 align:middle line:84%
And I think that this is an
important piece to point out,

00:07:00.654 --> 00:07:04.140 align:middle line:84%
is that loneliness and
connection are experiences,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.580 align:middle line:84%
are the way that
we experience life.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And so as somebody
who's more lonely

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
is experiencing life more from
a space of deep separation

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and deep inadequacy, people
who are more connected

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
tend to experience
the truth of who

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.870 align:middle line:84%
they are and their
interconnection

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.859 align:middle line:90%
with the world around them.

00:07:25.859 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And just going back to
what we were talking

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:84%
about as far as even just
that little example of,

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.810 align:middle line:84%
it's my sadness, or it's
the sadness of being human.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.350 align:middle line:84%
And so that's a big
differentiating factor

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.120 align:middle line:84%
of somebody who might
be feeling lonely

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.911 align:middle line:84%
or somebody who might
be feeling connected.

00:07:42.911 --> 00:07:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's this true intimacy
with our experiences,

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
with ourselves, and with
another human being.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, also in
there you were talking

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.380 align:middle line:84%
about how we have all of these
social media devices and all

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.742 align:middle line:90%
these ways to get connected.

00:07:58.742 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we can
get really intimate

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.658 align:middle line:84%
with the conversations that
are on the social media and all

00:08:02.658 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:90%
that kind of thing.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
But really, I feel like
it boils down to presence.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, and physical presence
for sure helps for sure.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.650 align:middle line:84%
But I know if I'm feeling
isolated or lonely,

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.584 align:middle line:84%
yes, I can call my sister,
these kinds of things.

00:08:21.584 --> 00:08:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Or you can, yes, write an
email, that kind of thing.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:31.430 align:middle line:84%
But presence is the bridge that
takes the concept of connection

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:84%
and actually brings it
into our lived experience.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.841 align:middle line:84%
So we have these concepts
of what it is to be lonely

00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:39.840 align:middle line:84%
and these ideas of how
to get out of loneliness.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And we have these
ideas of connection.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And even as yoga
teachers and meditation

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.300 align:middle line:84%
teachers and
spiritual guides, we

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.640 align:middle line:84%
talk about how
it's all connected.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And people understand that
to some degree up here.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Cognitively.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
But it is not their
experience of life.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.500 align:middle line:84%
They can think that, oh,
right, it's all connected,

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.200 align:middle line:84%
and even have this
understanding about it up here.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
But is absolutely not
their experience of life.

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And presence is the
thing that bridges

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:12.710 align:middle line:84%
the gap between a conceptualized
experience of connection

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and the actual lived
experience and what

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:18.000 align:middle line:90%
it means to be fully curious.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.359 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you define presence?

00:09:19.359 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yeah, this is
a really good point.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I talk about
presence in this way,

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.841 align:middle line:84%
there's a few different things
that I want to highlight here.

00:09:25.841 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:84%
It's first being
completely available

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.770 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves, each
other, and the moment

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:33.320 align:middle line:84%
as it is without
having to try to fix it

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.240 align:middle line:84%
or without having
to try to change it,

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.381 align:middle line:84%
just being completely
open and available,

00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:90%
which is scary in these times.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:43.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Really listening without
trying to plan your reaction

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:44.750 align:middle line:84%
before the person
is finished talking.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:45.620 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so true.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:90%
It's so true.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.413 align:middle line:84%
And just being completely
available to that,

00:09:48.413 --> 00:09:50.960 align:middle line:84%
even if it's not something
that you really like.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in that state
of availability to ourselves

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:57.830 align:middle line:84%
and our state and the
person sitting next to us

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.140 align:middle line:84%
and the experience
that's surrounding us,

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:84%
what it tends to do is, it
starts to-- and especially when

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
we can be available in a
very open and accepting way--

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.490 align:middle line:90%
it starts to open us up.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:09.156 align:middle line:84%
And this is the next
thing that I really

00:10:09.156 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:90%
think is important-- curiosity.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this
open availability.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, you move into
a state of curiosity,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.100 align:middle line:84%
where you start to ask yourself
bigger questions of yourself,

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.370 align:middle line:84%
start to ask other
people bigger questions.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
You start to investigate
the experience

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:84%
in a more intimate way versus
just staying at the surface

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
level of things, which starts
to bring us into a deeper

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:90%
state of connection.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, through
that curiosity starts

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.980 align:middle line:84%
to come a more rich
understanding of what

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
it means to be human, of
what it means to be divine

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:90%
or a piece of something more.

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So I'd love to give you an
example, just a real life

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.280 align:middle line:90%
example.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.420 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of that can
sound really, really great

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:90%
but not super practical.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So for example, my daughter
and I were just on a trip.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And she was acting
up quite a lot.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.890 align:middle line:84%
And if I was feeling a
little bit more drained

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit
more separate, I

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:84%
would have just probably
acted up back at her.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, we'd be
on this road trip

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.300 align:middle line:84%
in the car in a very frazzled
and isolating kind of way,

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.100 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.808 align:middle line:84%
We probably would've
yelled at each other

00:11:21.808 --> 00:11:24.360 align:middle line:90%
and then gone into our corners.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.295 align:middle line:84%
But moving through the realm
of presence, which does take--

00:11:29.295 --> 00:11:31.170 align:middle line:84%
and maybe we can get to
this in a moment-- it

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:36.900 align:middle line:84%
does take a certain amount
of energy, vital energy.

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:38.700 align:middle line:90%
So I have to be well rested.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:41.230 align:middle line:84%
I have to be well nourished
and that sort of thing

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:90%
so I can at least deal.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And so that's kind of the
primary step to presence

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.230 align:middle line:90%
anyway.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.690 align:middle line:84%
But then, moving
through in this way,

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.170 align:middle line:84%
I was able to just kind
of stop and receive

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.284 align:middle line:84%
the tantrum from my
daughter just as it was

00:11:53.284 --> 00:11:54.450 align:middle line:90%
without having to change it.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:90%
I could really feel into myself.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:84%
I was available
to the sensations

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.244 align:middle line:84%
that it was kind of
bringing up in me.

00:12:01.244 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts and the worries
and all of that kind of thing

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:84%
that it was bringing
up in me, I was

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.792 align:middle line:90%
just available to all of that.

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:08.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, I started
getting curious

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.570 align:middle line:90%
with myself and with her.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Like, hey, Lil, what's
really going on here?

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:90%
How are you feeling right now?

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And asked her where does
she feel it in her body.

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.390 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes she doesn't,
doesn't want to talk about it.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:19.190 align:middle line:90%
She's eight.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And she's like, Mom, I don't
want to talk about that.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But then, once I start
asking some bigger

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:27.972 align:middle line:84%
questions, like, "how
are you feeling?"

00:12:27.972 --> 00:12:30.180 align:middle line:84%
or "is there anything that
you're worried about right

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.630 align:middle line:84%
now?" or things like
this that elicit her

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:84%
into some sort of
response, then I

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.969 align:middle line:84%
start to understand that she's
just not been sleeping well

00:12:38.969 --> 00:12:40.260 align:middle line:90%
because we've been on the road.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:90%
She's out of her routine.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.864 align:middle line:84%
And I have not
been sleeping well

00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:45.030 align:middle line:90%
because we were on the road.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.380 align:middle line:90%
I've been out of my routine.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:84%
I can start to understand
these threads of things

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.700 align:middle line:90%
that connect us.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, we start to have
a completely different

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:90%
conversation.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And she starts to recognize
that she can lean in on me.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.270 align:middle line:84%
And then, I can also ask
questions and lean in on her.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're a lot closer in
our relationship versus much

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.530 align:middle line:90%
further apart.

00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Does that make sense?

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:90%
Does that resonate?

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, for sure.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:09.369 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
biggest thing that's

00:13:09.369 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:84%
standing out for me on this
is, when you say curiosity,

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.230 align:middle line:90%
it's not trying to fix.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.120 align:middle line:84%
Because I think,
in my experience,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:90%
that when someone comes at me--

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.604 align:middle line:84%
or when I certainly do this
to other people-- with,

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:23.520 align:middle line:90%
oh, I have the answer.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:25.644 align:middle line:84%
Just tell me how you're
feeling, and I can tell you

00:13:25.644 --> 00:13:27.420 align:middle line:84%
why you shouldn't be
feeling that way, how

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.860 align:middle line:90%
you can feel differently.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.310 align:middle line:84%
That can immediately feel
very isolating, as opposed to,

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:90%
you ask these questions.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, you both
have the capacity

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.370 align:middle line:84%
to go, oh my god, yeah,
I'm feeling that same way.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.870 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm feeling the same way.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, you're in a much
deeper level of connection.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And the curiosity does,
it has to be rooted

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:90%
in the want to understand.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Thich Nhat Hanh,
I believe, talks about,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.560 align:middle line:84%
like, please help
me to understand

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.510 align:middle line:90%
the nature of your suffering.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
intent behind it when

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.950 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to get curious--

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:90%
in our own selves too.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:84%
When we're exploring our
own store of angst or hurt

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.210 align:middle line:84%
or some of these
difficult emotions,

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:10.105 align:middle line:84%
we go, oh, right, let me
understand this more deeply.

00:14:10.105 --> 00:14:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, I work at
it with my daughter

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:14.190 align:middle line:84%
or with somebody that's
across the divide

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.030 align:middle line:84%
politically from me or any
of the divides that we face.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.130 align:middle line:84%
Please help me to
understand more.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.350 align:middle line:90%
And then, I just listen.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And that's the thing that's
really, really important,

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.030 align:middle line:84%
is to open up the
curiosity and then

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:30.120 align:middle line:84%
sit back and listen and make
yourself available again

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.530 align:middle line:90%
and again and again and again.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this
topic is essential.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.577 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a
whole other show.

00:14:36.577 --> 00:14:38.160 align:middle line:84%
I know it's really
passionate for you.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
But particularly about
reaching across these

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:46.500 align:middle line:84%
divides that we've created
politically, socially, racially

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:84%
in our country and in
the world, that actually

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:54.540 align:middle line:84%
taking this concept of presence
as a way to create connection

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:57.715 align:middle line:84%
instead of fueling
that fire of isolation.

00:14:57.715 --> 00:14:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.079 align:middle line:84%
And it's really
interesting right now

00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:03.120 align:middle line:84%
because I see some of
these divides in the world.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And I see the divides
as a cry for connection.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'm on this side
and you're on that side,

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:90%
I belong somewhere, don't I?

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's connection.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:84%
But in that connection,
there has to be an us

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.440 align:middle line:90%
and there has to be at them.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:84%
And we never start to
work to bridge the divide.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:84%
But I see underlying in the
seed of want there that people

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:23.770 align:middle line:90%
really want connection.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is an important
thing that I want to bring up.

00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:30.207 align:middle line:84%
And this is from the work
of John Cacioppo, who

00:15:30.207 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately passed
away this spring.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:35.050 align:middle line:84%
But he was a social
neuroscientist

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:36.880 align:middle line:90%
at the University of Chicago.

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:41.830 align:middle line:84%
And he's done lots of studies
on the disease of loneliness

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.270 align:middle line:90%
and these kinds of things.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.910 align:middle line:84%
But what he was
starting to find is

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:84%
that loneliness is
less like an emotion

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:84%
and more like a
survival response,

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.030 align:middle line:84%
much more akin to
hunger and thirst

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.270 align:middle line:84%
than it is to just some sort of
irrational emotional response,

00:15:58.270 --> 00:15:59.140 align:middle line:90%
let's say.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And so it's because we
are social creatures.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And as humans, we
need our communities

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.979 align:middle line:90%
in order to actually survive.

00:16:07.979 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the sharpest
claws or the sharpest teeth,

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:12.120 align:middle line:90%
and we don't run the fastest.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And tied up in our survival
mechanism is community.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And so if we are
feeling lonely, it's

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.780 align:middle line:84%
like an urge like hunger
that's saying eat.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:84%
When we're feeling
lonely, it's an urge

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.860 align:middle line:90%
like that that's saying connect.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.080 align:middle line:90%
You are on the fringes here.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't connect, our
survival instinct kicks in.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.594 align:middle line:90%
Fight, flight, freeze kicks in.

00:16:34.594 --> 00:16:36.010 align:middle line:84%
That suppresses
our immune system.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.593 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's a
whole host of things

00:16:37.593 --> 00:16:40.210 align:middle line:90%
that go along down that line.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So as we're working
to mend the divides,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:84%
to just recognize what's driving
the divide in the first place.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.920 align:middle line:84%
It might not be so
much our opinions.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, that has to do with it.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
But also, we're not going
to make any radical changes

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
unless we go at it
with, like, please help

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.490 align:middle line:84%
me to understand what's
the root of this,

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:90%
what's the source of this.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.619 align:middle line:84%
And it's there in the
source that we can connect.

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.360 align:middle line:90%
On the surface, not so much.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.609 align:middle line:84%
We'll just yell and scream
at each other all day long.

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get more
fearful because we're

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.440 align:middle line:84%
going to get more to the
fringes as we keep going along.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.635 align:middle line:84%
And our society is not
going to survive it.

00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:20.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So Meg, what are a couple
of tips that you would give

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.460 align:middle line:84%
to someone who is feeling
lonely or feeling isolated?

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.344 align:middle line:90%
What can they do?

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:26.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so a couple of things.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.980 align:middle line:84%
One thing that I think
is really vitally

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.620 align:middle line:84%
important for those who
are feeling really lonely

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:37.090 align:middle line:84%
is to acknowledge that
it does have a variety

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.507 align:middle line:90%
of physiological effects.

00:17:38.507 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that
it does, and people might not

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.166 align:middle line:84%
know this, is really affect
their sleep patterns.

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of people
who are feeling lonely

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:46.750 align:middle line:90%
are also quite tired.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So just to take care of
their basic vital essence,

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.320 align:middle line:84%
perhaps taking little naps
and enriching themselves.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's one thing.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:59.950 align:middle line:84%
But I would also say that it
is like the cry for hunger.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're hungry,
you need to go eat.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:05.289 align:middle line:84%
And the loneliness is not
something that's shameful.

00:18:05.289 --> 00:18:07.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's something that
they need to know about.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It's more like this
survival instinct.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's pointing them
back to the tribe,

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:13.810 align:middle line:84%
pointing them back
to connection.

00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, though,
they want to go to a place

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.240 align:middle line:84%
where there's going to
be meaningful connection.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:22.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like we talked about at
the beginning of the program is

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:26.369 align:middle line:84%
that just being around people
doesn't necessarily subside

00:18:26.369 --> 00:18:27.410 align:middle line:90%
this thing of loneliness.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.549 align:middle line:84%
So moving through the
world to find a place

00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:31.590 align:middle line:90%
of meaningful connection.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.173 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people that
I've worked with,

00:18:33.173 --> 00:18:36.070 align:middle line:84%
I find it's really helpful
if people find something

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:40.039 align:middle line:84%
that they feel really passionate
about and go volunteer there.

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:41.830 align:middle line:84%
Because there will be
threads of connection

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.042 align:middle line:90%
already sort of in place.

00:18:43.042 --> 00:18:45.250 align:middle line:84%
Other people who are passionate
about the same things

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:46.110 align:middle line:90%
will be there.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.150 align:middle line:84%
There will be something that's
easy to talk about with people

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great idea.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:51.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.840 align:middle line:84%
So just going out
and volunteering

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:84%
can be really great, or
even joining a book club.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes when we're feeling
lonely, we also feel--

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:84%
not always-- but sometimes
we feel socially awkward

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.510 align:middle line:90%
moving back into a situation.

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:04.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you have
something that's like,

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.542 align:middle line:84%
oh we're talking about that
book and how it affects me,

00:19:07.542 --> 00:19:09.250 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to
give you the framework

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
for that meaningful
connection to happen.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So those are two things that
I would say would be great.

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.180 align:middle line:90%
>> --and super practical.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:84%
Can you give the viewers and
the audience a practice or a tip

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:23.650 align:middle line:84%
around how to work
on cultivating

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
this quality of
presence in order

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
to be able to create
deeper connection?

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, absolutely.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.060 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to offer you guys
a little meditation that

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:38.520 align:middle line:90%
helps to cultivate presence.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.572 align:middle line:84%
So wherever you are, please
just sit up nice and tall.

00:19:41.572 --> 00:19:43.280 align:middle line:84%
And just like me, you
can sit in a chair,

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.210 align:middle line:90%
or you can sit on the floor.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:50.070 align:middle line:84%
Allow your spine to be uplifted,
and let your eyes fall closed.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.030 align:middle line:90%
Relax your jaw.

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And allow the seed
of your awareness

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:84%
to slip from the head space
and all of the mental doings.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And allow it to slip down
into the heart space.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:10.570 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:16.400 align:middle line:84%
And simply feel the sensation of
breathing as it rises and falls

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:17.200 align:middle line:90%
in your chest.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:27.110 align:middle line:90%


00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Just starting to build presence
in the space of the heart.

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:84%
Allow the fullness
of your awareness

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.327 align:middle line:84%
to rest on the sensation of
breathing there in the chest,

00:20:38.327 --> 00:20:39.410 align:middle line:90%
in the space of the heart.

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:59.520 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And just see what it's
like to experience life

00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:15.790 align:middle line:84%
from the space of the heart by
simply noticing any sounds that

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:18.730 align:middle line:84%
arise in the field
of your awareness

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:21.670 align:middle line:84%
as you continue to
breathe in and out

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.896 align:middle line:90%
of the space of your heart.

00:21:23.896 --> 00:21:29.017 align:middle line:84%
Just allowing all
sounds to settle

00:21:29.017 --> 00:21:30.100 align:middle line:90%
in the space of the heart.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:44.820 align:middle line:90%


00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:84%
Acknowledging these
not only as the sounds

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:53.205 align:middle line:84%
that you hear but simply as
the sound of life itself.

00:21:53.205 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:90%


00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And continuing to breathe in and
out of the space of the heart.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, welcome into the
vastness of your heart

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.390 align:middle line:84%
any sensations that you might
have in your body right now.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:28.090 align:middle line:90%


00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.760 align:middle line:84%
Welcoming these
sensations into a heart

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:37.500 align:middle line:84%
that is wide enough to hold them
all and infinitely more vast

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.640 align:middle line:84%
just being with the sensations
of having a human body.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:23:13.390 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, welcoming into
the space of the heart

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:21.000 align:middle line:84%
any thoughts or emotions
that are present for you now.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:90%


00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:35.220 align:middle line:84%
An intimate allowing of
the thoughts and emotions

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:38.180 align:middle line:84%
of humanity into the
space of your heart.

00:23:38.180 --> 00:24:14.320 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And now, one more time,
shifting awareness

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:27.060 align:middle line:84%
to the vastness itself that
holds and embraces it all.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:58.810 align:middle line:90%


00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Experiencing the
fullness of yourself

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.600 align:middle line:84%
in this moment from
the space of the heart,

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.760 align:middle line:90%
allow your eyes to open.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.710 align:middle line:90%


00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And you can move
on about your day,

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:19.940 align:middle line:84%
hopefully taking a thread
of this experience with you.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.260 align:middle line:10%
Knowing that, at any
moment throughout the day,

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.800 align:middle line:10%
you can simply put
your hand on your heart

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.170 align:middle line:10%
and take a deep breath
in and a slow breath out

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:32.210 align:middle line:10%
and allow that to draw you
back into a state of allowing

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.120 align:middle line:10%
an open presence,
and then allowing

00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.750 align:middle line:10%
you to move into a
state of curiosity.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:42.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Meg, thank you so much for
that practice-- so helpful.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And really, anyone
can use that as a way

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:49.010 align:middle line:84%
to start to cultivate connection
with their deeper self

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.719 align:middle line:84%
and with anyone else
in the world, right?

00:25:50.719 --> 00:25:51.518 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:51.518 --> 00:25:52.430 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely.

00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is a meditation
I do all the time.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And it helps me, like you
said, to connect with myself.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.320 align:middle line:84%
But it also helps my capacity
to connect with those around me

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:90%
for sure.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.671 align:middle line:84%
>>, Well thank you so
much for being here.

00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:05.628 align:middle line:90%
It's great to have you.

00:26:05.628 --> 00:26:07.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's so
wonderful to be here.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much for having me.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.355 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:26:10.355 --> 00:26:12.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for joining us.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.660 align:middle line:90%
I will see you next time.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.110 align:middle line:90%
