00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Hi, I'm Ashleigh Sergeant,
and welcome to "Everyday

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment," your go-to show
for insights and practical tips

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.570 align:middle line:10%
on how to live a conscious
life in the midst of your busy

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.950 align:middle line:10%
schedule.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.440 align:middle line:84%
Many of us have heard
that poor posture

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.380 align:middle line:84%
is related to things like
chronic pain, headaches,

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.640 align:middle line:90%
and fatigue.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
In the past, fitness
culture has taught us

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.610 align:middle line:84%
that regular exercise and
stretching is a key component

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.930 align:middle line:90%
to good posture.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But what does good
posture really mean?

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And how do we attain and
sustain such a state?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Modern scientific discoveries
in the fields of anatomy,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.790 align:middle line:84%
and biomechanics, and movement
disciplines-- like yoga,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:90%
Pilates and Tai chi--

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
reveal that posture is not
simply a physical concept.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
But rather, part of a much
broader and much more intricate

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:84%
combination of things going
on between our body and mind.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'm here
with Ben Stewart--

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
film maker and musician,
turned movement specialist.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Ben studies the science and art
of natural movement and body

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
communication as a pathway
to awakening to our highest

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:90%
human potential.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:84%
Ben, thank you for
being here today.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.888 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much for
having me on the show.

00:01:29.888 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, this is a
exciting topic for me.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.040 align:middle line:90%
I love to talk about movement.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And I said in the opening
that, like modern science

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.110 align:middle line:84%
is saying that it's
obvious that it's not just

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.340 align:middle line:90%
this physical thing--

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.770 align:middle line:84%
posture-- but it's not
really very modern at all.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And I know you have a lot of
concepts about that, as well.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:10%
>> I think that
most of the time,

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:10%
posture has been thought of as
just getting comfortable so you

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:10%
can sit for long
periods of time.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's definitely
a big aspect of it,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.860 align:middle line:84%
but that kind of glosses
over the importance of what

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:84%
a good posture can
actually do for you.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And what it opens
up inside the body.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I've been
interested in the most is

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
finding the most practical ways
to reach some of those higher,

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:84%
more artistic or loftier
cognitive functions

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what I'm
hearing you say is--

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and I think what we've heard in
our culture in different ways--

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:31.490 align:middle line:84%
is that like good posture
equals better or X thing.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.980 align:middle line:84%
What does it do for us,
actually-- good posture?

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:90%
And what does that really mean?

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's involved because I
think all these disciplines--

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.740 align:middle line:84%
at least, for me--
it's self-discovery.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.160 align:middle line:84%
What are you learning
about yourself?

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.920 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think good
posture is one size fits all.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:84%
So everybody has to have the
same curvature in their spine.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has to look the
same as they're standing.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And as much as you know
if you have all four limbs

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.790 align:middle line:84%
and you have a head on
top your shoulders, then

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:90%
we look fairly similar.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.630 align:middle line:90%
But we all have different form.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.120 align:middle line:84%
And our form is actually
telling us a lot about the path

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:90%
that we've had.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.950 align:middle line:84%
And not just our own physical
path, but our lineage--

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.710 align:middle line:84%
our parents and
what our ancestors

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:90%
have passed down to us.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.150 align:middle line:84%
So the body is a lot
more metaphorical

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
than I think we
give it credit for.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have a
very scientific--

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:84%
we'll only talk about what can
be proven by modern technology.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:84%
But really, by
looking at the body

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and respecting it for what it
is, it's an ancient technology.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.940 align:middle line:84%
It's been perfecting
itself for eons.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you think about
it, it's configured

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.470 align:middle line:90%
in a very intricate way.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci was trying to
show that in his Vitruvian Man.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
very artistic

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:90%
and telling about the body.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that all
of our ancient ancestral

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.400 align:middle line:84%
baggage that we
might carry-- even

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
the baggage from this
life, our trauma,

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:84%
our injuries-- they all show up
in a very symbolic and artistic

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.280 align:middle line:90%
way in our body.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And that makes it
more fun and more

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.610 align:middle line:84%
engaging to be able to go back
into, what is our posture?

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.050 align:middle line:90%
Where are we at now?

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
We start there and
then we start moving

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.040 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of
not just healing,

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.050 align:middle line:84%
but healing will be
the emergent quality

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.740 align:middle line:84%
of coming back into alignment
with where is our center?

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Where is our center of movement
and our center of gravity?

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I love that because I'm
a huge proponent of really

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
empowering people into
their own healing.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.530 align:middle line:84%
This concept-- and it has
been very much brought about

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.900 align:middle line:84%
in Western culture and with
the emergence of the field

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:90%
of science--

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:84%
which is only a couple
hundred years old, really--

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.640 align:middle line:84%
this idea that we need
to look outward or get

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.450 align:middle line:84%
information from something,
someone else, some other system

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.990 align:middle line:84%
to tell us exactly how
we are supposed to be.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:52.250 align:middle line:90%
What is center for us.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.510 align:middle line:90%
What is healing for us.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:84%
What is actually balance
and freedom for us.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.650 align:middle line:84%
And I think that there's
a lot of actual trauma

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.970 align:middle line:84%
or a lot of suffering
even within that model

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.320 align:middle line:84%
because there's this
concept of trying to strive

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and perfect something that
maybe isn't even attainable.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Or isn't even the thing that
is beneficial for my body

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.540 align:middle line:90%
versus your body.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.140 align:middle line:84%
Or my whole system versus
your system or someone else's.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And that really starting
to put the power back

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
into the individual
for us-- starting

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.160 align:middle line:90%
to really learn to listen.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> You hit the nail on
the head right there.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.950 align:middle line:90%
For me, this is all fractal.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So the way our body communicates
is in a fractal way.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.600 align:middle line:84%
When something is
happening inside our body,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.650 align:middle line:84%
the entire body is
actually responding to that

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:44.010 align:middle line:90%
and compensating for it.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So there's these balancing
acts that happen.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And what you mentioned
about science

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.210 align:middle line:84%
is totally true because
we live in a culture that

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.070 align:middle line:90%
has a cultural mindset.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And all cultural
mindsets have the threat

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.010 align:middle line:90%
of becoming very rigid.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.160 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense, building
economic models and things

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.630 align:middle line:84%
that are very rigid around
an idea that-- like you

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.380 align:middle line:84%
said-- only a couple
of hundred years old.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.410 align:middle line:84%
This modern reductionist--
if our science and technology

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.290 align:middle line:84%
can't prove it, then
it doesn't exist--

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
that's neglecting
the fact that we--

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.440 align:middle line:84%
can we even wrap our heads
around what reality truly is?

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.370 align:middle line:84%
So with culture,
there's also a posture

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.960 align:middle line:84%
that you hold in your
community, as well.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:84%
So if your culture is holding
this very reductionist

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
rigid way of
thinking, then it is,

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:84%
basically, it's our
duty to balance that,

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.894 align:middle line:84%
if we feel that
balance is needed.

00:06:38.894 --> 00:06:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same thing with
both hemispheres of the body.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.870 align:middle line:90%
We are symmetrical.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And we have two
hemispheres of the body.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:90%
And let's say-- for instance--

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.870 align:middle line:84%
I broke my right
ankle when I was 12

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and it was right
on a growth plate.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.980 align:middle line:84%
I had to work very hard
not to have this leg always

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:90%
flop out as I'm walking.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So there is this
asynchrony that was

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.840 align:middle line:84%
building because this leg
was getting much smaller.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So I had to then,
work on my gait cycle

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:10.440 align:middle line:84%
and how I walk because the more
that I realized as I got later

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
and I started looking at
what can a improper gait

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.280 align:middle line:90%
cycle actually do to you--

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.760 align:middle line:84%
it actually affects you all
the way up into the inside

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:90%
of your cranium.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
You have this sphenoid bone
and it looks like an owl.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.860 align:middle line:84%
If you were to take off
the front part of the face,

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.630 align:middle line:84%
it's this thing that
when you're walking,

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:30.120 align:middle line:84%
it actually like
moves back and forth--

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:32.130 align:middle line:90%
or it even flaps its wings.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And that houses the pituitary
gland and the pineal gland.

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.870 align:middle line:84%
And so not having a proper
gait cycle or a walking form,

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:84%
actually can degrade
the operation

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.740 align:middle line:84%
of the pituitary gland,
which is the master gland.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:84%
So your hormonal
balance, your attitude,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:90%
your way of perceiving yourself.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:90%
The way that you actually even--

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
how much potential you
think you even have.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:84%
How much impact in the
world or in your culture you

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:90%
believe you have--

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.490 align:middle line:84%
can be actually
affected very, very much

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:90%
so just by improper walking.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.150 align:middle line:90%
So we all have injuries.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.657 align:middle line:90%
We all have trauma.

00:08:07.657 --> 00:08:08.490 align:middle line:90%
And we have trauma--

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.610 align:middle line:84%
you go into these contractions,
like your body contracts

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.640 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that
electricity going into tissue

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.240 align:middle line:90%
makes it contract.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing as an
overwhelming situation.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
your body will

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.400 align:middle line:84%
go into a certain
contracting pattern.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the next time another
kind of trauma or fright

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:84%
happens and you'll likely go
back to that same path of least

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:90%
resistance.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:84%
So now it's symbolic,
but it has nothing to do

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.240 align:middle line:90%
with what's actually going on--

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.370 align:middle line:90%
the scare that you just had.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So I like to look at the
body is it's an art form.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
speaking symbolically.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't have
the English language,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.060 align:middle line:90%
it speaks completely different.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So what I believe
this is all about

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.470 align:middle line:84%
is our relationships--
coming back

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.060 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship with the body.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:55.890 align:middle line:90%
Listening to it.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
In symbolic form,
what is it telling us

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
about how we are
holding ourselves?

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Because your posture
says everything.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:90%
This posture says a lot.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.320 align:middle line:90%
This posture says a lot.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So there's all these little
things where posture actually

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:90%
informs your conscious state.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're really
conscious about your posture.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.679 align:middle line:84%
And you're also-- even just the
idea of I'm sitting like this

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:21.720 align:middle line:90%
or I'm sitting like this.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Some of us don't even
know to think of that.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
a really key piece.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And to go back to your point
on the ancestry piece--

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.940 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the things that we
have going on in our body,

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.210 align:middle line:84%
they actually come
to us as we are born.

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.170 align:middle line:90%
What I hear you say--

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.829 align:middle line:84%
you just have this curiosity
and this excitement about wow,

00:09:42.829 --> 00:09:45.120 align:middle line:84%
this is really cool about
this bone inside of our head.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:84%
This is really cool about the
way my body reacts to this.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
That cultivating this
curiosity around it I think

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:84%
is a really powerful
access point

00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:00.030 align:middle line:84%
in to know that if
these patterns are there

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.070 align:middle line:84%
and they haven't really
healed themselves

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.630 align:middle line:90%
or work themselves out--

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:84%
how do we start
to work with them?

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And how does that start
to change our state?

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that's the piece
that can be the hook of like,

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:13.620 align:middle line:90%
I can get curious about this.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:90%
But why?"

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.630 align:middle line:90%
How can this change my state?

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:21.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And you brought up a
bunch of really good points.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.270 align:middle line:84%
Trauma, injury--
these things happen.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that they
happen for a very good reason.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:84%
If we were always in a state of
equanimity, we wouldn't learn.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:84%
And so that's not
the point here.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.580 align:middle line:90%
We're meant to find our balance.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But life is also meant to
throw us off balance that way,

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:84%
we can keep finding
our way back to balance

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
from all these nuance
different imbalances.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that
the inspiration

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.155 align:middle line:90%
that you're speaking about--

00:10:49.155 --> 00:10:52.020 align:middle line:84%
that's really the best
part of this is because--

00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:90%
I'm an artist at heart.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:11:00.150 align:middle line:84%
So I use research as an element
or a color in a grand painting

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:02.250 align:middle line:90%
or a grand masterpiece.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.635 align:middle line:90%
Whereas, a lot of people--

00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:84%
they need it proven to them
first before they start moving.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.520 align:middle line:90%
To me-- as an artist--

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.920 align:middle line:84%
the body is already
speaking to you.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.230 align:middle line:84%
We already have a
relationship with it.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And nobody else-- you don't need
external validation to say this

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.750 align:middle line:84%
is what your body
is telling you.

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:20.880 align:middle line:90%
You can listen to people.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.010 align:middle line:84%
You can maybe allow
that to inform

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.460 align:middle line:90%
how you listen to your body.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.240 align:middle line:84%
But really, you're the
best expert on your body.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm the best on mine.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
brilliance of that.

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So coming back into good
posture-- what does that mean?

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.040 align:middle line:84%
That really means
that we wish to have

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.720 align:middle line:90%
a bit more of an optimal state.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:90%
We wish to have more balance.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:46.020 align:middle line:84%
We wish to have maybe less
stress-- all these things that

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:84%
are typified by our
culture, causes of stress

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:50.120 align:middle line:90%
and we want less stress.

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Our job causes us injuries
so we want less injury.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.680 align:middle line:84%
It's these circumstances
that we can overcome,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:84%
but the thing is that we're
cultivating the desire

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.120 align:middle line:90%
to surmount.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.010 align:middle line:90%
To actually overcome them.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:03.150 align:middle line:90%
So that's the beauty of it.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually
looking at the body

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and looking at posture
as an art form that's

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.680 align:middle line:90%
constantly teaching us.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And once you overcome something,
once you wake up to something--

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:16.500 align:middle line:84%
you don't need that alarm
bell to keep ringing.

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.850 align:middle line:84%
You need to move
on from that point.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's really the
brilliance of it.

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not hanging
onto these old things

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:84%
and really, it doesn't
matter where the injury truly

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.610 align:middle line:90%
came from.

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.110 align:middle line:90%
You can still work on it.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.681 align:middle line:84%
Because I've forgotten some
of the emotional traumas

00:12:31.681 --> 00:12:33.180 align:middle line:84%
and some of the
little things that I

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.520 align:middle line:84%
experienced as a little kid,
but it's here in my body.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not working on
me as a little kid,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on the
body that I have now.

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.450 align:middle line:90%
And coming back into center.

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:44.890 align:middle line:90%
How does it change our state?

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, we know that
moving the body

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
and actually giving it
challenge and giving it risk

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.640 align:middle line:84%
is actually a way to
enter the flow state.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Flow Genome Project
is talking about here's

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:84%
your comfort level
of a certain task.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.740 align:middle line:84%
If you go 4% more,
then you're already

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.270 align:middle line:90%
triggering the flow state.

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:84%
So challenge and
risk are two things

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that trigger a different
altered state of consciousness

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:11.190 align:middle line:84%
that I believe is actually
accessing what you would call

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.130 align:middle line:90%
the quantum realm inside you.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's a realm of
really, pure magic.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of things
that quantum physics

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:23.850 align:middle line:84%
is breaking down of the
old science, the old idea

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:84%
that we've come from where
everything is so rigid.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:28.860 align:middle line:90%
So the body-- it wants to learn.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And it does that by
being thrown off balance,

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:90%
coming back into balance.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.600 align:middle line:84%
So I say, the best thing
that we can actually do--

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.970 align:middle line:84%
the states that we can
find ourselves in--

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:42.660 align:middle line:84%
is finding what the
body is telling us.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.280 align:middle line:90%
Looking at our posture.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Not harping on ourselves or
getting down on ourselves

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:84%
because our posture
isn't perfect.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:90%
You start where you are.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.270 align:middle line:84%
You forgive yourself
for all of the past.

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
You forgive your parents
and everybody who you feel

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.170 align:middle line:90%
has wronged you.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
And you start in this moment
to move back in the direction,

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.680 align:middle line:84%
back in the trajectory
of what you feel balanced

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:90%
and what you for your health is.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So it is really a personal
journey for each of us.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.310 align:middle line:90%
And the body is--

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:12.390 align:middle line:90%
it's our guide.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.590 align:middle line:90%
It really is our guide.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:16.890 align:middle line:84%
It's whispering to
us in symbolic form.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And if we learn how
to listen to that,

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.630 align:middle line:84%
we are the ones that
are meeting it halfway.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:25.770 align:middle line:84%
So us actually consciously
changing our posture,

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:84%
us actually consciously
changing the way

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:33.000 align:middle line:84%
that we move into a more
intelligent, graceful manner--

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.550 align:middle line:84%
that's where we're really going
to start hearing the deeper

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:84%
messages of life that
don't speak God's not

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.830 align:middle line:84%
going to peek through the
clouds and actually tell you

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:41.940 align:middle line:90%
the secrets.

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.200 align:middle line:90%
This is the riddle.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.430 align:middle line:90%
This is the enigma.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.380 align:middle line:84%
So if we listen to
it, it will actually

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:90%
reveal its secrets to us.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.560 align:middle line:90%
But there is the key.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
All relationships-- your lovers,
your children, your family,

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.360 align:middle line:90%
nature in general--

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.480 align:middle line:84%
you have to listen to come into
a better relationship with it.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.460 align:middle line:90%
Force does not work.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.420 align:middle line:90%
Ignoring it does not work.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:04.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to meet it
halfway, actually listen.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And this will change
your conscious state

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and actually bring
you into a state

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:11.340 align:middle line:84%
where you feel confident that
you can listen to the body

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually giving
you the tips and clues

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:18.120 align:middle line:84%
to move towards
healing and wholeness.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:24.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I love this because we've
heard a lot that meditation can

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:90%
start to calm the mind.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And that calming the mind
can start to relieve stress.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:90%
Can start to relieve pain.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think an important piece
that we shouldn't overlook

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.440 align:middle line:84%
is that also, by moving
in more conscious ways

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.110 align:middle line:84%
and actually being in the
body in more conscious ways--

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:44.570 align:middle line:84%
also works the mind
and comes the mind.

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.310 align:middle line:84%
That it can work
in both directions.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:51.110 align:middle line:84%
So I'd love to have you show
us a couple of things about,

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:84%
how can we start
to learn to listen?

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.820 align:middle line:84%
How can we start to change
these states and tune

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.590 align:middle line:84%
into this deeper wisdom that
our body is offering us?

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:06.130 align:middle line:90%
[WHOOSH]

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:06.930 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
First thing I'll have us do is
just check in with our posture.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.960 align:middle line:84%
Before we correct
anything, I want

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:84%
us to be able to listen to
what the body's actually saying

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:17.677 align:middle line:84%
and develop that kind
of a relationship.

00:16:17.677 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
we should really

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.470 align:middle line:84%
be doing throughout the
day is checking in with how

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:23.610 align:middle line:90%
we're holding ourselves.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And remember that it's
symbolic towards how we feel.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And what we're actually
giving back out.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.610 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing is
if you're sitting--

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:35.470 align:middle line:84%
instead of resting
against the back,

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:90%
just come up a little bit.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And then adopt just a relaxed
or a slouching position.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.430 align:middle line:84%
You could even put
the hand on the legs,

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.950 align:middle line:90%
but just relax into this.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:49.970 align:middle line:90%
Listen to the body.

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:52.970 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Start feeling how
your breath feels.

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.895 align:middle line:84%
Is it restricted in any way
because of this posture?

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:05.859 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.990 align:middle line:84%
Now start checking in
with parts of your body--

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:09.099 align:middle line:90%
maybe your pelvis.

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your back-- that's
doing all the work

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.450 align:middle line:90%
and holding this posture.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Where is all the
work being done?

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.629 align:middle line:84%
And just check in
with those places.

00:17:16.629 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:90%
Keep breathing.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And now, I want you to link it
to something emotional-- maybe

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:30.050 align:middle line:84%
a strained relationship,
or a feeling

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:84%
of inadequacy, a lack of
self-confidence-- whatever

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.572 align:middle line:90%
it might be.

00:17:35.572 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:84%
And link it to something
that's very real

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:90%
and present for you lately.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Does it come up at
all in your body?

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Does it feel like it
is housed or located

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:90%
in any specific place?

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.770 align:middle line:84%
And just keep
checking in with it.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:51.940 align:middle line:90%
We don't have to shame it.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.570 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to make it seem
like it's a problem, an issue.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:90%
It just is what it is.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:84%
We're already living with
it so it is what it is.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're letting
it express itself.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:05.810 align:middle line:90%
We're listening to it.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:10.850 align:middle line:84%
And the more you breathe and
just check in with your body,

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.575 align:middle line:84%
just see where your
attention goes naturally.

00:18:13.575 --> 00:18:16.989 align:middle line:90%


00:18:16.989 --> 00:18:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And once you've come
to a state where

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:22.430 align:middle line:84%
you feel like you've actually
received some kind of message

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and then remember-- you've
already received the message.

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:29.360 align:middle line:84%
It's just not in a language
that you fully understand.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the
creativity comes in.

00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:34.370 align:middle line:84%
So once you get to that
place where you feel that

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:36.710 align:middle line:84%
you've received the message--
whether you can put it

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:90%
into words or not--

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.632 align:middle line:84%
then I'd invite you
to sit up straight.

00:18:41.632 --> 00:18:44.090 align:middle line:84%
Just whatever that means to
you because sitting up straight

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.282 align:middle line:84%
also means something
different to everybody.

00:18:47.282 --> 00:18:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And as you're sitting
straight, the first thing

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I want you to do is just
roll each shoulder back one

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.860 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And then just see how your
shoulder sits at that point.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you to lift
your chin just a little bit,

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.300 align:middle line:84%
just so you're not bringing
your neck down to your chest.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Just lift your chin
up a little bit

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:84%
and just feel the position
of your spine, now.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.530 align:middle line:90%
Check in with your breath.

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel now?

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.107 align:middle line:84%
Is it as restricted as it
was when you were slouching?

00:19:16.107 --> 00:19:19.590 align:middle line:90%


00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like you
have more expansiveness?

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.650 align:middle line:90%
How does it feel?

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.320 align:middle line:84%
Those spots in your body that
were holding your slouching

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:90%
posture--

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.930 align:middle line:90%
how do they feel now?

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:90%
Just check in.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:84%
Nothing's right,
nothing's wrong.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.900 align:middle line:84%
It just is what it is
and it's speaking to you.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:90%


00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to check back in
with that emotional component--

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:47.680 align:middle line:84%
that strained relationship
or whatever it was.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:49.870 align:middle line:90%
That feeling of self-doubt.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.650 align:middle line:90%
Just check in with it.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:55.840 align:middle line:84%
See how that feeling,
that idea, or concept

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.150 align:middle line:90%
fits with this new posture.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.246 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to have
to sit with it a bit.

00:20:01.246 --> 00:20:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And it may not
make perfect sense

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.620 align:middle line:84%
right now-- that's why I
invite you to do this daily.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:90%
Do it in the morning.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Do it in the middle of the
day when you feel stressed.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.410 align:middle line:90%
When you're on the phone.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:14.480 align:middle line:84%
When you're standing
talking to somebody.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.430 align:middle line:84%
When you're sitting in
front of the computer.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.770 align:middle line:84%
Just check in with your
posture, like you are now,

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.710 align:middle line:90%
and just see how it feels.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And see if you
can find some kind

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:28.220 align:middle line:84%
of link between your posture
and your emotional state.

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Is your posture informing
your emotional state?

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.068 align:middle line:84%
And just keep breathing
and keep listening.

00:20:34.068 --> 00:20:40.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And once you've come to a place
where you feel like you've

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.020 align:middle line:90%
received the message--

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:84%
again, whether you can
put it in words or not--

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:90%
just sit with it.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to
acknowledge it and thank it

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.630 align:middle line:90%
for exactly what it is.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.610 align:middle line:90%
There's no shaming.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.920 align:middle line:84%
The only forgiveness
is in the fact

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.700 align:middle line:84%
that we've been fighting
against all these messages.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:84%
They're holding themselves
in the body somehow

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and we've been
fighting against it.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.580 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do
now is surrender.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.030 align:middle line:90%
It's very simple.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:90%
Just a breath.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:14.790 align:middle line:90%


00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Fall in love with that exhale--

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.830 align:middle line:84%
that's what sends you
into a parasympathetic,

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.050 align:middle line:90%
more calm nervous system.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And just check in with
your body one more time.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And now, the last thing that
I'm going to leave you with

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:31.830 align:middle line:84%
is really, now that
we have found a way

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.220 align:middle line:84%
to enhance our way of
listening to the body--

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:84%
just a few simple
things that many people

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:84%
don't think of when it comes
to, what is a correct posture?

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, our
abdomen is not engaged

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.670 align:middle line:84%
and that is one of the things
our diaphragm and our abdomen

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.440 align:middle line:84%
actually holds our
spine straight.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And when our spine
is not straight,

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:84%
that channel is not
sending information

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.820 align:middle line:84%
properly because all
the information goes

00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.770 align:middle line:84%
from the connective
tissues of the body

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.420 align:middle line:90%
to the cranial sacral system.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And all of that information
is sent straight to brain,

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:90%
straight to the mind.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.920 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to check in now,
with how your neck actually

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.610 align:middle line:84%
feels seated on
top of the spine.

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:90%
Is it imbalanced?

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Is it leaning to one
side or the other?

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Does it feel strained?

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.900 align:middle line:90%
Just check in.

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:27.810 align:middle line:84%
So all we're going to do is
just make a quick adjustment.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:30.690 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be super simple
for you to remember it.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.940 align:middle line:84%
Just slightly bring
in your abdomen--

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.520 align:middle line:84%
as if you're on the beach and
you're sucking in that gut.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And just feel how that actually
holds and supports your spine.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I want you to
check in with your pelvis.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:84%
How is all of this stacking
on top of your pelvis?

00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:90%
And two little adjustments--

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:57.080 align:middle line:84%
bring the chest up
just a little bit.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.840 align:middle line:90%
And then bring it back down.

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And just breathe
in one more time.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:07.350 align:middle line:90%


00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:90%
And then let it go, again.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.780 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
checking in with here

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.930 align:middle line:84%
is this symbolic language
of the body, of the posture.

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And movement-- it's the
same thing with movement.

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.006 align:middle line:84%
As you're walking
throughout the day,

00:23:21.006 --> 00:23:23.130 align:middle line:84%
you don't need to know what
the scientists and what

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:26.170 align:middle line:84%
the professionals are saying
about what correct posture is.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.800 align:middle line:84%
All you need to do
is check in with you.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.990 align:middle line:84%
And check in with
how it's making you

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:33.810 align:middle line:84%
feel on an emotional,
psychological level.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.720 align:middle line:84%
If it's causing anxiety
or if it's relieving it.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:84%
This is listening
to your body talk

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:84%
because your body is
always talking to you.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.070 align:middle line:90%
And the more you do this--

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.020 align:middle line:84%
in the same way
that you just have

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:84%
to be present with your
lovers, with your children,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:84%
with your friends,
and your family--

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.130 align:middle line:90%
you have to keep showing up.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And keep checking in
with them to strengthen

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.550 align:middle line:90%
that relationship.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.430 align:middle line:84%
It's the same thing
with your body,

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:84%
and your body is waiting for
you to come into a better

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.740 align:middle line:90%
relationship with it.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So I hope that this-- even
though it may not seem like

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:90%
you've done much--

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.190 align:middle line:84%
what you're really doing is
less of a physical manipulation

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.590 align:middle line:90%
and more of a listening act.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.750 align:middle line:84%
You're learning how to
actually quiet the mind

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:17.870 align:middle line:84%
and listen to the subtle things
that the body are telling you.

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And I promise you,
if you do this--

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.040 align:middle line:84%
if you come into a better
relationship with your body,

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.370 align:middle line:84%
it will open up all those
secrets, all those questions,

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.230 align:middle line:84%
all those mysteries
of life that you

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.090 align:middle line:90%
keep racking your brain about.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And it will improve
your potential

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.830 align:middle line:84%
to be the best you
that you can be.

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:35.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome, Ben.

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:37.610 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.140 align:middle line:84%
Becoming more aware of
our bodies and everything

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:40.940 align:middle line:90%
that we do--

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:41.840 align:middle line:90%
so important.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Thanks for allowing me
to share with your audience.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for being here.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for joining us.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.790 align:middle line:90%
Until next time.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.540 align:middle line:90%
