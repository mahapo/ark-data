00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.450 align:middle line:10%
I'm Ashleigh Sergeant.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.380 align:middle line:10%
And welcome to "Everyday
Enlightenment," your go-to show

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.500 align:middle line:10%
for tips on how to be more
conscious in the midst

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:10%
of your busy modern life.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:84%
The World Health
Organization recently

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.520 align:middle line:84%
projected that mental
illness will be the leading

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:90%
cause of death by 2020.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And the Center for
Disease Control

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:84%
has determined that sleep
disorder is now a public health

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.100 align:middle line:90%
epidemic.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.300 align:middle line:84%
What is the role that
technology and social media

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.840 align:middle line:84%
play in contributing to mental
health and sleep disorders?

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.210 align:middle line:84%
How can we avoid
these illnesses?

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And what can we do to nourish
ourselves and create balance?

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.340 align:middle line:84%
My guest today is Rod
Stryker, a world-renowned yoga

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.740 align:middle line:84%
and meditation teacher
for more than 40 years.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.340 align:middle line:10%
He's the founder of
ParaYoga, the author

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.210 align:middle line:10%
of "The Four Desires," and the
creator of the app Sanctuary,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.220 align:middle line:10%
a vital resource
for the practices

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.220 align:middle line:10%
of meditation and yoga nidra.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Rod, thanks so much for
being here with me today.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.391 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's great to
be with you, Ashleigh.

00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:24.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So these statistics are kind
of staggering, aren't they?

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:90%
>> They are.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.880 align:middle line:90%
They're alarming.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And the good news
is that there's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.990 align:middle line:90%
a lot we can do about it.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.350 align:middle line:10%
But we have to be rather
deliberate because the fact is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:10%
our society, our
culture, and technology

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.060 align:middle line:10%
is moving us in a
direction that makes

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:10%
these things almost inevitable.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's about really
making conscious choices

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.380 align:middle line:84%
and also accessing some
really vital resources

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.720 align:middle line:84%
that I hope we'll talk
about a little bit today.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of these
things that sometimes,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.030 align:middle line:90%
when life is moving so quickly--

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.060 align:middle line:84%
and what's happening with
this technological age

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
is that we start to just accept
things sometimes as they are.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, I'm so busy.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:90%
Or everybody has anxiety.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:84%
Or nobody can really
sleep so well.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> It's true.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:84%
In a way, the new normal
is leaning into emotions

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.380 align:middle line:90%
like sadness and anxiety.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And if we're not absolutely
insane and completely disabled

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.370 align:middle line:84%
more or less, then we feel
like we're just normal.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Or we're not
getting anything done.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:90%
That's true as well.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> People are so used to
feeling like they need to be

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.189 align:middle line:90%
so, so, so hyper-productive.

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it's something that
we're experiencing as well.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, it's worth just
mentioning that there is value

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.740 align:middle line:84%
in having a certain
level of stress.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.406 align:middle line:84%
And I know that sounds
counterintuitive.

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:34.620 align:middle line:90%
But that's stimulation.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:90%
And that is motivation.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.987 align:middle line:90%
And it gets us inspired.

00:02:37.987 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is--
and you mentioned

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.570 align:middle line:84%
the technological thrust
of our society now.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:84%
The reality is that
none of that technology

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:84%
takes into account what
our physiology needs.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And the short view on this is
that really, our physiology

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and what we need to be
healthy hasn't changed.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.960 align:middle line:84%
But the cumulative
build-up of technology

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and less sleep and
constantly going

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.920 align:middle line:84%
is actually disrupting
vital physiological systems

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.805 align:middle line:90%
in our body.

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:12.527 align:middle line:84%
To make it easy to understand,
the autonomic nervous system

00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:14.610 align:middle line:84%
is a part of ourselves, a
part of a nervous system

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.160 align:middle line:84%
that we don't think about
and that works all the time.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.189 align:middle line:84%
And it's constantly
measuring our stress levels.

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:84%
And on the basis of
that, it's either

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:84%
throwing us into a
fight-or-flight response--

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
that's over on the
autonomic nervous system

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.840 align:middle line:90%
side, the sympathetic side.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Or it's moving us into
a rest-and-digest mode,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:90%
where we're regenerating.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.196 align:middle line:84%
And blood flow is moving
toward the organs.

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we begin
to replenish and recharge

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.850 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.212 align:middle line:84%
But so much of the technology--
what they're actually finding--

00:03:42.212 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:84%
so when we're on our
phone, whether we're

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.920 align:middle line:84%
doing social media or
we're playing a video game,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.440 align:middle line:84%
it actually stimulates the
sympathetic nervous system,

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.660 align:middle line:84%
throws us into this
stress response.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.250 align:middle line:84%
The blue light from computers
and from our smartphones

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:84%
disrupts the release
of melatonin.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And so our sleep
patterns are disrupted.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.820 align:middle line:84%
Our sleep patterns
get disrupted.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.120 align:middle line:84%
We now aren't actually
processing our life

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:90%
in the same way we would.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:84%
What the human body really
needs is homeostasis.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.900 align:middle line:90%
That's where we repair.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.736 align:middle line:84%
Normally, when we sleep is
where we get our homeostasis.

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that
all the systems of the body

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.610 align:middle line:84%
have basically gone
into a standstill.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And in deep sleep,
that's what we access.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, in that standstill
state, that's

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:84%
when the mechanism of
regeneration begins.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.180 align:middle line:84%
If we were to sleep eight
hours, 20% of that time

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:90%
is in deep sleep.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.030 align:middle line:90%
That's where we regenerate.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.340 align:middle line:84%
But then you start to
add in stress levels

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:90%
that you mentioned.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.050 align:middle line:84%
And we start to throw in the
mix the effect of technology

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:90%
on our nervous system.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Sleep patterns get disturbed.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:84%
We don't get that 20% of
deep rest that we need.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we become
more stressed.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And usually what happens--
it's a kind of catch-22

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.970 align:middle line:84%
because the more
stressed we get,

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:84%
invariably we seek out things
that create more stress, not

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:90%
more relaxation.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.069 align:middle line:84%
>> Like caffeine, more social
media, more emails or things,

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:84%
feeling like you're
getting something done.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.570 align:middle line:84%
And by getting something done,
you might relieve that stress.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, we're
stimulating it.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.936 align:middle line:84%
>> There's also a new
understanding about

00:05:11.936 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:90%
the research on this.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And that is that we're
all so overstimulated

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.910 align:middle line:84%
that our body is now
starting to develop

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
a desensitization to those
chemicals related to stress,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.700 align:middle line:90%
mainly cortisol.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
So that means that in
order to get motivated,

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%
we need higher levels of
stress than we did 10, 20, 30,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.595 align:middle line:90%
40, 50 years ago.

00:05:33.595 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, that's interesting.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You now need higher levels
of stress to even feel normally

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.340 align:middle line:90%
stimulated to get things done.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.740 align:middle line:84%
So it really is this
vicious cycle and then

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:84%
this forecast of that in
just not even a decade,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
we're going to turn this corner
into so many serious health

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.540 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's interesting that
you say that about the possible

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.334 align:middle line:84%
need for more cortisol or more
stress to even feel motivated.

00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And when you said
that, I was connecting

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.750 align:middle line:84%
to what people, I think,
identify with as having energy.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Because people think
a lot of times--

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.680 align:middle line:84%
when they think about
learning meditation or doing

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.440 align:middle line:84%
guided relaxation or
something along those lines,

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:84%
people think, oh, that will
just make me fall asleep.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Or I'll just be
tired after doing it.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.730 align:middle line:84%
If I relax too much,
I'll just fall asleep.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's this, I
think, misunderstanding

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:34.760 align:middle line:84%
happening that actually, our
most beneficial and most vital

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.470 align:middle line:84%
resource being
connected to our energy

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
is actually a relaxed state
where we are energetic as well.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.310 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to feel this
really intense stimulation

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.510 align:middle line:90%
to actually get things done.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And for what it's worth,
there's another important

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.708 align:middle line:84%
element in the
point you're making.

00:06:47.708 --> 00:06:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is that the
brain has two functions.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So they've been described as
exploitation and exploration.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.774 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that when
we go into a stress level,

00:06:58.774 --> 00:07:01.190 align:middle line:84%
when the brain is stressed,
when the brain is experiencing

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.990 align:middle line:84%
we're in stress,
we actually begin

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.910 align:middle line:90%
to diminish our free will.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.500 align:middle line:90%
And here's what I mean by that.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:84%
The brain starts to go
back when it's in stress.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.946 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to what
it already knows.

00:07:10.946 --> 00:07:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, its normal
function and what

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:84%
it functions when it's actually
in a state of relaxation

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.520 align:middle line:84%
is what's called
"exploration," which

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.350 align:middle line:84%
means you begin to
see new solutions,

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.219 align:middle line:84%
new positive directions that
you would normally not see.

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you've
been having a challenge

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:84%
that's been sustained
or in place for a while,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.660 align:middle line:84%
if you're stressed, it's very
hard to work out of that box

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.810 align:middle line:84%
or out of that prison
or containment.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:84%
When you relax, you begin
to see new possibilities.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.900 align:middle line:84%
A client of mine used
to say, you know,

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.415 align:middle line:90%
when I work with you--

00:07:40.415 --> 00:07:42.830 align:middle line:84%
he was an unlikely
candidate for meditation.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.700 align:middle line:90%
Let me just put it that way.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.954 align:middle line:84%
But when he first began to
learn to do meditation--

00:07:46.954 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and he was a very
high-powered executive

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.910 align:middle line:90%
and banking consultant.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:52.040 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you know,
through meditation, I

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:84%
begin to hear answers to
questions I haven't yet asked.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's the idea here.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:84%
It's not just about
our physiology.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But it is about
our mental health.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to solve
many of the challenges

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.460 align:middle line:84%
that we face emotionally and
psychologically, we need rest.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
We need to slow down in
order to find those solutions

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.720 align:middle line:84%
and then ultimately create from
that new place of discovery

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.280 align:middle line:90%
and invention.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:84%
That's the natural
condition of a human being.

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And I would just say
that, as you mentioned,

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.550 align:middle line:84%
I've taught yoga and
meditation for about 40 years.

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:28.520 align:middle line:84%
There's this idea that
yoga and meditation

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.450 align:middle line:84%
is a kind of artifice
or a contortion.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.030 align:middle line:84%
Or it's taking you out
of your normative life.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is that
really, yoga and meditation--

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:90%
yoga nidra, for example--

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.809 align:middle line:90%
bring us back to normative life.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.810 align:middle line:84%
It's life that takes us out
of our normative state, which

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.840 align:middle line:84%
is creativity and
healing and regeneration

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:84%
and rest and enthusiasm
and joy and peace

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and also, by the way, the
ability to work our way out

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.500 align:middle line:84%
of sadness, the ability
to work away out of stress

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and challenges that we face.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:90%
So there are resources.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.050 align:middle line:84%
But the point is that we need
to really make an effort,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:84%
if you will, to step out
of the normative flow,

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.470 align:middle line:84%
let our neighbors and our
people at work and stuff--

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
if they're going to continue to
operate at that level of stress

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.280 align:middle line:90%
and momentum, let them do it.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:84%
If you have the education,
which is why we're here today--

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.290 align:middle line:84%
to help educate people
that there are resources

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.850 align:middle line:84%
that they can use
that really help

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.430 align:middle line:84%
meet the demands of the
world we're in today.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think that yoga nidra is
one of the most powerful ones

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.730 align:middle line:84%
that people can
use and work with.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.940 align:middle line:84%
It's probably the easiest one
for people to access and get

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:39.900 align:middle line:90%
the most benefit from.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Yoga nidra has been written
about for almost 3,000 years.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.132 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
really catching on.

00:09:47.132 --> 00:09:48.590 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the
yoga world, I think

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:84%
this is now the next frontier
about the resource people

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:90%
are looking to work with.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
It's as simple as
lying on your back

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and listening to very simple
guidance and direction.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:90%
And the point about yoga nidra--

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.560 align:middle line:84%
"nidra" means sleep, and
"yoga" means awareness.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.910 align:middle line:90%
I call it "enlightened sleep."

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.740 align:middle line:84%
So it means that
while you're sleeping,

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:90%
you're actually still aware.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.726 align:middle line:84%
And it's referring
to a kind of sleep

00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:19.100 align:middle line:84%
that I spoke about
earlier, which

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.400 align:middle line:90%
is that state of homeostasis.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.910 align:middle line:90%
It's dreamless sleep.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you repair
mentally and emotionally.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.760 align:middle line:84%
That's where your cognition
is heightened and developed,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.040 align:middle line:84%
your brain function,
your memory.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:90%
Your creativity is heightened.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:36.322 align:middle line:84%
But it's also the critical
thing to repair physiologically.

00:10:36.322 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell us a little
bit about how it brings us

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.880 align:middle line:90%
into the delta state?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.450 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that one of
the big taglines that we hear

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.000 align:middle line:84%
around yoga nidra is like,
20 minutes of yoga nidra

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.590 align:middle line:90%
is equal to--

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:50.660 align:middle line:84%
I feel like that
stat varies a lot.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.485 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:10:51.485 --> 00:10:56.240 align:middle line:84%
The ultimate state of yoga nidra
is indeed the delta rhythm.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.160 align:middle line:90%
It's predominantly delta.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.500 align:middle line:84%
If a sleep scientist
would look at it,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.680 align:middle line:84%
they would effectively
see that you were asleep.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
But they would see this
other little element in it.

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:84%
They would see a little
elevated alpha rhythm, too.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:90%
Delta is deep sleep.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Delta is where we regenerate.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:84%
But the peak or this
elevation of the alpha state

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.450 align:middle line:84%
that we normally
don't see in sleep

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:20.194 align:middle line:84%
means that there's a subtle
trace of awareness happening

00:11:20.194 --> 00:11:21.110 align:middle line:90%
while you're sleeping.

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's been
documented in research.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:29.420 align:middle line:84%
But in essence, we don't reach
that deep state homeostasis

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:84%
and physiological repair
when we are dreaming.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:84%
It's when we're in
dreamless sleep.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
predominant delta state.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:42.290 align:middle line:84%
That's what I mentioned earlier
is only about 20% to 25%

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.890 align:middle line:90%
of eight hours of sleep.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:44.837 align:middle line:90%
So that's number one.

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:45.920 align:middle line:90%
How does it get you there?

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:47.750 align:middle line:84%
It kind of really
works systematically,

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
which is to help you relax
through various layers.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we have
to do is calm your senses

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and bring your attention
inward and then gradually,

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.240 align:middle line:84%
through different
steps in the process,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:84%
attention to the
breath, attention

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.560 align:middle line:84%
to where you're holding
tension, continuing

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:90%
to internalize awareness.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:84%
You gradually sense
yourself starting

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.270 align:middle line:84%
to disconnect from the
world as we know it

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:17.060 align:middle line:84%
and connecting to consciousness,
this ever-sustaining,

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:84%
ever-present intelligence
that really is

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:84%
running the show of life and
is what pervades life itself.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we're
connecting to with no cognition

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:90%
to distract us from it.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:29.630 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.490 align:middle line:84%
And I've experienced
it many times.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.316 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I
remember hearing you

00:12:33.316 --> 00:12:34.940 align:middle line:84%
say that I thought
was really important

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:40.220 align:middle line:84%
was how important is this
in relation to meditation.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a lot of people
now really starting to realize,

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:44.810 align:middle line:90%
OK, wow.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:47.870 align:middle line:84%
I think I need to
meditate, becoming

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:50.517 align:middle line:84%
aware of their anxiety,
becoming aware of the stresses,

00:12:50.517 --> 00:12:52.100 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware of
some of the diseases

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:90%
that are more prominent.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And more and more
people, I believe,

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.380 align:middle line:84%
are waking up to the
idea that we have power

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.330 align:middle line:90%
to work with these things.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And how do you
think this relates

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.510 align:middle line:84%
to beginning a
meditation practice?

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Because in my
experience, yoga nidra

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.704 align:middle line:84%
can be a little
bit more appealing

00:13:06.704 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and more accessible
to some people

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:84%
because we get to
do it laying down.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:11.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I would agree.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're on the
same page with that.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:15.912 align:middle line:84%
And I think because
of really what we've

00:13:15.912 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:90%
been talking about thus far--

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.350 align:middle line:84%
because our stress levels
are as high as they are--

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.440 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot to ask a
really stressed out mind

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:29.780 align:middle line:84%
to reach a quality
in meditation that

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:32.750 align:middle line:84%
speaks to this same
state of absolute ease

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.030 align:middle line:84%
and connecting to
the highest, most

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:36.440 align:middle line:90%
pristine part of ourselves.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.659 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to do that
through sitting up.

00:13:38.659 --> 00:13:40.700 align:middle line:84%
There's physical discomfort
and things like that.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.350 align:middle line:90%
So you make a really good case.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.530 align:middle line:90%
I've taught the same thing.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Yoga nidra allows us
to immediately impact

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:84%
our central nervous system much
more quickly than meditation.

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Meditation eventually
gets there.

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And the chief distinction
between the two

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.000 align:middle line:84%
is what allows us to go deeper
in meditation is effectively

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:84%
concentration, which we've all
become less and less efficient

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.041 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:10.040 align:middle line:84%
Again, modern life-- the
impact on concentration

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.650 align:middle line:84%
is significant, just like
its impact on memory.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.394 align:middle line:84%
>> Technology can pull
our awareness into so many

00:14:15.394 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:84%
different places in
the blink of an eye.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>> We're overstimulated.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's the vehicle
for meditation.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.930 align:middle line:84%
However, the vehicle for
yoga nidra is relaxation.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And because you're
lying on your back

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and because the yogis left us
some really amazing systematic

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.500 align:middle line:84%
processes to help us relax, if
we think about, would I rather

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:39.745 align:middle line:84%
concentrate to reach this
heightened place of healing

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:41.870 align:middle line:84%
and regeneration, or
would I rather relax

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:84%
to reach that similar
place, most people probably

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
will get deeper faster
and get to that place

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:49.500 align:middle line:90%
through yoga nidra.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:50.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.340 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
that's insignificant.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.673 align:middle line:84%
I think the one thing I do
want to say about it, though,

00:14:54.673 --> 00:14:58.590 align:middle line:84%
is not all experiences within
yoga nidra are created equal.

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:02.530 align:middle line:84%
There are actually different
levels of that experience.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:04.416 align:middle line:84%
And mind you, all of
them are productive.

00:15:04.416 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:90%
All of them are meaningful.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.900 align:middle line:90%
We all need to slow down.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, you had
mentioned falling asleep.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.320 align:middle line:90%
It's OK if you fall asleep.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
You may actually wake
up occasionally tired.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that a lot
of us, if not every single one

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.870 align:middle line:90%
of us these days, is tired.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:84%
But we're so
overstimulated, we're

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.520 align:middle line:84%
kind of overriding
an awareness of where

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:84%
our bodies and our
minds really are.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.249 align:middle line:84%
Yoga nidra gets you
closer, gets you back

00:15:28.249 --> 00:15:29.290 align:middle line:90%
to knowing where you are.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.123 align:middle line:84%
And if you need rest,
you might fall asleep.

00:15:31.123 --> 00:15:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So stage one is just
this relaxation.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:84%
You may feel a softening in your
body, this kind of turning away

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:90%
from the world.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And the world itself, even
the sounds outside of the room

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.550 align:middle line:84%
or where you're practicing,
are more distant.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
That's already a
great first step.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.320 align:middle line:84%
Second step is now where you
begin to really experience

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:84%
a distance from
your own thoughts,

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:54.080 align:middle line:84%
where worry and concern
vanish completely,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:84%
which is-- again, how
wonderful would that be,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.150 align:middle line:84%
especially citing
those statistics you

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:90%
mentioned at the beginning?

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.910 align:middle line:90%
It really becomes meaningful.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, some teachers would
say that those first two

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.860 align:middle line:90%
steps are not yoga nidra.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.100 align:middle line:84%
They are preparations to
enter the state of yoga nidra.

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
General relaxation,
withdrawal from the world,

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:84%
and then ultimately this
deep softening and separation

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.700 align:middle line:84%
from the mind and all
its concerns-- those

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.500 align:middle line:90%
are preparations.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:22.080 align:middle line:84%
Third stage is awareness
of the state of sleep.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Literally, you can be lying
there and not sleeping

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.760 align:middle line:90%
but aware of the state of sleep.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.630 align:middle line:90%
It's really special.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And then the final stage
is where we would describe

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:90%
there are no experiences.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.470 align:middle line:84%
You're beyond all feelings
and all experiences now.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.390 align:middle line:84%
Yogis and spiritual
types might consider

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.750 align:middle line:84%
that contemplative ideas
around, that's pure oneness.

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.070 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing to seek.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.580 align:middle line:84%
There's no seeker,
nothing being sought.

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.120 align:middle line:90%
It's just pure being.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
height of yoga nidra.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's the ultimate stage.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:90%
All of them are productive.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:16:59.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Will you give us an
experience of it?

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I'd love to.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:01.540 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.359 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to suggest is
that you get some basic props

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.839 align:middle line:84%
so that you're comfortable
for the practice.

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.829 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to ask you
to lie on your back.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.410 align:middle line:84%
It's terrific if you have
something under your head.

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:17.079 align:middle line:84%
And make sure the surface
that you're resting on

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
is comfortable and soft enough
to accommodate you resting

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.210 align:middle line:90%
for about 10 minutes or so.

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:25.810 align:middle line:84%
So please get
comfortable as I lead you

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.730 align:middle line:84%
through this short
yoga nidra practice.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:31.390 align:middle line:84%
It's best if you do have
something under your head

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.190 align:middle line:90%
so that you have some padding.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you like, you're more
than welcome to have something

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.570 align:middle line:84%
under your thighs so you have
a little additional lower back

00:17:38.570 --> 00:17:39.370 align:middle line:90%
support.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:40.170 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:90%
Arms are by your side.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And have the heels about
just a little wider than hip

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.870 align:middle line:90%
distance apart.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:48.280 align:middle line:84%
I'll also recommend that
you have situated yourself

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:84%
in a room that's
relatively quiet.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And if it is bright,
it's a really good idea

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:84%
to have just a lightweight
covering over your eyes,

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:84%
but nothing too heavy, not
really a heavy eye pillow.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:03.680 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:84%
So as you settle down, I'd
like you to go ahead and close

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.240 align:middle line:90%
your eyes.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And make any final
adjustments you might need.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.290 align:middle line:84%
The intention is
that you won't have

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.456 align:middle line:90%
to move during the practice.

00:18:12.456 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is the time to
get really comfortable.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a moment
or two just to settle in.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And see if you need
any more adjustments

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:84%
so that you can remain still
throughout the duration

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.110 align:middle line:90%
of this practice.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Keep in mind that yoga nidra
can be done any time of day.

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And this practice, as
well as other practices,

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
can be done as many
times as you need.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.070 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, do the same
practice over and over again.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.090 align:middle line:90%
Find new practices.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:84%
Practices can vary in length
from 10 minutes to as long

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:90%
as even an hour.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.970 align:middle line:84%
With your eyes closed
and your body open,

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.960 align:middle line:84%
just first have the intention
that you will stay aware

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:90%
throughout the practice.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.890 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're
going to invite the body

00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.730 align:middle line:84%
to go into deep sleep,
the mind to sleep,

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:03.311 align:middle line:84%
but that awareness
will be sustained

00:19:03.311 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:90%
throughout the practice.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:11.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And then make the decision that
for the next 10 minutes or so,

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.970 align:middle line:84%
you will not try and
solve any outside issues.

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:23.020 align:middle line:84%
You'll let go of all
responsibility and all care.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:26.770 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing and no
one to take care of now.

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:90%
Just rest.

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:32.130 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.820 align:middle line:84%
With your eyes
closed, initially just

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.850 align:middle line:84%
become aware of
the body breathing.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:43.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to ask you
to go ahead and take eight

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:90%
slow, comfortable breaths.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.767 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to begin
to expand your capacity.

00:19:51.767 --> 00:19:53.850 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to do in
a way that the breath is

00:19:53.850 --> 00:19:58.230 align:middle line:84%
as smooth and as comfortable as
possible, just eight of them--

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:02.350 align:middle line:84%
again, just relatively
still, the abdomen

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.964 align:middle line:84%
softly expanding
and contracting.

00:20:04.964 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Just be aware of
the body breathing.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And notice how you're
using your mind

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:24.310 align:middle line:84%
to shape your breath
slow and smooth.

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And your breath is shaping
your mind to become quiet

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.030 align:middle line:90%
and relaxed.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.590 align:middle line:90%
Three more times, please.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:50.840 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.280 align:middle line:90%
Just relax.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Follow the breath once
more as slow as possible.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:06.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:06.850 align:middle line:90%
Excellent.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Now please allow your
breath to flow effortlessly.

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.585 align:middle line:84%
You're no longer shaping
your breath consciously.

00:21:13.585 --> 00:21:24.000 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.940 align:middle line:84%
With the breath
flowing effortlessly,

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.020 align:middle line:84%
just become aware of
its unique qualities--

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.470 align:middle line:84%
how inhale is slightly
different than exhale.

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:37.210 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
As you exhale, that's an
opportunity to let go.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:10%
And as you inhale, that's the
experience of a kind of wave

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.490 align:middle line:10%
that regenerates and charges
every cell of the body.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:55.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.510 align:middle line:84%
As you exhale,
it's a letting go.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.600 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:84%
As you inhale, a
wave of healing.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Your breath is effortless.

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:15.570 align:middle line:90%
No trying, effortless effort.

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:24.156 align:middle line:90%


00:22:24.156 --> 00:22:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And continuing to empty all
thought, memory, movement each

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:38.540 align:middle line:84%
time you exhale, become aware
of the sensations in the body.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:48.250 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:50.445 align:middle line:84%
Notice how some sensations
are very familiar.

00:22:50.445 --> 00:22:53.740 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:84%
And others are unique
for this moment.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.550 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.118 align:middle line:84%
Just allow the breath
to flow effortlessly.

00:23:03.118 --> 00:23:08.000 align:middle line:90%


00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.790 align:middle line:90%
Notice where you're holding.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:84%
Notice the sensation of
contraction, tension.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:19.280 align:middle line:90%


00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And have the
intention to let go.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:34.450 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:35.935 align:middle line:90%
As you exhale, relax.

00:23:35.935 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:90%


00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.470 align:middle line:84%
Sense your body
supported by the floor.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:53.700 align:middle line:90%


00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:59.170 align:middle line:84%
In this moment, be
aware that there

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:02.405 align:middle line:90%
is no holding, no contraction.

00:24:02.405 --> 00:24:05.080 align:middle line:90%


00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.250 align:middle line:84%
Allow innate
intelligence-- not mind--

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:90%
to shape your breath.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:24.560 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Complete relaxation on inhale.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.210 align:middle line:90%
Complete relaxation on exhale.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:41.940 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:45.030 align:middle line:84%
Have the sense you're
no longer the breather.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:51.730 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:56.910 align:middle line:84%
You are awareness,
experiencing your body breathe.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:13.260 align:middle line:90%


00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:90%
Now sense the space around you.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.020 align:middle line:90%


00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:23.300 align:middle line:84%
You can begin by seeing
or feeling or sensing

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.295 align:middle line:84%
where the body ends and where
the space just outside of it

00:25:26.295 --> 00:25:27.095 align:middle line:90%
begins.

00:25:27.095 --> 00:25:33.800 align:middle line:90%


00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:40.460 align:middle line:84%
Sense that space is inherently
nurturing and healing

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.980 align:middle line:84%
as though you're surrounded
by healing and nurturing

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.152 align:middle line:90%
intelligence.

00:25:45.152 --> 00:25:50.240 align:middle line:90%


00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Then, when the body
breathes in, sense

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:57.420 align:middle line:84%
that healing and nurturance
moving through your skin

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.210 align:middle line:90%
toward your spine.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you breathe out,
it moves out of your spine

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.140 align:middle line:90%
to the space around your body.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:08.410 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.680 align:middle line:90%
Effortless effort.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:90%
See it, or feel it, or sense it.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.840 align:middle line:84%
When you breathe in, this wave
of healing nurturance comes in.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:26.230 align:middle line:84%
When you breathe out, it
expands, fortifies the body,

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.310 align:middle line:90%
and fills the space around you.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Please continue.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:33.525 align:middle line:90%


00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:34.325 align:middle line:90%
Just relax.

00:26:34.325 --> 00:26:38.440 align:middle line:90%


00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And slowly, you'll
experience that you

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:52.405 align:middle line:84%
enter into this practice without
trying, no visualization.

00:26:52.405 --> 00:27:00.960 align:middle line:90%


00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Healing nurturance in, and
flooding the body and the space

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.180 align:middle line:90%
around you on your exhale.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:08.980 align:middle line:90%
Please continue.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:27.280 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.200 align:middle line:90%
Now eventually, just relax.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.510 align:middle line:84%
And feel a pool of
healing and nurturance,

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:37.700 align:middle line:84%
or see it, or sense it,
both inside the body

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and outside the body
approximately arm's

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.890 align:middle line:90%
length in every direction.

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:47.432 align:middle line:84%
You rest in a pool of
healing and nurturance.

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:56.865 align:middle line:90%


00:27:56.865 --> 00:27:57.665 align:middle line:90%
Body sleeps.

00:27:57.665 --> 00:28:00.170 align:middle line:90%


00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.790 align:middle line:90%
Mind lets go.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:03.590 align:middle line:90%
Rest.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:40.700 align:middle line:90%


00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.949 align:middle line:84%
You can continue to lie in
this state as long as you like,

00:28:43.949 --> 00:28:45.240 align:middle line:90%
provided you don't fall asleep.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.820 align:middle line:90%


00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.995 align:middle line:84%
But if you're ready to
come out of the practice,

00:28:49.995 --> 00:28:52.540 align:middle line:84%
you would do so now,
first by breathing down

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.238 align:middle line:90%
toward your hands and feet.

00:28:55.238 --> 00:28:57.640 align:middle line:90%
So your breath will deepen.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.190 align:middle line:84%
And then once you feel or sense
the breath bringing vitality

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:05.950 align:middle line:84%
back to your extremities,
you can begin to move them.

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:08.680 align:middle line:90%
Move your toes, your fingertips.

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Just bring the thumbs
over your fingertips.

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually roll over
to your right side to come back.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.290 align:middle line:90%
The practice is now complete.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.780 align:middle line:90%
So take your time to ease back.

00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:33.118 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.118 --> 00:29:35.094 align:middle line:90%
Feel good?

00:29:35.094 --> 00:29:36.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.280 align:middle line:90%
So good.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.170 align:middle line:90%
>> It's hard to talk.

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:44.000 align:middle line:84%
It's such an important
practice, I think.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:44.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Important, yeah.

00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:45.600 align:middle line:90%
Thank you again.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for being here.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so
much for joining us.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:90%
We'll see you next time.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.010 align:middle line:90%
