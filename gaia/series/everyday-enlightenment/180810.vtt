>> Hey.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm Ashleigh Sergeant.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to "Everyday
Enlightenment," your go-to show

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.190 align:middle line:84%
for tips on how to be more
conscious in the midst

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.290 align:middle line:90%
of your busy modern life.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever really wanted
to change a bad habit

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:84%
but found yourself back
in the same situation over

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and over again or in the
middle of a particular behavior

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.700 align:middle line:84%
that you desperately
want to shift

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.610 align:middle line:84%
but find yourself
totally unable to stop?

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:84%
According to the
tradition of yoga,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:84%
the very first step to changing
behavior that causes suffering

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:84%
is actually recognizing
these patterns even

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.740 align:middle line:84%
exist in ourselves
and then cultivating

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.020 align:middle line:90%
the desire to change them.

Today, I'm here with the
powerful, hilarious, and very

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.330 align:middle line:90%
real Gina Caputo.

Gina is a longtime yoga and
meditation practitioner,

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.780 align:middle line:84%
a lover of nature,
music, and cooking,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and a self-proclaimed
work in progress.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.166 align:middle line:84%
Gina, thank you so much
for being here today.

00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, thank
you for having me.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that this is a
topic near and dear to both

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.620 align:middle line:90%
of our hearts.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think one that is
particularly important right

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.220 align:middle line:84%
now in our modern age of
things like yoga and meditation

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.200 align:middle line:84%
to make you peaceful
and happy and blissful.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.820 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't just happen.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you get on your
mat once in a while, or you

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.169 align:middle line:84%
sit on your cushion
once in a while.

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, once in a while.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of the time, you're
out there living in the world.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where the
yoga tradition comes in,

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
from a really deep level,
to actually give us

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.265 align:middle line:84%
tools to transform suffering,
not to just annihilate it.

00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't really
work like that.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.000 align:middle line:90%
>> And not to bypass it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Fair.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.150 align:middle line:90%
And not to bypass it.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I think as human beings,
it's helpful to recognize that

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.370 align:middle line:84%
we're all subject to what
we could call ordinary

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.660 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.979 align:middle line:90%
And you really nailed it.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
Where in previous generations I
don't think that it was really

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.220 align:middle line:84%
championed to do this kind
of self-reflective work

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and then, you know,
talk about it.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I'm really
grateful that I think that

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.980 align:middle line:84%
we're in a time where at least
it's becoming, in some ways,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.580 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more popular
to be doing this work.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.580 align:middle line:84%
But I think a big step that
we need to take in Yoga Land,

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.160 align:middle line:84%
if you want to call it
that, or modern yoga,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:84%
is to recognize that
we're selling it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.910 align:middle line:84%
in a particular way,
which you described,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.967 align:middle line:84%
where it brings about peace
and tranquility and happiness.

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not sure that we're
being clear about what

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:90%
that path actually looks like.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Like we said, you don't
just step on your mat

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.420 align:middle line:90%
and it magically happens.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.080 align:middle line:90%
That in fact, it's a journey.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.510 align:middle line:84%
And that journey
is one, I believe,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.880 align:middle line:84%
that is really
transcending the patterns

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.760 align:middle line:84%
in the ordinary consciousness,
these behavioral grooves

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.660 align:middle line:84%
that we get stuck in, kind of
little ruts of behavior, that

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:84%
often go under the line
of your consciousness,

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.980 align:middle line:90%
or your awareness.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And so, yeah, it's fantastic
that we have these tools--

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:90%
quite ancient tools, in fact--

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that are still pertinent
to the challenges

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.730 align:middle line:90%
of being a modern day human.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
I would love to
see us, as yogis,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.680 align:middle line:84%
take that next step,
though, and really call out

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.880 align:middle line:84%
the evaluation and the work
and what that work looks

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.940 align:middle line:90%
like on this path of yoga.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think that point of even
calling them tools, or calling

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:84%
it work, is what
it is, you know?

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
tools and, you know,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.080 align:middle line:84%
tools that we use with
our hands and what

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:84%
it takes to actually
build something and build

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:90%
a structure.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.470 align:middle line:84%
It takes time and
labor and work.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And that is actually
what it takes

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:84%
to transform ordinary
consciousness,

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness
that keeps us stuck.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.559 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:84%
I really resonate with
what you were just saying.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.010 align:middle line:84%
It was in some ways like
a devastating game changer

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:84%
to recognize, as I was learning
yoga in the beginning--

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:84%
to recognize that I could
no longer say things like,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.760 align:middle line:84%
you make me so mad, or
this really upsets me.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:84%
Because that is just a
language practice that

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:84%
is attributing your
suffering to something

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.305 align:middle line:90%
that's external to you.

00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:30.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.240 align:middle line:90%
That's huge.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it was.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And I was upset to read
that maybe I was doing it.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
And that it wasn't
all of these things--

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.250 align:middle line:84%
traffic or, you know, any
other of these mundane things.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:84%
They're not the cause
of your suffering.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.350 align:middle line:84%
And so it was with
great joy that I

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
saw that the causes
of our suffering

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
are actually codified,
like laid out.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.330 align:middle line:84%
For someone like me to have
names for each of these root

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:84%
causes of suffering, then made
me feel like, OK, I can really

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:84%
sink my teeth into this
part of the practice

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:90%
now that I can name it.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
I see it show up in my life, and
now I can say, ah, that's this,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:90%
or that's that.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And then it helps you
take responsibility

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.740 align:middle line:84%
for both your
suffering and your joy.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:84%
You realize you're the one
really in control of that.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:22.000 align:middle line:84%
So in some of the yoga texts,
particularly Patanjali's "Yoga

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Sutras," I find
them so incredible,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.260 align:middle line:84%
because they really outline a
technology that is timeless,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.910 align:middle line:84%
a way that we can actually start
to identify these patterns.

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.990 align:middle line:84%
Even in this crazy,
busy modern world,

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.620 align:middle line:90%
they totally still apply today--

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.550 align:middle line:84%
how to look at ourselves in
a more clear way in order

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:84%
to transcend and move through
some of these patterns.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.830 align:middle line:84%
The word you used,
"clear," it gives us

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.980 align:middle line:84%
like a system for looking
at ourselves in maybe

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:90%
a more honest way.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.310 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.930 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.720 align:middle line:84%
In Patanjali's "Yoga Sutras,"
there's so much good stuff.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like such a
rich text to dig

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:90%
into as a yoga practitioner.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:84%
But I remember vividly
coming to like a screeching

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:84%
halt when I got to the section
that was about the Kleshas.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:84%
So the Kleshas are the
five causes of suffering,

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:84%
like the root
causes of suffering.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.600 align:middle line:84%
And most of us who participate
in ordinary consciousness

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.060 align:middle line:84%
really like to assign
our suffering, the root

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.460 align:middle line:84%
cause of our suffering,
to something external.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's my boss.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's my mother-in-law.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's this traffic.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's the bad weather.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:40.630 align:middle line:90%
Those are the causes.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.210 align:middle line:84%
And it removes-- this is
where I think of honesty--

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:84%
it removes us and
our participation

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.140 align:middle line:90%
from the equation.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Where the Kleshas firmly put
that responsibility right back

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.020 align:middle line:84%
on your lap, right
into your plate.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:84%
So the five Kleshas
are-- the first one

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:84%
is considered the root Klesha,
or the root cause of suffering,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.910 align:middle line:84%
like the root of all
the other root causes.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:04.690 align:middle line:90%
The tap root, so to speak.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:84%
And it is "avidya,"
or ignorance.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And here, this is
not your IQ or what

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.270 align:middle line:84%
you've got on your SATs
or anything like that,

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.210 align:middle line:84%
but an ignorance that
is a deeper ignorance

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:90%
about the nature of things.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.730 align:middle line:84%
So if I were to give an example
of that kind of ignorance,

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.990 align:middle line:90%
it might be--

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.430 align:middle line:84%
well, consider our
relationship with nature.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.430 align:middle line:84%
So right there might be
an example of avidya.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And ignorance that every time I
use plastics, or my purchasing

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.990 align:middle line:84%
patterns and habits,
that these aren't having

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.240 align:middle line:90%
an impact on anybody else.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Or we underestimate the
impact that we're having

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.760 align:middle line:90%
on each other at all times.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:84%
So let's say you're in a
grocery store, you know,

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're maybe not
having a great day.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.070 align:middle line:84%
We forget that our thoughts,
our words, our actions

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.290 align:middle line:84%
are all having an impact
on the people that we

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.650 align:middle line:90%
share this Earth with.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
>> That one comes
up all the time.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.435 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:08.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the most
powerful things that we

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:84%
can do in any moment
to help to move

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.440 align:middle line:84%
through this
pattern of ignorance

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.920 align:middle line:84%
is to start to get in the
habit of asking ourselves,

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:90%
how am I affecting others?

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>> How are my choices
affecting not just me?

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.680 align:middle line:90%
All day long.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And let's be completely
honest about it--

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.800 align:middle line:90%
that's work.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That's work.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:90%
>> That's work.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.669 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot easier
to be ignorant.

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is why this
is one of those--

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.470 align:middle line:90%
>> And more painful.

00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, indeed.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> At the end of the day.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:39.919 align:middle line:84%
It might be hard to
look at these things.

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:40.919 align:middle line:84%
But the end of the day,
it's more difficult.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.909 align:middle line:90%
>> It's harder not too.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:90%
>> It's harder not to.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.049 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.630 align:middle line:84%
The second one is
also very interesting

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and tends to go under
the radar for most

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.680 align:middle line:90%
of us, the consciousness radar.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.600 align:middle line:90%
And it's "asmita."

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's this
misidentification of who

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I am with the
identity construct,

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.770 align:middle line:90%
or my personality construct.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.139 align:middle line:84%
So for me, you know,
I am Gina Caputo.

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I am the director of the
Colorado School of Yoga.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm a wife.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm a sister.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm a daughter.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.890 align:middle line:84%
I like hiking, and
blah blah, blah.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:09.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm a hiker.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, I give
all these labels,

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:84%
and I identify with those
labels rather than who I really

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.350 align:middle line:84%
am, which is bigger than
that, broader than that,

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:90%
deeper than that.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:24.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is a big
part of the work.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:84%
The reason it
causes suffering is

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.225 align:middle line:84%
because we get attached
to being these things.

00:09:30.225 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And I've seen it
in yoga, and I'm

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:84%
sure you have to,
when a person who

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.850 align:middle line:84%
is quite adept at the
physical practice,

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:39.980 align:middle line:84%
let's just say posture
practice, gets injured.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, who are you?

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.540 align:middle line:84%
You were known--
for example, you

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.000 align:middle line:84%
were known as this
person that could

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.320 align:middle line:90%
do these marvelous things.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden that's gone.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Now who are you?

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.940 align:middle line:90%
And you suffer.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And this goes for physical
appearance in general.

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's so big right
now in our society as well,

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:04.360 align:middle line:84%
which is who are we once this
physical body starts to break

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.770 align:middle line:90%
down, which it will?

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, that all of these
things are impermanent--

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.650 align:middle line:90%
who am I, really?

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, I really strongly identify
with my curly brown hair,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Or your job.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:16.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Or your job.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.970 align:middle line:90%
That's a great one.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's a
really common one.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.960 align:middle line:84%
When people retire,
then they have

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:90%
a bit of a identity crisis.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.980 align:middle line:84%
Who am I now that I
don't have this job?

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.420 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you one way--
this might seem silly,

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.540 align:middle line:84%
but I think it can
be very helpful--

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.260 align:middle line:90%
is to look at two things.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:84%
One is, what questions do you
ask when you meet someone?

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Because a very common
one is, what do you do?

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.346 align:middle line:90%
>> As if that was you.

00:10:39.346 --> 00:10:40.915 align:middle line:90%
The other would be very similar.

00:10:40.915 --> 00:10:46.630 align:middle line:84%
It would be how do you
respond to those questions?

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:90%
How do you introduce yourself?

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.510 align:middle line:84%
What's your own story and
narrative around who you are?

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:51.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:52.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm from here.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:90%
I have this many kids.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So something that
I've been playing

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:84%
with over the years is instead
of doing that question--

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.390 align:middle line:84%
that ubiquitous question
that everyone is expecting,

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.790 align:middle line:84%
like, oh, what do you do--
is I'll say something like,

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:05.201 align:middle line:90%
what fires you up?

00:11:05.201 --> 00:11:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of cool, because
there's this moment of like--

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.700 align:middle line:84%
[STAMMERING] like
I'm ready to say

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.400 align:middle line:84%
that I am a CEO of blah,
blah, blah, or whatever.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.290 align:middle line:90%
And then they have to like--

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:16.360 align:middle line:84%
and I'll say, no, no,
like, you know, what do you

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.276 align:middle line:90%
feel passionate about?

00:11:17.276 --> 00:11:18.400 align:middle line:90%
What excites you?

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's a small practice
of rewiring or rewriting

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:84%
this unconscious
behavior of identifying

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.880 align:middle line:84%
with these particular
things instead of speaking

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.470 align:middle line:84%
to the broader,
deeper who are you?

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:90%
That's so good.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:32.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:84%
>> So the third and fourth one
are like two sides of the same

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:38.340 align:middle line:90%
coin.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, these two--

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.790 align:middle line:84%
all the Kleshas, I
believe, are game-changers.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.430 align:middle line:84%
But these two, we're going
through them all day.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like we're flipping
this coin all day long.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And to a point you've
just made, this

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.810 align:middle line:84%
means that we can be in
practice all day long.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:54.610 align:middle line:90%
>> All the time.

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Not just when you're in
your approved stretchy pants

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.579 align:middle line:84%
or on your mat,
but all day long.

00:11:59.579 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
>> We'll talk about
conscious living.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.430 align:middle line:84%
It's being conscious,
aware, having

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.040 align:middle line:84%
intentionality around
everything that we're doing.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Not just in those minutes
that you're in a formal yoga

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.090 align:middle line:84%
So these next two are
"raga" and "dvesha,"

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:90%
or attachment and aversion.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And man, they show
up all the time.

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:20.350 align:middle line:90%
How about this-- we wake up.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:21.280 align:middle line:90%
We look outside.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.765 align:middle line:90%
It's a beautiful day.

00:12:22.765 --> 00:12:26.350 align:middle line:84%
Ah, beautiful day equals
good, equals me happy.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:27.250 align:middle line:90%
You wake up.

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:90%
It's a gray, stormy day.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Gray, stormy day equals
bad, equals me unhappy.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Those right there are examples
of attachment and aversion.

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:84%
That if it isn't the one I
want, the one that I'm either

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.740 align:middle line:84%
attached to, and it's the
one I'm averse to, I suffer.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.180 align:middle line:84%
But consider, is it the day
that's causing the suffering?

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Because I dare say,
there must be someone out

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.830 align:middle line:84%
there that sees a sunny
day and goes, oh no.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend, actually,
that means skin cancer to her.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.330 align:middle line:90%
So that's actually a bummer.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:00.400 align:middle line:90%
So could it possibly be the day?

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Or another way this
comes up constantly

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.980 align:middle line:84%
in yoga classes, like these
posture practice classes,

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.490 align:middle line:84%
is let's say maybe the
teacher asks you to do

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.560 align:middle line:90%
a posture that you dislike.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.540 align:middle line:84%
I remember, you know, every
time the teacher would say,

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.310 align:middle line:84%
put your hands alongside your
ears for Wheel, I'd go, ugh.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:90%
Now, is it Wheel?

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the woman next to me
is like, oh yes, my favorite.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, maybe it's the teacher,
because that's the next one we

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:25.530 align:middle line:90%
go to.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:27.010 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I can't stand this teacher.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> This terrible teacher
that doesn't understand me.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.163 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, she's the worst.

00:13:29.163 --> 00:13:29.546 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:29.546 --> 00:13:30.346 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:30.346 --> 00:13:33.190 align:middle line:90%
So consider that all day long.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Go to a restaurant, you have
this thing that you want.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.670 align:middle line:90%
It's your favorite dish.

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:38.320 align:middle line:84%
You go there every
Thursday, and you get it.

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Well, you got there on that
Thursday and, I don't know,

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:41.350 align:middle line:90%
they're closed.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Or you get there,
and they say, oh,

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.720 align:middle line:84%
we're out of the caprese
sandwich or whatever it is.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:90%
And we suffer.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.680 align:middle line:84%
We love to assign that suffering
to something else that's

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:53.480 align:middle line:90%
not us.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.000 align:middle line:90%
>> External for us.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Raga and dvesha give
us the opportunity to see

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.080 align:middle line:90%
you're choosing that.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.980 align:middle line:90%
You're choosing that.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.360 align:middle line:90%
You're choosing that attachment.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:90%
You're choosing that aversion.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So for this one, the way that I
try to work with this is really

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.540 align:middle line:84%
that I'm constantly aware
of those moments I feel both

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:84%
extremely jubilant and happy
that something went my way

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and the opposite of that-- those
times when I'm deeply angry

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.660 align:middle line:84%
or upset about something
that isn't going my way--

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and I say, ah,
attachment, ah, aversion.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:30.410 align:middle line:90%
Label it.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.305 align:middle line:84%
For me what it feels like is
I try to zoom out a little.

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:35.680 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's like you take
the camera-- you're in tight

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.680 align:middle line:84%
on this thing that you're
attached or averse to,

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:90%
and you kind of back it out.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Slowly loosen the grip, lady.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Like, I think I'm going to be
OK if I eat this other thing

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.860 align:middle line:84%
or if the day is not as
sunny as I would like.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.350 align:middle line:90%
So it takes a lot of discipline.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And to say, it's not that you
can't want something or desire

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:57.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's not to say
that we are never

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:06.370 align:middle line:84%
going to prefer certain
things and not other things.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.420 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:10.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reality of
being in this human body.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But does it govern our state
of suffering or happiness?

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:16.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Bingo.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:17.800 align:middle line:90%
Bingo.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.720 align:middle line:90%
It would be silly--

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I would never say,
it's all good.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:22.884 align:middle line:84%
I actually don't
care for that phrase.

00:15:22.884 --> 00:15:23.683 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:23.683 --> 00:15:24.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Like, I get it.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:84%
But I also don't care
for it, because it almost

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.190 align:middle line:84%
acts like I should
just accept everything.

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, in essence, yeah,
that would be nice.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:84%
But it removes
what you just said.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.240 align:middle line:84%
It's like, we are going
to have preferences.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.600 align:middle line:84%
The trick is, can
you have a preference

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and not be attached
to the outcome?

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Can you have a preference
and not be averse

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.660 align:middle line:90%
if it doesn't go your way?

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's this fine line.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:84%
So it goes back to
this discipline,

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.450 align:middle line:90%
where you have your preference.

00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:84%
You kind of soften
around the preference.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.680 align:middle line:84%
And so that when, if it doesn't
go the way that you prefer,

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.020 align:middle line:90%
you're OK.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:03.850 align:middle line:90%
You're OK.

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:04.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, really powerful.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.794 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is not moving that
you have the preference.

00:16:08.794 --> 00:16:10.710 align:middle line:84%
Just that you're OK if
it doesn't go that way.

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I love that that vision
of just a little bit of space

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.020 align:middle line:84%
around it, a little
bit of space.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Zoom out, yeah.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:17.590 align:middle line:90%
That's a good one.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:84%
So the last one,
the last Klesha,

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:84%
or root cause of suffering,
is called "abhinivesha."

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's either
like a fear of death

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.670 align:middle line:84%
or simply not acknowledging
that all humans are

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.060 align:middle line:84%
subject to this cycle of
beginning, middle, end.

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:35.010 align:middle line:90%
We all are subject to dying.

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
>> This one is very touchy
for the Western world.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:39.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't like to
talk about this.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:40.410 align:middle line:90%
>> No, we certainly don't.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And I think what makes me
sad about not acknowledging

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:48.355 align:middle line:84%
death in a healthy way is that
we live as if we won't die.

00:16:48.355 --> 00:16:49.155 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:49.155 --> 00:16:50.850 align:middle line:90%
And it's the one sure thing.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.460 align:middle line:90%
Indeed.

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:54.360 align:middle line:90%
It is the one sure thing.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we may
live in a way that

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.060 align:middle line:84%
squanders life, that
squanders opportunities,

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
acknowledging it.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:04.619 align:middle line:84%
Now obviously, you could
get obsessed with it.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And that might get a
little morose and morbid.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:84%
But that's why I say a healthy
relationship with it is really

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.579 align:middle line:84%
just acknowledging
it's inevitable.

00:17:12.579 --> 00:17:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So you know, a certain
amount of carpe diem--

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.910 align:middle line:84%
like us saying, I'm
going to do this.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to try this.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:24.199 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm not going to let
this thing dominate me,

00:17:24.199 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
find this workable.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I will die,
and life is short.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is where the sometimes
kind of sounds like, you know,

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.070 align:middle line:84%
foofy practices that
we hear sometimes

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.500 align:middle line:84%
in the modern world now, but
the practice of gratitude.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, that will drop
you in so quickly to be able

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.360 align:middle line:84%
to really connect with
the gratitude of, wow,

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:51.310 align:middle line:84%
look at these amazing people
around me that I get to speak

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.110 align:middle line:90%
to today.

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.745 align:middle line:84%
And the barrage of information
that we have all the time--

00:17:54.745 --> 00:17:55.620 align:middle line:90%
oh, I can't get this?

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Well now, I'm going
to move on to this.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of my
teachers always says

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.950 align:middle line:84%
we've lost the
power of daydreaming

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.520 align:middle line:84%
in our modern world, because we
never actually are just sitting

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.842 align:middle line:90%
anymore and kind of thinking.

00:18:06.842 --> 00:18:08.550 align:middle line:84%
We're on our phone
and then on this thing

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, always
doing something.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And I find that that is the
space where this abhinivesha

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:19.380 align:middle line:84%
gets really unpacked, because we
have this free time to actually

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:90%
be able to reflect on life.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And you make me think of a
practice that I try to be very

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:84%
diligent about doing with
regards to abhinivesha that I

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.540 align:middle line:90%
think is quite simple.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:84%
It requires that you take
a moment of time and space.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:36.540 align:middle line:84%
As you just said, the
busier our lives get,

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
the less we make time, or
prioritize time, to do this.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:84%
But one thing I try to do each
and every day and as soon as I

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
can upon waking-- so you know,
coming from the sleep state

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:90%
to the conscious awake state--

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.620 align:middle line:90%
is I try to have gratitude.

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I say this internally.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.005 align:middle line:84%
It may or may not
work for everybody.

00:18:56.005 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:90%
But I have gratitude.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:90%
I say, just this--

00:18:58.560 --> 00:18:59.590 align:middle line:90%
just this.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that
is, I woke up again.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:84%
Like, I feel the current
of life in me again today.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.330 align:middle line:84%
And I try to have a
root gratitude for that.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:11.010 align:middle line:90%
Let me just be clear.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:14.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm not grateful that everything
in my life is perfect today.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:19.320 align:middle line:84%
Because not a single day has
that actually felt the case.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.480 align:middle line:84%
It may be that my
health is a little off.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.520 align:middle line:84%
It may be that work is
a challenge right now.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:27.030 align:middle line:84%
It may be that I'm having some
challenges in relationships.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.430 align:middle line:84%
It may be that it's
not a nice day outside,

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:32.990 align:middle line:90%
or whatever the cause.

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:84%
I try to just say I'm
alive again today.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And that is like
this root gratitude

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.980 align:middle line:84%
that I think it's very
helpful to stay connected to.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.440 align:middle line:90%
It's simply that you're alive.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:84%
Not that your life has gone
perfectly, not that you're

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.790 align:middle line:90%
experiencing joy every moment--

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:52.300 align:middle line:84%
just that the life force
runs through you again today.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Amen to that.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's work, right?

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:84%
>> But it may be the most
important work you do.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.900 align:middle line:84%
We're always teaching
other people by example.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:90%
We're always leading by example.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.250 align:middle line:84%
No matter how
unimportant you might

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:07.560 align:middle line:84%
think you are in the
grand scheme of things,

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.290 align:middle line:84%
or the hierarchy, we are
all influencing each other

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.380 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So I would love to say
this work isn't easy.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But it may actually be the most
important work that you do.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.477 align:middle line:84%
>> And I've found that if you
can cultivate a curiosity about

00:20:19.477 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:90%
it--

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:23.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like a curiosity
about surfing the waves.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:24.060 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, it's not a
curiosity about how happy can I

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:27.690 align:middle line:90%
be, per se?

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.200 align:middle line:84%
But can you be curious
about surfing those waves,

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
climbing the mountains,
going down into the valleys--

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:90%
all of it?

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Hmm, this is interesting.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.380 align:middle line:90%
What's behind this?

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.416 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:20:39.416 --> 00:20:41.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So Gina, are you ready to
give us your top tips on how

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:46.200 align:middle line:84%
to work with these Kleshas and
these root causes of suffering

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.990 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of our
really busy lives?

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd love to.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.317 align:middle line:84%
So I always like to keep
things as simple as possible.

00:20:53.317 --> 00:20:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So I've come up with
three tips that I

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:84%
think are really
workable if you want

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.805 align:middle line:84%
to jump onto the path of
working with the Kleshas

00:20:59.805 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and these unconscious
behaviors that may be the root

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.830 align:middle line:90%
causes of your suffering.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.990 align:middle line:84%
So my first suggestion is
really my top suggestion,

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the most
powerful tip I can offer you,

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
which is to embrace a
meditation practice.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, I feel like we set
ourselves up for disappointment

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.010 align:middle line:84%
when we think of meditation
as being a state where

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.630 align:middle line:90%
your mind is completely empty.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.280 align:middle line:90%
It's just a mental void.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And you just feel
blissful and happy.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
We set ourselves
up for frustration,

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.090 align:middle line:84%
because that's rarely what
meditation feels like.

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Most of the time, it's
something like you sit.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:90%
You focus on your breath.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:90%
Your mind wanders.

00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:36.750 align:middle line:90%
You come back.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.370 align:middle line:84%
Over and over again,
though, we tend

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.500 align:middle line:84%
to get a little
frustrated with that.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:84%
What if we looked at meditation,
not as an opportunity

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.650 align:middle line:84%
to simply empty your
mind, but become

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
more aware of your mind and
the patterns of your mind?

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I like to think of meditation
as a chance for you

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:90%
to cultivate the inner witness.

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.850 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I am able to
track the activity of my mind.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:03.600 align:middle line:84%
In psychology, they call
this the onboard observer.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.550 align:middle line:84%
So then meditation
might look like--

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:06.420 align:middle line:90%
I sit.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I focus on my breath.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.795 align:middle line:90%
My mind wanders.

00:22:09.795 --> 00:22:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Ah, I become aware that my mind
is no longer in the present.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:84%
My mind is no
longer on my breath.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:19.020 align:middle line:84%
This little practice
that seems like it's not

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.760 align:middle line:84%
that big of a deal
and what impact

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:22.380 align:middle line:90%
does that have on my life?

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I'll tell you-- it
trains up your awareness.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you're caught in
the throes of attachment

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and aversion, for example,
you might be able to say,

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.750 align:middle line:90%
ah, I'm attached to this.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm causing my own suffering.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:39.480 align:middle line:84%
My second tip is related
to your whole being.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So where meditation may be
largely mentally focused work.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.810 align:middle line:84%
I'd recommend that
you look for ways

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:48.880 align:middle line:84%
to use your body in
this practice as well.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.780 align:middle line:84%
Now maybe obviously,
yoga posture practice

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:84%
is a great opportunity
for building the stamina

00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:00.060 align:middle line:84%
to persevere and stay with this
challenging, long-term work.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:01.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's not the
only way to do it.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:06.180 align:middle line:84%
I know many people that use
cycling, running, hiking,

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.180 align:middle line:84%
really any activity
that brings you

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.030 align:middle line:84%
either to the edge
of your comfort zone

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.870 align:middle line:84%
or starts to expand your
comfort zone by challenging

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:17.230 align:middle line:90%
your comfort zone.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
opportunities to witness things

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.710 align:middle line:84%
like attachment
and aversion arise

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.280 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of something you're
doing with your entire body.

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And my last tip is
going to really work

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.800 align:middle line:84%
for some of us, which
is to log your journey.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And as part of that, to also
relax around your process.

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And maybe logging it will really
support you in doing that.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.870 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by logging
here is journal.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Any time of day-- this
needn't be a long entry--

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.180 align:middle line:84%
but any time of
day, you could be

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.580 align:middle line:84%
making little notes
of observations that

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.220 align:middle line:90%
have percolated up within you.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And I like that
this also gives you

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:90%
a written history of yourself.

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:00.570 align:middle line:84%
In some ways, you're writing
a guidebook for yourself.

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:02.940 align:middle line:90%
You are acting as your own guru.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So if your goal is
to start to rewrite

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.890 align:middle line:84%
these unconscious behaviors,
what if you literally

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
wrote down the unconscious
behaviors that you observed?

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:15.780 align:middle line:84%
I feel like it would give
you a real clear map on how

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.220 align:middle line:90%
to change these behaviors.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.630 align:middle line:84%
So as I said before,
let's make no mistake

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.710 align:middle line:84%
in thinking that
this work is quick--

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.010 align:middle line:90%
that it's easy.

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:26.710 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's very
challenging work.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:29.200 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, it's
helpful to acknowledge

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:84%
because we're always teaching
and leading others by example,

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.190 align:middle line:84%
because we're embracing
the responsibility

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:84%
for our own happiness,
it may actually

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.560 align:middle line:84%
be the most important
work you ever do.
