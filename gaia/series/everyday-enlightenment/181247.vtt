00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Hey, I'm Ashleigh Sergeant,
and welcome to "Everyday

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.330 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment."

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:10%
This is your go-to show
that offers practical tips

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.680 align:middle line:10%
from expert guests at the
end of every episode designed

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.050 align:middle line:10%
to help you be more
conscious in the midst

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.970 align:middle line:10%
of your busy modern life.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.430 align:middle line:84%
The quest for living a
spiritually empowered life

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:84%
can often seem at odds with
the demands of a person

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.170 align:middle line:90%
in the modern world.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle line:84%
But aspirations like
always being at peace

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.600 align:middle line:84%
or being happy all of
the time are not really

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.720 align:middle line:84%
the true spiritual goals
of most traditions.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:10%
My guest today is
Dr. Paul Dugliss,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.560 align:middle line:10%
an M.D. of Internal Medicine,
a qualified practitioner

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:10%
of acupuncture and
traditional Chinese medicine.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:84%
He also holds a master's
degree in clinical psychology.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.940 align:middle line:84%
With his unique blend of Eastern
and Western medical knowledge,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Dugliss finds
his current practice

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.040 align:middle line:84%
of Ayurvedic medicine
and spiritual counseling

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.050 align:middle line:90%
to be the most rewarding.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:84%
He is the author of
many books, including

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.590 align:middle line:84%
"Ayurveda, The Power to Heal,"
"Enlightened Nutrition,"

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
"Patanjali in the Light,"
and "Think with the Heart,

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:90%
Love with the Mind."

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Dugliss, thanks so much
for being here with me today.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very welcome.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So how do you see these
unrealistic spiritual

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.910 align:middle line:84%
aspirations manifesting
in your practice?

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I see them all the time.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.230 align:middle line:10%
And I think what
happens is that we

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.390 align:middle line:10%
get into this misconception,
this mistake when it comes

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.840 align:middle line:10%
to inner development
where we're mistaking

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.790 align:middle line:10%
the end for the means,
where we see somebody who's

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.470 align:middle line:10%
very peaceful and say, oh, OK,
the way to get there is for me

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:10%
to try to be
peaceful, or where we

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.900 align:middle line:10%
see somebody who's very
unattached and very blissful--

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.460 align:middle line:10%
oh, OK, so I'll try
to be unattached,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:10%
I'll try to be blissful
and that will get me there.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And what we don't
understand is that

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
what's happening for that
individual is the results

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.330 align:middle line:90%
of their inner state.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not the means
to that inner state.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.880 align:middle line:84%
It's the result of
the inner development.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So we don't just meditate
or think about being happy

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.910 align:middle line:84%
or just aspire to be
peaceful all the time

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.810 align:middle line:84%
as our actual practice to
get us towards inner peace.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I
think the other tragedy

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
that I see is that people
don't understand that there are

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.510 align:middle line:84%
different paths for different
people and that a lot of people

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.200 align:middle line:84%
get drawn to the
ascetic traditions.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
They get drawn to this
concept of non-attachment,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.300 align:middle line:84%
and they try to
move towards that

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.900 align:middle line:84%
and don't realize that
it may not fit for them,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.720 align:middle line:84%
that there are
very few people who

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.300 align:middle line:84%
are designed to be monks,
who are designed to be away

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:84%
from society, designed
to be away from family,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and that there actually
is a whole set of paths

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.570 align:middle line:90%
for the householder.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.880 align:middle line:84%
Can you tell us a little bit
about how the ascetic path

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.340 align:middle line:84%
manifested or what are some
of the components of it

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.150 align:middle line:84%
in traditional yoga
traditions versus some

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
of the different qualities
or different techniques

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.460 align:middle line:90%
of the householder path?

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.380 align:middle line:84%
>> The ascetic path, the monk's
path, is based on letting go.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:90%
It's actually based on loss.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:90%
You move to the ashram.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.790 align:middle line:90%
You get away from society.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.710 align:middle line:90%
You lose connection to society.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:90%
You lose connection to wealth.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.960 align:middle line:90%
You lose distractions.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> And you give up family.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And you give up family.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:90%
You give up relationships.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And the focus is continually
on letting go, loss, letting

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:84%
go, loss, less,
less, less, less,

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.100 align:middle line:84%
until there's nothing
left, until you finally

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.070 align:middle line:90%
connect to your true self.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.779 align:middle line:84%
The householder path is
based on fulfillment.

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It's almost the opposite
where we're cultivating

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:90%
the qualities of the heart.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.980 align:middle line:84%
We're cultivating
that inner bliss.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
We're cultivating
fulfillment to the point

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.540 align:middle line:90%
where we're unaffected.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.600 align:middle line:90%
We're not attached.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.480 align:middle line:84%
There's this analogy that I
love to use with my students

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
that it's like walking
down the streets

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and having your
wallet pickpocketed.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.890 align:middle line:84%
If you're a billionaire,
it's like you've

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.300 align:middle line:84%
got so much in the bank, you've
got so much fullness within,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
you have so many resources
that it doesn't affect you.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
If you're poor and your wallet
has your last money and that's

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.210 align:middle line:84%
your last meal, it's
incredibly stressful.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.240 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, the
state of peace,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:84%
the state of non-attachment
for the householder

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.630 align:middle line:90%
comes from fulfillment.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.480 align:middle line:84%
>> How does fulfillment relate
to something like gratitude?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Or instead of letting
go and releasing

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:84%
and having to let go and
free and rid ourselves

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:84%
of all of these
things as if they're

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.320 align:middle line:84%
these shameful
tarnishes that we must

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.000 align:middle line:84%
get rid of because
they're our humanity

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.416 align:middle line:84%
and they're just terrible, and
if we get rid of them, then

00:05:38.416 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
we may ascend, but,
rather, what I'm

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.640 align:middle line:84%
hearing you say is it's
more of a cultivation

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.060 align:middle line:84%
of different aspects
of our awareness

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:84%
or different aspects
of presence, namely

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:84%
the experience of fulfillment,
which I'm automatically

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:90%
connecting to gratitude.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.770 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's a great connection.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a little tricky in
that often gratitude comes,

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:90%
again, from that fullness.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And so trying to force
it, that's not natural.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think the thing that
you said that's really key

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.200 align:middle line:84%
is it comes through
cultivation of awareness.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
But what we don't realize is
that, within our own awareness,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.280 align:middle line:84%
we have all these
potentials, and it's

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
through the cultivation
of awareness,

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.870 align:middle line:84%
and not just being
aware of things,

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.630 align:middle line:84%
but cultivation of
consciousness itself,

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.030 align:middle line:84%
that really is the foundation of
our fulfillment, the foundation

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.530 align:middle line:84%
of our evolution, our
growth, and, ultimately,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.590 align:middle line:90%
the foundation of our health.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I love that because I
remember when I first started

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.080 align:middle line:84%
on this path and I first
started reading, like,

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Patanjali's "Yoga Sutras," which
I know you have a book on, I

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.080 align:middle line:84%
just remember reading
some of them and thinking,

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:84%
this sounds really kind of
impossible when it was being

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.820 align:middle line:84%
translated to me as, oh, well,
you have to give up all these

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:04.620 align:middle line:90%
attachments.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.161 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
completely-- you can't

00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:07.920 align:middle line:90%
have any violent thoughts.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.060 align:middle line:84%
These concepts
seemed really lofty,

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:84%
and it kind of brought
up some of the struggles

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.661 align:middle line:84%
of my own humanity, which
I've had this conversation

00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
with others of like, oh my
god, am I ever really going

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do that?

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So if we're not trying
to, if we're not

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.830 align:middle line:84%
taking the ascetic
path and we're not

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.320 align:middle line:84%
trying to just release and
let go everything in order

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
to attain these
qualities or this state,

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.050 align:middle line:84%
how is it that the householder
path actually relates to things

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:84%
or teaches us to relate to
qualities of our humanity

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.290 align:middle line:90%
like emotions and relationships?

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're really talking
about the relationship to life

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.570 align:middle line:90%
and all aspects of it.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And too often what happens
when we're challenged

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:90%
is that we go into resistance.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.090 align:middle line:90%
We resist the anger.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we're not supposed to be--

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:03.450 align:middle line:90%
we're supposed to be peaceful.

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:04.825 align:middle line:84%
We're not supposed
to be violent.

00:08:04.825 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:84%
We resist the challenge,
the physical challenge.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.080 align:middle line:90%
We resist the disease.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.160 align:middle line:90%
We resist.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.750 align:middle line:84%
And when we live in
resistance, that's

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:20.320 align:middle line:84%
when we actually create
more of the suffering.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the way out is
actually a combination

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:31.170 align:middle line:90%
of cultivating consciousness.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:84%
It's also cultivating the
qualities of the heart.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:46.170 align:middle line:84%
It's also cultivating and
reprogramming the mind such

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:51.120 align:middle line:84%
that we relate to life in
a totally different way.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And let me just explain
this with a question

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:84%
that I often pose
to my students.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:03.630 align:middle line:84%
If you knew every challenge,
every problem in your life,

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.720 align:middle line:84%
every experience in
your life was organized

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:84%
by your soul for your
learning and growth,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.120 align:middle line:84%
that you actually planned
it before this life,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:90%
how would your life change?

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.810 align:middle line:84%
How would your relationship
to life change?

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And what I hear from
them is, oh my gosh,

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:84%
if I really knew that, if
I really accepted that,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.910 align:middle line:90%
then I would drop the worry.

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:32.290 align:middle line:90%
I would drop the resistance.

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:90%
I would begin to embrace life.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd begin to embrace
every moment of life.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.220 align:middle line:84%
And so the key to
be able to have

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that kind of radical
acceptance and to really

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.100 align:middle line:84%
be embracing of life is
built on a foundation of,

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.190 align:middle line:84%
first, cultivating the nervous
system through meditation,

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.960 align:middle line:84%
through a type of
meditation that

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.190 align:middle line:84%
gives the mind rest, that
allows us to go beyond thought

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.840 align:middle line:90%
and feeling and sensation.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.230 align:middle line:84%
It's based, then, on integrating
what we gain in the meditation

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.500 align:middle line:90%
into every moment of the life.

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's accelerated
by practices

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.590 align:middle line:84%
that allow us to come
into the heart, that

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:84%
allow us to connect
with and integrate

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:84%
that true self through the
heart and the heart's love.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.400 align:middle line:84%
>> If we could just touch for
a moment on this misconception

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that people have that we're
essentially stopping the mind

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:35.920 align:middle line:84%
completely because-- and if I
can just get the mind to stop,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.867 align:middle line:84%
then I will somehow, I don't
know, be more enlightened.

00:10:38.867 --> 00:10:40.450 align:middle line:84%
But can you talk a
little bit on here?

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I know you have your--
like, good luck with that.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.520 align:middle line:84%
One of my teacher
says, your mind

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.625 align:middle line:84%
is an organ that
secretes thought.

00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:49.367 align:middle line:84%
It's just never going
to stop doing that.

00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:50.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you could just
talk a little bit

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.050 align:middle line:84%
about-- because I know
you have your book

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.660 align:middle line:84%
"Think with the Heart,
Love with the Mind."

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.740 align:middle line:84%
You talk a little bit about
the relationship between--

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I like how you put it--
giving the mind rest

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:84%
and how that
relates to beginning

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.580 align:middle line:84%
to think more or be
embodied with this presence

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:90%
more of the heart space.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:15.080 align:middle line:84%
So there are two
important aspects.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:21.555 align:middle line:84%
One has to do with a difference,
a distinction between quietism

00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:25.080 align:middle line:84%
where we stop thinking
and where we actually

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.830 align:middle line:90%
go into pure consciousness.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.000 align:middle line:84%
And the easiest way to go
into pure consciousness

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.450 align:middle line:84%
is through absorption,
being absorbed

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:84%
in something that's
blissful, often a sound,

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:43.050 align:middle line:84%
being absorbed in a
sound that carries us

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:90%
to that pure consciousness.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:48.810 align:middle line:84%
That's very different
than stopping the mind.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:49.842 align:middle line:90%
So this is--

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the
mind's still there--

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:51.770 align:middle line:90%
>> The mind's still there.

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:52.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's probably
still thinking.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.130 align:middle line:84%
We're just not
really immersed in--

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So what this allows us to do
is to shift our identification

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
As we experience more and
more the pure consciousness,

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.030 align:middle line:84%
we begin to shift
our identification,

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.390 align:middle line:84%
not so much with the
thoughts or with the emotions

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:90%
or with the body.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.520 align:middle line:84%
We begin to recognize
our true self.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And there is a very
important integration

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:84%
that needs to take place
of that pure consciousness

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.400 align:middle line:90%
with the emotions.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:84%
Again, just like--
an enlightened person

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:39.000 align:middle line:90%
still has thoughts.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.760 align:middle line:84%
An enlightened person
still has emotions.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Most people don't
recognize that.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.440 align:middle line:84%
Again, they're not
attached to the emotions.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:84%
They're not identified
with the emotions.

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And really, one of
the quickest ways

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:84%
to come to this integration
is through cultivating

00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the qualities of the heart that
happens as we cultivate more

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:84%
consciousness, as
we put our attention

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:90%
more on the core of the heart.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:13.080 align:middle line:84%
What most people associate
with the heart is some emotion.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.200 align:middle line:90%
But there's more to it.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.610 align:middle line:90%
There are subtler levels to it.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:22.620 align:middle line:84%
Those subtler levels really
key into things like intuition.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.480 align:middle line:84%
The subtler levels
of the heart key

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
into the subtle senses and
the ability to perceive energy

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:30.520 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.730 align:middle line:84%
The subtle aspects
and even beyond that,

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.560 align:middle line:84%
the core of the heart,
is really a window

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:84%
into that infinite pure
consciousness that we are.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:90%
And so we need both.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:84%
We need an effortless
meditation practice,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and then we need a practice
during the day that

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:52.210 align:middle line:84%
allows us to connect to
the core of the heart

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:56.880 align:middle line:84%
and to approach things that
arise from that, to approach

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.920 align:middle line:84%
accepting and
loving what arises,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.790 align:middle line:90%
accepting the challenge.

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:05.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh OK, I get this bad news.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I accept this
challenge that my soul

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.010 align:middle line:84%
arranged this for my
growth, for my wellness,

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:16.230 align:middle line:90%
for something positive.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:21.270 align:middle line:84%
And I find the positive
quality of love to meet that.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's through that
meeting of the challenge,

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
through developing
that quality of love

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:31.320 align:middle line:84%
that we really
fulfill the purpose

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:90%
of the experiences of life.

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have
these experiences?

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.210 align:middle line:84%
These experiences are
cultivating our divinity.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:84%
They're cultivating
that quality of love

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:84%
that is needed within us for
our growth and development.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, actually, all of life,
rather than being resisted

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:53.400 align:middle line:84%
or for us trying
to transcend and go

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:84%
beyond all the problems,
what life is calling out

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:84%
for us to do is to find
within us the divinity that's

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.480 align:middle line:90%
needed to meet that.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And in doing that, we begin
to realize that life is really

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.850 align:middle line:90%
courting our love.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:84%
The experiences of life
is the divine courting

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.730 align:middle line:90%
us and our heart's love.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:28.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I love that because it's kind
of the opposite of this feeling

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.440 align:middle line:84%
of lack or this feeling of
I have to rid myself of all

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
of these things, and really
it's the challenge is actually

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.950 align:middle line:84%
becoming bigger and more
vast and more loving and more

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:45.390 align:middle line:84%
accepting and more trusting
with life, with someone else,

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:50.400 align:middle line:84%
with food, with ourselves, that
actually it's this invitation

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:56.400 align:middle line:84%
from our highest nature
to expand and to actually

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.840 align:middle line:84%
recognize that and be in an
intimate relationship with

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:04.890 align:middle line:84%
whatever is arising as opposed
to having to get past it or be

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:05.910 align:middle line:90%
above it.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautifully said.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.030 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly this relationship.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So again, the
householders-- it's

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.160 align:middle line:84%
all about relationship,
relationship to life,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:84%
relationship to others,
relationship to emotion,

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and having that ability in that
to rise up, to loving what is,

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:90%
loving what is.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:33.114 align:middle line:84%
And then it's easy to be present
because you love each moment.

00:16:33.114 --> 00:16:35.280 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're not trying
to push anything else away.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.830 align:middle line:84%
>> You're not trying to push
things away, not at all.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.900 align:middle line:84%
But again, I get a little
bit ahead of myself

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.470 align:middle line:90%
in that we need the foundation.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:84%
We need the cultivation
of consciousness.

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
We do need that
effortless meditation that

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
gives the mind a rest to
cultivate our nervous system

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:57.330 align:middle line:84%
and its ability to identify more
with the pure consciousness.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.310 align:middle line:90%
So we do need that.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.635 align:middle line:90%
But what's missing from--

00:17:00.635 --> 00:17:01.760 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't just show up.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.010 align:middle line:90%
We actually--

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:90%
>> It doesn't just show up.

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:03.600 align:middle line:84%
>> --do have to
still do practices--

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.215 align:middle line:90%
>> We do have to do something.

00:17:04.215 --> 00:17:05.115 align:middle line:90%
>> --and cultivate something.

00:17:05.115 --> 00:17:05.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:06.970 align:middle line:90%
We do have to do something.

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:13.260 align:middle line:84%
And what's been missing, I feel,
is the technique or techniques

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.250 align:middle line:90%
to then integrate that.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:18.750 align:middle line:84%
So again, it's not just,
well, my spirituality

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:84%
is that I meditate
and that's it.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.220 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.569 align:middle line:84%
Again, there's a wholeness
that is being brought forth

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:29.470 align:middle line:84%
because this is the
need of the time.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:31.890 align:middle line:84%
It really is the need
of the time for us

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.110 align:middle line:84%
to have a householder
path, a path that

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
allows us to experience
the fullness of life,

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
to experience all that life has
to offer and recognize that it

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.570 align:middle line:90%
is the fastest growth possible.

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.810 align:middle line:84%
It's faster than
going to the ashram.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:51.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:52.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So would you show us a
meditation practice that helps

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:84%
to cultivate the heart and helps
to expand consciousness to lay

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:03.490 align:middle line:90%
this foundation?

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:04.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.440 align:middle line:90%
I'd love to.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:84%
I would call it kind of a guided
meditation or a contemplation

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.270 align:middle line:90%
almost.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.444 align:middle line:90%
>> I call it heart centering.

00:18:13.444 --> 00:18:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And so this heart centering
practice, I think,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.710 align:middle line:90%
can be very valuable.

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:84%
So I ask everybody
to close their eyes.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.300 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
start with, first,

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:28.980 align:middle line:84%
an instruction to honor
whatever you feel.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:84%
Don't expect, because we're
dealing with the heart,

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
that you should be
feeling love or joy.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
Whatever comes comes,
and we'll work with that.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.720 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is
going on a journey

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.600 align:middle line:84%
to explore what is actually
there in the core of our heart.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.310 align:middle line:84%
So first start by attending
to the physical layer,

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:56.010 align:middle line:84%
to the physical sensation
at the center of the chest,

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:84%
underneath the mid
sternum, paying attention

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:12.270 align:middle line:84%
to any tension, any sensation
that is in the physical area,

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and just observing, just paying
attention without evaluation.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:26.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to
go a step more subtle

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to pay
attention to the energy

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:90%
in this area, the energy.

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.500 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's a sense of warmth.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.250 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's a sense of flow.

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a
sense of expansion.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:84%
What energy do you
sense in this area?

00:19:52.620 --> 00:20:05.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And going a step
more subtle, we're

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.700 align:middle line:84%
going to go to the
emotional layer.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Maybe when you put
your attention here,

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:16.735 align:middle line:90%
you feel some emotion.

00:20:16.735 --> 00:20:19.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:90%
Just be innocent.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.610 align:middle line:84%
Experience whatever it
is, whatever emotion

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.050 align:middle line:90%
arises for you.

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Don't get into analyzing it
or telling a story about it.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Just feel what is present.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.710 align:middle line:90%
Just be present to this emotion.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:45.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:48.095 align:middle line:84%
And notice, as you attend
to it, what happens.

00:20:48.095 --> 00:20:56.250 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, sometimes
there may be, as we

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.500 align:middle line:84%
go even deeper inward,
yet another emotion

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:90%
underneath that one.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
So ask, is there
something deeper?

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And let yourself go more
in towards the core.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Imagine this emotion that you
experience first as a layer

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:23.300 align:middle line:84%
and see if there is something
layered underneath it.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.050 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:31.170 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there was some
hurt underneath it.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:34.070 align:middle line:90%
You'll discover some fear.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:38.500 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is, just be with it.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Accept it.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.570 align:middle line:90%
Don't analyze.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:44.944 align:middle line:90%
Just feel the sensations of it.

00:21:44.944 --> 00:21:55.720 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going
to go even further

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:06.060 align:middle line:84%
inward beyond the emotions to
the subtlest, finest feeling

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.250 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.960 align:middle line:84%
There may be a
feeling of expansion.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.550 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.665 align:middle line:84%
There may be just
the sense of a void.

00:22:16.665 --> 00:22:19.290 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:26.230 align:middle line:84%
There may be some
subtle blissfulness.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:30.388 align:middle line:90%


00:22:30.388 --> 00:22:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Just explore whatever is there.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.060 align:middle line:84%
And if you expected
to feel some love

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:52.620 align:middle line:84%
and you experienced
some space, just a void,

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.830 align:middle line:90%
that's perfectly fine.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's some dots
of light within a void.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Feel into those.

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:05.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you're
experiencing, notice

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:84%
that, at this subtle
level, it's not dead.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a liveliness
even in the spaciousness.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:25.650 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And now allow yourself
to go as deep as you can.

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:39.630 align:middle line:90%


00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:45.525 align:middle line:84%
At this core of the
heart, you'll find peace.

00:23:45.525 --> 00:23:49.060 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:56.470 align:middle line:84%
At this core, you may experience
some joy or some subtle bliss.

00:23:56.470 --> 00:24:01.240 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your experience
is, know it's perfect.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:11.880 align:middle line:90%
This is the true self.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:90%
This is your being.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:84%
This is what resides at
the core of the true heart.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is always
available to you.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:24.990 align:middle line:90%
This is always with you.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:29.610 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:35.640 align:middle line:84%
This is always your essence
and nothing can touch it.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can change it.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.010 align:middle line:90%
It's always available to you.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And if you do this practice
of coming to the true heart,

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:54.150 align:middle line:84%
if you do this heart centering
practice periodically

00:24:54.150 --> 00:24:57.990 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day,
you'll find that you

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:04.630 align:middle line:84%
can meet whatever life brings
with this peace, with this joy,

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:90%
with this bliss.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:11.130 align:middle line:84%
You can rapidly integrate
this into the way

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:90%
you relate to life.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.070 align:middle line:90%


00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:16.150 align:middle line:90%
So carry this.

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.020 align:middle line:90%
Make this a practice.

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.870 align:middle line:90%
Be easy with it.

00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:20.740 align:middle line:90%
And be blessed.

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:29.260 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:31.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so much
for that practice.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:84%
So powerful to have that as a
tool for cultivating the heart

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.350 align:middle line:84%
space and, most
importantly, like you

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.920 align:middle line:84%
said, bringing into every
day and really feeling

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.040 align:middle line:84%
that this presence
is with us always.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So thank you so
much for sharing.

00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:48.640 align:middle line:84%
It's always great
to talk with you.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.520 align:middle line:90%
>> You're very welcome.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.200 align:middle line:90%
It's been a joy.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And thanks so
much for joining us.

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.980 align:middle line:90%
I will see you next time.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.730 align:middle line:90%
