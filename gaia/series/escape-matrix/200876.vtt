[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, and welcome to this
new series with Gaia of 13

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.190 align:middle line:10%
programs in which I'm
basically going to chat.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:10%
Chat about the last
30 years of compiling

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.670 align:middle line:10%
extraordinary information
across a vast range of subjects.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to connect
those subjects in this series,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.587 align:middle line:90%
and that is so, so important.

00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:46.220 align:middle line:90%


00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.300 align:middle line:84%
What we lack almost all
the time is context.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
You see a world event,
you see it happening,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.410 align:middle line:84%
you see something that
happens in your life.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to look at these
things as in and of themselves.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
And so we try to get
clarity about them

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.670 align:middle line:90%
by just looking at them alone.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:84%
But what I've learned
over the last 30 years

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.970 align:middle line:84%
over and over again is
that the real truth,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.730 align:middle line:84%
the real understanding comes
when you connect the dots,

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:90%
you connect the events.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And when you put
an individual event

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.210 align:middle line:84%
in context of its connections
to many others, then

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.980 align:middle line:84%
suddenly that event starts
to look very, very different

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
than it did when you just
looked at it in and of itself.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And so in terms of my
life, the relationship

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.360 align:middle line:84%
between the perceived
normal, what

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.820 align:middle line:84%
I would call the
human normal, this

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.520 align:middle line:84%
is the normal that is nothing
more than a construct.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.260 align:middle line:84%
It's taught in schools
and universities.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.510 align:middle line:84%
It's what the mainstream
media pound out 24/7.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:84%
It's what you get through
mainstream science

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
and mainstream medicine
and mainstream academia.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And basically, it is a
version of life, reality--

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:84%
everything that has
been constructed.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:84%
But because it's
now termed normal,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.820 align:middle line:84%
people tend to believe that
anything outside of that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:90%
must therefore not be normal.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.520 align:middle line:90%
And you have to give events--

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.680 align:middle line:84%
happenings that
can't be explained

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.300 align:middle line:84%
by human normal another tag
name called the paranormal.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, as my life
experience has shown me,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:84%
the paranormal is the
normal and the human normal

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:90%
is the illusion.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.710 align:middle line:84%
So in just going through
some main points in my life

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
here in this first program,
you'll perhaps see how--

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:84%
while we trot through
life apparently

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.930 align:middle line:84%
within the bounds of human
normal, the paranormal--

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.650 align:middle line:84%
the real normal-- is actually
interacting and intercepting

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.920 align:middle line:90%
with events all the time.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
I was born in a place called
Leicester in the English

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Midlands, and I was born into
what they call in Britain

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:90%
a working class background.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.590 align:middle line:84%
And so I went through
school and just got by.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't academically terribly
bright because I really

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:90%
wasn't bothered.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.070 align:middle line:84%
But what I thought
my life was about

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.230 align:middle line:84%
was to be a
professional footballer.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:90%
That was my ambition as a kid.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And I would say
this to anyone who

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.990 align:middle line:84%
maybe comes from
a background that

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.050 align:middle line:84%
just doesn't have
a lot of money,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have a lot of
apparent opportunity--

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:41.620 align:middle line:84%
don't you think for a
second that you cannot have

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.780 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinary
life, because you can.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.380 align:middle line:84%
Because, as we'll
explore in this series,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.380 align:middle line:84%
you are really the
one in control of it,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and taking back that control
is what freedom really means.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.890 align:middle line:84%
So I had this ambition to be a
professional footballer, which

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
drove me through my
childhood, and a series

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.430 align:middle line:84%
of synchronous stick bits
a lock allowed me to be

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:90%
a professional footballer.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.960 align:middle line:90%
But in the first few years--

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm still a teenager, I got--

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.170 align:middle line:84%
rheumatoid arthritis
came out of nowhere

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:90%
and my career ended at 21.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And then I went on to be
a journalist, a newspaper

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.870 align:middle line:84%
journalist and a
radio journalist,

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.170 align:middle line:84%
and then I became a national
television presenter

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.420 align:middle line:84%
for the BBC out of
London in sport and news.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.752 align:middle line:84%
And you think then, well, OK,
well this is my life, then.

00:05:50.752 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be in the media.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
But then my life said hello
and welcome to the paranormal,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:84%
and it entered my life
in an extraordinary way.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:84%
I also, by the way, became
a national spokesman

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.490 align:middle line:84%
for the British
Green Party, and I

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
went from joining the
party as a local member

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.190 align:middle line:84%
to being a national
spokesman within weeks.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
During 1989, while I was
working for the Green Party

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:84%
and working for the BBC,
I had this feeling--

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and it got more
and more tangible--

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.857 align:middle line:84%
that when I was in a room
alone, I wasn't alone.

00:06:41.857 --> 00:06:43.440 align:middle line:84%
It was like there
was something there,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.070 align:middle line:90%
there was a presence there.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't into
any of this stuff.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.780 align:middle line:90%
I've never met a psychic--

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.820 align:middle line:84%
and I was open to it,
I didn't dismiss it,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:90%
but I just never got into it.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So I'm bemused, because I'm
feeling this presence more

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.800 align:middle line:90%
and more powerfully.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:84%
And then as 1989
became 1990, I suddenly

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.180 align:middle line:84%
had this extraordinary
experience

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:84%
which launched me on a
road that led to this seat

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:23.380 align:middle line:90%
now as I'm talking to you.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.832 align:middle line:84%
I was with my son
in a place called

00:07:25.832 --> 00:07:28.040 align:middle line:84%
Ryde where I live on a place
called the Isle of Wight

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.160 align:middle line:84%
at the South Coast
of England, and we

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.840 align:middle line:84%
were going to have some
lunch, my son Gareth.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Big strapping singer/songwriter
now, little boy then.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we went to this cafe
area near a railway station,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.960 align:middle line:84%
and a railway worker
came out and started

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.575 align:middle line:84%
talking to me about sport cause
he knew me off the television.

00:07:50.575 --> 00:07:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And then when that
conversation was finished,

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.782 align:middle line:84%
I realized that
Gareth was not there,

00:07:54.782 --> 00:07:55.990 align:middle line:90%
but I knew where he would be.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:00.340 align:middle line:84%
He'll be in the news shop,
little newspaper shop

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.390 align:middle line:90%
next to the station.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.310 align:middle line:90%
So I went in there, he was.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So I'm standing at the door,
and the atmosphere changed,

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:10.880 align:middle line:90%
that's all I can say.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.610 align:middle line:84%
The atmosphere
around me changed.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:20.330 align:middle line:84%
Now what I now realized was
happening with the greater

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.900 align:middle line:84%
understanding of the
passage of experience

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:26.240 align:middle line:84%
is that what I was
experiencing was

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:84%
an electromagnetic
field of some kind

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.080 align:middle line:90%
had just basically engulfed me.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.130 align:middle line:90%
And then my feet began to burn.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.935 align:middle line:84%
It was like two magnets were
pulling the feet to the ground,

00:08:40.935 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't move my feet.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.930 align:middle line:90%
And then I heard--

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:84%
it wasn't a voice, it was
like a very strong thoughtful

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.100 align:middle line:84%
which said, go and
look at the books

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:84%
on the far side, which just
passed through my mind.

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm standing
there bewildered

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:59.210 align:middle line:84%
trying to work out
what's happening to me,

00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and I, in a daze, trotted
over towards these books.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.000 align:middle line:84%
Now I knew this
newsagent shop very well.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:84%
The books it sold
were romantic novels,

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.030 align:middle line:84%
you know perfectly formed
English roses, big macho

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.370 align:middle line:90%
soldiers, that kind of stuff.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.340 align:middle line:84%
But there in the middle of
all these romantic novels

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.980 align:middle line:84%
was one book, and it had a
woman's face on the front,

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:84%
and it was called
"Mind to Mind,"

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and it was written by a
lady called Betty Shine.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.450 align:middle line:90%
So I turned it over--

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.440 align:middle line:84%
I picked it up because
it was so different.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
I picked it up and I read
the blurb on the back,

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.550 align:middle line:90%
and then I saw this word--

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:90%
psychic.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.660 align:middle line:90%
It was a biography--

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:45.070 align:middle line:84%
autobiography by Betty Shine
about her life as a psychic

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.050 align:middle line:84%
so immediately I
saw it, I thought,

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.820 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if this
lady would pick up

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.890 align:middle line:84%
what I've been
feeling all around me

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.020 align:middle line:84%
for the last year,
this presence.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.520 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote to her
and went to see her,

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.100 align:middle line:90%
but I didn't tell her anything.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
I said, I've got arthritis,
maybe your hands-on healing,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.480 align:middle line:90%
which she also did, might help.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Didn't tell her anything,
didn't want to give her

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.850 align:middle line:90%
any inkling, so I went along.

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.020 align:middle line:84%
I went along a couple of times,
had the hands-on healing,

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.900 align:middle line:84%
we had a nice chat, and I
found it all very fascinating,

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.090 align:middle line:90%
it's all new to me.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:90%
And then I went the third time.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'm lying on her--

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.442 align:middle line:84%
like a medical-type
bench in her front room,

00:10:23.442 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:84%
and she's doing the hands-on
healing on me left knee,

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:90%
just off of me left knee.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.840 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly I felt like
a spider's web on my face.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And this really hit me,
cause I read in her book

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:84%
that when other
levels of reality

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:84%
are trying to lock
in to you, you

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.580 align:middle line:84%
feel like a spider's
web on your face.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Now clearly again,
with the hindsight

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:47.980 align:middle line:84%
of experience,
what I was feeling

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:84%
was an electromagnetic
field, which

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.640 align:middle line:84%
is what is used to make
this communicative contact

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
between dimensions,
between frequencies.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
phenomena that when

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.690 align:middle line:84%
you're in a crowd
of excited people,

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.840 align:middle line:84%
people say their hairs on the
back of my neck are stood up.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:10.170 align:middle line:84%
That's an electromagnetic
field effect.

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I said
nothing to Betty Shine

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.470 align:middle line:84%
about the spider's web, but
10 to 15 seconds later, she

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:24.150 align:middle line:84%
launches her head back and she
said, my God, this is powerful,

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.510 align:middle line:84%
I've got to close me
eyes for this one.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.118 align:middle line:84%
And my backside's slipping
down the bench, I'm thinking,

00:11:30.118 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:90%
Icke, what'd you get into here?

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.090 align:middle line:90%
What's all this?

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:38.182 align:middle line:84%
And then here I am,
lying on this bench,

00:11:38.182 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm a national spokesman
for the British Green Party,

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm a national television
presenter with the BBC,

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:84%
and this lady starts telling
me that a presence that she

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.580 align:middle line:84%
can see in her mind was
telling her to tell me

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.760 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to go
out on a world stage

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.190 align:middle line:84%
and I was going to
reveal great secrets.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.390 align:middle line:84%
One line that came out was, one
man cannot change the world,

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.180 align:middle line:84%
but one man can communicate
the message that can change

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And that information would
be put directly into my mind

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:18.210 align:middle line:84%
and at other times I
would be led to knowledge.

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course part
of me's kind of lying

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:25.410 align:middle line:90%
there thinking, what the?

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.580 align:middle line:90%
You know.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But something here was saying go
with it, go with it, and I did.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And what happened
after I left her house

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:84%
that day is that my life
became this incredibly

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:48.590 align:middle line:84%
synchronistic journey of
walking into information.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:84%
It came in the form of
reading the right books,

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.120 align:middle line:84%
coming across documents,
personal experiences,

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.100 align:middle line:84%
synchronicity mystically,
again, meeting

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:01.480 align:middle line:90%
people who gave me information.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was like
and has been ever

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:09.370 align:middle line:84%
since some force has been
handing me puzzle pieces

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:90%
in a jigsaw puzzle.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.980 align:middle line:84%
I left the BBC, or it
left me, and I suddenly

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:24.280 align:middle line:84%
was going full-time into
this whole arena of following

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:30.050 align:middle line:84%
this impulse that started off
in Betty Shine's front room.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote a book called
"Truth Vibrations" in 1990

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.920 align:middle line:84%
about what was happening
to me, not that I really

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:90%
understood at that time.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And then towards
the end of 1990,

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.780 align:middle line:84%
out of nowhere, I
got this feeling--

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.230 align:middle line:90%
go to Peru.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.050 align:middle line:84%
I walk down the
street and I look over

00:13:56.050 --> 00:14:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and I catch a travel
agent's window,

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.683 align:middle line:90%
and it would be go to Peru.

00:14:04.683 --> 00:14:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I'd put the
television on, there'd

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.070 align:middle line:90%
be a documentary about Peru.

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I thought
I'm going with it,

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.860 align:middle line:84%
because my intuition,
something here was telling

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.200 align:middle line:90%
me to go with this, go with it.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:27.800 align:middle line:84%
This was saying, ooh, not so
sure, but I went with this.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So I end up getting
on a plane to Peru,

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.130 align:middle line:84%
amazing things happen
in Peru over a period

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:39.230 align:middle line:84%
of three weeks, which culminated
in a real life-changing

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:84%
paranormal event for me, which
happened at a place called

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Sillustani, which is an
old Inca site not far

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.220 align:middle line:84%
from the shores of Lake
Titicaca, the highest navigable

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:90%
lake in the world.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So we went out there, and
I went around this site,

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:90%
it was beautiful.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Distant mountains, a lake,
beautiful countryside.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:09.410 align:middle line:10%
But after I'd been
around, the feeling I had,

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.970 align:middle line:10%
the urge I had to go there was
not matched by the experience.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So I was quite disappointed,
getting the bus taxi,

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:22.310 align:middle line:90%
and we head back to Puno.

00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:24.650 align:middle line:84%
Just a minute, two
minutes down the road,

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:26.960 align:middle line:84%
I'm daydreaming out
the side of the van--

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:84%
the taxi bus thing,
and I see this hill.

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm looking at it, and
all I can hear in my head is,

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
come to me, come
to me, come to me.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So I ask them to stop the bus
and I walked up this hill.

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:90%
I said, I won't be long.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was over an hour
because of what happened.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:53.900 align:middle line:84%
I got to the top of this hill,
and there was kind of stones

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:58.910 align:middle line:84%
there all around, and I
walked in the middle of them.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And what happened to me in
the newsagent's shop started

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
to happen again, only
enormously magnified.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.240 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I started
to feel like magnets

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:18.440 align:middle line:84%
were pulling my feet down,
I thought I recognized that.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I felt like a drill
going in the top of my head

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and down through my
feet and another--

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.855 align:middle line:84%
what was obviously a flow of
energy coming the other way

00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:27.980 align:middle line:90%
and out the top of my head.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.050 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:36.380 align:middle line:84%
And again, not a voice, but
a very strong thought form

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.140 align:middle line:84%
went through my
head, which said,

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.950 align:middle line:84%
it will be over when
you feel the rain.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:52.340 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm looking at a clear blue
Peruvian sky and a piercing

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:90%
hot sun.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.270 align:middle line:90%
There's not a cloud to be seen.

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:58.640 align:middle line:84%
It will be over when
you feel the rain.

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.430 align:middle line:84%
So you think you're
going crazy, right?

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.935 align:middle line:84%
So then this energy starts
to get more and more powerful

00:17:04.935 --> 00:17:06.560 align:middle line:84%
going through my
body, and then my arms

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
go out at an angle
like that, which I made

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.359 align:middle line:90%
no conscious decision to do.

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:15.619 align:middle line:90%
Just went like that.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:84%
And this energy got
stronger and stronger

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.599 align:middle line:84%
and stronger-- my
arms stayed like that

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:90%
for the best part of an hour.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.589 align:middle line:90%
And it was fine.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:29.540 align:middle line:84%
When it was over it
wasn't, but it was fine,

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel what you
would normally feel.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And this energy got more
and more and more powerful.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.315 align:middle line:90%
And I'm starting to shake.

00:17:38.315 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:46.250 align:middle line:84%
And then I notice that on
the distant mountains--

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
over the distant mountains,
there was a light-gray mist,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.970 align:middle line:90%
and it very quickly got darker.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.550 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, it's raining.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And what then happened,
if you put it in a movie,

00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:02.020 align:middle line:90%
they'd say, oh, come on.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:84%
Don't be daft, far-fetched--
that is when it happened.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Over the next very short
time, this enormous rainstorm

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:84%
came out of those mountains
and across the land towards me.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.810 align:middle line:84%
You know weather people talk
about a front coming across.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Well, this was like a straight
line of rain coming towards me.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.950 align:middle line:84%
I've described it as
like drawing curtains

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:90%
across the sky.

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's coming towards
me in stair-rod fashion.

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:40.828 align:middle line:84%
And by now, I can hardly
stand with this energy.

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:41.870 align:middle line:90%
And then the rain hit me.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:45.020 align:middle line:84%
It soaked me immediately,
it was so fierce.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.780 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly the energy stopped.

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.720 align:middle line:84%
It will be over when
you feel the rain.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.580 align:middle line:90%
And my legs will like Bambi.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.230 align:middle line:84%
My shoulders are
now agony having

00:18:57.230 --> 00:18:59.450 align:middle line:90%
been like that all that time.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:05.500 align:middle line:84%
And something very
profound had happened,

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what then.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And I had crystal, a quartz
crystal, which I put in my hand

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.490 align:middle line:84%
when I got back
down to the vehicle

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:84%
to try to get this energy
that was pouring out my hands.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.080 align:middle line:90%
I was pouring out of my feet--

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.122 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't sleep that
night because of the energy

00:19:26.122 --> 00:19:27.770 align:middle line:90%
coming out of me feet.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:31.900 align:middle line:84%
So then I come home to
Britain, and this book

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.762 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote, "Truth
Vibrations," is coming out,

00:19:35.762 --> 00:19:37.220 align:middle line:84%
and there's a lot
of interest in it

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.870 align:middle line:84%
because it was starting to seep
out into the mainstream media

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:45.710 align:middle line:84%
that you know that Icke guy
who presented for the BBC,

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:48.580 align:middle line:90%
he's gone a bit strange.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:84%
And I got invited onto
a television program,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:59.840 align:middle line:84%
totally primetime BBC program
called "The Terry Wogan Show--"

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.550 align:middle line:90%
it was a chat show.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:08.750 align:middle line:84%
And what had happened to me
after that experience in Peru

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:12.860 align:middle line:84%
is that if you live
your life in a bubble,

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.170 align:middle line:84%
say a bubble of reality,
a bubble of sense

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.930 align:middle line:84%
of the possible, and you
get along with your life

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:21.360 align:middle line:84%
in the ol' bubble, and there's
someone comes along and pops

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:90%
it--

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.740 align:middle line:84%
doesn't tell you, doesn't
give you any warning,

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.770 align:middle line:84%
just goes pop,
what happened was,

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.230 align:middle line:84%
after that experience in
Peru, concepts, information,

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:37.880 align:middle line:84%
insights were pouring
into my conscious mind.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was like pressing too
many keys on the computer-- you

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.790 align:middle line:84%
try to process too
much information

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:48.260 align:middle line:84%
through the computer, and the
computer says, I'm freezing.

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.960 align:middle line:90%
Can't do this.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:90%
Well that was me.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:54.270 align:middle line:84%
For three months, if you'd
have asked me my name,

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I would've checked.

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Asked me where I was,
I would've checked.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.030 align:middle line:90%
Is this planet Earth?

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.800 align:middle line:90%
It didn't seem like it anymore.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:08.230 align:middle line:84%
And in the middle of this, I
went on "The Terry Wogan Show"

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:11.470 align:middle line:90%
on live television primetime.

00:21:11.470 --> 00:21:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And what happened on that
show, which you could see it

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:23.120 align:middle line:84%
on the internet, led
me to then experience

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:29.920 align:middle line:84%
what can only be described as
historic levels of ridicule.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I could not walk down
any street in Britain

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.980 align:middle line:90%
without being laughed at.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:40.570 align:middle line:84%
I lived my life to the sound
of distant laughter, sometimes

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.340 align:middle line:90%
in-your-face laughter.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:46.577 align:middle line:84%
A comedian only
had to say my name.

00:21:46.577 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Didn't need a joke--

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:90%
I was the joke--

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.780 align:middle line:90%
to get laughter.

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.520 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.520 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And you would think that
that was going to destroy me,

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:07.890 align:middle line:90%
It made me.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Because there are other forces
at work if we only let them in,

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:90%
and they know what's coming.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:20.700 align:middle line:84%
They can see the river
from source to sea,

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.670 align:middle line:84%
you can see the next
turn on the river.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:90%
And that force knows--

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.730 align:middle line:90%
and it's part of us--

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:29.500 align:middle line:90%


00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
what is necessary
for what's coming.

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at my life
and what I've written and what

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:42.970 align:middle line:84%
I've talked about, one thing
was absolutely essential

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.900 align:middle line:84%
in my personality make-up
for me to do that--

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.590 align:middle line:84%
no longer having the fear
of what other people think.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Because if I'd have
feared, what other people

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.920 align:middle line:84%
would say about what
I was going to say

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and what I was going to write,
then you almost certainly

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.800 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have written it.

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.810 align:middle line:84%
But once you let go of the fear
of what other people think,

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:14.960 align:middle line:84%
you step out of the biggest
prison that anyone can live in,

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.720 align:middle line:84%
because once you fear
what other people think,

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.165 align:middle line:84%
other people are now
controlling your life.

00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:23.400 align:middle line:90%


00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:30.350 align:middle line:84%
And what that mass ridicule did
for me, incredible gift it was,

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.740 align:middle line:84%
although it was a nightmare
in the experiencing,

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:38.720 align:middle line:84%
was it set me free of the fear
of what other people think

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:40.700 align:middle line:90%
and say about me.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.270 align:middle line:90%


00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I've used this phrase
in the books sometimes.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Life so often gives you your
greatest gift brilliantly

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:59.840 align:middle line:84%
disguised as your worst
nightmare, and it did for me,

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
and I'll always be
grateful for it.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And from that time, I've gone
on following the synchronicity

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
and more and more layers
and layers of information,

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.270 align:middle line:84%
which I'm going to share
with you in this series,

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.120 align:middle line:90%
has been dropping in my lap.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps the other
moment, the other experience

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:26.610 align:middle line:84%
that I'll mentioned
today happened in 2003.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:29.370 align:middle line:84%
By that time, I'd
reached the point

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:34.350 align:middle line:84%
where I was saying to
myself and saying to others,

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:38.430 align:middle line:84%
if I'm going to move on
and really understand what

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:42.890 align:middle line:90%
this reality is, I need to--

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:48.110 align:middle line:84%
I need to get out there
and observe it and see it.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Not in some dream where
you wake up and you think,

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.610 align:middle line:84%
well was that real
or was that a dream?

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.040 align:middle line:84%
But actually consciously
experience it.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.590 align:middle line:84%
At that time,
synchronicity again,

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:01.760 align:middle line:84%
I was invited to go to
the rainforest in Brazil

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and partake of something
called ayahuasca,

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.900 align:middle line:84%
which is illegal in many--
in various countries,

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.520 align:middle line:90%
but is legal--

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:84%
or was then, anyway,
it might still be--

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.910 align:middle line:84%
in Brazil if it's done in a
Brazilian religious setting,

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:18.650 align:middle line:90%
which this one was.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.760 align:middle line:84%
So I go along, and I
take it on two nights.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:26.480 align:middle line:84%
And basically, obviously,
it's a psychoactive drug

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.535 align:middle line:90%
from a rainforest plant.

00:25:27.535 --> 00:25:30.830 align:middle line:90%
It tastes a bit like licorice.

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And I took it on the
first night and I

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:84%
had an experience for about
two hours, which was amazing,

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:40.280 align:middle line:84%
but the second night was
a voice kicked in as clear

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.640 align:middle line:90%
as mine is now.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:46.490 align:middle line:84%
A female voice, it
took a female form.

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:49.520 align:middle line:84%
And the voice gave
me chapter and verse

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:56.150 align:middle line:84%
for five hours on the illusory
nature of physical reality.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:26:00.560 align:middle line:84%
How this reality that we
experience as physical,

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:07.640 align:middle line:84%
solid, material, is
actually complete illusion--

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.310 align:middle line:84%
and I am going to go
into this information.

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:84%
And I started looking
at what mainstream

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.630 align:middle line:84%
science in its various
disciplines had discovered,

00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:24.980 align:middle line:84%
not least quantum
physics, and I realized

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:31.230 align:middle line:84%
that if only these disciplines
would put their dots together,

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:34.550 align:middle line:84%
and instead of competing
with each other for funding

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.470 align:middle line:84%
and prestige, these
different disciplines,

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:84%
they actually saw the unity that
was there, if only they would

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:84%
look, they'd already established
that this so-called physical

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:55.660 align:middle line:84%
world is an illusion, which
can be very simply explained,

00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and I will as this
series unfolds.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And since then, with that
incredible fundamental

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.980 align:middle line:84%
foundation understanding
that this reality is not

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.350 align:middle line:84%
how we experience
it, it's not what

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:17.330 align:middle line:84%
we think it is,
it's not what we're

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:28.030 align:middle line:84%
told it is, suddenly the
paranormal ceased to be para.

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Because all these
happenings, these

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:40.220 align:middle line:84%
phenomena that human
normal can't explain--

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and if you can't explain it, it
can't be happening, so it goes,

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.380 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.990 align:middle line:90%
That's not possible.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Why isn't it possible?

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, because human
normal can't explain it,

00:27:56.050 --> 00:27:58.420 align:middle line:90%
so it can't be happening.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:84%
Well when you realize
the true nature of what

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.300 align:middle line:90%
we perceive and experience--

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I have to laugh, it is
quite funny, really,

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:05.985 align:middle line:90%
as physical reality.

00:28:05.985 --> 00:28:08.590 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:middle line:84%
You realize that paranormal
is not only the real normal,

00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:18.790 align:middle line:84%
but allows all these
phenomena that human normal

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:84%
can't explain to be perfectly
logically explainable.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we're going
in the rest of this series.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And since then, right
up to present day,

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
the synchronicity has continued,
and the places that it

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:47.800 align:middle line:84%
has taken me, the information
that it has brought to me

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:56.570 align:middle line:84%
has been way outside
of human normal,

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:59.420 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, I've
got lots of abuse,

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I've got lots of ridicule,
but because of my experience

00:29:06.770 --> 00:29:12.600 align:middle line:84%
with historic levels
of abuse and ridicule,

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:18.850 align:middle line:84%
thanks to the "Wogan
Show" and the aftermath,

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:23.050 align:middle line:84%
never once considered,
should I put this out?

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Because I know I'll get back.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize that the
true nature of the "I"

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:44.430 align:middle line:84%
is simply awareness, a state of
being aware, and that awareness

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.925 align:middle line:90%
is on an infinite, eternal--

00:29:47.925 --> 00:29:50.720 align:middle line:90%


00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:57.180 align:middle line:84%
not even a journey,
an experience.

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:05.520 align:middle line:10%
An infinite, eternal experience
of exploring forever forever.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:10.860 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to be
a member of the herd,

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.890 align:middle line:84%
you can go your own unique way,
that's what we supposed to be.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:20.320 align:middle line:84%
We are points of attention
within an infinite flow

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:29.270 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, but we are
unique points of attention.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Expressing,
celebrating uniqueness

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:42.960 align:middle line:84%
is to celebrate that we
are an expression of all

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:84%
that is, has been,
and ever can be,

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.680 align:middle line:90%
and people hear that phrase.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.640 align:middle line:84%
All that is, has
been, and ever can be?

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:51.350 align:middle line:90%
That's impossible.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:52.150 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Because what is it
actually saying?

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It's saying we are
all possibility,

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and within all
possibility, you must

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.270 align:middle line:84%
be all that is, has
been, and ever can be.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:09.600 align:middle line:90%


00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.410 align:middle line:84%
The realization of the
true "I" as opposed to the,

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:17.910 align:middle line:84%
"this is what you
are I" transforms

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:26.860 align:middle line:84%
life from an existence
into an adventure.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.580 align:middle line:10%
Of the next 12 programs
that follows this one,

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.070 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to be
exploring these things

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.870 align:middle line:10%
in more detail and these
elements in more detail,

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:42.920 align:middle line:10%
and putting some substance
on top of the concepts.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to put human
life, world events, reality

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:84%
itself in a completely
different light.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.530 align:middle line:90%
I hope you'll join me.

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.480 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.
