00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.835 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.835 --> 00:00:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.590 align:middle line:90%
I'm David Icke.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And today, I'm going to
talk about the matrix.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:23.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.430 align:middle line:10%
The whole idea of a matrix,
a simulated reality--

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.560 align:middle line:10%
which I think this is--

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.250 align:middle line:10%
kind of came very prominent
to public attention

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.470 align:middle line:10%
with "The Matrix"
movies, matrix movies

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:46.470 align:middle line:10%
which described how there
was a real world and then,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.340 align:middle line:10%
through an attachment to
the back of the brain,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.530 align:middle line:10%
the brain stem, people were
attached to a fake reality,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.120 align:middle line:10%
a simulation, which
was called the matrix.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And what I found interesting
is in recent years,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.310 align:middle line:84%
more and more and
more mainstream

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
scientists are coming out
and saying, well, actually,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:84%
when we look at it and we look
at the uncovering of what's

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.810 align:middle line:84%
happening in the fabric of our
reality, the energetic fabric,

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.160 align:middle line:84%
it does look like we're in
some kind of simulation.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So the question then
comes, well, if we are,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.430 align:middle line:90%
how does it work?

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.780 align:middle line:90%
How do we interact with it?

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
How do we manifest its
reality in our reality

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.260 align:middle line:84%
so it becomes the world
we think we're in?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a waveform
information field, like Wi-Fi.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And the five senses are
decoding that information

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.950 align:middle line:84%
into electrical
information which

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:84%
is then communicated to the
brain, which then decodes it

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.960 align:middle line:90%
again--

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.120 align:middle line:84%
same information,
different form--

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.530 align:middle line:84%
into digital
holographic information.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
The reason that's important
to emphasize again

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.880 align:middle line:84%
in relation to do we
live in a simulation

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.600 align:middle line:84%
is because that's how
the simulation enters

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.010 align:middle line:90%
our perception of reality.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Look at these sophisticated
virtual reality games

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.450 align:middle line:84%
that people experience now all
the time getting more and more

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
sophisticated, where
they put on the headset,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.220 align:middle line:84%
they put on the earphones,
they put on the gloves

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.410 align:middle line:90%
for the touch senses.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And when you see them there
with their headset on,

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.460 align:middle line:84%
they're reacting as if
what they're experiencing

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.880 align:middle line:90%
as a virtual reality is real.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.770 align:middle line:84%
And these virtual reality games
are getting closer and closer

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.730 align:middle line:90%
and closer to this reality.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And those that are at
the cutting edge of this

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:84%
are saying that it won't be
too long before you will not

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:84%
be able to see the difference
between the virtual reality

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:32.470 align:middle line:84%
games or systems and this
reality we call the real world.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So then we ask, well,
what's going on then?

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.180 align:middle line:84%
What's going on when they're
experiencing these games?

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.600 align:middle line:90%
Quite simple.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.100 align:middle line:10%
The games are hacking into
the decoding processes

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:53.460 align:middle line:10%
that we use to decode this
reality from the waveform

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:10%
through the electrical into
the digital holographic.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
The information from
the game overrides,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.910 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the five
sense decoding system,

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.270 align:middle line:90%
what we call normal reality.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:84%
And so the dominant reality we
start to decode is the game.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And it seems so
unbelievably real.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:10%
So if you want to
control humanity or mass

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:40.660 align:middle line:10%
by manipulating them to
experience a fake reality they

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.900 align:middle line:10%
think is real--

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:10%
I am absolutely convinced
that's what is happening--

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.340 align:middle line:10%
then all you've got to do
is control the information

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.740 align:middle line:10%
that people receive through
this decoding process,

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:05.890 align:middle line:10%
and they will manifest the
game in their perception

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:13.550 align:middle line:10%
when all it is is
information that's

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.040 align:middle line:10%
hijacked those processes.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.060 align:middle line:84%
So when you look
at it, you can see

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.060 align:middle line:84%
how reality can be
faked, because it's

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
being faked all the time in
virtual reality technology now.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And you might have seen a
famous movie, "The Truman Show,"

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:middle line:90%
with Jim Carrey.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And for those who haven't,
basically Jim Carrey

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
was born into basically what we
call it in Britain a soap drama

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:84%
that people were watching
all the time day after day.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.130 align:middle line:90%
But he didn't know that.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.580 align:middle line:84%
He thought this
movie sets on which

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.040 align:middle line:90%
the drama was played out--

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:84%
people watched it as
a drama every day--

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:90%
was real.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:84%
All the people around
it were actually actors.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:16.810 align:middle line:90%
He didn't know that.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.020 align:middle line:90%
He found out eventually.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.990 align:middle line:90%
And the principle is the same.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.460 align:middle line:84%
People are being born into
this fake reality, I suggest.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.920 align:middle line:10%
And they believe it to be real,
without realizing that it's

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:41.010 align:middle line:10%
actually created to enslave
their sense of reality, thus

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:10%
their behavior,
and thus limiting

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:10%
their perception of anything
beyond the simulation.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.260 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And it all sounds
kind of fantastic.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:84%
But the arrival of
the "Matrix" movies

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.700 align:middle line:84%
was brilliant for me, because
it was a visual representation

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.030 align:middle line:84%
of what I'd been thinking
about for some time,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:22.120 align:middle line:84%
that maybe this world is not,
quote, natural, but simulated.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And again, look at the
symbolism of those movies.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.670 align:middle line:84%
What was happening
with the connection

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.970 align:middle line:84%
at the back of the
neck in the brain stem

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.530 align:middle line:84%
was another source
of information

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:84%
was overriding the brain's
decoding processes,

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:84%
which took their
perception out of what

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.670 align:middle line:84%
was said to be the real
world into this matrix.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And when they
entered the matrix,

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.330 align:middle line:84%
it was just a world like
this one full of people

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.510 align:middle line:84%
going about their
lives, doing their jobs,

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:90%
bringing up families.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And yet, it was all just
an information source

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.040 align:middle line:90%
being decoded.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:14.930 align:middle line:84%
And then in the last few years,
there's been a guy at NASA,

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:84%
a director at their Jet
Propulsion Laboratory,

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:90%
called Rich Terrile.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.920 align:middle line:84%
And he absolutely
held nothing back.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.800 align:middle line:90%
It was quite a surprise.

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.420 align:middle line:84%
When he came out,
the mainstream media

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
was quite widely
reported in Britain.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:37.070 align:middle line:10%
And he said that
he had concluded

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:43.179 align:middle line:10%
that we live in a reality
that is simulated,

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:47.320 align:middle line:10%
and what we are
experiencing is a reality

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:10%
of digital holograms--

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:10%


00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.658 align:middle line:10%
which kind of interested
me immediately,

00:08:54.658 --> 00:08:56.950 align:middle line:10%
because I've been writing
for years and years and years

00:08:56.950 --> 00:09:01.220 align:middle line:10%
about the fact that
this is how it works.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.760 align:middle line:84%
We decode the waveform
through the electrical

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.300 align:middle line:90%
into digital holograms.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, the implication
is that if it's a simulation,

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:90%
then it's not natural.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, some intelligence
has to have created it.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And to be fair, a lot of people
wouldn't have the courage

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:90%
to come out like this.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But Rich Terrile
said, yeah, of course.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:84%
If what I'm saying is true,
it is a simulation based

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:41.040 align:middle line:84%
on digital holograms, then some
intelligence has created it--

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:48.190 align:middle line:84%
which takes you into many and
various interesting places.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So then there was professor
of physics James Gates.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:03.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, James Gates was a science
advisor to Barack Obama.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And he led a team asking
the same question that's

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:13.220 align:middle line:84%
being widely asked now,
is this a simulation?

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
And then he went public
with the findings

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:84%
that they had found in the
energetic fabric of our reality

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
on and off, one and zero, on and
off electrical charge systems--

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:84%
which are, of course, the
basis of how computers work.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And the question
was then, what are

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:45.170 align:middle line:84%
they doing in the energetic
fabric of our reality?

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.600 align:middle line:10%
Well, if it's a
simulation, maybe there

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.200 align:middle line:10%
is an explanation for
what they're doing there.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.650 align:middle line:84%
He also found, or
the team found,

00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:00.970 align:middle line:84%
in the energetic fabric of this
reality something called error

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.520 align:middle line:90%
correcting codes.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And these are used
in computer systems

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:84%
to basically kick back into
balance any information being

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
communicated that goes haywire
a bit, loses its natural state.

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And these error
correcting codes kick it

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:28.410 align:middle line:90%
back into how it should be.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:35.820 align:middle line:10%
As he said, what are they
doing in the energetic fabric

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:10%
of our reality?

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And James Gates
was asked, have you

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:48.130 align:middle line:84%
found a set of equations
indistinguishable from those

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that drive search
engines and browsers

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:90%
in our energetic reality?

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:84%
And Gates replied,
that is correct.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:02.830 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:09.520 align:middle line:84%
So then you move to Max
Tegmark at the Massachusetts

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:15.700 align:middle line:84%
Institute of Technology, MIT,
who was, again, a physicist.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.540 align:middle line:84%
Talked about the fact
that the universe

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:29.280 align:middle line:84%
can be entirely described in
the nature of numbers and maths.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.940 align:middle line:84%
And he also added
that the physics

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:41.280 align:middle line:84%
of this reality and the physics
of virtual reality games

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:90%
are the same.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.460 align:middle line:84%
They are encoded
in the same way.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:50.290 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And I could go on
with other examples

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:59.080 align:middle line:84%
of scientists who've started
to go in this direction.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:05.490 align:middle line:84%
So the question then
comes, obviously,

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:17.220 align:middle line:84%
what is all this computer-like
virtual reality-like encoding

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:90%
doing in our reality?

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, I say it's
because what we're

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.080 align:middle line:84%
seeing with technology
as it advances

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:84%
so fast now is
technology mimicking

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:43.690 align:middle line:84%
reality, because our reality
is simulated in some way

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:47.770 align:middle line:90%
by a form of technology.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:54.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.850 align:middle line:84%
It's been my view
for quite a long time

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
now that the idea that
the speed of light

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.200 align:middle line:84%
is the fastest speed
possible, though it's

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.500 align:middle line:84%
become a basic tenet
of mainstream science,

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:90%
I say that's nonsense.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:18.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we live in
an infinite reality

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:24.140 align:middle line:84%
that is all possibility
and all potential.

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So you can't have a fastest
speed within all possibility,

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.200 align:middle line:84%
because all possibility
is all possibility.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:44.310 align:middle line:84%
And I say that what
the speed of light is

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:50.040 align:middle line:84%
is the limit, the firewall
of the simulation.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.780 align:middle line:84%
And so they found that when
you get closer and closer

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.240 align:middle line:84%
to the speed of
light, things start

00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:03.920 align:middle line:84%
to go strange, start to act
differently, react differently.

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And things that
work a certain way

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.610 align:middle line:84%
within the reality
in general starts

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:19.110 align:middle line:84%
to change when it gets
to the speed of light.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:26.030 align:middle line:84%
My view is that this is
happening because it's

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:84%
entering the outer limits
of this particular simulated

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:37.490 align:middle line:84%
reality, and therefore it
starts to act differently.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:46.320 align:middle line:84%
What this also
brings us to is why

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
there is this quite obvious
and blatant suppression

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:90%
of how reality works.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:59.270 align:middle line:84%
There is this
suppression of knowledge,

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:84%
of what is the true I. People
are born into this world,

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:90%
and then they're given labels.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.480 align:middle line:90%
You are a man.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:90%
You are a woman.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:90%
You are black.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.020 align:middle line:90%
You are white.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:13.495 align:middle line:84%
You are this sexuality
or that sexuality.

00:16:13.495 --> 00:16:15.620 align:middle line:84%
You are this income bracket
or that income bracket.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.970 align:middle line:84%
These are the labels
that I talk about.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.330 align:middle line:84%
And people then self-identify
with these labels

00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.380 align:middle line:90%
as if that's who they are.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they're self-identifying
who they are with the world

00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:90%
that they are experiencing.

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:42.860 align:middle line:84%
And so put simply, as
I would say it anyway,

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
they are in the simulation and
they are of the simulation.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.690 align:middle line:84%
They are getting all
their information

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:59.450 align:middle line:84%
that's giving them a fix on
who they are and where they are

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and an understanding of or
a perception of reality that

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:12.829 align:middle line:84%
is all coming, that information,
from within the simulation,

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:19.579 align:middle line:84%
from within the walls, I would
say, of the speed of light.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
have no other way

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the world
from another perspective.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:37.870 align:middle line:84%
To do that, you have to
expand your consciousness,

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:45.150 align:middle line:84%
your perceptual state
beyond the walls and limits

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.120 align:middle line:84%
of the simulation,
as I would say.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
to enter levels

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:84%
of reality, levels of awareness
that are not being dictated

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.310 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their perception
by the information coming

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.200 align:middle line:90%
from the simulation.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Then you start to go through
a process of re-evaluating

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:90%
your sense of self.

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, the labels, you can
see that that's all they are.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And you start to realize
that you are consciousness

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:90%
having that experience.

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:84%
You also start to look at
the world in a different way.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.840 align:middle line:84%
You start to see dots
connecting instead of everything

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.890 align:middle line:90%
being random.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.200 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
is, although you may not

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.310 align:middle line:84%
realize it, you're
actually perceiving

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
the simulated reality from
beyond the simulated reality.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And thus, you see it in a
completely different way

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.220 align:middle line:84%
from those who are
in the simulation

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.410 align:middle line:84%
and of the simulation,
because the information

00:18:56.410 --> 00:18:57.880 align:middle line:84%
of the simulation
is all they get

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:90%
so that's all they perceive.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:05.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is why, I
would say anyway,

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
during this period of
known human history,

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:19.680 align:middle line:84%
there has been this war,
really, on human perception

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:26.790 align:middle line:84%
to constantly limit the sense
of the possible that people have

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:84%
and to hold people in a
perceptual prison called

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.460 align:middle line:90%
the simulation.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And your perception of reality,
your perception of self

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:45.600 align:middle line:90%
expresses itself in a frequency.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:48.460 align:middle line:90%
Everything's a frequency.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you are in the simulation
and of the simulation,

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
you will be
resonating, interacting

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
with the simulation within
the walls of the simulation.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.717 align:middle line:84%
But when you expand your
consciousness beyond it,

00:20:06.717 --> 00:20:09.300 align:middle line:84%
you're now interacting with that
that's beyond the simulation.

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:84%
Thus, you see the world
you're living in-- bracket,

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:12.560 align:middle line:90%
simulation--

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.810 align:middle line:90%
in a completely different way.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.850 align:middle line:84%
You certainly see yourself
in a different way.

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So this, I would
suggest, is why there

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:84%
has been this quite
obvious ongoing onslaught

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:34.530 align:middle line:84%
on human perception
which involves

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:39.730 align:middle line:84%
controlling information
which would give people

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:84%
a sense of limitation, a
sense of powerlessness that

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.180 align:middle line:84%
would hold them
in the simulation

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.230 align:middle line:90%
and not expanding beyond it.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at religion,
what does that say, religion?

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Through the centuries--
indeed, through the thousands

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:90%
of years--

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:84%
and you look at
what most of them

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:07.130 align:middle line:84%
are saying, that what you
need to know to understand

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:84%
the world, to
understand who you are

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:14.030 align:middle line:84%
and your place in the world,
you need to read this book.

00:21:14.030 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.040 align:middle line:84%
This book will tell
you everything.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you deviate
from this book in terms

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.300 align:middle line:84%
of your perception, then
you are a blasphemer,

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:27.920 align:middle line:90%
and the work of the devil.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And we've seen through history
in its more extreme periods

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.470 align:middle line:84%
where people are burnt at
the stake and other horrors

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:43.670 align:middle line:84%
for not accepting
that this book is

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:47.260 align:middle line:84%
the fountain of all knowledge
and all you need to know.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:54.100 align:middle line:84%
As humans became more and
more awake and more resistant

00:21:54.100 --> 00:22:00.610 align:middle line:84%
to acquiescing to that, in
came mainstream science.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:04.300 align:middle line:84%
Mainstream science
tells us, basically,

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.930 align:middle line:84%
that this world is solid,
quantum physics apart--

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:84%
because that's what happens with
science, that I've seen anyway.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physics is showing
that there is no physicality.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And the rest of
science basically

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.650 align:middle line:84%
is nodding that, yes,
I acknowledge that.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Because they have
to, because that's

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.310 align:middle line:90%
what they're coming up with.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But then they crack on
with their own discipline

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.140 align:middle line:90%
as if that's not happening.

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:90%
Everything's solid.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Everything's limited.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:37.420 align:middle line:90%
No life after death, no spirit.

00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:90%
And what is that doing?

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:45.630 align:middle line:84%
By the way, that form of science
is just another religion.

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And the holy books of
the science religion

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.690 align:middle line:84%
are the books of
scientific orthodoxy.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:59.090 align:middle line:84%
They're the bibles and
the other holy books

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.530 align:middle line:90%
what is all that doing?

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:08.140 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's religion or
whether it's mainstream science,

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:14.140 align:middle line:84%
it's holding people
in a perceptual state

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:21.690 align:middle line:84%
that holds them in the
walls, the firewalls

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.480 align:middle line:90%
of the simulation.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:31.330 align:middle line:10%
If you talk to people
who have experienced

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:37.940 align:middle line:10%
these sophisticated advanced
virtual reality games,

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.170 align:middle line:10%
they'll tell you that when
they're experiencing it,

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:10%
it's real.

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:46.660 align:middle line:90%
It's happening to them.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And you can understand why, when
this simulation is obviously

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.860 align:middle line:84%
even more advanced
and sophisticated

00:23:56.860 --> 00:24:01.000 align:middle line:84%
than human technology
has yet reached,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.790 align:middle line:84%
people are born into
this world, this matrix,

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and they go through
their entire lives

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:19.930 align:middle line:84%
experiencing it and believing
it to be real until they

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.288 align:middle line:90%
pass at the other end.

00:24:23.288 --> 00:24:32.180 align:middle line:10%
And because humans basically
live a short life--

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:10%
nothing like, in my
view, what humans

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.507 align:middle line:10%
used to live long ago when
the world was different--

00:24:39.507 --> 00:24:44.180 align:middle line:10%


00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.030 align:middle line:10%
just look at people
when they get

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.370 align:middle line:10%
towards the end of their life.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:54.320 align:middle line:84%
And they'll tell you,
god, it just flew by.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:57.965 align:middle line:90%
I mean, where's it all gone?

00:24:57.965 --> 00:25:00.630 align:middle line:90%


00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And that means you have
a very limited period

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:12.888 align:middle line:84%
within the simulation to suss
it's all fake and a simulation.

00:25:12.888 --> 00:25:15.580 align:middle line:90%


00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's why very few people
do suss it, do realize it.

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
But there is a route
one to realizing it.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is to put
aside the labels,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:36.620 align:middle line:84%
to stop self-identifying with
the labels that were given,

00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.940 align:middle line:84%
and start self-identifying with
being the I, the awareness that

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:44.040 align:middle line:90%
is having the experience.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And that expansion of
self-identity becomes

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:50.610 align:middle line:84%
an expansion of consciousness--
one is an expression

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:51.480 align:middle line:90%
of the other--

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:57.390 align:middle line:84%
and you start to breach
the perceptual walls

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:90%
of this simulated reality.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:06.030 align:middle line:10%
And that's when the
aha moments come

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:10.880 align:middle line:10%
and you start to see what
you couldn't see before.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And when you then
put all this together

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:23.015 align:middle line:84%
that I've talked about here,
we come back to that question.

00:26:23.015 --> 00:26:26.150 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:33.420 align:middle line:84%
If this is a simulation,
it's not happened naturally.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:35.810 align:middle line:84%
Someone, some thing,
some intelligence,

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:40.070 align:middle line:84%
some consciousness
has created it.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:49.490 align:middle line:10%
And that is a question I've
been pursuing for decades.

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:57.370 align:middle line:10%
Who is behind the simulation,
and what is their agenda?

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:03.300 align:middle line:84%
And the next time, I will
return to the subject

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:08.860 align:middle line:84%
and I will return to that
question with some answers.

00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:13.750 align:middle line:90%
Who created the matrix?

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I'll see you then.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.000 align:middle line:90%
