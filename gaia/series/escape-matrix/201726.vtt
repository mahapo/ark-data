00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello and welcome.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm David Icke,
and today I'm going

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.790 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the
real revolution.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.572 align:middle line:90%
We love each other.

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:21.977 align:middle line:90%

00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:27.270 align:middle line:90%


00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:10%
This word love is bandied
around a lot, but what is it?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:10%
What is love?

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:10%
Well, maybe we could
start with what it's not.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.830 align:middle line:10%
Love doesn't mean
we have to agree.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:51.040 align:middle line:84%
What an absolutely
boring world, if we

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.060 align:middle line:84%
believe that we live in a
state of all possibility

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.200 align:middle line:84%
or potential, what a boring
world if everyone agreed.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So number one, love is
not about agreement.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And love does not mean
either that we roll over

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.550 align:middle line:84%
and allow ourselves to be
imposed upon because "I love

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.530 align:middle line:90%
you so you do what you like.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.757 align:middle line:84%
I'll just lie down and
you can walk all over me."

00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:21.840 align:middle line:90%
It don't mean that at all.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Love, I guess for
most people, would

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.730 align:middle line:90%
be expressed as attraction.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.390 align:middle line:84%
You are attracted to
someone, physically, often,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.250 align:middle line:90%
and you feel "I'm in love."

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.240 align:middle line:84%
And yes that can
absolutely happen.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.120 align:middle line:84%
But for me, the love
I'm talking about,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:58.890 align:middle line:84%
is most profoundly
expressed in friendship.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Friendship.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, there's this great
phrase I heard a long time ago.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.250 align:middle line:84%
A friend is someone who
walks into the room when

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.290 align:middle line:90%
everyone else is walking out.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
A friend doesn't have
to agree with you.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
They might seriously disagree
with what you've done,

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.090 align:middle line:84%
but they have this connection,
this love connection,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
and it's unconditional,
I say true sense,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.320 align:middle line:84%
which is, I'm always going to
be here for you because we have

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.900 align:middle line:84%
that connection that we call
friendship, which is really

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.370 align:middle line:84%
just an expression of
unconditional love.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a
relationship, for instance,

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:84%
where you are physically
attracted and you perceive

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.777 align:middle line:90%
it as love--

00:02:55.777 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:90%
which is far enough.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wrong with that.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.980 align:middle line:84%
Done it meself-- and
that's all you have,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.610 align:middle line:84%
then at some point that's
probably going to dissipate.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Because although I'm still
very young and very virile,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:84%
eventually it will
even come to me

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:84%
that you move on into
different stages of your life.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And if just physical
attraction is all

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that we perceive
as love then, as we

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.860 align:middle line:84%
see all the time in human
society, maybe it fizzles out.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.370 align:middle line:84%
But a relationship between two
people who start out physically

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.350 align:middle line:84%
attracted to each other but
have that core, that foundation

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:84%
of friendship, then as life
moves on through its stages,

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
that friendship, love,
real love, true love,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.570 align:middle line:84%
unconditional love,
will always be there,

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.186 align:middle line:84%
and so the relationship
will always be there.

00:04:06.186 --> 00:04:10.160 align:middle line:90%
And a question.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.580 align:middle line:84%
What is our point of
reference from which we

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:22.120 align:middle line:84%
peruse the world and interact
with different people?

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Is that point of
attention love of the kind

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.772 align:middle line:84%
that I'm talking about,
the understanding

00:04:28.772 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:84%
that we're all expressions
of each other having

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.950 align:middle line:90%
different experiences?

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Or is it hate, is it resentment,
is it revenge, animosity?

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.290 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever that
point of reference is

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:84%
will dictate your relationship
and interaction with people,

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and together,
collectively, it will

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.053 align:middle line:84%
decide what the world is
that we are experiencing.

00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Because whatever that
point of reference

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.600 align:middle line:84%
is will color
everything that we do,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:84%
and it will form our
perceptions and dictate

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:90%
our perceptions of reality.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And I've obviously
written and talked a lot

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:20.080 align:middle line:84%
over the years about
the fact that the world

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.360 align:middle line:90%
is run by psychopaths.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:84%
What I'm doing is I'm looking
at the traits of their behavior

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.790 align:middle line:84%
and relating it to the
psychological official

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:40.820 align:middle line:84%
definition of a psychopath and
seeing that that behavior ticks

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.170 align:middle line:84%
off all the boxes of what is
considered to be a psychopath.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.440 align:middle line:84%
So I'm making an
observation that the world

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.460 align:middle line:84%
is run by psychopaths
based on their behavior.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.480 align:middle line:90%
And what is a psychopath?

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.490 align:middle line:90%
What is psychopathic behavior?

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:90%
It is the absence of love.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened is
that this psychopathic state,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.210 align:middle line:84%
this absence of love,
has filtered down

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:18.590 align:middle line:84%
because of the manipulation into
so much of mainstream society

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:26.810 align:middle line:84%
where people interact not on
the basis of love and empathy

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.510 align:middle line:84%
and understanding but on the
basis of constant judgment

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.100 align:middle line:90%
and condemnation.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And people might say,
well, you're doing that

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.240 align:middle line:90%
by calling them psychopaths.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.780 align:middle line:90%


00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:52.060 align:middle line:84%
But I'm not in the sense of
having hatred for them or not,

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.710 align:middle line:90%
frankly, feeling sorry for them.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:59.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm observing their behavior
and I'm calling it psychopathic.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Because how we look at
people we vehemently

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.180 align:middle line:84%
disagree with dictates
whether we are actually coming

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:90%
from a point of love or not.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So I look at this
network of manipulators,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and I look at their
psychopathic behavior,

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.700 align:middle line:90%
but I don't hate them.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And on one level, I
seek to understand them.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:84%
I feel sorry for them because
they, by their very nature

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:42.010 align:middle line:84%
and by their very
behavior, are living lives

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.830 align:middle line:84%
in the absence of love, which
is why they do what they do.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.100 align:middle line:84%
If love was part
of their makeup,

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't do what they do.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And in a less
extreme way, people

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:03.330 align:middle line:84%
who talk about
love so often look

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
at other people in society, not
necessarily psychopathic people

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:11.550 align:middle line:84%
but just people they
disagree with or whatever,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:90%
and they will condemn them.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Say someone does
something very unpleasant

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.180 align:middle line:84%
and there's immediate
condemnation.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can see the reason
for their reflex action

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.660 align:middle line:84%
condemnation of what's
being done, whether it's

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:84%
someone going crazy
with a gun or whatever,

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:36.679 align:middle line:84%
because of the effect
on other people.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:39.110 align:middle line:90%
I do see that.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:84%
But what love also says is,
why did that person do that?

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:54.850 align:middle line:84%
What has happened in their
mental and emotional makeup

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:84%
that makes someone do
that horrible thing?

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:84%
And so often you find that
when you break it down

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.770 align:middle line:84%
and you play it
back, you find that

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:16.340 align:middle line:84%
said people who
just attack society

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and who want to just do anything
destructive because they have

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:31.993 align:middle line:84%
this hatred of society,
you chart that back often

00:09:31.993 --> 00:09:33.660 align:middle line:84%
and you'll find there's
a reason for it.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.380 align:middle line:84%
I remember a story
in my own experience.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:39.810 align:middle line:84%
There was a child
at this school where

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I used to visit
on occasion, and I

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.750 align:middle line:84%
used to visit this class
which was full of kids

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.045 align:middle line:90%
who had big behavior problems.

00:09:51.045 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were very
difficult to handle.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And the guy who ran the class,
I used to chat to him a bit

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.040 align:middle line:90%
about his experience.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.800 align:middle line:84%
And he told me one story,
which kind of encapsulates what

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm trying to get across here.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:84%
There was this one
boy in this class,

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
but it was a special class away
from the rest of the classes

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.940 align:middle line:84%
because of their
behavior problems,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:84%
who was almost impossible
to keep under control.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And one day this teacher went
back home with the boy to talk

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.810 align:middle line:84%
to his parents about
something that had happened.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.950 align:middle line:84%
And he walks in the
door, and the parents

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:90%
are paralletically drunk.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And this boy's little
brother, toddler brother,

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.330 align:middle line:84%
was sitting on the
carpet between them

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:56.410 align:middle line:84%
playing with a pile of
empty booze bottles.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:59.070 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:05.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can look at
the behavior of that boy

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:90%
and you can just condemn it.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.720 align:middle line:84%
In the absence of love, you
would condemn it and say,

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.900 align:middle line:90%
he's horrible.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.706 align:middle line:90%
He's evil.

00:11:16.706 --> 00:11:23.670 align:middle line:84%
But if this is hope and you
say, why is he doing it?

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:30.180 align:middle line:84%
And you realize the
fantastic wisdom

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:84%
of that Native American phrase,
don't judge a man until you've

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.990 align:middle line:90%
walked a mile in his moccasins.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, we do it all the time,
but love won't do that.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.286 align:middle line:84%
It will say, what
you've done is horrible,

00:11:50.286 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:90%
but why have you done it?

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you infuse love
into a situation like that,

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:02.750 align:middle line:84%
you might have a
chance of looking

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:08.820 align:middle line:84%
at the cause of why so
many horrible things happen

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:84%
instead of just
condemning the outcome.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.840 align:middle line:90%
Jail him forever.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.920 align:middle line:90%
Capital punishment.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.902 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.902 --> 00:12:23.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the difference
between coming

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle line:84%
from a perspective
of without love

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and coming from a
perspective of love.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:39.600 align:middle line:84%
You look at everyone
as equally important.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.190 align:middle line:90%
All people matter.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And to condemn without
knowing their story

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:55.070 align:middle line:84%
is to condemn society,
to continually

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:59.900 align:middle line:84%
repeat and perpetuate
the same outcomes,

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.957 align:middle line:84%
because the cause is
not being addressed,

00:13:01.957 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and that cause is only
addressed when you do that.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.980 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:84%
So many times you see
these horrible events,

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:16.100 align:middle line:84%
like mass shootings, and those
questions are never asked.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And so what we've also done
with the absence of love,

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:31.510 align:middle line:84%
if we've fallen into this whole
illusion of self-identifying

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:38.240 align:middle line:84%
with labels, labels that are
formed by the head, often

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:43.160 align:middle line:84%
formed by society, we're told
what labels we should have.

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And then, we have
the divide and rule

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.020 align:middle line:84%
between those
labels which allows

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.740 align:middle line:90%
the few to control the many.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:54.010 align:middle line:84%
But when you come from
this point of view

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
of love, this
understanding that we're

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:03.980 align:middle line:84%
all expressions of each other,
that doesn't see the divisions.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:08.060 align:middle line:84%
It sees the
connections between us.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.270 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look at someone
and say, you are black, white,

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:14.060 align:middle line:90%
or sky blue blooming pink.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.970 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say, you are this
sexuality or that sexuality

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.625 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:21.000 align:middle line:84%
You are this culture, you're
that culture, this religion,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.875 align:middle line:90%
you're that religion.

00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:23.485 align:middle line:90%
It's what the head does.

00:14:23.485 --> 00:14:24.860 align:middle line:84%
What the heart
does is say, we're

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:26.200 align:middle line:90%
all expressions of each other.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.680 align:middle line:84%
We're just points of attention
in the same consciousness

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:90%
having different experiences.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And so love is not
just what we perceive

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:43.640 align:middle line:90%
it to be in human society.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm attracted to you,
and all these other things.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:52.110 align:middle line:84%
It is the fundamental
energetic consciousness

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:58.300 align:middle line:90%
state that unifies all of us.

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:03.150 align:middle line:84%
It unifies humans with
trees and animals.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:07.470 align:middle line:84%
It unifies humans with the sky,
with the rain, with the wind,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.630 align:middle line:90%
with the air.

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And once we withdraw from that,
this can only see the parts.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.210 align:middle line:90%
This could see the whole.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:90%
So we have these phrases.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.280 align:middle line:90%
We talk about psychopaths.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.730 align:middle line:90%
We talk about evil.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.630 align:middle line:84%
What is evil except
the absence of love?

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Love is life.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy, the
very foundation of life.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:45.250 align:middle line:84%
You spell evil
backwards and it's live.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Evil is an inversion
of life because evil

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:55.750 align:middle line:84%
is the absence of love,
the very source of life.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And what the world
needs to transform

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:05.290 align:middle line:84%
it is an infusion of
what comes from here.

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Because what has created
this reality that

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:84%
has so many, if
you like, problems,

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.800 align:middle line:84%
has so many challenges,
so many things

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:21.360 align:middle line:84%
we'd like not to be
happening, what's created

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:90%
it is an absence of love.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:middle line:84%
What is a war if not
an absence of love?

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I see this word
hate used all the time today.

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.920 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:49.380 align:middle line:84%
If you hate something you
believe is malevolent or bad,

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:54.420 align:middle line:84%
you become the malevolence
because you are expressing,

00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:84%
in your hatred of malevolence,
the energetic frequency

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.677 align:middle line:84%
of malevolence, which
is about hate, thus

00:17:04.677 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:90%
you're connecting with it.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.880 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.940 align:middle line:90%
What you hate you become.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.030 align:middle line:84%
What you fight you
become because you make

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:18.930 align:middle line:90%
this vibrational connection.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And what do we see
now more and more?

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:30.800 align:middle line:84%
We have anti-hate organizations
and anti-hate protests.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.540 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:36.640 align:middle line:90%
You want to stop fascism?

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:41.097 align:middle line:84%
You want to stop the emergence
of a fascist society?

00:17:41.097 --> 00:17:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Well, stop acting like one then!

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:47.450 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:49.230 align:middle line:90%
You don't like hate.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Nor do I. So let's
have some love then.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.630 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.630 --> 00:18:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And you have this hate,
hating, anti-hating hate,

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:07.040 align:middle line:84%
and so it goes on in this
dark spiral that spirals down

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.670 align:middle line:84%
into more and more conflict and
violence and animosity, which

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:13.784 align:middle line:90%
is what we're seeing now.

00:18:13.784 --> 00:18:19.210 align:middle line:84%
What is the only thing
that will transform that?

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:84%
The opposite of
what is causing it.

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, love is not
to agree with everything

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.990 align:middle line:90%
and it's not to roll over.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:40.420 align:middle line:84%
I think I've got a fair
record, in the last 30 years,

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:84%
of not rolling
over, but it doesn't

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.510 align:middle line:84%
mean you have to hate
the people that you're

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:52.232 align:middle line:84%
challenging and exposing because
if you do, you become them.

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:57.292 align:middle line:84%
And there's this other
idea that love is weak.

00:18:57.292 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, he's into love.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:00.610 align:middle line:90%
What are you into?

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, I'm strong.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm anti-hate.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.180 align:middle line:90%
Love is weak.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:90%


00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Love is the very absence of what
is perceived to be weakness.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:17.810 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it will always do
what it knows to be right.

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.400 align:middle line:84%
It won't consider
consequences for doing

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.483 align:middle line:90%
what it knows to be right.

00:19:23.483 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:90%
It will just do them.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Another thing about love
is the absence of fear.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Because what love
connects us to,

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:38.850 align:middle line:84%
the very fabric
of all existence,

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.315 align:middle line:84%
is the understanding that
there is nothing to fear.

00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:45.590 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:47.830 align:middle line:90%
What is death?

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.210 align:middle line:84%
It's a transition
of our awareness,

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:56.130 align:middle line:84%
our point of attention, into
another reality of experience.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.300 align:middle line:90%
It's another birth.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.005 align:middle line:90%
It's not death at all.

00:20:00.005 --> 00:20:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So what is there
to be frightened

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.025 align:middle line:90%
about in terms of that?

00:20:04.025 --> 00:20:05.900 align:middle line:84%
What is there to be
frightened about in terms

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:84%
what people say about
us, and what have you,

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.820 align:middle line:84%
when we are on an
infinite journey

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is just an
infinitesimal little brief

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:17.688 align:middle line:90%
experience?

00:20:17.688 --> 00:20:18.730 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing to fear.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Love knows that, so it
will always stand up

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:23.980 align:middle line:90%
for what it knows to be right.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, people
talk about courage,

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
which is a great thing,
but what is courage?

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:38.770 align:middle line:84%
It's the ability to overcome
fear and do it anyway.

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But there's another stage
beyond that in which

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.570 align:middle line:84%
you eliminate the fear
and no longer need

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:53.020 align:middle line:84%
the courage to overcome
what is no longer there.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's a challenge in
this world, of course it is,

00:20:55.270 --> 00:21:02.660 align:middle line:84%
but that's what love in its
prime state actually is.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:07.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy that
will change everything.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And just observe the spectrum
of human society, all the things

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:84%
that happen, the wars,
the conflicts, the hunger,

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:84%
the homelessness, the
oppression, the censorship,

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and every single one of those
things is the absence of love.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:84%
How can you allow a situation,
if you're coming from love,

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:49.970 align:middle line:84%
whereby people in
ever greater numbers

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:56.770 align:middle line:84%
live and sleep in the streets of
Los Angeles where the rats now

00:21:56.770 --> 00:22:03.640 align:middle line:84%
run amok and even typhus
is breaking out in places?

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.990 align:middle line:84%
People will sit around
a table and mentally

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:13.030 align:middle line:84%
discuss the problem and the
economics of the problem.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:18.650 align:middle line:90%
Love says, it can't happen.

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't care about you figures.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:25.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't care about
your calculator.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:29.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what some
accountant is telling you.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:37.510 align:middle line:84%
This is absolutely unacceptable
to this, so whatever it takes,

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:40.300 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be done.

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:90%
That's what love does.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.580 align:middle line:84%
And love will look at demands
that your country is going

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:57.020 align:middle line:84%
to bomb another country, and
it will, from that perspective,

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.710 align:middle line:90%
see the nonsense of it.

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:03.050 align:middle line:84%
The nonsense of
pepper bombing cities

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:08.360 align:middle line:84%
of civilians that have
played no part in what

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.550 align:middle line:84%
is claimed to be
the reason you have

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.030 align:middle line:90%
to go and bomb that country.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:13.830 align:middle line:90%
This?

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:14.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:90%
They've done that.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.785 align:middle line:90%
He's killing his own people.

00:23:16.785 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:90%
So what are we going to do?

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.952 align:middle line:84%
We're going to kill some
more of their own people

00:23:19.952 --> 00:23:22.680 align:middle line:90%
to protect them from violence.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:90%
That makes sense.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.580 align:middle line:90%
This?

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:27.380 align:middle line:90%
Are you insane?

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:30.130 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:34.540 align:middle line:84%
This is not interested
in bombing people.

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Bombing people?

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:90%
They are expressions of me.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.485 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to bomb
expression me?

00:23:45.485 --> 00:23:46.285 align:middle line:90%
Are you mad?

00:23:46.285 --> 00:23:50.410 align:middle line:90%


00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the completely
different point

00:23:52.930 --> 00:24:03.300 align:middle line:84%
of perception of everything that
this brings and this justifies.

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:12.490 align:middle line:84%
So people will love those
immediately around them

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:18.312 align:middle line:84%
where they have a connection
and daily interaction,

00:24:18.312 --> 00:24:19.270 align:middle line:90%
and that's fair enough.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:19.930 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wrong with that.

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:90%
Good thing.

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:30.690 align:middle line:84%
But this love looks at little
kids in Libya and Syria

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:36.770 align:middle line:84%
and Iran and Lebanon,
wherever, and says,

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.803 align:middle line:90%
well, hold on a minute.

00:24:38.803 --> 00:24:41.220 align:middle line:84%
They're just little children
just like the little children

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:42.900 align:middle line:90%
you say you love.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Why are you saying that
it would be so terribly

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:55.310 align:middle line:84%
wrong for violence to be
applied to your children

00:24:55.310 --> 00:25:00.630 align:middle line:84%
but OK to be applied
to those children?

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Because that's not really love.

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.860 align:middle line:90%
That's a different connection.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:07.950 align:middle line:84%
Love connects to
everyone and says

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:13.590 align:middle line:84%
that little kids in Syria
that we've never met and know

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:17.700 align:middle line:84%
nothing about are
just as important

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.340 align:middle line:84%
as the children in our
house that we see every day.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Because they are expressions
of all that is, as we are,

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.450 align:middle line:84%
and as these children
in our own house are.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a completely different
way of perceiving the world,

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.570 align:middle line:84%
and it will change
everything because it

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.810 align:middle line:90%
sees the unity of everything.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:44.150 align:middle line:84%
It sees the equal
importance of everything

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:46.210 align:middle line:84%
because everything
is an expression

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:90%
of the same consciousness.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Why would one expression
of the same consciousness

00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:58.550 align:middle line:84%
be considered more
important than another?

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:84%
It wouldn't, if you
see it as a whole,

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:84%
and this does because,
in its foundation state,

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:09.180 align:middle line:84%
this is what the
whole ultimately is.

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.940 align:middle line:84%
What we've done in this reality,
and been manipulated to do,

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:19.480 align:middle line:84%
is to withdraw from that unity,
that knowingness of unity,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:84%
into the divisions of
mind and the divisions

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:84%
of perceived different
unconnected people, events,

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:39.890 align:middle line:84%
instead of realizing
it's one seamless state

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.100 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you took a baseball
bat and you smashed yourself

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.740 align:middle line:84%
with it, they'd
say you were crazy.

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:90%
Mad.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.340 align:middle line:90%
That man's mad.

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.320 align:middle line:84%
He's hit himself
with a baseball bat.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.717 align:middle line:84%
But if you take the
whole perspective,

00:26:59.717 --> 00:27:02.050 align:middle line:84%
we are all expressions of the
same consciousness, that's

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.200 align:middle line:90%
basically what we're doing.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.560 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it funny, really?

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.400 align:middle line:90%
Oh my God.

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.760 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:21.830 align:middle line:84%
If you take the biggest view
of reality and who we are,

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:27.210 align:middle line:84%
the American, British,
French, whatever,

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:34.700 align:middle line:84%
pilots who are bombing
civilians in the Middle East

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.350 align:middle line:84%
are actually, from
that perspective,

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:39.770 align:middle line:90%
they're bombing themselves.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:41.930 align:middle line:90%
It's insane.

00:27:41.930 --> 00:27:43.430 align:middle line:90%
That knows that.

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:46.570 align:middle line:84%
This doesn't because
it only sees parts.

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:49.670 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't see the whole.

00:27:49.670 --> 00:28:01.400 align:middle line:84%
So love is far more than
people have perceived it to be.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not attraction.

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:03.980 align:middle line:90%
It can be an expression of it.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.710 align:middle line:90%


00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:11.690 align:middle line:84%
It's friendship, unconditional
love in our interaction.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:16.670 align:middle line:10%
But crucially, it's
that level of awareness

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:23.210 align:middle line:10%
that sees that we're all one
and the divisions between us

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:29.540 align:middle line:10%
are just illusions
of this reality

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.420 align:middle line:10%
that we've been
manipulated to perceive.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.760 align:middle line:84%
How do you take
control of your life

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:84%
back, your perceptions
back, human society back?

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.110 align:middle line:84%
You do that, and
everything changes.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:90%
How do I know that?

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Because that is what has
created what we see now.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.580 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.670 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:55.120 align:middle line:90%
