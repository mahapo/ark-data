00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm David Icke.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.710 align:middle line:84%
And this time we're going
to discuss the end game.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:26.050 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.830 align:middle line:10%
Where is humanity
ultimately being taken?

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:10%
Well it's becoming
clearer and clearer

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.910 align:middle line:10%
what the answer to
that question is simply

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:50.650 align:middle line:10%
by the unfolding of human
society events and happenings.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what has
become the dominating force

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:84%
in human society in
recent years so fast?

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:90%
Technology.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:90%
So what is the end game?

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.300 align:middle line:84%
It is to connect
the human mind brain

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
to artificial intelligence, AI,
so AI becomes the human mind.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Up to this point,
human perception

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.190 align:middle line:84%
has been manipulated by
control of information.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.960 align:middle line:84%
This end game is to go to
the next stage beyond that

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:84%
and ensure that human
perception doesn't

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.295 align:middle line:84%
need manipulating anymore,
because it's coming direct.

00:01:45.295 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And what I call the
totalitarian tiptoe towards that

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.120 align:middle line:84%
is so blatant all
around us today.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's called the smart grid.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.330 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything new that
happens now that is created,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.081 align:middle line:84%
that is introduced
now, it seems not,

00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:14.630 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't have the word
smart in front of it--

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.090 align:middle line:84%
smart meters, smart cars, smart
phones, smart televisions,

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.890 align:middle line:90%
smart everything.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, the pennies start
to drop, and the dots

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.370 align:middle line:84%
start to connect when we
realize that if it's got smart

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.050 align:middle line:84%
in front of it, it's connected
to an agenda, in which all

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:84%
the smart objects, smart
techniques, smart everything

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.640 align:middle line:84%
are interconnected to form
what is planned to be,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.375 align:middle line:84%
what is unfolding all the
time, a phenomenal human grid

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:55.175 align:middle line:90%
of control.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:90%


00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:84%
The smart grid is
designed through AI

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:84%
to control everything, control
every aspect of human life.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Just look today at
how much more each day

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:84%
artificial intelligence
is dictating events,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.960 align:middle line:90%
making decisions.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:84%
More and more
they're introducing

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.620 align:middle line:84%
weaponry and military
technology that's

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.260 align:middle line:84%
controlled not by
humans making decisions,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.480 align:middle line:90%
but by AI making decisions.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
Increasingly moving
towards the point

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.230 align:middle line:84%
where AI is deciding
who lives and who dies.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:90%
This is no accident.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.590 align:middle line:90%
This is the totalitarian tiptoe.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.243 align:middle line:84%
And I'll explain
later how it's worked,

00:03:48.243 --> 00:03:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and how we've got to
this point, and how

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.590 align:middle line:84%
the manipulation of perception
has got us to this point

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
through the constant
introduction of more and more

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:90%
sophisticated technology.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, the smart grid is
based on the internet.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.830 align:middle line:84%
And there are many good
things about the internet.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
And primarily, from
my point of view,

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:84%
has been the free
flow of information.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.510 align:middle line:84%
But there is a big
ulterior motive

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.870 align:middle line:84%
to the internet, which
involves this smart grid

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and this totality
of human control.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing
now is the internet

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
being changed so that
the good things about it,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:84%
the free flow of information,
discourse, and opinion,

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.680 align:middle line:84%
are increasingly
deleted, leaving

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:52.180 align:middle line:84%
the benefits of the internet
to the networks of control.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:84%
So how did the
internet come about?

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.654 align:middle line:84%
Well, the organization that
claims credit for the internet

00:05:01.654 --> 00:05:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and for the internet
to actually be possible

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.610 align:middle line:90%
is an organization called DARPA.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
This is the technological arm,
the technological development

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:90%
arm of the pentagon.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:84%
And DARPA gives the
world beautiful gifts--

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.690 align:middle line:90%
it's a lovely organization--

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.150 align:middle line:84%
like death rays, and more
and more sophisticated

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.630 align:middle line:84%
ways of killing people without
damaging the furniture.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.080 align:middle line:90%
Lovely organization.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And so the internet was
made possible by DARPA.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.730 align:middle line:84%
If DARPA wants it, it
ain't good for humanity.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.140 align:middle line:84%
But you see, if they were
going to bring in the internet

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.130 align:middle line:84%
and they were going to make it,
which is what the ambition was,

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.610 align:middle line:84%
the foundation of human
society to a point

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:84%
where it's
irreversible, well, it's

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.980 align:middle line:84%
no good trying to sell from
the start the kind of internet

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.455 align:middle line:84%
that it's now becoming
with all this censorship.

00:06:08.455 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
So we had the free
flow of information.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:90%
It was great.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.020 align:middle line:84%
And people could have discourse
and discussion in an atmosphere

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.790 align:middle line:90%
of openness and freedom.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:23.880 align:middle line:84%
And that was very good
for people like me

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
that allowed us
to get information

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:90%
out that wouldn't normally.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:35.990 align:middle line:84%
But that was just some price
that the shadow networks

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.080 align:middle line:84%
had to pay to get
to the point where

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.010 align:middle line:84%
the internet was the central
pillar of human society.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.960 align:middle line:90%
Once that point was reached--

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.210 align:middle line:90%
and they've reached it now--

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
then they can start
and are bringing

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.440 align:middle line:84%
in the censorship and the
restrictions that takes away

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:84%
the good things of the internet
from the human point of view,

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and keeps the good
things of the internet

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:90%
from the cabal point of view.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So the next stage after
creating the internet was

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:84%
to create something called
the internet of things.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:84%
And it just shows how fast it
is, because I remember writing

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.160 align:middle line:84%
books, not that long ago
really, in which I was warning

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.140 align:middle line:84%
about the coming
internet of things

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.660 align:middle line:84%
and what the real agenda was,
and now the internet of things

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:90%
is with us.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:32.220 align:middle line:84%
And what the internet
of things manifests

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:38.020 align:middle line:84%
as is virtually everything
connected to the internet.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Your fridge, your
car, all these things

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.450 align:middle line:84%
connected to the
internet, which means

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.180 align:middle line:84%
whoever controls the internet
controls all of those things.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.880 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got billions of
devices and items connected

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:84%
and controlled
through the internet.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And now we're moving
to the next stage

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:84%
from the internet of things
to the real goal, which

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:90%
is the internet of everything.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And that includes
the human mind,

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:19.160 align:middle line:84%
the human brain
connected to the internet

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:90%
via artificial intelligence.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're going to
have everyone connected

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.909 align:middle line:84%
to the internet,
even their minds,

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:84%
you have to create a situation
in which the internet is

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:44.150 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, that Wi-Fi is
everywhere, where there's not

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:47.330 align:middle line:84%
an inch of the planet
that isn't covered

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.330 align:middle line:90%
by an internet connection.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is why more and more
and more wherever you go,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:90%
you find Wi-Fi.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.930 align:middle line:90%
It's in trains.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:90%
It's on buses.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:90%
It's in the street.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.430 align:middle line:84%
But even then you can't cover
the planet terrestrially.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening is
that literally thousands

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:84%
of satellites are
going up and our

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:84%
planned to go up to fire
internet connections

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:30.170 align:middle line:84%
from space, from the sky,
so that the entire planet is

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:90%
bathed in internet connection.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:38.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's impossible
to escape from it.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And while people are
watching the game shows

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:47.330 align:middle line:84%
and watching the irrelevant
political posturing

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and rhetoric, the real
power is developing

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:01.090 align:middle line:84%
this technological control
system minute by minute

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.460 align:middle line:84%
by minute, tick,
tick, tick, tick.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.220 align:middle line:84%
And ironically,
the person that's

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:15.200 align:middle line:84%
putting more of these internet
satellites up than anyone else

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:19.550 align:middle line:84%
through his SpaceX
operation is Elon Musk,

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
which is, I say, it's strange,
because Elon Musk, of course,

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:28.830 align:middle line:84%
has come out and said that AI
could be the end of humanity.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you
connect AI to the human brain

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and AI becomes the human mind
and becomes human perception,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.360 align:middle line:90%
of course, what's that?

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.330 align:middle line:84%
It's the end of
humanity as we know it.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:84%
So Elon, mate, what are
you helping them do it for?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Why have you started a company
called Neuralink to connect

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.160 align:middle line:90%
the human brain to technology?

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.555 align:middle line:90%


00:10:52.555 --> 00:10:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I think we should have
him answer personally.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:90%
Just my opinion.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you have
Google's Ray Kurzweil

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:84%
who's been very
vocal and open, even

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:11.800 align:middle line:84%
giving us a time, a year, 2030,
when he says the human brain

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:90%
will be connected to AI, and--

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:90%
these are his own words--

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:22.320 align:middle line:84%
that once that
connection is made,

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.720 align:middle line:84%
more and more of
human thinking will

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:28.530 align:middle line:84%
be done by artificial
intelligence until, again--

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.920 align:middle line:84%
his words-- human
thinking as we know it

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.620 align:middle line:84%
now will be
virtually negligible.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And AI will be the human
individual and collective mind

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:90%
and perception.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.790 align:middle line:90%
So why are they telling us this?

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.200 align:middle line:90%
Because of the sales pitch.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.770 align:middle line:84%
The sales pitch is if
we are connected to AI,

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.070 align:middle line:90%
we will become superhuman.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:08.520 align:middle line:84%
We will become godlike because
of our mental capacities.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I have another way
of looking at it.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:90%
We will not become superhuman.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:84%
We will become
subhuman and posthuman.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:31.750 align:middle line:84%
We will no longer be human
as we perceive it now.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.750 align:middle line:84%
You see these
companies that appear

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:40.933 align:middle line:84%
to be you doing things that
appear to be one thing,

00:12:40.933 --> 00:12:42.350 align:middle line:84%
but all these
different companies,

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:46.630 align:middle line:84%
whether it's Facebook, social
media, and social media

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle line:84%
platform, whether it's
Google, search engine, Amazon,

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
retail site, they're
absolutely the cutting

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:84%
edge in other areas of
the business of this AI,

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:90%
quote, "revolution."

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
where this is going

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.040 align:middle line:84%
and what the end
game is, suddenly

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:21.850 align:middle line:84%
an enormous number of dots start
to connect in terms of what's

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:90%
happening all around us.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
For example, for this
smart grid to work

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.470 align:middle line:84%
to the level that
is desired, they

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:84%
need communicative
power of at least 5G.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:51.000 align:middle line:84%
We've had the 2G and the
3G, and we've got the 4G.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be
just an increase in power

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:84%
as we move through and become
technologically more savvy.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.690 align:middle line:90%
But 5G is totally different.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's enormously
more powerful.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the power bottom line level
necessary for the smart grid

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:84%
to operate with its
connections to all

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:22.030 align:middle line:84%
these gadgets and devices,
and, of course, ultimately,

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:22.830 align:middle line:90%
the human brain.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:30.910 align:middle line:84%
But 5G is also in a
completely different band

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:34.180 align:middle line:90%
of frequency to 4G.

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And thus its impact on the
human body and human psychology

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:46.350 align:middle line:84%
is vastly more
significant and powerful.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And 5G, therefore,
is being introduced--

00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:55.680 align:middle line:84%
and the telecommunications
industry has admitted this

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.250 align:middle line:84%
under questioning
on Capitol Hill--

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:04.680 align:middle line:84%
that it's being rolled out
without any independent testing

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.040 align:middle line:84%
funded by the industry
into its effect

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:13.560 align:middle line:84%
on human health and
human psychology.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.490 align:middle line:90%
And you know why?

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.520 align:middle line:84%
Because they know
that if they did

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.700 align:middle line:84%
have those independent
studies, people

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:84%
would be shocked
at the findings.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.000 align:middle line:84%
This is why so many
independent scientists

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:84%
have signed letters
and documents

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:84%
saying there must be
a moratorium on 5G

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:84%
until what appears to be
the devastating consequences

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:90%
are understood.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:49.510 align:middle line:84%
But without 5G, there's
no smart grid at the level

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.880 align:middle line:90%
that they want to run it.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And so this is another red flag,
a red flashing light to watch.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:05.530 align:middle line:84%
If something is plainly
dangerous or plainly stupid,

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.550 align:middle line:90%
and it's pushed--

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.150 align:middle line:90%
made to happen any way--

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:16.550 align:middle line:84%
it's almost always the
agenda, because the agenda

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:90%
demands that it happens.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.160 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's dangerous
or whether it's stupid

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:90%
is irrelevant to this cabal.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.880 align:middle line:90%
It's going to happen.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you look
at what has happened

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:84%
to the human
energetic environment

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.775 align:middle line:84%
as this smart grid and this
smart technology has unfolded.

00:16:36.775 --> 00:16:39.840 align:middle line:90%


00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Compared with the turn
of the 20th century,

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.650 align:middle line:84%
the human environment
energetically,

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:55.980 align:middle line:84%
the energetic field
that we operate in,

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:84%
has increased in
terms of radiation

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:06.680 align:middle line:84%
generated technologically by
millions and millions of times.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:11.900 align:middle line:84%
As some experts in the
field have pointed out,

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:84%
never in the entirety of human
history has the human body

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and the human mind
had to cope and deal

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:29.570 align:middle line:84%
with such an environment
of radiation.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And then you think this, how
does the human brain work?

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.040 align:middle line:90%
How does it process information?

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:45.380 align:middle line:84%
It does it electrically,
electromagnetically.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.540 align:middle line:90%
What is the human body?

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:52.910 align:middle line:84%
It's an energetic field of
information, an energetic field

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:56.340 align:middle line:90%
of radiation.

00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you are bombarding the
electromagnetic electrical

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:84%
human brain and the
electromagnetic human energy

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.680 align:middle line:84%
field with
technologically-generated

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.110 align:middle line:84%
frequencies that are
totally and utterly

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:24.470 align:middle line:84%
incompatible to the human
field and the human brain,

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.760 align:middle line:84%
anyone think how that's
going to turn out?

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be devastating
for human health, because

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.390 align:middle line:84%
of the energetic information
imbalances it's going to cause,

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:39.290 align:middle line:84%
which are going to manifest
as human dis-ease, disharmony.

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to devastate
the balanced processing

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.970 align:middle line:84%
of information by
the human brain.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So what has happened in the
smart phone Wi-Fi technology

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:10.290 align:middle line:84%
obsessed society
of very few years?

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I was born in 1952.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:16.230 align:middle line:84%
The great majority
of my life was lived

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.460 align:middle line:90%
without any of this stuff.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.220 align:middle line:84%
It's come in a
dramatically short time,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:23.370 align:middle line:84%
and it's taken
over human society.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened
in the same period?

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:33.420 align:middle line:84%
An absolute explosion of human
anxiety, human depression,

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:41.690 align:middle line:84%
teenage suicide, Alzheimer's,
and other forms of dementia,

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.265 align:middle line:90%
and violent human behavior.

00:19:45.265 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
Does anyone think
that's just coincidence?

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.290 align:middle line:90%
Of course not.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.140 align:middle line:84%
The human mind,
human emotions, which

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:59.030 align:middle line:84%
are also a frequency and
energetic field of information

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.240 align:middle line:84%
are being devastated by
the imbalances caused

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.580 align:middle line:84%
by technologically-generated
frequencies.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And 5G is going to take this
to a whole new level of impact.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:12.680 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And those in the inner
core behind all this

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.420 align:middle line:84%
know exactly what that
impact was going to be

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:90%
and is going to be.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they're
doing it, because it's

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:90%
all about human control.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
So let's just look
at how it's unfolded.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I've talked in another
program in the series

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:52.040 align:middle line:84%
about something called
the totalitarian tiptoe.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And that is where you go
in steps towards your goal.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.380 align:middle line:84%
And you use the steps
to trick the people

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:04.710 align:middle line:84%
into believing they're random
steps and not connected.

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's apply that to the
unfolding of technology.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Stage 1, what you do is you get
the population, particularly

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
the young-- and why the
young are especially

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.760 align:middle line:84%
targeted is they're going to
be the adults when this is

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:84%
supposed to come in full blown,
like Kurzweil's connection

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:90%
to the human brain by AI.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.150 align:middle line:90%
2030 is the year he's given.

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:35.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to get them
addicted to technology.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:40.990 align:middle line:84%
So stage 1, you introduce
the smartphone and technology

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:90%
that people hold.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.890 align:middle line:90%
You want to get inside the body.

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:47.140 align:middle line:84%
You want to get
inside the brain,

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:84%
but you can't go
directly to the brain,

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.610 align:middle line:84%
because people would
say, what's going on?

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.410 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:54.830 align:middle line:90%
You do it in these steps.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:22:01.390 align:middle line:84%
First step, get the population,
especially the young, addicted

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.070 align:middle line:90%
to technology they hold.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Well, achieved.

00:22:06.530 --> 00:22:07.330 align:middle line:90%
Look around.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:08.230 align:middle line:90%
I travel a lot.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what the country is.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:12.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
what the culture is.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.760 align:middle line:90%
Anywhere around the world, boom!

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.590 align:middle line:90%
That's the new human.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Where in places
like China, they're

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.800 align:middle line:84%
having parts of the
pavement blocked off

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.840 align:middle line:84%
so people with phones
can walk so they

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:30.610 align:middle line:90%
don't bump into other people.

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.200 align:middle line:90%
Crazy.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Kids spending their
childhoods like that.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.060 align:middle line:90%
All planned.

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Stage 2, you want
to get in the body,

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:84%
so the next stage is
to get on the body.

00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:52.480 align:middle line:84%
So you have your Apple
Watches, your Bluetooth,

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
endless gadgets

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.740 align:middle line:90%
now that you put on the body.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And what you're doing is
you're conditioning people

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:06.880 align:middle line:84%
to accept technology as
just the way things are.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.830 align:middle line:90%
This is an important point.

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:10.450 align:middle line:84%
When you're born
into the world, you

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:14.710 align:middle line:84%
tend to accept the world that
you find as how things are.

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So people like me, who
have a radar, because I

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:84%
was born in 1952, look at
the world now, and they go,

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.200 align:middle line:90%
"Madness, man."

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.220 align:middle line:84%
But someone born into
it, it's their normal.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:90%
It's all they've ever known.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is why once
they can get the young,

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and those that have
that radar pass on,

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:84%
people just think, well, the
way things are is normal.

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going
to be much more

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.940 align:middle line:84%
open to be manipulated into
this technological end game

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:51.520 align:middle line:90%
than people who have the radar.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.640 align:middle line:84%
But the next stage,
something I've

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.530 align:middle line:84%
been writing about
and predicting

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:03.420 align:middle line:84%
since the 1990s, the
early 1990s, actually,

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.120 align:middle line:84%
is to move to the point
where technology goes

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.750 align:middle line:84%
into the body in the form of
microchips, not just microchips

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:14.140 align:middle line:84%
you can see, but nano microchips
as well, absorbed by the brain.

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:18.615 align:middle line:84%
And when I was in Sweden
last year speaking.

00:24:18.615 --> 00:24:20.010 align:middle line:90%
Did you know in Sweden--

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:84%
at the time I speak anyways,
it's probably more by time

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:90%
you see this--

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.300 align:middle line:84%
around 3,000 people
have been microchipped.

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And some of them have
parties to celebrate the fact

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.930 align:middle line:90%
that they're microchipped.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:33.220 align:middle line:84%
Are now they can open
doors without pushing them.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, crikey.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:90%
What an advancement.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.330 align:middle line:90%
And this is where it's going.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And so you go what you
can hold, on your body,

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:45.540 align:middle line:90%
in your body, connection to AI.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.530 align:middle line:90%


00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:51.530 align:middle line:90%
And it's a mind game.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And there's another
part of this mind game.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:25:00.700 align:middle line:84%
To get people to accept
connecting themselves to AI,

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:02.950 align:middle line:90%
they have to make--

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:84%
before that physical
connection will

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.860 align:middle line:84%
be made and be
accepted to be made,

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.750 align:middle line:84%
they have to make a
psychological connection.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening
is these devices--

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:19.780 align:middle line:84%
please don't tell me you have
one, please, for your sake--

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:24.700 align:middle line:84%
these devices, where you have
these personal assistants

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:25.852 align:middle line:90%
in your home and stuff.

00:25:25.852 --> 00:25:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Some people have
one in every room.

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.980 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:35.830 align:middle line:84%
This interaction
with AI is being

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.290 align:middle line:84%
manipulated to become
an interaction as

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.660 align:middle line:90%
if I'm AI is human.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:43.870 align:middle line:84%
And this psychological
connection to AI

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.315 align:middle line:84%
is being manipulated
through these devices

00:25:46.315 --> 00:25:48.190 align:middle line:84%
and endless other ways
that we're interacting

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:52.080 align:middle line:90%
with AI now as if it's human.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.300 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is once the
psychological connection

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.110 align:middle line:10%
is made, then people
will be open to make

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.000 align:middle line:10%
the physical
connection and allow

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.380 align:middle line:10%
AI to become the controller
of the human brain

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:08.025 align:middle line:10%
and the human
perception or process.

00:26:08.025 --> 00:26:11.060 align:middle line:90%


00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.950 align:middle line:90%
All these things are connected.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And all you need
to know to see this

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:24.290 align:middle line:84%
is to take a step back,
look at its totality,

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.530 align:middle line:90%
and know what the end game is.

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:30.820 align:middle line:84%
The end game is connecting
AI to the human brain

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.400 align:middle line:90%
so AI becomes the human mind.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.840 align:middle line:90%
Hold that.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:40.690 align:middle line:84%
Hold that as the
outcome that's required,

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and then you'll see
the steps towards it

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:84%
over, and over, and over
again all around us.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.870 align:middle line:84%
The idea is get people
so focused on that they

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:55.450 align:middle line:84%
don't do that, and thus
don't see that they're

00:26:55.450 --> 00:27:00.740 align:middle line:84%
being manipulated down a
very dark and dangerous road

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.060 align:middle line:90%
for humanity as we know it.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
But it's not just
humanity, you know?

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:08.230 align:middle line:90%


00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Animals have energetic fields.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:18.440 align:middle line:84%
Animals have radar,
which interacts

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.250 align:middle line:84%
with the electromagnetic
field of the planet.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Animals have brains
that work electrically.

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:29.550 align:middle line:90%


00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:35.590 align:middle line:84%
Trees, the natural world
of plants and vegetation

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.660 align:middle line:90%
have electromagnetic fields.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:43.660 align:middle line:84%
So this bombardment of
technologically-generated

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:51.130 align:middle line:84%
imbalance is going to
devastate all that as well.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:55.330 align:middle line:84%
Look at how birds are
starting to act strangely

00:27:55.330 --> 00:28:00.400 align:middle line:84%
in terms of their movements,
because their radar, which

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:84%
is guided by interaction
with the Earth's

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:06.040 align:middle line:84%
electromagnetic field, is
being thrown out of kilter

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:90%
by technological radiation.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Look at dolphins and whales
who work in the same way.

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.310 align:middle line:84%
They just beach themselves
in large numbers.

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:90%
What did they just do that for?

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.500 align:middle line:84%
Look at the destruction
of bees, which

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:25.460 align:middle line:90%
pollinate food production.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:33.680 align:middle line:84%
These are the things that
a mature society would see,

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.250 align:middle line:84%
but you can't see in
the peripheral vision

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:43.670 align:middle line:84%
where this is being manipulated
if you're totally focused

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:46.710 align:middle line:90%
on something else.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Pick up a pencil.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.485 align:middle line:90%
Pick up a pen.

00:28:50.485 --> 00:28:51.860 align:middle line:84%
And put it in
front of your eyes,

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.692 align:middle line:84%
and focus your attention
on it, just that.

00:28:55.692 --> 00:28:57.150 align:middle line:84%
Where's your
peripheral vision now?

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:58.067 align:middle line:90%
What can you see here?

00:28:58.067 --> 00:28:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:02.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
perceptual manipulation

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.920 align:middle line:84%
is based upon-- focusing
attention on irrelevance

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and smartphones so we don't
have the peripheral vision

00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.210 align:middle line:84%
to see how the dots connect
and what's actually happening.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.480 align:middle line:84%
And what's been
happening is we've

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:17.970 align:middle line:84%
been manipulated
as a human society

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:22.740 align:middle line:84%
to build our own
technological prison.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:33.910 align:middle line:84%
And when you follow this through
historically in the sequence,

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:36.700 align:middle line:84%
and if you kind of come from
the perspective that I do,

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:84%
that some non-human force has
been behind this manipulation

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.230 align:middle line:84%
all along, you start to
see that what's happened

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:57.670 align:middle line:84%
is that systematically humanity
has been manipulated to develop

00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:03.730 align:middle line:84%
the intellectual capacity
to build its own prison

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.830 align:middle line:84%
technologically, but not the
expansion of consciousness

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:12.220 align:middle line:84%
necessary to have
the wisdom to see

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:14.860 align:middle line:90%
that that's what you're doing.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.060 align:middle line:90%
It's all systematic.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:20.410 align:middle line:90%


00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And there's another thing,
another point in all this.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a question
I never see asked.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:32.760 align:middle line:90%
What is AI?

00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:38.450 align:middle line:84%
What is this artificial
intelligence?

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Yes, on one level,
it's algorithmic codes.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.800 align:middle line:84%
On another level,
it's a level of AI,

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:52.820 align:middle line:84%
which learns from information
received, learning AI.

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:57.220 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, you know
all this information

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:02.070 align:middle line:84%
that's now trawled
from everyone, that's

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:84%
trawled from human society,
and human activity,

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:11.630 align:middle line:84%
and discourse on a phenomenal
level through Silicon Valley

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:18.590 align:middle line:84%
into the intelligence
and military networks.

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:22.970 align:middle line:84%
All that information is
not just surveillance.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:29.380 align:middle line:84%
That information is being
fed into AI, learning AI.

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:37.580 align:middle line:84%
Thus learning AI is becoming
phenomenally, staggeringly

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:41.700 align:middle line:84%
advanced in its understanding
of human society

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.200 align:middle line:84%
and how the human
psychology works.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Do you think AI
having that knowledge

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and that understanding is good
for humanity and human freedom?

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:53.750 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so somehow.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:32:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But then there's another level
of the question, "What is AI?"

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I mentioned in one of these
programs in the Gaia series

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:12.620 align:middle line:84%
about a non-human force
which a group of people

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:16.100 align:middle line:84%
call the gnostics, referred
to as archons, a Greek word

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.070 align:middle line:90%
meaning rulers.

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:25.160 align:middle line:84%
And they said these archons,
in their prime state,

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:30.080 align:middle line:84%
are simply consciousness,
an energetic field

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.820 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:33.110 align:middle line:90%
But they do take form.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:36.360 align:middle line:84%
I go into all that in
that particular program.

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:90%
Well, I asked this what-if.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:47.950 align:middle line:84%
What if AI in that
most advanced form

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:52.870 align:middle line:90%
is actually the archontic mind?

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:58.320 align:middle line:84%
What if it's actually
this archontic, non-human

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.910 align:middle line:90%
consciousness?

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And what if the
connection technologically

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:14.560 align:middle line:84%
of AI to the human
brain is to assimilate

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:24.090 align:middle line:84%
the human brain and the human
mind into the archontic mind?

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:30.990 align:middle line:84%
Thus humans become nothing
more than a hive mind

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:33.990 align:middle line:90%
of a non-human force.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:39.240 align:middle line:84%
I say what if in
a rhetorical way,

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:43.320 align:middle line:84%
because after my 30 years
of research so far--

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm not even nearly done yet--

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:52.760 align:middle line:84%
that's what I'm absolutely
convinced is really happening.

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.070 align:middle line:10%
So this technological
revolution,

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:04.150 align:middle line:10%
this technological takeover is
actually a wonderful example

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:10.090 align:middle line:10%
of how if you connect
dots, what appears

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:18.010 align:middle line:10%
to be one thing in and of itself
becomes very different when

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:21.050 align:middle line:10%
connected to everything else.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:27.159 align:middle line:84%
It is so urgent that
those dots are connected

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and humanity sees where
this is really going.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:35.370 align:middle line:90%


00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.400 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.000 align:middle line:90%
