[JINGLE]

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:10.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm David Icke, and I'd call
today's subject "Perceptions

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.705 align:middle line:90%
of Freedom."

00:00:16.705 --> 00:00:25.130 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.130 align:middle line:10%
>> I've always thought that if
you've got what you perceive

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.060 align:middle line:10%
to be a problem, there's
two ways to deal with it.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.440 align:middle line:10%
You can find a solution--

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.820 align:middle line:10%
and we're drowning in solutions
that lead to more problems.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
Or you can do what I feel is
the more sensible thing, which

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:84%
is to remove the
cause of the problem.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.240 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of human
control and the limitation

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.260 align:middle line:84%
of human potential,
the problem, the cause

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:84%
of which we need to remove,
is that people in general

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:90%
give their power away.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, give
their perceptions away.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And from that, they are
giving their life away.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.360 align:middle line:84%
I've got a quote here I
came across a long time.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I think it's a
great quote, really

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
sums up the relationship
between perceptions and life

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:90%
"Accidents happen," it says.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:90%
"That's what everyone says.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.660 align:middle line:84%
But in a quantum universe,
there are no such things

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.250 align:middle line:84%
as accidents, only
possibilities and probabilities

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:84%
folded into existence
by perception."

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked in
this series about how

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:84%
our perceptions manifest,
express themselves

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:90%
as frequencies.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Every thought, every
emotion is frequency.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
And so a perception is
a band of frequency.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And from that band of frequency,
we interact with this quantum

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
field of possibility
and probability,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.660 align:middle line:90%
call it a Wi-Fi field, whatever.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And we create feedback
loops, in which

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.980 align:middle line:84%
we manifest experiences,
which are manifestations

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.460 align:middle line:90%
of our perception.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.800 align:middle line:84%
So someone with a "little me,
I have no power perception

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.770 align:middle line:84%
of self" will
overwhelmingly live

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
a life which becomes a
self-fulfilling prophecy

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:90%
because of this feedback loop.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:84%
So we've given our
perceptions away,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:90%
and we need to take them back.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And the starting point
is surely to understand

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:90%
how we give them away.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And the foundation of that is
that we take our perceptions

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.305 align:middle line:90%
so often off the shelf.

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:14.820 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And I remember I was in the
Old City of Jerusalem in 1993.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:84%
And I am near the big
mosque in the center

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:84%
of the old Jerusalem, and
that's kind of a focal area.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And I was watching some Muslim
children playing football--

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
soccer, as you
call it in America.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And they were, I don't know,
6, 7, 8, that kind of age.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And it just occurred
to me that by that age,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:84%
they would have a perception,
probably for life,

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.940 align:middle line:84%
of, yes, life, god, and
Jewish, Christian people.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.510 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of the
Old City of Jerusalem,

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.730 align:middle line:84%
it's broken up
into four quarters.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.560 align:middle line:84%
There's a Muslim quarter,
a Jewish quarter,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:84%
a Christian quarter,
an Armenian quarter.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.696 align:middle line:90%
And they're very small.

00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:20.279 align:middle line:84%
And it just occurred to me as I
was watching those little kids

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.390 align:middle line:84%
play soccer that if
they had been born--

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.470 align:middle line:84%
literally in the Old City
of Jerusalem's case--

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
down the street, in the Jewish
quarter, Christian quarter,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Armenian quarter, they would
now have a very different view

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.540 align:middle line:90%
of life, god, religion.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.240 align:middle line:84%
Put the same child in
another situation, where

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.790 align:middle line:84%
they only hear something
else, and they'll

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:90%
believe something else.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.950 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying is,
instead of forming perceptions

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:84%
from life experience,
and research,

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.630 align:middle line:84%
and looking at whether
information stands up or not,

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.260 align:middle line:84%
so many people tend to just
get them off the shelf.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you widen that, and
you look at the mainstream

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.850 align:middle line:84%
media and "mainstream
everything," as I call it,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:21.450 align:middle line:84%
that too is in so
many ways a religion.

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.810 align:middle line:90%
It's a belief system.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a narrative about
life and everything.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So perceptions are so
important to everything.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.065 align:middle line:90%
And we need to take them back.

00:05:34.065 --> 00:05:37.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Parents, for instance,
need to set children free--

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.880 align:middle line:90%
free of indoctrination.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.300 align:middle line:90%
Yes, parental indoctrination.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why people
tend to follow the religion they

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:90%
were born into.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:84%
It's indoctrination
and also pressure,

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
with fear of punishment
and consequences

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.480 align:middle line:84%
for not accepting the
belief system of the family.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.620 align:middle line:84%
We should surely be
saying to children,

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:84%
you come to your own conclusions
about what you believe.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And you look at information,
you look at all possibility,

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
and then you come to
conclusions about how

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:90%
you want to see the world.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:84%
I will respect the
conclusions you

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.320 align:middle line:84%
come to because you have to be
your unique expression of all

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.850 align:middle line:90%
that is and not a clone of me.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.380 align:middle line:84%
And what then happens
is children can breathe.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I can now uniquely
explore possibility

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.920 align:middle line:90%
and decide what I think of it.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I've not got to keep
my mom and dad happy

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:84%
because they go to
church every Sunday

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.300 align:middle line:84%
and I'm supposed to do the
same and believe what they do.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
We need to realize that
we are being programmed,

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.860 align:middle line:84%
or the attempt is to program
us through the "mainstream

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
everything" into this
narrow band of sense

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.400 align:middle line:84%
of the possible so that
we are on that postage

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:90%
stamp for the rest of our lives.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:43.230 align:middle line:10%
Instead of that,
if we want truly

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:10%
to have freedom individually
and collectively,

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.073 align:middle line:10%
instead of just absorbing it--

00:07:49.073 --> 00:07:50.490 align:middle line:10%
I don't care if
it's a religion, I

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.860 align:middle line:10%
don't care if it's what
some politician says,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:54.395 align:middle line:10%
or what some academic says.

00:07:54.395 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:90%
Don't matter.

00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So instead of just absorbing
it, we need to surely say,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.050 align:middle line:90%
does it stand up?

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.130 align:middle line:90%
It's all right saying it.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.336 align:middle line:84%
It's all right telling me
that this is how things are.

00:08:09.336 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to check it out
and see if it has validity.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you from 30 years
of experience of doing just

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that, most of the
time, it doesn't.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So many things that
people believe simply

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.810 align:middle line:84%
because that's all
they've heard turn out

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:29.190 align:middle line:90%
to be absolute nonsense.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.590 align:middle line:84%
And to take our
power back, to take

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:36.360 align:middle line:84%
the freedom of our
perceptions back,

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:84%
we need to give up and
release all rigid belief,

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:90%
immovable belief--

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.425 align:middle line:90%
"we're Church of England" slam.

00:08:49.425 --> 00:08:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.440 align:middle line:90%
And ditch the bias filter.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
what I mean by that.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So many people, they
take on a belief system,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.990 align:middle line:90%
a perceptual system.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And then they filter
all information

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:84%
they receive
through that system,

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.290 align:middle line:90%
through that belief filter.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.280 align:middle line:90%


00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, I'm going
to judge everything I hear

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:90%
by whether I consider it true--

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
not just by reflex action,
acceptance or denial,

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.260 align:middle line:90%
but by checking it out--

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.450 align:middle line:84%
on whether it has,
in my view, validity.

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:44.110 align:middle line:84%
If we let truth and
validity be our guide

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:46.990 align:middle line:84%
to what enters our
belief systems,

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.630 align:middle line:90%
then everything changes.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:90%
Give you an example.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.720 align:middle line:90%
People say, I'm a Democrat.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Someone else says,
I'm a Republican.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:90%
But what does that mean?

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:04.725 align:middle line:90%
That's a package belief.

00:10:04.725 --> 00:10:08.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And so you see the
same in Britain

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.460 align:middle line:84%
with "I'm a supporter
of the Labor Party,"

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.420 align:middle line:84%
"I'm a supporter of the
Conservative Party."

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.070 align:middle line:90%
"I'm Labor," "I'm Conservative."

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.630 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:84%
It means that we are
taking beliefs in a package

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:84%
again, where you either
take all from that package,

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.270 align:middle line:90%
or you reject it all.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And we have an
absolute solid gold

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.080 align:middle line:84%
example of what I'm talking
about now in Donald Trump.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I watch American
television a lot,

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:51.767 align:middle line:84%
and I follow things that
happen in America a lot

00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:53.850 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's very
important to know what's

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:84%
going on in the United
States because of its impact

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:90%
on the rest of the world.

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And what I see over
and over again--

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not a supporter
of Donald Trump.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a supporter
of the Republicans.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a supporter
of the Democrats.

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:16.260 align:middle line:84%
I step back from that
whole illusory diversion

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:84%
that we call the
political spectrum.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But I see Donald Trump say
something, whatever he says,

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:31.020 align:middle line:84%
and I can tell you who,
which stations and which

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:34.650 align:middle line:84%
areas of society are
going to reject what

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:90%
he has said by reflex action.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Because it has no
validity sometimes.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:49.370 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of the time,
they reject what Trump

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:54.380 align:middle line:90%
says because Trump has said it.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And then on the other side, you
take another, take a democrat

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:00.130 align:middle line:90%
like Nancy Pelosi.

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:05.230 align:middle line:84%
People who support Donald
Trump will reject whatever

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.910 align:middle line:90%
comes out of Pelosi's mouth.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.430 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:84%
Not only because
it has no validity,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:90%
but because she said it.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:27.210 align:middle line:84%
It's not what is said,
but who's said it

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.600 align:middle line:84%
that becomes the arbiter
of whether you accept

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.150 align:middle line:84%
its validity in
your belief system,

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:37.120 align:middle line:90%
your perceptions or not.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.250 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm talking
about here is

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:46.220 align:middle line:90%
what I call the sovereign mind.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Sovereignty of the
mind, where you

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.860 align:middle line:84%
as a unique
expression of all that

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:84%
is form your opinions only
on the basis of information

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:middle line:84%
received, which you
dispassionately look upon

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.470 align:middle line:90%
to see if it has validity.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And so in this way, instead
of package beliefs--

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.000 align:middle line:84%
in other words, you're taking
on other people's beliefs

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.860 align:middle line:90%
to be your own--

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:27.810 align:middle line:84%
instead of that, you form
your own unique perceptions.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm listening
to politicians--

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Trump, or Pelosi, or anybody--

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm listening to each statement.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.550 align:middle line:84%
And as you go along, in the same
speech, in the same interview,

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.430 align:middle line:84%
you can go, no,
don't accept that;

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.840 align:middle line:84%
well, I think that's fair;
I think that's fair, yeah;

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that's justified what
he says there or she says there.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And you're picking out your
own unique version of reality

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:07.590 align:middle line:84%
instead of taking
on someone else's.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And this sovereign
mind is celebrating

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:18.505 align:middle line:90%
who we are, which is a unique--

00:14:18.505 --> 00:14:26.620 align:middle line:84%
unique-- point of attention
within infinite reality.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:84%
You're celebrating your natural
state, which is uniqueness.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Your unique take on all
possibility, all potential.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we going
to set ourselves

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:53.768 align:middle line:84%
free of off-the-shelf
belief systems,

00:14:53.768 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
then we also need surely
to set other people

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:10.160 align:middle line:84%
free to be their own unique
expression of all that is.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by
that is, stop policing

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:19.970 align:middle line:90%
the perceptions of others.

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I observe
the world today,

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:32.860 align:middle line:84%
and I shake my
head at what I see.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:39.300 align:middle line:84%
The walls are closing in on what
perceptions people are allowed

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:46.750 align:middle line:84%
to have, where those that take
on a particular belief system--

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.270 align:middle line:84%
fair enough, all the
best, your choice--

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:84%
then insist that
everyone else must

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.150 align:middle line:90%
conform to what they believe.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:58.320 align:middle line:90%
It's a new religion.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.430 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.500 align:middle line:90%
What is a religion?

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.981 align:middle line:84%
What any religion,
don't matter what it is?

00:16:05.981 --> 00:16:08.810 align:middle line:90%
It is an orthodoxy.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.650 align:middle line:84%
It is a set of
beliefs, which become

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:14.670 align:middle line:90%
the orthodoxy of that religion.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.670 align:middle line:84%
What does orthodoxy really
mean in that context?

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It means, this is
what you must believe,

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:26.000 align:middle line:84%
or you're not a true follower,
disciple of this religion,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.800 align:middle line:90%
blasphemer, and all that.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, play that out into
what we're seeing today,

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:38.560 align:middle line:84%
where the new religion
of, you must believe this,

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:39.820 align:middle line:90%
or we're going to abuse you.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.876 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to label you.

00:16:41.876 --> 00:16:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to make
life horrible for you.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.390 align:middle line:84%
With a bit of luck,
we'll destroy you.

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:84%
What is that but
a new orthodoxy,

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.460 align:middle line:90%
a new religion, a new tyranny?

00:16:56.460 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.340 align:middle line:84%
And part of this tyranny
is Silicon Valley

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.970 align:middle line:84%
and the corporations there
that censor what people say,

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.779 align:middle line:90%
and what opinions they can have.

00:17:10.779 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
policing the orthodoxy.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:25.060 align:middle line:84%
They are the new bishops, the
new popes, the new priests

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.541 align:middle line:90%
of human perception.

00:17:27.541 --> 00:17:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
again an example,

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:84%
and kind of earthly
example, really--

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:39.880 align:middle line:84%
the term "conspiracy theorists"
or "conspiracy theory."

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.270 align:middle line:84%
What you're supposed
to do in the orthodoxy

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.430 align:middle line:90%
is wave that away.

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:84%
If you are challenging
the official narrative

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:51.730 align:middle line:84%
that everyone's supposed
to have and believe in,

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:90%
you're a conspiracy theorist.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.550 align:middle line:84%
Do you know where that term
came from into widespread use,

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:02.620 align:middle line:84%
conspiracy theorists
and conspiracy theory?

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.610 align:middle line:90%
The CIA.

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:06.470 align:middle line:90%
True, provable fact.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.240 align:middle line:90%
The documents exist.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
In the 1960s, when people--
you know, those crazy people,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.360 align:middle line:90%
really insane--

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.060 align:middle line:84%
those people that didn't
buy the official story

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:21.440 align:middle line:90%
of the Kennedy assassination.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.150 align:middle line:84%
They didn't buy that one
bullet hit the president

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:84%
from the front, having
been shot from behind.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:38.480 align:middle line:84%
U-turn bullets now or
that one magic bullet.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Did they really claim this?

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:42.770 align:middle line:90%
I do believe they did.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:47.990 align:middle line:84%
Went through several people,
people who didn't accept that.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
The CIA wanted to
discredit them.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Why? 'Cause they were
seeking the real truth.

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they contacted major
media organizations in America.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.460 align:middle line:90%
Like I say, the documents exist.

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And they urged them to label
those people "conspiracy

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.790 align:middle line:84%
theorists" and what they were
saying as "conspiracy theories"

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:11.460 align:middle line:90%
to discredit them.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And all these
years later, people

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:21.210 align:middle line:84%
are parroting and repeating
the CIA propaganda.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.340 align:middle line:90%
The media are doing the same.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Silicon Valley is
censoring people

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.740 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of, "they're
conspiracy theorists."

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:36.910 align:middle line:84%
In other words, on the
basis of CIA propaganda.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And the vast majority
of people doing that

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:84%
have no idea even
that the CIA was

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.690 align:middle line:90%
behind the use of the terms.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But the orthodoxy says,
there are no conspiracies,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:90%
so you must not believe in them.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:90%
And we must censor them.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Do you know what
conspiracy theory

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.450 align:middle line:90%
means if you break it down?

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:09.120 align:middle line:84%
It means the acceptance
that authority lies to us--

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:84%
that's it, that's
the basis of it.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.060 align:middle line:84%
And researching when authority
makes statements, which

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.160 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to become
our perceptions,

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:84%
researching if on this occasion
authority has lied again.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.490 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole history
of authority is lying.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:33.490 align:middle line:84%
But you get so many
people who think

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:39.750 align:middle line:84%
they're anti-establishment, who
jump on so-called conspiracy

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:44.582 align:middle line:84%
theories and conspiracy
theorists when all it's saying

00:20:44.582 --> 00:20:46.040 align:middle line:84%
is, authority lies,
and we're going

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.957 align:middle line:84%
to check out here to see
if they're lying now.

00:20:47.957 --> 00:20:50.510 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.980 align:middle line:84%
What it comes down to
in the end is this.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:84%
You say to someone, do you have
respect for your own opinion?

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, yeah, yeah, I do.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.632 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you've got
a right to that opinion?

00:21:05.632 --> 00:21:07.840 align:middle line:84%
Oh, yeah, of course I've
got a right to that opinion.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.520 align:middle line:90%


00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So why do you think no one else
has unless they agree with you,

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.020 align:middle line:90%
huh?

00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Why do people feel it is
necessary to be so unbelievably

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:31.190 align:middle line:84%
arrogant as to say, I have
a right to what I believe,

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.560 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to
censor and abuse you

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.060 align:middle line:90%
for having a different opinion?

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.775 align:middle line:90%
That's tyranny by any criteria.

00:21:37.775 --> 00:21:40.850 align:middle line:90%


00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:43.140 align:middle line:90%
And what does that do?

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.110 align:middle line:90%


00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:50.230 align:middle line:84%
In any situation where the
few are controlling the many,

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:55.900 align:middle line:84%
the few have to manipulate the
many to control themselves.

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And what I've just described
is the target population

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.780 align:middle line:90%
policing itself.

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:04.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:08.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like ditching
the sheep dog,

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:14.150 align:middle line:84%
and the sheep policing the
sheep to keep them in line.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.450 align:middle line:84%
I've had endless tax on
me-- oh, my goodness me--

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.100 align:middle line:90%
over the last 30 years.

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, historic levels
of abuse and ridicule.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.490 align:middle line:90%
You know something?

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:32.100 align:middle line:84%
I have never once said that
what has been said to me

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.770 align:middle line:90%
and about me should be censored.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.030 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.960 align:middle line:84%
I should be given the
abuse and the ridicule

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.120 align:middle line:90%
that I've had in my life.

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:47.220 align:middle line:84%
I should be at the front
line of demanding censorship

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.650 align:middle line:84%
so people can't do
that to me anymore.

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:57.910 align:middle line:84%
But I am actually at
the frontline of saying,

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.080 align:middle line:90%
I don't want censorship.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.880 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Because once you go down
that road, it doesn't end.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I believe in the
free flow of opinion,

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.400 align:middle line:90%
and view, and information.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And then allowing people
to make up their mind,

00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:24.630 align:middle line:84%
form their perceptions from
that free flow of information.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And people say, well,
what about people that

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:36.340 align:middle line:84%
urge people into
violence or urge people

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.408 align:middle line:90%
to burn this house down?

00:23:39.408 --> 00:23:41.670 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But there are laws
to deal with that.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Then this is the point
after the point of delivery.

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:55.310 align:middle line:90%
And that is very vital.

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.110 align:middle line:90%
Vital?

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.910 align:middle line:90%
It's crucial.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.870 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Once you censor before
the point of delivery,

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:12.320 align:middle line:84%
you are giving
authority the power

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:17.440 align:middle line:84%
to censor what
people see and hear.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, it doesn't
just stop at one point.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.670 align:middle line:84%
It continues and gets more
and more advanced, more

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
and more extreme, which
is exactly what we're

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.710 align:middle line:90%
seeing happening now.

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:84%
They will say to
you, oh, we've got

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.610 align:middle line:84%
to censor before the
point of delivery people

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:40.030 align:middle line:90%
advocating terrorism.

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.270 align:middle line:84%
And most people that
don't follow this

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.190 align:middle line:84%
and what the game really
is will say, well,

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:48.060 align:middle line:90%
that's fair enough, yeah.

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.870 align:middle line:90%
But it don't end there.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.655 align:middle line:84%
The next thing is, we
must censor fake news.

00:24:53.655 --> 00:24:57.300 align:middle line:90%


00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.170 align:middle line:90%
How do you define fake news?

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:01.880 align:middle line:90%
Well, whatever we say it is.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.330 align:middle line:90%
And so on, and so forth.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.760 align:middle line:90%
And you know where that leads?

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:84%
That leads to people
constantly seeing their ability

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.350 align:middle line:84%
to express anything being
deleted, and deleted,

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.940 align:middle line:90%
and deleted, to the point--

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:18.600 align:middle line:84%
which is where it's
all meant to lead--

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:25.320 align:middle line:84%
where the population will
only ever see or hear

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:31.280 align:middle line:84%
what the authority says
they can see or hear.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And those demanding
censorship, and those

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.290 align:middle line:84%
who think they're
anti-establishment,

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:40.460 align:middle line:84%
who break into round of applause
when the alternative media is

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:84%
censored by the Silicon Valley
billionaire corporations,

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:84%
should understand that
that's where the road leads.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:54.460 align:middle line:84%
And you know who will be
included in that censorship

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.930 align:middle line:90%
eventually?

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.750 align:middle line:84%
The people now demanding
the censorship.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.290 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:04.780 align:middle line:84%
If people want
freedom, they need

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:09.110 align:middle line:84%
to cease to be
frightened of it, cease

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:13.520 align:middle line:84%
to define freedom
as personal freedom

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.940 align:middle line:84%
and a different
version of freedom

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.160 align:middle line:84%
for other people who
have a different opinion.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.510 align:middle line:90%
So two things I would suggest.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.980 align:middle line:90%
Just my view, my opinion.

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:36.060 align:middle line:84%
First of all, we have to surely
again have the self-respect

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:39.850 align:middle line:84%
to have control of
our own perceptions,

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:84%
to believe what
we in sovereignty,

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:49.080 align:middle line:84%
in our sovereign mind
choose to believe.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And then have respect for
everyone else to do the same,

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:84%
even if we don't
agree with them.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.920 align:middle line:90%
That's freedom.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.650 align:middle line:90%
That's setting people free.

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And we have no freedom
unless everyone else

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:90%
has the same freedom.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:22.430 align:middle line:84%
Because, you know, people
talk about freedom of speech.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And they say, "there are
limits to freedom of speech."

00:27:26.050 --> 00:27:28.560 align:middle line:90%


00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's no freedom
of speech then, huh?

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.900 align:middle line:90%
What is freedom of speech?

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.960 align:middle line:90%
It's the freedom to speak.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Once you start censoring before
the point of delivery what

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:47.560 align:middle line:84%
people can and cannot speak,
then there's no freedom

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:48.790 align:middle line:90%
of speech left.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:53.950 align:middle line:84%
All that is left is
the, quote, "freedom

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:58.450 align:middle line:84%
to believe what is
allowed to be spoken

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:01.540 align:middle line:84%
and to speak what is
allowed to be spoken."

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's not freedom at all.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
seeing is that band

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.580 align:middle line:84%
of what is allowed
to be spoken is

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.420 align:middle line:84%
getting squeezed, and
squeezed, and squeezed.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very dark road with
an obvious, an obvious outcome.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.930 align:middle line:10%
So perceptions of freedom?

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.660 align:middle line:10%
We need to set ourselves free.

00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:29.620 align:middle line:10%
Crucially, equally, we need
to set everyone else free.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:35.080 align:middle line:84%
Do that, and the world
will be transformed.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.390 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.200 align:middle line:90%
