00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm David Icke.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.189 align:middle line:84%
And today we'll be answering the
question, who built the Matrix?

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.053 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.053 --> 00:00:25.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:10%
I've talked in this series
about the fact that I feel--

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.370 align:middle line:10%
and I'm nothing
like alone anymore.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:10%
In fact, quite the opposite,
as more and more mainstream

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:10%
scientists start looking at
reality from this direction--

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:10%
that we live in some
form of simulation.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:51.980 align:middle line:84%
A virtual reality which has
not been naturally created,

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.310 align:middle line:90%
but artificially created.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And so if that's the case, some
intelligence has created it.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:90%
So who?

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.060 align:middle line:84%
There is a common theme
that is quite obvious,

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
and that is of some force
that's not human manipulating

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.650 align:middle line:90%
human affairs.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.210 align:middle line:84%
And we can look at it, as
many do, in the form of they

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.010 align:middle line:90%
are extraterrestrials or aliens.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.670 align:middle line:84%
Or we can go deeper and see
it as a form of consciousness

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:84%
that takes the form of what
people call extraterrestrials.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
So until the 1920s,
mainstream science

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
said there was one
galaxy, the Milky Way.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you'd have
said at the time,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.980 align:middle line:84%
no, no, there's not
one galaxy, there

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:84%
are phenomenal
numbers of galaxies

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, the
prevailing wisdom of the time--

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.010 align:middle line:84%
one-- would have said,
oh, it's ridiculous.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Don't be ridiculous.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.860 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy, man.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.040 align:middle line:84%
The latest highest
estimate I have

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:84%
seen in the mainstream of
galaxies in the universe

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.255 align:middle line:90%
is 2 trillion.

00:02:28.255 --> 00:02:30.910 align:middle line:90%


00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
From one to 2 trillion,
since the 1920s.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, the potential
for other life that's not human

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.330 align:middle line:84%
is beyond phenomenal, and the
very idea that humans are alone

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.740 align:middle line:90%
is crazy.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.080 align:middle line:90%
But so many people believe that.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.848 align:middle line:84%
And even now if you talk
about it in the public eye,

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:02.640 align:middle line:84%
much of the media will
ridicule you for it.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.440 align:middle line:90%
I have been.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.490 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:84%
But all these ancient societies
describe that phenomenon,

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
they describe the
visitations, and they

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:23.300 align:middle line:84%
describe how non-human entities
are manipulating human society.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And my view is
that an expression

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
of this non-human force, one
of these non-human forces,

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.790 align:middle line:84%
is behind the creation of
the Matrix, or simulation.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look at these
ancient societies, and the way

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:84%
they pass this knowledge
on through the carriers

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:84%
of the knowledge, you see
these different descriptions

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.170 align:middle line:90%
of this force or forces.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:84%
The Star People,
the Shining Ones,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:90%
the Jinn in the Islamic belief.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.900 align:middle line:84%
Actually pre-Islamic belief,
where it came from originally.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.850 align:middle line:84%
And you see descriptions
of the Archons

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:22.630 align:middle line:84%
by a people that go under
the heading of Gnostics.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you want an example
of how different names are

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.350 align:middle line:84%
described in the same
way, then look no further

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.430 align:middle line:90%
than the Archons and the Jinn.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.700 align:middle line:84%
The way they're described, even
in the wording, is so similar.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And so you have this
recurring theme,

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.600 align:middle line:84%
where you realize that
a lot of these names

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.590 align:middle line:84%
for different expressions
of this non-human force,

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.030 align:middle line:84%
interacting with
the Earth, going

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.940 align:middle line:84%
way back in human
society, are actually

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
the same force under
different names.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we take
the Gnostic story,

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:84%
it's very indicative of
the stories in general.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.100 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics, they
weren't a race,

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:84%
they were a people, a
belief system, if you like.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's still people
that basically go along

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.230 align:middle line:84%
with the Gnostic way of
looking at things today.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And what is for sure is
the authority, hierarchy,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Roman Church did
not like the Gnostics.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Whenever the Gnostics
got a location

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
and were being
successful in circulating

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:02.670 align:middle line:84%
their perception of reality,
the Catholic Church, the Roman

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.460 align:middle line:90%
Church, sent the boys in.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, one
expression of Gnostics

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.670 align:middle line:84%
where the Cathars in Southern
France, who were destroyed,

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.860 align:middle line:84%
at least in the public
arena, by the Roman church.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And it culminated in the siege
of the Castle of MontsÃ©gur

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.990 align:middle line:84%
in Southern France in
1244, which I've visited.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:90%
It's an amazing place.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And another expression
of the Gnostics

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:84%
were the people that
ran the Great or Royal

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Library in Alexandria,
which, at one time,

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:58.470 align:middle line:84%
was a place that
held an estimated

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:07.830 align:middle line:84%
half a million scrolls, holding
knowledge of human history

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.510 align:middle line:84%
and of human knowledge
in many fields,

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.710 align:middle line:84%
not least what we would
call scientific fields.

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And that Royal Library and
that Gnostic belief system

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:27.150 align:middle line:84%
again was targeted by our
friends in the Roman Church,

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.800 align:middle line:90%
and it was destroyed.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:42.270 align:middle line:84%
But then, when it seemed that
the Gnostic knowledge, the way

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:84%
the Gnostics saw the world,
to a large extent disappeared,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:54.440 align:middle line:84%
came an amazing find at a place
called Nag Hammadi in Egypt,

00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:07.680 align:middle line:84%
about some 70 miles, 80 miles
from Luxor in the Nile Valley.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And what was found in
a sealed earthen jar

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:23.910 align:middle line:84%
were a treasure trove
of Gnostic writings.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:27.300 align:middle line:84%
They-- it would seem,
it's been estimated--

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.440 align:middle line:84%
were put in that
jar maybe around 400

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.120 align:middle line:84%
AD, that kind of
time, which would

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.409 align:middle line:84%
fit with the destruction of the
Great Library at Alexandria.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:40.020 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:84%
They had not been changed as
traditional religious texts

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:49.770 align:middle line:84%
that have been out
in the open to suit

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:50.970 align:middle line:90%
the authority of the day.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:56.330 align:middle line:84%
So basically, what you
got was what they wrote.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's suggested that the
knowledge that these Nag

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Hammadi texts contained go
back much further than 400 AD,

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:90%
centuries earlier maybe.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.490 align:middle line:84%
And what they say is
quite extraordinary.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
There are now books that
have translated them.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.220 align:middle line:84%
I've read two versions,
at least, in my research.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:84%
One fifth, about one
fifth, of these writings

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:35.710 align:middle line:84%
describe a phenomenon
they call Archons.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And they call them Archons
because that's a Greek word

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:90%
meaning ruler, rulers.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:48.130 align:middle line:84%
And these writings say that
this non-human phenomenon

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:52.160 align:middle line:84%
they call the
Archons, the rulers,

00:09:52.160 --> 00:10:02.780 align:middle line:84%
had created a fake
reality to enslave humans.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And I'll come to that
in a second a bit more.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:10%
But briefly, when you
break down their language,

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:18.600 align:middle line:10%
the way they describe this
fake reality, and then

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.960 align:middle line:10%
you apply that to
the modern world

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:28.000 align:middle line:10%
of technology-generated
virtual reality,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.980 align:middle line:10%
it's extraordinary that you
can see the common themes.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.090 align:middle line:84%
That what they would describe
in their language of the day,

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:43.080 align:middle line:84%
in their culture of the day, and
their environment of the day,

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.290 align:middle line:84%
could very easily be
applied in modern language

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:50.530 align:middle line:84%
to virtual reality
simulation, this fake reality

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.710 align:middle line:90%
that we're talking about.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:58.320 align:middle line:84%
Another interesting thing
is that these writings say

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:04.740 align:middle line:84%
that the Archons in their
prime form were not form,

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.730 align:middle line:84%
they were simply expressions
of consciousness.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:17.400 align:middle line:84%
A state of consciousness in
a state of great unbalance,

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.440 align:middle line:84%
thus their behavior
was unbalanced.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:84%
But that this Archontic
energetic consciousness

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:38.920 align:middle line:84%
did take form in which they
appeared in the human world.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:46.310 align:middle line:84%
And fascinatingly, from
texts that were, it seems,

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:84%
hidden away around 400 AD
maybe, in that period--

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:56.510 align:middle line:90%
only found in 1945--

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:00.860 align:middle line:84%
say that the two prime
forms that this Archontic

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:84%
consciousness took were
reptilian or serpentine,

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and a form that looked like
an unborn baby, or fetus,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:84%
with gray skin and
dark unmoving eyes,

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:28.970 align:middle line:84%
which could be a fair
description of what

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:37.145 align:middle line:84%
it is described in UFO
research fields as the Grays.

00:12:37.145 --> 00:12:39.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:47.810 align:middle line:84%
And to see that connection
in these Nag Hammadi texts

00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:49.890 align:middle line:84%
was very, very
interesting to me,

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:53.630 align:middle line:84%
because one of the
pennies that needs to drop

00:12:53.630 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:84%
is that this phenomenon of
reptilian, gray, et cetera,

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
interactions with human society
is not a modern phenomenon.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:84%
It's just that we're
experiencing it now.

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.630 align:middle line:90%
But it goes way back.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And again, when you scan
the ancient accounts

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:26.970 align:middle line:84%
around the world, reptilian,
and what we call Grays,

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:84%
comes up again and again
in terms of visitations

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.160 align:middle line:84%
One man that I've spent a lot
of time with over the years

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.460 align:middle line:84%
is a Zulu shaman, the official
historian of the Zulu nation,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.660 align:middle line:90%
called Credo Mutwa.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.120 align:middle line:90%
A very famous shaman.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And I met him many
years ago and had

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:90%
long conversations with him.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And in Zulu legend,
accounts, lore, they

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:04.800 align:middle line:84%
speak of what they
call the Chitauri.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And the Chitauri are the, quote,
"children of the serpent."

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.150 align:middle line:90%
Also known as the devastators.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
They are, the Zulu
say, a reptilian race

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:90%
manipulating human society.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting about
the whole reptilian phenomenon,

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.230 align:middle line:84%
when you go deeper
into it and you dig up

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:34.750 align:middle line:84%
the various descriptions of
them, is that they are quote,

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:37.600 align:middle line:90%
"obsessed with technology."

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Technology is their god.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:49.340 align:middle line:84%
They are expert at
technological advancement.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And so when you think where
we are in the human world

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.350 align:middle line:84%
today in developing virtual
reality technology--

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:90%
it's moving so fast.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you think where another
race, much more technologically

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.660 align:middle line:84%
advanced, where
would they be now

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.440 align:middle line:84%
in terms of creating
a simulation,

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.000 align:middle line:84%
which, if you were
being manipulated by it,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:84%
you'd have no idea, certainly
in the daily experience,

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.590 align:middle line:90%
that it was simulation?

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And this kind of, again, comes
back to these Gnostic writings.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:84%
They say that this Archontic
force, which in one area

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:48.370 align:middle line:84%
takes a reptilian form,
created this fake reality.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And humans are entrapped
by it because they don't

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.210 align:middle line:90%
realize that it is a trap.

00:15:58.210 --> 00:16:02.870 align:middle line:90%
They think it's a natural world.

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:11.620 align:middle line:84%
And when, again, you look at
the way the Gnostics described

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
this fake reality,
you can apply it

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:20.560 align:middle line:84%
to the phenomenon that's
become known as the Matrix,

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.420 align:middle line:84%
described, of course,
in "The Matrix" movies.

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And what the Nag
Hammadi texts say

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:41.080 align:middle line:84%
is that this fake reality is
a bad copy of prime reality.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.130 align:middle line:84%
And so basically
what has happened

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.960 align:middle line:84%
is that a copy of
this world as it was--

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.860 align:middle line:84%
Think of "The
Matrix" movies, where

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:84%
they're in the real
world, as they call it,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.418 align:middle line:84%
and then they go
into the Matrix when

00:16:56.418 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:84%
they get attached to
the information, which

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:84%
they decode into that
Matrix world of illusion.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:10.270 align:middle line:84%
That this world was created as
a bad copy of prime reality.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And at the start,
the simulation was

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.310 align:middle line:90%
a reflection of prime reality.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:24.940 align:middle line:84%
It was not same as, but it
was a copy of it as it was.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:29.740 align:middle line:84%
And what's happened since then
is this simulation has been

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:37.120 align:middle line:84%
constantly changed to make,
with every passing year--

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:90%
especially now--

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:44.860 align:middle line:84%
the bad copy becoming less
and less an expression

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.680 align:middle line:90%
of what it's a copy of.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.530 align:middle line:84%
You can look at the
destruction of the rainforests,

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.330 align:middle line:90%
for instance.

00:17:53.330 --> 00:17:57.470 align:middle line:84%
You look at the environmental
destruction in general.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:02.830 align:middle line:84%
You can see the way the natural
world, or this what I would say

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:07.390 align:middle line:84%
is a copy of the prime
reality natural world,

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:15.370 align:middle line:84%
has been changed and
made to be less and less

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:22.970 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful place of
which it was a copy.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:33.800 align:middle line:84%
So if, again, you look at
how virtual reality works,

00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:41.630 align:middle line:84%
you have a source of information
from the virtual reality

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:47.400 align:middle line:84%
game that you are
playing, experiencing,

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and it hijacks, overrides,
the five senses that

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.610 align:middle line:84%
are decoding the reality
that we call the world,

00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:58.500 align:middle line:90%
I call the simulation.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.870 align:middle line:90%
It overrides them.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And so, suddenly, the
person with a headset on

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:84%
and the gloves and the
earphones is experiencing

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:84%
another reality, even though it
seems very, very real to them,

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.310 align:middle line:84%
especially the more
sophisticated virtual reality

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.290 align:middle line:90%
technology gets.

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.200 align:middle line:84%
They are experiencing
a reality that

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:28.320 align:middle line:84%
feels very real that is nothing
more than information being

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:84%
communicated to the brain
through the five senses, which

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:36.300 align:middle line:84%
is hacking in to the information
that we would normally

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.680 align:middle line:90%
decode into this reality.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:84%
So someone is standing
there, or sitting there,

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:46.770 align:middle line:84%
within the reality
we call the world,

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:84%
but that overriding of their
senses and decoding processes

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:84%
means they are experiencing
another world, a virtual world,

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:84%
within the reality that
we call human society.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And what this means is that,
if you can create a situation

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.880 align:middle line:84%
where the information
that you are generating

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:84%
to create this
simulation can override

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:28.300 align:middle line:84%
the normal human decoding
processes of reality,

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:34.270 align:middle line:84%
people will start
decoding the simulation.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And another common theme that
has come to me in information

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.790 align:middle line:84%
again and again around the
world is a common theme

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:49.720 align:middle line:84%
you find, for instance, in
the Bible in Genesis, where

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.990 align:middle line:84%
it talks about the sons
of God who interbred

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:84%
with the daughters of men,
and the Nephilim and all

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.380 align:middle line:90%
that theme.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And so many times when--
particularly in the Old

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:06.370 align:middle line:90%
Testament of the Bible--

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:08.920 align:middle line:84%
you see these stories
and these concepts

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and these descriptions,
when you look

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:84%
around the non-biblical
world of ancient societies

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.010 align:middle line:84%
and the knowledge passed
through to present day,

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:21.280 align:middle line:84%
you find the same basic
stories being told.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.270 align:middle line:84%
With different names
for their heroes,

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:90%
but the same basic stories.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:30.670 align:middle line:84%
It's my view, having looked
at this for a long time,

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.610 align:middle line:84%
that what's being
described there

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:41.140 align:middle line:84%
is the manipulation of the human
form, the human energetic field

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:46.070 align:middle line:84%
if you like, that from which the
body is a projection, to tune

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:53.670 align:middle line:84%
it in to the simulation
information source.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:22:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And once this transition
was instigated,

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:84%
the human decoding
processes were

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:14.800 align:middle line:84%
locked in to the information
source being broadcast

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.940 align:middle line:84%
by the simulation, at
which point humans started

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:25.810 align:middle line:84%
experiencing a reality
they thought was real,

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:29.870 align:middle line:84%
they thought had
naturally evolved.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:36.360 align:middle line:84%
But ever since, it's
been the fake reality

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:90%
the Gnostics described.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:44.650 align:middle line:84%
This Archontic force,
by its very nature,

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:50.310 align:middle line:84%
by its own state of being,
has a very limited range

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.850 align:middle line:90%
of frequency.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I've talked in
other shows of how

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.660 align:middle line:84%
your perceptions,
your state of being,

00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:02.910 align:middle line:84%
your beliefs, your emotional
state, your mental state,

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:05.410 align:middle line:90%
dictates your frequency.

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you are in a
very distorted state

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that we would
then describe as malevolent,

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.220 align:middle line:90%
that is a state of imbalance.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.310 align:middle line:84%
Because balanced consciousness
is not malevolent.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:26.210 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a space of
love, what we call love.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:33.780 align:middle line:84%
So because of this distortion
that we call malevolence,

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:38.820 align:middle line:84%
it's on a very low frequency,
and a very limited frequency.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:45.670 align:middle line:84%
And so what it's had to
do is to draw humanity

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.510 align:middle line:84%
into that frequency band
that it operates in,

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:53.970 align:middle line:84%
and this simulation operates
in, for obvious reasons--

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.590 align:middle line:90%
the Archontic force created it--

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and to hold them in
that vibrational state.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:09.170 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have this
tidal wave of manipulation,

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:84%
not least in the world today,
to control human perception,

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:84%
thus control the human
frequency, thus to hold it

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.670 align:middle line:90%
in this simulation.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Because once you expand
your consciousness

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:23.490 align:middle line:84%
beyond the walls
of the simulation,

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:26.010 align:middle line:84%
suddenly the world
looks very different,

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and you start to understand
the situation that we are in.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we have a
situation where,

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:84%
if we go on accepting
and believing

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:52.560 align:middle line:84%
in the limits of the possible
and the limits of describing

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.330 align:middle line:84%
this world that we call human
that come from mainstream

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:03.720 align:middle line:84%
sources, we are going
to go on believing

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that a simulated
reality is real.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.520 align:middle line:84%
And that which is
controlling the simulation

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:15.660 align:middle line:84%
will go on through that,
controlling our perception.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:20.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's simply a cause
and effect feedback loop,

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.230 align:middle line:84%
where the simulation
gives us our perceptions,

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:27.640 align:middle line:84%
our perceptions are that
it's real, and so it goes on.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:38.400 align:middle line:84%
And what this awakening now is
potentially allowing us to do,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:43.840 align:middle line:84%
this awakening from the
limitations of human perception

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:50.800 align:middle line:84%
up to this point, is
to see our plight,

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.370 align:middle line:84%
to see the situation
we're in, and to start

00:25:54.370 --> 00:26:03.260 align:middle line:84%
to grasp how it works and thus
how we can stop it working.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So how do we break out of
this control by simulation?

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:14.800 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you stop
believing what it's telling you.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:19.270 align:middle line:84%
And you allow your sense of the
possible to expand and expand

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and expand in the
knowledge that, at best,

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.690 align:middle line:84%
in terms of awareness
and knowledge,

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:32.340 align:middle line:84%
we are living in the
stone age of possibility.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:84%
And beyond the firewalls of
this reality lies infinity.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Infinity of possibility.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:40.993 align:middle line:90%
A potential of everything.

00:26:40.993 --> 00:26:45.070 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And if we allow that sense
of the possible to expand,

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:55.080 align:middle line:84%
we allow our sense of
self-identity to expand.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm not my labels, I am
the infinite awareness

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.790 align:middle line:84%
having the experience
called the labels.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.190 align:middle line:90%


00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And if we set other
people free so

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.790 align:middle line:84%
they don't fear what we think
because of the consequences

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:14.580 align:middle line:84%
that we give them if they think
something different to us.

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.970 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we set
people free to explore

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:19.590 align:middle line:90%
all possibility.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:26.440 align:middle line:84%
If we open the heart, our
connection to levels of reality

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:29.170 align:middle line:84%
way beyond the simulation--
that's why they want

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:31.010 align:middle line:90%
closed-hearted people--

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:34.512 align:middle line:84%
it takes you beyond the
simulation immediately.

00:27:34.512 --> 00:27:39.970 align:middle line:84%
If we do that, then the
power the simulation

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:45.100 align:middle line:84%
has over us to control our
perception, thus our lives,

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:50.180 align:middle line:84%
diminishes and dilutes and
dilutes and dilutes and dilutes

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:54.440 align:middle line:84%
until we are the ones
who are controlling

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.090 align:middle line:90%
our perceptions again.

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And not the virtual
reality game feeding

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:02.750 align:middle line:84%
its version of reality and self
that is there for one reason--

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:84%
to hold us in perceptual
therefore ongoing servitude.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:14.910 align:middle line:84%
You know, when you look at
these apparently unsolvable

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.280 align:middle line:90%
problems--

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.370 align:middle line:84%
oh, what can we do,
there's nothing we can do--

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.240 align:middle line:84%
it all comes back to a very
simple, constant recurring

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:90%
theme.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.780 align:middle line:90%
We are here because we are here.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:35.820 align:middle line:84%
When we are here, we
are no longer here

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:40.770 align:middle line:84%
either in our perceptions
or in the life experiences

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.690 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.790 align:middle line:90%
We are infinity.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:50.700 align:middle line:10%
If we start to live it,
then the world of limitation

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:56.850 align:middle line:10%
must disappear because we'll no
longer be interacting with it

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:10%
and thus having it
control our lives.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Like everything, the
complications of the problem

00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.090 align:middle line:84%
are just a perception
of the problem.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
The answers are so simple,
and anyone can do it.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.120 align:middle line:90%
It's just a choice.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:25.000 align:middle line:90%
