00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.640 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:12.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm David Icke.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And today's subject,
the human mind game.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:10%
When people think about a
few controlling the many,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:10%
the obvious question is,
how would they do it?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:10%
How can a few people
control billions of people?

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've talked in another
program in this series

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.500 align:middle line:90%
about the web structure--

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.590 align:middle line:84%
the hierarchical web
structure, if you like--

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.770 align:middle line:84%
through which it
is orchestrated.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
But its foundation
is quite simple.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Its programming the human
mind to see the world

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.070 align:middle line:84%
in a way that suits
the agenda of the few,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.670 align:middle line:84%
pulling the strings
from the shadows.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I've talked in another of these
programs in the Gaia series

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.290 align:middle line:90%
about the big program.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.020 align:middle line:84%
How human society is one big
program from cradle to grave,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
downloading a
perception of reality

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.060 align:middle line:84%
to keep the population in
servitude and in ignorance

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.700 align:middle line:84%
of what is going on, and
indeed, ignorance of the nature

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.560 align:middle line:90%
of reality itself.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But there are other means,
other techniques of perception

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:84%
control, that are used
on us all the time,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.310 align:middle line:90%
day after day after day.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And one that I've been
highlighting for decades

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:84%
is what I call problem
reaction solution.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.780 align:middle line:10%
See, if you've got
an agenda and you

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.420 align:middle line:10%
want to keep from people the
fact that that agenda exists,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.990 align:middle line:10%
then you've got to make it
seem that the events that

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:10%
are pushing your agenda
on are random and not

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:10%
coordinated and not planned.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So say you want to change
society in a particular way.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Say you want more
centralization of power

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.240 align:middle line:84%
or you want more censorship,
more destruction of privacy,

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.340 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.830 align:middle line:84%
If you come out
and just say, we're

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.837 align:middle line:84%
going to do that, without
any justification, well,

00:02:33.837 --> 00:02:35.670 align:middle line:84%
you're going to get a
reaction against that.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.412 align:middle line:84%
The population is going
to be saying, well,

00:02:38.412 --> 00:02:40.120 align:middle line:84%
what do you mean you're
going to do this?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.412 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean you're going
to take our privacy away?

00:02:42.412 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean you're going
to take freedom of speech?

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.915 align:middle line:90%
What are you talking about?

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.880 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.510 align:middle line:84%
So what you do is
you provide an excuse

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:84%
to do it in which you're
not actually saying,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.140 align:middle line:84%
we want to do this,
but saying, we

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:84%
have to do this in the
light of what's happened.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And this is where problem
reaction solution comes in.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So stage one, you
create a problem.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.480 align:middle line:84%
It could be a terrorist attack,
it could be a government

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.850 align:middle line:84%
collapse, it could be
a run on a currency,

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.480 align:middle line:90%
an economic collapse, whatever.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Anything that would
give you the excuse

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
to provide a solution
to the problem, that

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.690 align:middle line:84%
would push the agenda
on in the way you want.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.930 align:middle line:84%
And what you're looking at
stage two of problem reaction

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.570 align:middle line:84%
solution is the reaction,
the reaction from the public,

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.010 align:middle line:84%
which is basically,
do something.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:84%
You covertly create the problem,
you blame someone else for it

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.650 align:middle line:84%
or something else for it, and
then, through a unquestioning

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.000 align:middle line:84%
pathetic mainstream
media, you tell the public

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
the version of that problem that
you want them to believe, i.e.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.680 align:middle line:84%
not seeing who's
really created it.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And at stage two you're
looking for the reaction.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.530 align:middle line:84%
A reaction of a fear,
of anger, of outrage.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And basically you want
the public to say to you,

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.400 align:middle line:90%
do something.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.960 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do about it?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And then at stage
three, those who've

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.200 align:middle line:84%
covertly created the problem
got that reaction then

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.340 align:middle line:84%
offer the solutions to the
problems they have themselves

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.790 align:middle line:90%
created.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to give
you a quote from someone who

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.940 align:middle line:84%
played a part in one of these
problem reaction solution

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:90%
scenarios.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.360 align:middle line:84%
After the Second
World War, there was--

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and people would be, I'm
sure if they're new this,

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:90%
they're shocked to hear this--

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.770 align:middle line:84%
a NATO operation called
Operation Gladio.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And NATO, according
to the propaganda,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:84%
is supposed to be there to
protect the West from danger,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.270 align:middle line:90%
terrorism, war.

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't, but
it's supposed to.

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:20.310 align:middle line:84%
But what Operation Gladio was,
was a campaign of terrorism

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:25.600 align:middle line:84%
to justify more power
for governments,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.510 align:middle line:84%
for security agencies,
more destruction of freedom

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:90%
and privacy.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.400 align:middle line:84%
Because the problem that the
Operation Gladio operatives

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.050 align:middle line:84%
were providing were
justifying solutions

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:84%
that would not have been
justified otherwise.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.080 align:middle line:84%
It operated in Italy, it
operated around Europe.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And this is a quote from a man
called Vincenzo Vinciguerra.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And he was a Gladio
operative who

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.600 align:middle line:84%
was involved in a terrorist
bomb attack and was jailed.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:84%
He's still in jail,
the last time I heard.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And during his hearings he said
this about Operation Gladio.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:22.420 align:middle line:84%
"You had to attack civilians,
the people, women, children,

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.710 align:middle line:84%
innocent civilians, innocent
people, unknown people

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
far removed from
any political game.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.650 align:middle line:90%
The reason was quite simple.

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:84%
They were supposed to
force these people,

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.380 align:middle line:84%
the Italian public in this
case, to turn to the state

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:90%
to ask for greater security."

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:90%
Do something.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.440 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do about it?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:84%
"This is the political
logic that lies behind all

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:52.750 align:middle line:84%
the massacres," he said, "and
the bombings which remain

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:57.460 align:middle line:84%
unpunished, because the
state cannot convict itself

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.993 align:middle line:84%
or declare itself responsible
for what happened."

00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:05.380 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.400 align:middle line:84%
So number one, when
something happens

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
in terms of a world
event, whatever it may be,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.940 align:middle line:84%
a terrorist attack or someone
going crazy with a gun,

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.720 align:middle line:84%
look at what the
solutions to that problem

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.290 align:middle line:84%
are in terms of what the
authorities say must be done,

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and question whether
those solutions are

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.000 align:middle line:84%
good for human freedom or
whether they benefit those that

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.310 align:middle line:90%
wish to advance human control.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:48.470 align:middle line:84%
Now a stablemate with this
interconnected relationship

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
of problem reaction solution
is another technique

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.480 align:middle line:84%
that I call the
totalitarian tiptoe.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.090 align:middle line:84%
It's another perceptual
mind manipulation technique.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:90%
And that works like this.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.450 align:middle line:84%
You are at A, you know
that your agenda is

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:13.330 align:middle line:84%
going to take the
world to Z. But you

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.700 align:middle line:84%
know if you go from A
to Z in too big a leap,

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:24.160 align:middle line:84%
the changes in society are
going to be so fundamental

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.520 align:middle line:84%
that many people are going
to look up from the game

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.820 align:middle line:84%
show and their sport and they're
going to say, what's going on?

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.225 align:middle line:90%
Ethel, Ethel.

00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:34.100 align:middle line:90%
What's going on here?

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.770 align:middle line:90%
What are they doing?

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:90%
So you don't go in big leaps.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.710 align:middle line:90%
You use the totalitarian tiptoe.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:84%
You go as fast as you can
but not so fast that people

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.020 align:middle line:84%
start to see the
pattern and realize

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:90%
that it's all connected.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So you'll go from
A to B, and maybe

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.690 align:middle line:84%
go to D if you can get
away with it, and so on.

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
But all the time, you're
moving towards this Z goal,

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.670 align:middle line:90%
which is total human control.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:84%
And I have this phrase that
I use, "know the outcome

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and you'll see the journey."

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:21.680 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's crucial
to uncover what the agendas

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.080 align:middle line:90%
outcomes are planned to be.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Because once you
know that, you can

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:84%
see the stepping stones,
the totalitarian tiptoe,

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.030 align:middle line:90%
to those outcomes.

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.440 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know what the
outcomes are planned to be,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.987 align:middle line:84%
then all these events
just appear random.

00:09:39.987 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:90%
Oh, something else has happened.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's happened.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Oh, now that's happened.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.410 align:middle line:84%
But there's no connection
apparently between the two.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you know what the
outcome is planned to be,

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.600 align:middle line:84%
know the outcome and
you'll see the journey.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Because you'll see
that these events,

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.930 align:middle line:84%
through problem reaction
solution not least,

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:06.870 align:middle line:84%
are using the excuses to
push us on to those outcomes.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.850 align:middle line:84%
So what are some
of those outcomes?

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.460 align:middle line:90%
Centralization of power.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Anything you can use
and create as an excuse

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:24.540 align:middle line:84%
to centralize power is
benefiting your agenda.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:27.980 align:middle line:84%
So we've had, in the
European example,

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:84%
this incessant movement
to centralization

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.900 align:middle line:90%
of power in Europe.

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:35.930 align:middle line:84%
So it's now in the hands
of a few bureaucrats who've

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:84%
never seen a ballot
box in their life.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:44.840 align:middle line:84%
And these incessant
stages of centralization

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:51.350 align:middle line:84%
have been justified by endless
excuses, not least financial.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:54.020 align:middle line:90%
So the European example.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.170 align:middle line:84%
What you do in the
totalitarian tiptoe?

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.720 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened
with the European Union.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:04.460 align:middle line:84%
They said, oh, well, we
need a free trade zone.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Right, OK, free trade zone.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.955 align:middle line:90%
OK, right.

00:11:06.955 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you're seeing
these free trade zones

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:90%
appearing all over the world.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's not central
control or anything,

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.170 align:middle line:90%
it's just good for jobs.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Good for jobs, yeah.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you start a free trade
area called the European

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Economic Community-- the EEC--

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.920 align:middle line:90%
or the common market.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.872 align:middle line:84%
And then you stay
like that for a bit.

00:11:30.872 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:84%
And then you go, well, you
know, it would be actually

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.000 align:middle line:90%
more efficient--

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.460 align:middle line:84%
here in the market,
more efficient--

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:42.380 align:middle line:84%
if we had more centralization
of power to coordinate.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And then it goes on, and
it goes on, and it goes on.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And through the decades
of the European Union,

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.830 align:middle line:84%
at different points there's
been new excuses and new excuses

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.193 align:middle line:84%
and new excuses to
centralize power even more.

00:11:54.193 --> 00:11:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And now you have
a situation where

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:84%
a few bureaucrats in
Brussels are dictating

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:03.680 align:middle line:84%
literally the fine
detail of people's lives,

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.890 align:middle line:84%
including things like the shape
of bananas and stuff like that.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean fine detail.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.870 align:middle line:84%
It's why so many
people in Britain

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.550 align:middle line:90%
wanted and voted to get out.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
centralization of money.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.100 align:middle line:90%
That's another tiptoe.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Because if you look at
the way human society

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:31.190 align:middle line:84%
is structured today, what
dictates human choice is money,

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:90%
overwhelmingly.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.440 align:middle line:84%
And then you think of,
what is a definition

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.520 align:middle line:84%
of freedom in the world
as it is structured today?

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Definition of freedom,
indeed in any situation,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:90%
is basically choice.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:55.920 align:middle line:84%
The more choices you have,
the more freedom you have.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:84%
The fewer choices you have,
the less freedom you have.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And in the way that the world
is run and structured today,

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:12.190 align:middle line:84%
money overwhelmingly dictates
how many choices you have,

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:90%
thus how much freedom you have.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:23.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you can control money and
hoard the money at the center,

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:26.000 align:middle line:90%
you are dictating choice.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And as you hoard more money and
pour more money to the center,

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:41.270 align:middle line:84%
you are sucking choice, thus
freedom, out of human society.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And that totalitarian tiptoe
is how we've reached a point

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:90%
where a handful of people--

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:54.780 align:middle line:84%
not the 1%, the very
much less than 1%--

00:13:54.780 --> 00:14:00.110 align:middle line:84%
now have equivalent wealth
to the poorest half--

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:05.590 align:middle line:90%
half-- of the world population.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.580 align:middle line:90%
And people call it capitalism.

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not.

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:12.260 align:middle line:84%
Not in the way that
capitalism is perceived.

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.486 align:middle line:90%
It's cartel-ism.

00:14:15.486 --> 00:14:22.450 align:middle line:84%
It's controlling through
monopolies at the center.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And capitalism, if you
like, is control of money,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.620 align:middle line:84%
in the way that
people perceive it.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And so the more money you
can hoard at the center,

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.990 align:middle line:84%
the more control you have,
because you control choice.

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:90%
And that's where we are now.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:84%
I talked in this series about
the permanent government

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.615 align:middle line:84%
and then the here today, gone
tomorrow political parties,

00:14:53.615 --> 00:14:55.740 align:middle line:84%
which people argue about
but have no power, really.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:84%
The permanent government
has the power.

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.360 align:middle line:10%
So let's look at
an example of that.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:84%
People say that the
right in politics

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:13.750 align:middle line:84%
is into capitalism, that side of
economic structure and the way

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.370 align:middle line:90%
it's played out.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:18.890 align:middle line:90%
And the left is about socialism.

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.850 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we've got choice.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Not as many choices as
we've got of bagels,

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.090 align:middle line:90%
but we've got a choice.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.190 align:middle line:84%
Oh yeah, well that's
good, isn't it?

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.955 align:middle line:90%
But have we?

00:15:28.955 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:84%
You know, we're
seeing in America

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
now this word "socialism"
used more and more

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.870 align:middle line:90%
on the left in politics.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.260 align:middle line:90%
We need socialism.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:46.230 align:middle line:84%
But socialism is just
another control structure

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:90%
of the same 1%, or less than 1%.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.150 align:middle line:84%
They control by hoarding money
in the capitalist version

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:90%
of their control system.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And through their
socialism, Marxism, power

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.270 align:middle line:84%
to the people
illusion they control

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:13.850 align:middle line:84%
by the hierarchical
structure of society.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
what has happened

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.390 align:middle line:84%
in so-called
communist countries,

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:25.030 align:middle line:84%
whether it's the Soviet
Union or China or whatever,

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:31.960 align:middle line:84%
you have a structure which is
sold as a people's revolution.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.900 align:middle line:84%
But at the end of
that revolution

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:90%
the same elite's in control.

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.670 align:middle line:84%
They may be different
personnel, but the same networks

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:43.540 align:middle line:90%
are in control that were before.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at how the
control works in socialism--

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.310 align:middle line:84%
non-capitalist countries,
as it's claimed--

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.680 align:middle line:90%
it's by structure.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.390 align:middle line:10%
The structure of the society
gives power to the few

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:10%
to dictate to everyone
else, not least

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.859 align:middle line:10%
by controlling the military
and law enforcement

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:09.540 align:middle line:10%
and imposing the will of the
few, in the communist example,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:10%
on the rest of the population.

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's that structure,
control by hierarchical society

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.810 align:middle line:84%
structure, or whether it's the
capitalist structure of control

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:22.200 align:middle line:84%
of money, thus
controlling choice,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.869 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
mirrors of each other.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Because the outcome
is the same--

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:31.450 align:middle line:90%
control of the many by the few.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And the other centralization
of power that the totalitarian

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
tiptoe and problem
reaction solution brings

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.970 align:middle line:90%
is control of information--

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.450 align:middle line:84%
the fundamental
control that dictates

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:53.500 align:middle line:84%
perception, which is formed
from information received.

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And where this whole mind
game is taking people--

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not being wise now, I've
been writing this in my books

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.050 align:middle line:90%
for decades--

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:09.400 align:middle line:84%
is a structure that I call
the Hunger Games society.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, you know, symbolized
by "The Hunger Games" movie

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.930 align:middle line:90%
series.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is how the Hunger
Games society would work.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:24.710 align:middle line:84%
This Hunger Games society
is designed to be a pyramid.

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:26.490 align:middle line:90%
It is a pyramid.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:31.590 align:middle line:84%
At the top, you've
got the less than 1%

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:middle line:84%
that control the
wealth of the world.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
They control the
corporations, they

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:42.780 align:middle line:84%
control the banking system,
the pharmaceutical cartel--

00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.710 align:middle line:84%
all the cartels, the oil
cartel, all of them--

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and therefore have
the power to dictate

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.320 align:middle line:84%
to human society in general,
even though they're a tiny few

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:90%
compared with the population.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.880 align:middle line:84%
At the bottom of
this Hunger Games

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:04.050 align:middle line:84%
society is supposed to
be virtually everyone

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:84%
else in a state of
deprivation and dependency

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:20.400 align:middle line:84%
for even survival upon
the decisions of the 1%.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And in this structure of
the Hunger Games society,

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
between less than 1% and
the rest of the population,

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:36.590 align:middle line:84%
is designed to be a merciless
police military state.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, the plan
is to merge the police

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.360 align:middle line:90%
with the military.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.220 align:middle line:84%
A merciless police
military state to,

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:52.500 align:middle line:84%
A, impose the will of the few
on the rest of the population,

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:59.100 align:middle line:84%
and to stop the population
rebelling against the few.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, if people just take a
step back and look at society

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:84%
from that perspective,
it's unfolding

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:18.460 align:middle line:90%
before us, like, by the minute.

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:84%
You have the hoarding
of money, thus

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.270 align:middle line:84%
power, in the hands of
fewer and fewer people.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:31.670 align:middle line:84%
You have more and
more people getting

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:38.900 align:middle line:84%
sucked into deprivation, through
homelessness and poverty,

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and you have the destruction
of what people call

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.120 align:middle line:90%
in America the middle class.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.240 align:middle line:84%
A bit different to
the middle class

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.720 align:middle line:84%
as we describe it in Britain,
but not a million miles apart.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.310 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And the destruction
of the middle class

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.890 align:middle line:84%
is pulling more and
more people into

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.372 align:middle line:90%
deprivation and dependency.

00:21:03.372 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is not just
happening in the United States.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:10%
This is happening all over
the Western world, all

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.150 align:middle line:10%
over the world.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And it's the Hunger
Games society

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:90%
unfolding before our eyes.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And unless we start
to realize that

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.930 align:middle line:84%
this structure unfolding
is not happening

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:29.620 align:middle line:90%
randomly but by design--

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:84%
cold, calculated design-- unless
we start to understand that,

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:36.160 align:middle line:90%
it will just go on happening.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.340 align:middle line:84%
But if we understand
it's coordinated,

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:43.650 align:middle line:84%
we might have a chance of
starting to pull back, and pull

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.980 align:middle line:84%
back, push back, whatever,
against this totalitarian

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:54.460 align:middle line:84%
tiptoe that is very quickly
becoming a totalitarian sprint.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you an incredibly
topical, certainly

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:05.260 align:middle line:84%
in recent decades,
example of how

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.450 align:middle line:84%
this combination
of problem reaction

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:12.370 align:middle line:84%
solution and the
totalitarian tiptoe operate.

00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:84%
You look at all the
wars in the Middle East

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.060 align:middle line:84%
that America has
been involved in

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.130 align:middle line:84%
and Britain has
been involved in.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:26.110 align:middle line:84%
We usually come behind-- ruff,
ruff, ruff, yes, master--

00:22:26.110 --> 00:22:28.790 align:middle line:90%
in recent times.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:33.650 align:middle line:84%
And each one has been
given a different excuse.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But they've all
been, A, coordinated,

00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:43.400 align:middle line:90%
and B, long planned.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:84%
In the 1990s in
the United States,

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.968 align:middle line:84%
an organization was
created called the Project

00:22:47.968 --> 00:22:49.010 align:middle line:90%
for New American Century.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:52.940 align:middle line:84%
It has been well written
about and often well condemned

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:59.180 align:middle line:84%
by people that understand
what its motivations are.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And in September 2000,
it produced a document

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:08.390 align:middle line:84%
which was demanding a series
of regime changes in the Middle

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:13.100 align:middle line:90%
East, using American troops.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.250 align:middle line:84%
One of its phrases
was that we need

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:20.930 align:middle line:84%
to fight multiple-theater
wars to regime

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:24.370 align:middle line:90%
change a series of countries.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Those countries are
quite familiar now.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Iraq, Libya, Syria, Iran,
Lebanon, North Korea,

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:40.510 align:middle line:84%
leading to regime
change in China.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:45.230 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:50.890 align:middle line:84%
This document was published
in September 2000,

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:54.860 align:middle line:84%
and the people that wrote
it, who were behind it,

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.530 align:middle line:84%
came to power
either in government

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:84%
or in the background
in government

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:07.390 align:middle line:84%
with Boy George Bush
in January 2001.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And what it said
in this document

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.260 align:middle line:84%
is that, if we're going
to justify these regime

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
changes and these multiple
wars to the American people,

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.280 align:middle line:90%
what America needs--

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.420 align:middle line:90%
and this was the phrase--

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:30.100 align:middle line:90%
is a new Pearl Harbor.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And the phrase in
the document said

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:39.660 align:middle line:84%
this transformation, all these
regime changes they wanted,

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:84%
basically would be
necessarily slow,

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:50.800 align:middle line:84%
quote, "absent some catastrophic
and catalyzing event,

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.030 align:middle line:90%
like a new Pearl Harbor."

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:56.950 align:middle line:90%


00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.930 align:middle line:84%
One year to the month
after that document

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:03.280 align:middle line:84%
was published, nine months
after the people that

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.760 align:middle line:84%
wrote it came to
power with Bush,

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:10.450 align:middle line:84%
America had what Bush
called at the time

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:15.400 align:middle line:84%
the Pearl Harbor of
the 21st century.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:25.750 align:middle line:84%
As a result of that trigger, a
series of wars began to unfold

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.820 align:middle line:84%
in the Middle East,
starting with Afghanistan--

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:32.230 align:middle line:84%
and then going through that list
in the document ever since--

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.780 align:middle line:84%
that was started
by 9/11, the Pearl

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Harbor of the 21st
century, and have been

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.460 align:middle line:90%
justified by different excuses.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:41.560 align:middle line:84%
Weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.640 align:middle line:90%
Saddam Hussein.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:43.810 align:middle line:90%
Send the boys in.

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.960 align:middle line:90%


00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Colonel Gaddafi in Libya,
he's killing his own people.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.660 align:middle line:90%
Send the boys in.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.660 align:middle line:90%
So is Assad now in Syria.

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:58.990 align:middle line:90%
Send the boys in.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Oh, Iran is a
threat to the world.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And as I speak, they are
desperate to send the boys in.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.957 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's look at this from
the political point of view.

00:26:10.957 --> 00:26:12.790 align:middle line:84%
You know this thing
called political choice?

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:13.720 align:middle line:90%
You remember that?

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.690 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:10%
George Bush was a
Republican, and he

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.620 align:middle line:10%
was controlled by the
neo-conservative network.

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:28.610 align:middle line:90%
And so Britain-- ruff, ruff--

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:33.620 align:middle line:84%
we had a poodle
called Tony Blair.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And he was the Prime Minister
and leader of something

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.860 align:middle line:84%
called the Labor
Party in Britain.

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.270 align:middle line:90%
The so-called left party.

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And they invade Iraq
on a lie about weapons

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.280 align:middle line:90%
of mass destruction in Iraq.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.500 align:middle line:90%
Why did they lie?

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:55.820 align:middle line:84%
Because invading Iraq,
regime changing in Iraq,

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.090 align:middle line:84%
was the agenda, and thus they
didn't have a real excuse

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:01.730 align:middle line:90%
to do it so they made one up.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Then Republican Bush
and Labor Party Blair

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:84%
get replaced by Democrat Barack
Obama and Conservative Party

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:18.290 align:middle line:84%
Prime Minister in
Britain David Cameron.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:25.400 align:middle line:84%
They then oversee the
invasion of Libya.

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.090 align:middle line:90%
So Iraq, tick off list.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:30.620 align:middle line:90%
Change regime?

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:84%
Now we've gone
from those parties

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:90%
to the opposition parties.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:36.390 align:middle line:90%
OK, now tick that off.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And then in the same period
of Obama and Cameron,

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.460 align:middle line:84%
they started the process
of destabilization

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:51.092 align:middle line:84%
in Syria, which has led
to catastrophe there.

00:27:51.092 --> 00:27:54.290 align:middle line:90%
I'll send in the boys then.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:56.590 align:middle line:90%
Problem reaction solution.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:02.343 align:middle line:84%
And then along comes after
Obama the maverick Donald Trump.

00:28:02.343 --> 00:28:03.510 align:middle line:90%
He's got to drain the swamp.

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:04.927 align:middle line:84%
He's going to drain
the swamp he's

00:28:04.927 --> 00:28:06.300 align:middle line:90%
been swimming in all his life.

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.160 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, I think I buy that.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:84%
And the Trump regime is now, as
I speak, at serious loggerheads

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:23.100 align:middle line:84%
with Iran and wants a war with
it, really, truth be told.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.850 align:middle line:84%
So you have this list of
countries for regime change.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:29.130 align:middle line:84%
And no matter who comes
and goes in politics,

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:32.130 align:middle line:84%
whatever kind of party
or color, same list.

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.350 align:middle line:90%
Tick, tick, tick.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.380 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Because the politicians are
here today, gone tomorrow.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:45.120 align:middle line:84%
The permanent government
is dictating events.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.250 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have so many wars?

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Why do we have so many wars?

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:52.752 align:middle line:84%
Do you know many people in
your life that want a war?

00:28:52.752 --> 00:28:54.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't meet many
people that want a war.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.060 align:middle line:90%
But we keep having them.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.950 align:middle line:84%
Through human history,
war, war, war, war.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you want
to change society,

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:12.120 align:middle line:84%
nationally or globally, in
a way that is irreversible--

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.620 align:middle line:84%
it will never be
the same again--

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:19.210 align:middle line:84%
nothing does that more
comprehensively than a war.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:23.860 align:middle line:84%
After a war, that society
is never the same again.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And when you have
an agenda that's

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:30.130 align:middle line:84%
pushing the world in
a certain direction,

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:32.972 align:middle line:84%
you have to keep destroying
the status quo so you

00:29:32.972 --> 00:29:34.930 align:middle line:84%
can move the world further
in the direction you

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:90%
want it to go.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And nothing destroys status quos
more comprehensively than wars.

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's something I call
creative destruction.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.310 align:middle line:84%
You have a status
quo, you have a war.

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:50.140 align:middle line:90%
You destroy the status quo.

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.660 align:middle line:84%
The world moves further
on down your road.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.610 align:middle line:90%
You have another war.

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Take the First World War,
Second World War, as an example.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And you destroy the new status
quo, the world moves on again.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:03.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's happening.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:06.805 align:middle line:84%
And that's why there is
always money for war.

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:09.550 align:middle line:90%


00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:13.270 align:middle line:84%
When is the last time you
heard any political leader say,

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.420 align:middle line:90%
we can't go to war?

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.210 align:middle line:90%
We can't afford it.

00:30:16.210 --> 00:30:17.010 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:17.810 align:middle line:90%
War?

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Money no object.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:19.600 align:middle line:90%
Homeless people?

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.808 align:middle line:10%
Oh, can't afford that.

00:30:20.808 --> 00:30:22.600 align:middle line:10%
Well, can't afford
this, can't afford that.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:23.400 align:middle line:90%
War?

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.450 align:middle line:90%
How much do you want?

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:27.560 align:middle line:90%
This is why.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And if we're going to
get street wise to this,

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.190 align:middle line:84%
we need to keep
asking all the time,

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:34.750 align:middle line:84%
when we're presented
with a world

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.610 align:middle line:84%
event and an
official explanation

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:40.840 align:middle line:90%
for it, who benefits?

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Who benefits from me believing
this version of events

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:47.200 align:middle line:90%
that I'm being given?

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And if it is
benefiting anyone that

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.830 align:middle line:84%
wants to take the world
further towards centralization

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:55.500 align:middle line:84%
of power, destruction
of freedom,

00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:01.690 align:middle line:84%
destruction of privacy,
destruction of choice,

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:06.400 align:middle line:84%
then red flags should wave
and red flashing lights

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:13.000 align:middle line:84%
should go off everywhere becuase
it's almost certainly a scam.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:84%
We need to stop accepting
explanations from officialdom,

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.200 align:middle line:84%
in whatever form they may
take, from whatever political

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.540 align:middle line:84%
direction-- it doesn't
matter, they're all the same--

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:25.905 align:middle line:84%
and start to
question everything.

00:31:25.905 --> 00:31:26.780 align:middle line:90%
And that's the point.

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:29.770 align:middle line:10%
There's a Russian TV
station called RT,

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:34.690 align:middle line:10%
and it has this motto, "Question
more," which is better than not

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:10%
questioning at all.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:39.170 align:middle line:10%
But it's not enough.

00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:46.780 align:middle line:10%
We don't need to question more,
we need to question everything.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:48.780 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:32:17.000 align:middle line:90%
