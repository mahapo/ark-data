00:00:09.291 --> 00:00:10.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm David Icke,
and today I'm going

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.015 align:middle line:84%
to be talking about
holographic reality.

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:24.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.390 align:middle line:10%
Holographic reality,
the physical

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.240 align:middle line:10%
that isn't and how
we can appear to be

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.940 align:middle line:10%
experiencing a world of solidity
when it's nothing of the kind.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to start with a quote.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.420 align:middle line:90%
"We are perceivers.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.700 align:middle line:90%
We are awareness.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.560 align:middle line:90%
We are not objects.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:90%
We have no solidity.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.370 align:middle line:90%
We are boundless.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.060 align:middle line:84%
We, or rather our
reason, forget this.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And thus we entrap the
totality of ourselves

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.300 align:middle line:84%
in a vicious circle
from which we rarely

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:90%
emerge in our lifetime."

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:90%
So if we are perceivers--

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.830 align:middle line:90%
I say we are--

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.340 align:middle line:84%
if we are boundless,
then how come

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.320 align:middle line:84%
we are experiencing an
apparent physical world?

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know
when you research--

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.500 align:middle line:84%
certainly when I've researched
anyway over the last 30 years--

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.650 align:middle line:84%
tends to happen is you
come across key elements

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.460 align:middle line:90%
of understanding.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And those key points just
keep coming back in relation

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
to so many different
areas, subjects.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, we
are living in a reality

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.390 align:middle line:84%
where the base form is
wave form, wave form

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:90%
information like Wi-Fi.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.030 align:middle line:84%
And the five senses pick up
that wave form information,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
they turn it into
electrical information,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.800 align:middle line:84%
they communicate
it to the brain,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.140 align:middle line:84%
and then the brain decodes
it into digital holographic

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.410 align:middle line:84%
It's the same information but
in a different decoded form

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.428 align:middle line:84%
just as the information
in a Wi-Fi field

00:02:24.428 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:84%
looks very different
even though it's

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
the same information
when it's decoded

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.690 align:middle line:90%
onto the screen of the computer.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And digital is kind
of interesting.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.220 align:middle line:84%
There are different ways
that sensitive people--

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.970 align:middle line:84%
call them psychics
or numerologists

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.080 align:middle line:84%
or whatever-- read
reality or read the future

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:90%
as it's perceived.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And these are
different techniques

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.800 align:middle line:84%
for reading different levels
of the same information.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.350 align:middle line:84%
So, for instance, a psychic
would pick up the wave form

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.630 align:middle line:84%
level of the person, and they
would pick up information

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.940 align:middle line:90%
from that wave form field.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.330 align:middle line:84%
A numerologist
dealing in numbers

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.410 align:middle line:84%
would be reading the digital
level of that information.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want it to
feel like experiments where

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.370 align:middle line:84%
I have had readings with
psychics reading the wave form

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
energetic level and
numerologists doing readings

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.300 align:middle line:84%
for me on the basis of
numbers, and the readings

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.592 align:middle line:90%
have been virtually identical.

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:48.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's because they're
reading the same information

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.420 align:middle line:90%
in a different form.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.760 align:middle line:84%
So digital holograms,
what's also interesting

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
is digital holograms
are now being

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.540 align:middle line:84%
used in mainstream society
to promote new cars

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.950 align:middle line:90%
and what have you.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And digital holograms is what
we call the physical world.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.540 align:middle line:90%
It's illusory, physical.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.920 align:middle line:84%
And like I say,
holographics is now

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.280 align:middle line:84%
becoming more and
more mainstream

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.710 align:middle line:84%
and center stage because
one of the things

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.170 align:middle line:84%
I've noticed is that the
technological world that's

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.140 align:middle line:84%
emerging all around us
is actually mimicking

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.310 align:middle line:90%
the nature of reality itself.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
So how are holograms that
we buy in the shops--

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.550 align:middle line:84%
how are they how
were they created?

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.570 align:middle line:84%
The way they're created,
again, in so many ways

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:01.130 align:middle line:84%
mimics the way we create
them to manifest our reality.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.030 align:middle line:84%
First of all, you have a
laser, and the laser beam

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:90%
is split into two beams.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:84%
One's called the object
beam, and the other one's

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.260 align:middle line:90%
called the reference beam.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And the object of beam
basically creates a wave form--

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:90%
here we go again--

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:84%
depiction version of the object
that's being holographically

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:90%
filmed or created.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And then the object beam
and the reference beam

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.400 align:middle line:84%
are focused onto a
holographic print,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
and they collide
with each other.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And they create what's
called an interference

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:90%
pattern between the two.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And you can liken this,
very much liken it,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:84%
to throwing two
stones in a pond,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and as the waves come
out from the two stones

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:84%
and they collide, they
create a wave form pattern

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:21.200 align:middle line:84%
in the water that reflects the
speed the stones hit the water.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
The nature of the
how heavy the stones

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.990 align:middle line:84%
are, et cetera, et cetera, is
all in that way form pattern.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way,
these wave form patterns--

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:84%
interference patterns
they're called--

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
on the holographic print
are a wave form depiction

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:50.620 align:middle line:84%
of whatever's been
holographically created or put

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:54.340 align:middle line:90%
on that film by the laser.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.250 align:middle line:84%
What then happens
is the laser is

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.310 align:middle line:90%
fired at the wave form pattern.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Wave form pattern--
think what I've

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.120 align:middle line:84%
been talking about
here about the fact

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:84%
that we decode this holographic
illusory physical reality

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:90%
from wave form information.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.360 align:middle line:90%
It's the same principle.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you fire the laser
at the wave form print,

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.820 align:middle line:90%
an amazing thing happens.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, a
three-dimensional version

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:84%
of what's been the
object of the hologram

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:90%
appears in front of you.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And the best of them look
as solid as you will meet.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way,
this is what we're doing,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
and what it means is
that the world we think

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:84%
is outside of us,
is external to us,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.990 align:middle line:84%
is actually all
going on in here.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And there is a fantastic trait
of holograms, all holograms,

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:15.940 align:middle line:84%
which again explains so
much about many things that

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:19.900 align:middle line:84%
appear to be bewildering, not
least the mainstream science.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Can't understand how that
works so it can't be happening,

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.770 align:middle line:90%
that sort of thing.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And this characteristic is
that every part of a hologram

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.809 align:middle line:84%
is a smaller version
of the whole.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:35.620 align:middle line:90%
So

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.010 align:middle line:84%
If you take the
holographic print,

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.390 align:middle line:84%
that wave form print,
and you cut it into four

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:48.430 align:middle line:84%
and fired a laser at
each of the four pieces,

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:84%
you will not get a
quarter of the picture.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:84%
You will get a quarter-sized
version of the whole picture.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So every part of the hologram
contains the information

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.820 align:middle line:90%
of the whole hologram.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle line:84%
So now we can understand
because the body

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:18.100 align:middle line:84%
is a hologram why
reflexologists, for instance,

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.860 align:middle line:84%
can find points on
the feet and the hands

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and other parts of the
body that represent organs

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:90%
and other functions of the body.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.330 align:middle line:84%
It's why if you
look at acupuncture,

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.030 align:middle line:84%
they find points
around the ear that

00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:37.000 align:middle line:84%
represent all different
parts of the body.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:42.490 align:middle line:84%
Because the body's a
hologram and therefore

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:47.560 align:middle line:84%
every part of the hologram is
a smaller version of the whole.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So, again, if you look
at palm reading, those

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:84%
that can genuinely do it,
they are reading their hand,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're telling
you about yourself.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the hand is
part of the hologram

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:05.080 align:middle line:84%
therefore contains
all the information

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.740 align:middle line:90%
from the whole body.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And what they've also found
in the fabric of our reality

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:90%
are fractal patterns.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:25.770 align:middle line:84%
These are repeating patterns
that are basically the same--

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:90%
not basically the same.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:90%
They are the same.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:31.740 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a small
part of something

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:33.570 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a larger
part of something,

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.930 align:middle line:84%
the fractal patterns keep
repeating, large and small.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.820 align:middle line:90%
What is that describing?

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.300 align:middle line:84%
That's describing
holographic reality

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.860 align:middle line:84%
because that's the world
that we are living in.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:84%
So this reality is a
holographic dream in effect,

00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.750 align:middle line:84%
but it seems so real when
so many of our dreams

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.560 align:middle line:90%
don't seem real.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:90%
We know they're dreams.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.430 align:middle line:90%
We wake up.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.880 align:middle line:90%
You say I've had a dream.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.750 align:middle line:84%
But this one seems
incredibly real

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
because of the
power of the mind.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about your dreams.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:23.110 align:middle line:84%
I dream often in three
dimensions if you like.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I experience in my dreams what
appears to be the world that I

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:90%
experience here.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But how can that be because we
accept that dreams are actually

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.220 align:middle line:90%
going on here?

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:90%
So it can't be physical, can it?

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:47.000 align:middle line:84%
But this dream seems very
physical and very real.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And like I say, that's the power
of the mind for reasons outcome

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:52.950 align:middle line:90%
to.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:12:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So we're having multiple
experiences at the same time.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:05.780 align:middle line:84%
We exist and experience
over multiple dimensions

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But the one we are actually
aware of that seems real

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.970 align:middle line:90%
is this one.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.840 align:middle line:84%
As the brain decodes this
wave form information

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
into what appears to
be this solid world--

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:22.910 align:middle line:90%
and this is a quote.

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And what's kind of
interesting about this to

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:30.550 align:middle line:84%
me anyway is how long
ago it was stated.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:84%
It's by a mystic a Sufi mystic
called Rumi, very well-known

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.530 align:middle line:90%
in esoteric circles.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And he lived between
1207 and 1273.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And yet although we are supposed
to progress with the passage

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.220 align:middle line:90%
of what we call time--

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:84%
so we become more and
more knowledgeable

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.280 align:middle line:84%
and we're at the cutting
edge of human evolution--

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:07.020 align:middle line:84%
the very fundamentals of
understanding human reality

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:12.070 align:middle line:84%
were known way back and
have been forgotten--

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.450 align:middle line:84%
I say systematically
forgotten by those

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that don't want us to know
the true nature of reality.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:22.790 align:middle line:84%
Anyway this is what Rumi
said all those centuries ago.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:90%
This place is a dream.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.750 align:middle line:84%
Only the sleeper
considers it real.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Then death comes like
dawn, and you wake up

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:37.860 align:middle line:84%
laughing at what you
thought was your grief.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:44.600 align:middle line:84%
And that absolutely
sums up the situation

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:84%
of how humanity has had
its perception of life,

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:56.140 align:middle line:84%
its perception of
reality, so skewed

00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:01.840 align:middle line:84%
that we're living a reality that
is not even close to the one

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that we think
we're experiencing.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
It was a near-death
experiencer who

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:21.820 align:middle line:84%
said that being really truly
alive when officially you're

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:23.390 align:middle line:90%
dead.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So when you leave
the body, that's

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:32.880 align:middle line:84%
when he said it felt
like life, true life,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.060 align:middle line:84%
and death was almost
returning to the body,

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
not leaving it, which is
an inversion of reality

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:90%
that you find all the time.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.290 align:middle line:84%
But here's a fantastic quote
from a near-death experiencer

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
who is describing what
reality is like when

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:90%
they've left the body.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.570 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:14:54.570 --> 00:15:00.240 align:middle line:84%
They've left the vehicle
that is decoding information

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.190 align:middle line:84%
into this holographic
illusion of physicality.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:07.800 align:middle line:90%
And this is what you said.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.440 align:middle line:90%
Everything from the beginning--

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.850 align:middle line:84%
my birth, my ancestors,
my children, my wife--

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:19.380 align:middle line:84%
everything comes
together simultaneously.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:84%
I saw everything about
me and about everyone

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:24.300 align:middle line:90%
who was around me.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.180 align:middle line:84%
I saw everything they
were thinking now,

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:30.120 align:middle line:84%
what they thought then,
what was happening before,

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.580 align:middle line:90%
what was happening now.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:34.380 align:middle line:90%
There is no time.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
There is no sequence of events,
no such thing as limitation

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.000 align:middle line:84%
of distance, of
period, of place.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:84%
I could be anywhere I
wanted to be simultaneously.

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.530 align:middle line:90%


00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.635 align:middle line:90%
So that is our true state.

00:15:52.635 --> 00:15:56.200 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
that we experience

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:07.900 align:middle line:84%
this world of such
apparent limitation

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
is the way our
perceptions influence

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.905 align:middle line:90%
the way we decode reality.

00:16:13.905 --> 00:16:19.140 align:middle line:90%


00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:24.240 align:middle line:84%
The power of the mind to
influence that reality

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.200 align:middle line:90%
is phenomenal.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:31.872 align:middle line:84%
Think of a dream when
you jump off a cliff--

00:16:31.872 --> 00:16:34.330 align:middle line:90%
where you fall off a cliff.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:35.820 align:middle line:90%
What happens?

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:90%
You wake up.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.902 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.902 --> 00:16:42.110 align:middle line:90%
And you realize just a dream.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.680 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:52.740 align:middle line:84%
But you jump off a cliff in
this non-physical holographic

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:84%
reality, which just
not a dream, and you

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:03.350 align:middle line:84%
don't wake up as you
do from the dreams

00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:90%
that we perceive as dreams.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:90%
You're dead.

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.130 align:middle line:90%
How come?

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
How can we be
physically affected

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:90%
in a non-physical world?

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, this comes back to
the power of the mind.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember in "The Matrix"
movie, the first one?

00:17:23.310 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
Neo is being taken through a
series of exercises, tests,

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:40.520 align:middle line:84%
to try to get him to overcome
the perceptual limitations

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.010 align:middle line:84%
of believing he's in a physical
world even though he's not.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And they had him trying
to jump between buildings.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you believed
that or understood

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:58.970 align:middle line:84%
that it was all an illusion,
then you were able to do that.

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.350 align:middle line:84%
If you didn't, you
weren't able to do that.

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.150 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:04.995 align:middle line:84%
Because you didn't
believe it was possible.

00:18:04.995 --> 00:18:07.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Take, for instance, the
experience of fire walking.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:84%
You walk through fire
in a state of perception

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.680 align:middle line:90%
that you're going to get burned.

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Someone will be calling
an ambulance very quickly.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:84%
But you can-- people do walk
through fire in other states

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:90%
of perception--

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:36.440 align:middle line:84%
perception or belief that
they're not going to get

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.530 align:middle line:84%
burned, and they
walk through fire

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:44.150 align:middle line:84%
and don't get burned
because an illusion can only

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:51.900 align:middle line:84%
burn an illusion if you believe
it can and decode that reality.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:57.350 align:middle line:84%
So in this "Matrix" movie, when
they brought some Neo back out

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:84%
of this computer program
that he was trying

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:84%
to jump across buildings to
overcome the belief that it was

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.950 align:middle line:84%
real, he had blood
coming from his mouth,

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:17.260 align:middle line:84%
and he said if this is all
an illusion, what's this?

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And the Morpheus character said
that your mind makes it real.

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:31.270 align:middle line:84%
The body cannot exist
without the mind, he said.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Now why is that?

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Because the body is the mind.

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:46.510 align:middle line:84%
The body is just a decoded
holographic expression

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:90%
of the mind.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Yes, even the body,
everything is holographic.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Therefore we are decoding
the energetic fields

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.430 align:middle line:84%
that we call the body, the
information fields, the wave

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:01.960 align:middle line:84%
form fields, into the
very body that we think

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.820 align:middle line:84%
we are inhabiting,
and our perceptions

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:10.960 align:middle line:84%
will dictate the nature
of how we do that

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.930 align:middle line:90%
and how we experience that body.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:21.530 align:middle line:84%
For instance, how many
times when someone is told

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:84%
they have a fatal disease
and they go to the doctor--

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.980 align:middle line:90%
and this is why doctors--

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:34.140 align:middle line:84%
anyone watching-- should be
very, very careful about this--

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and they say to the doctor how
long have I got to live, doc.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.490 align:middle line:84%
And they'll be given
six months, whatever.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:48.040 align:middle line:84%
The number of people who die
in that predictive period

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.300 align:middle line:90%
is remarkable.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.940 align:middle line:90%
'Cause the mind believes it.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.340 align:middle line:84%
What you believe you perceive,
and what you perceive

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:01.320 align:middle line:90%
you experience.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:06.240 align:middle line:84%
This is the power of the
mind, the power of perception

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:14.110 align:middle line:84%
to make this reality, this
dream, appear so real.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:84%
Same with placebo,
the placebo effect.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.030 align:middle line:84%
You read stories of
placebo experiences

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
where instead of
taking the real drug,

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.880 align:middle line:84%
they take a sugar
pill or something,

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.023 align:middle line:84%
and they have the same
effect that the drug was

00:21:30.023 --> 00:21:32.190 align:middle line:84%
supposed to have because
they believe it's the drug.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:34.190 align:middle line:84%
And so they believe that
it'll have that effect.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:39.840 align:middle line:84%
There have been
experiments where

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.510 align:middle line:84%
people have been given in a
test group a psychoactive drug

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:47.010 align:middle line:84%
and the other part
of the test group

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.080 align:middle line:84%
has been given a sugar
pill, and some of them

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:90%
have gone off the trip.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Power of the mind, the power
to create its own reality.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Now what I'm talking about
here has fantastic implications

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.160 align:middle line:90%
not least for health.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.810 align:middle line:84%
They talk about how the
mind heals the body,

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.910 align:middle line:90%
and the mind can heal the body.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes, absolutely it
can for the very reasons

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I'm discussing here,
but the mind, of course,

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.330 align:middle line:84%
in the other way, the
mind in another state

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:32.130 align:middle line:84%
can also disrupt and
dis-harmonize the body

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.280 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
it can become ill.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.680 align:middle line:84%
This is how emotional
states become what we call

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.970 align:middle line:90%
physical dis-ease, disharmony.

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:84%
And if we are decoding the body
into this form from a wave form

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:59.190 align:middle line:84%
information field,
then the power

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:04.260 align:middle line:84%
of the mind to interact with the
wave form field, the foundation

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.900 align:middle line:84%
information field
of the body, is

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:11.190 align:middle line:84%
infinite to harmonize
or dis-harmonize

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.240 align:middle line:84%
that field which then reflects
in the decoded hologram

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.280 align:middle line:84%
as a body that's
healthy and strong

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.690 align:middle line:90%
or one that's weak and ill.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.870 align:middle line:90%


00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.420 align:middle line:84%
We can heal ourselves, and
we can make ourselves ill.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.020 align:middle line:84%
This is the process
that makes that happen.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.115 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you an
example of myself.

00:23:32.115 --> 00:23:35.110 align:middle line:90%
I was a professional footballer.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:40.600 align:middle line:10%
And then at the age of 15, I'd
just joined a football club.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:84%
A process started in my
body, which was eventually

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:84%
diagnosed and ended my
football career at 21,

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:90%
as rheumatoid arthritis.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:84%
Started in one joint,
went to another joint,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.090 align:middle line:84%
went to another joint,
went to another joint.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And they said to
me I'm just a kid.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm 21.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.890 align:middle line:84%
They said there's
a chance you might

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:07.440 align:middle line:84%
be in a wheelchair in your
30s as this progresses.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thinking
I'm not having that.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, it did progress
and it did progress

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and it did progress
because at that time that's

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.800 align:middle line:90%
what arthritis did to me.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:84%
Like the perception of everyone
else, you get arthritis.

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:23.500 align:middle line:90%
It progresses.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.340 align:middle line:84%
And that was my experience
anyways what it was doing.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So I decided I weren't having
this arthritis anymore.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.740 align:middle line:84%
It was not going to affect
me as it had been anymore.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly
wasn't going to be

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.890 align:middle line:84%
in a wheelchair thank
you very much if it's all

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:41.200 align:middle line:90%
the same with you.

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.400 align:middle line:90%
And what has happened now--

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm 67-- I've got the
arthritis when I was 21.

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, I got it when I was 15.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.740 align:middle line:84%
It got too bad to
play football at 21.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And my arthritis
has not been better

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.390 align:middle line:84%
than it is now for decades
and decades, decades.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't trouble me.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I could cry sometimes
frankly when

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I see people suffering,
people with chronic disease,

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:84%
all these health
challenges, because we

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:20.500 align:middle line:84%
have a medical
profession that is based

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:25.210 align:middle line:84%
on a complete lack
of understanding

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:30.790 align:middle line:84%
of what the body is,
what the mind is,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:35.350 align:middle line:90%
and what this reality is.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:42.750 align:middle line:84%
A brilliant comedian from the
southern states of America

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:47.940 align:middle line:84%
called Bill Hicks, he
died in a very early age

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.100 align:middle line:90%
in his early 30s.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:84%
But Bill was a
very profound man.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Not only was he very perceptive
in terms of world events

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and seeing what was
really going on,

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
he also took a lot of
psychoactive potions

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:09.020 align:middle line:84%
in his life and
therefore realized

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:13.610 align:middle line:84%
that this physical world
is the illusion that it is.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And as part of a joke,
he said this, which

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:23.240 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly profound I think.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.940 align:middle line:84%
He was describing
reality, and he said this.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:35.590 align:middle line:84%
All matter is merely energy
condensed to a slow vibration.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:39.950 align:middle line:84%
We're all one consciousness
experiencing itself

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.870 align:middle line:90%
subjectively.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:43.250 align:middle line:90%
There's no such thing as death.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Life is only a dream, and we are
the imagination of ourselves.

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:56.090 align:middle line:84%
What an absolutely
fantastic line.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:01.610 align:middle line:84%
We are the imagination
of ourselves.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:06.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's that imagination
that manifests

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:84%
in the way we decode information
into holographic reality

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and thus the nature of
the physical experiences

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.790 align:middle line:90%
that we have.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.880 align:middle line:84%
What has happened
and what continues

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.940 align:middle line:84%
to happen though more and
more people are waking up

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:31.460 align:middle line:84%
is humanity's imagination
of itself individually

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and collectively
has been hijacked.

00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And thus we are
imagining reality

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:84%
based on that perceptual
hijacking, which

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:47.720 align:middle line:90%
is not a reality.

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:84%
That is good for
humanity, and that's

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:56.410 align:middle line:84%
why I spend so much
time uncovering

00:27:56.410 --> 00:28:02.140 align:middle line:84%
the networks that are actually
behind that perceptual

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.500 align:middle line:90%
programming.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.590 align:middle line:10%
But the great news
is now that we

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:12.500 align:middle line:10%
are in a time when people
are beginning like never

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:19.250 align:middle line:10%
before in my experience
to question again

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.100 align:middle line:10%
not only what's really
behind world events,

00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.480 align:middle line:10%
but, hey, what is this place?

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.430 align:middle line:10%
Who am I?

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.790 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:36.410 align:middle line:84%
And the answers will
transform this world,

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and it will
transform human life.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.180 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.000 align:middle line:90%
