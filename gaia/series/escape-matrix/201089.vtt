00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm David Icke, and today
we'll answer the question, how

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.306 align:middle line:90%
do the few control the many?

00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:19.218 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:24.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.300 align:middle line:10%
As my research unfolded
over the last 30 years,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.280 align:middle line:10%
it became clear very
early on that the few do

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:10%
control the many.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:10%
So the question was, how?

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.310 align:middle line:84%
How do a relative
handful of people

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.160 align:middle line:84%
control the direction
of the world

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.970 align:middle line:84%
with a population
currently of 7.7 billion?

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.230 align:middle line:84%
There had to be a structure
that allowed that to happen.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And also, that
structure had to be such

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.200 align:middle line:84%
that the vast overwhelming
majority of people

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.670 align:middle line:84%
who were playing a
part in that control

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.250 align:middle line:84%
had no idea that's
what they were doing.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And, it turns out, there
is just such a structure.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.010 align:middle line:90%
You can use the symbolism--

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:90%
and it's almost not symbolism.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.400 align:middle line:90%
It's how it is structured.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:84%
But you can use the
symbolism of the spider's web

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.270 align:middle line:84%
to understand how the
few control the many.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a spider in
the center of the web.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.680 align:middle line:84%
And this spider, for those that
have watched other programs

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.360 align:middle line:84%
in this series, is
that non-human force

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
that Archontic force that
I've been talking about.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And then you come in
to the human world

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.420 align:middle line:84%
with the strands in the web
immediately around the spider.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.310 align:middle line:84%
These strands are the most
exclusive secret societies.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.870 align:middle line:84%
Some of them don't
even have names,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:84%
which makes them harder
to identify and track.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And within that exclusive
group of secret societies

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.170 align:middle line:84%
are those in the human
realm who absolutely

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.310 align:middle line:84%
know A, how all this works,
and B, what the endgame is

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.870 align:middle line:84%
and what the manipulation
is taking humanity towards.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you come further
out from the spider,

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.370 align:middle line:84%
and then you start to
meet the secret societies

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.330 align:middle line:90%
we do know about.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.200 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we know about
their existence.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.200 align:middle line:84%
We don't know about what their
inner circle is deciding.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
But we know their names,
things like the Freemasons,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.530 align:middle line:84%
The Knights of Malta, the
Knights Templar, Opus Dei,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.990 align:middle line:84%
The Inner Circle of the Jesuit
Order, and so on and so forth.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.250 align:middle line:90%
And that's important.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:84%
I'll emphasize this
more in a second.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.530 align:middle line:84%
When I talk about
secret societies,

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that everybody
in that secret society

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.615 align:middle line:90%
is manipulating the world.

00:03:14.615 --> 00:03:15.920 align:middle line:90%
That would be ridiculous.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So many people would know,
it would get out widely

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.120 align:middle line:90%
into the public arena.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.810 align:middle line:84%
These are compartmentalized
structures

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:84%
where the few at the top,
the very few at the top

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:84%
are the only ones that know,
actually, what the game really

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.000 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.770 align:middle line:84%
Everyone else only
knows a part of it.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:84%
So you then come further out in
the web, still in the hidden,

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and you meet what I call the
cusp organizations in the web.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
This is the point where
the hidden part of the web

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.430 align:middle line:84%
meets the seen part of
the web, and here you'll

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.590 align:middle line:84%
find organizations
like the Council

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:84%
on Foreign Relations
in the United States,

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.660 align:middle line:84%
which has driven American
foreign policy since it

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.930 align:middle line:90%
was created in 1921.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.540 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about the
Trilateral Commission, again,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.500 align:middle line:84%
set up in America by the
Rockefeller family and others,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.130 align:middle line:90%
and that was around 1973.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Then you have the
Bilderberg Group,

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.500 align:middle line:84%
very well-known in
the alternative media,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.700 align:middle line:84%
which was created in 1954 at the
Bilderberg Hotel in Oosterbeek,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Holland, which is
why it is called,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:90%
of course, the Bilderberg Group.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:90%
And you have the Club of Rome.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:84%
The Club of Rome was
created in the 1960s

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
to use environmental
concerns as an excuse

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.460 align:middle line:84%
to justify the centralization
of power in the world.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So these are the
organizations which

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.420 align:middle line:84%
take the agenda
for human society

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.870 align:middle line:84%
from the spider through
the secret society network,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.940 align:middle line:84%
and through the
cusp organizations

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.950 align:middle line:90%
out into the public arena.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And there you see
governments, you

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.520 align:middle line:84%
see corporations, you
see banking systems,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.930 align:middle line:84%
and all these other
institutions that control

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
and direct human society that
are making decisions that

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.970 align:middle line:90%
decide where humanity goes.

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you get to
the core of the core

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:33.000 align:middle line:84%
of those organizations,
you will be at a point

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:84%
where they connect
into this web,

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.770 align:middle line:84%
and from that
point of view, they

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.470 align:middle line:90%
are all the same organization.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So at that inner core level,
Silicon Valley corporations

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:84%
are the Pentagon, are
the banking system,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.190 align:middle line:84%
are the biotech industry, are
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:84%
At that deep level,
they all connect.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And so in the public
arena, we see apparently

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.450 align:middle line:90%
random decisions.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:84%
We see random decisions by
the pharmaceutical cartel,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.300 align:middle line:84%
by governments, by government
agencies, by banks, and so on.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:84%
But when you know how
the structure works

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
at the core of
those organizations,

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:90%
they're all on the same team.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.770 align:middle line:84%
So how does this not get
out into the public arena?

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, for the same reason
that I've talked about,

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:84%
compartmentalization, whereby
if you look at a secret society,

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.500 align:middle line:84%
they're broken up into
levels, into degrees.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:84%
And to get to the
next degree, you

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:48.580 align:middle line:84%
have to be invited by
that degree above you.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.210 align:middle line:84%
And you only get in there if
they think you're acceptable.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And if you, therefore, look
at governments, corporations,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.790 align:middle line:84%
universities, any of these
institutions and organizations,

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
they're basically structured
like a secret society.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.450 align:middle line:90%
They're structured as pyramids.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.160 align:middle line:84%
So at the top of
the pyramid, you've

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.850 align:middle line:84%
got a tiny few people who
know how the whole pyramid

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:17.290 align:middle line:84%
structure of that organization,
whatever it is, operates.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And they know what
the real game is

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and the real motivation
of that organization is.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.970 align:middle line:84%
But as you come down
from that pyramid peak,

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.850 align:middle line:84%
you meet more and more and
more people in an organization,

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
and they know, as you
go down, less and less

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.510 align:middle line:84%
and less about what the
organization is really about.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.640 align:middle line:90%
They only know their part in it.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:84%
And so someone
here does not know

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.520 align:middle line:84%
what they're doing,
apparently in isolation

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.472 align:middle line:84%
and in apparent
innocence, connects

00:07:47.472 --> 00:07:49.180 align:middle line:84%
into what they're
doing and they're doing

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and they're doing to create
a very different picture

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:54.010 align:middle line:90%
of what's happening.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:90%
Only they at the top know that.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Now there's one other thing
to know about this web

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.040 align:middle line:90%
before I move on.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's that there
was an interbreeding

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:12.080 align:middle line:84%
between this non-human force,
the spider, and humans,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.740 align:middle line:84%
which created particular
hybrid bloodlines to represent

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:22.130 align:middle line:84%
the spider that overwhelmingly
operates outside

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.190 align:middle line:84%
of this reality to
represent its interests

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:84%
and its agenda
within this reality.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And these quote,
special bloodlines

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.450 align:middle line:84%
are the drivers of
the human level,

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:84%
if you like, the human
society level of this web.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And this is where
royalty comes from,

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
and it's where
aristocracy comes from.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:09:00.730 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that throughout
all this long period

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:05.610 align:middle line:84%
of human society, there have
been particular bloodlines that

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
claim the right to rule
because of their genetics?

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.350 align:middle line:84%
And so you have
these bloodlines,

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.530 align:middle line:84%
and they came out
through the ancient world

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.620 align:middle line:90%
as openly royal bloodlines.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Then there came a point where
the populations of the world

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:27.960 align:middle line:84%
were starting to reject
that in-your-face control,

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
a dictatorship by people
who were just rulers

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.350 align:middle line:90%
because of their genetics.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:38.520 align:middle line:84%
We in Britain, and in the
commonwealth countries,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:84%
have still not passed into
a level of maturity that

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:49.650 align:middle line:84%
can see that having a head of
state like we have in Britain

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:52.980 align:middle line:84%
purely decided by their
bloodline and genetics

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.810 align:middle line:84%
is probably not a
great idea and has

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:90%
nothing to do with democracy.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:59.160 align:middle line:84%
But in most other
areas of the world,

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:84%
the royal families openly
expressing their control

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.450 align:middle line:90%
have disappeared.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.670 align:middle line:90%
But what happened?

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.340 align:middle line:90%
They didn't disappear.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:16.930 align:middle line:84%
What they did was they swapped
their crowns and coronets

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:22.420 align:middle line:84%
for business suits, and they
went into the institutions that

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:84%
replaced royalty
in most countries,

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:33.050 align:middle line:84%
like politics and
banking and business.

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.230 align:middle line:84%
And they've gone on, driving
the direction of the world

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.560 align:middle line:90%
ever since through this web.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.810 align:middle line:84%
And although they are
not overtly royal now,

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.200 align:middle line:84%
the vast majority, they
consider themselves still

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.450 align:middle line:90%
special bloodlines.

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you get these
ultra rich, powerful families

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
on the east coast of the United
States, in Britain and Europe

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and elsewhere, interbreeding
because they're

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.850 align:middle line:84%
holding this hybrid
genetic code, which

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:11.090 align:middle line:84%
is the whole
foundation of why they

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:15.410 align:middle line:84%
say their bloodline is special
and has the right to rule.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So these bloodlines sit
atop this global structure,

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.860 align:middle line:84%
this global web, in the
human realm, that is.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And this web operates
basically like

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:90%
a transnational corporation.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:90%
You have a headquarters.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:84%
These corporations,
they have headquarters

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:84%
in particular country,
let's say America.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And then in all the
different countries,

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.810 align:middle line:90%
they have their branches.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:46.070 align:middle line:84%
Their branches are dictated
to in terms of the way

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.690 align:middle line:84%
they operate from the center,
from the headquarters.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.870 align:middle line:90%
And this web works the same way.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:58.520 align:middle line:84%
In each country, there are
networks of secret societies

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.390 align:middle line:84%
and bloodline
families whose role

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:08.870 align:middle line:84%
is to control the politics
and the financial structure

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and the corporate structure
within that country in line

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
with the centrally
dictated global plan.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And although people
would say, well,

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:23.237 align:middle line:84%
the center of this structure has
got to be in the United States,

00:12:23.237 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:84%
well, to an extent,
but not really.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.590 align:middle line:84%
It's in Europe for
historical reasons.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about European
governments, just here

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:90%
today, tomorrow organizations.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:38.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the center of
this web, this secret society

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.130 align:middle line:90%
web.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So when I've traveled around
the world, what I've seen

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.510 align:middle line:84%
are the same things
being introduced,

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:51.940 align:middle line:84%
the same basic
laws and direction

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.650 align:middle line:84%
of the country being
introduced, that

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.370 align:middle line:84%
is happening all over the
world at around the same time

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:84%
because it's being
centrally coordinated.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And in each country,
and globally, you

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.830 align:middle line:84%
have something that I call
the permanent government.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
Now I've been describing
this in the books

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:16.780 align:middle line:84%
now for the best
part of 30 years.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, in
more recent years,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:30.860 align:middle line:84%
we've had this phrase or
description of the deep state.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, the deep
state is an aspect

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.800 align:middle line:90%
of this permanent government.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
Deep state refers to the
military intelligence networks

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:84%
and law enforcement networks,
to a very large extent as well.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.450 align:middle line:84%
But that deep state is part of
the permanent government, which

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.080 align:middle line:90%
works like this.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:90%
Again, pyramid.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.670 align:middle line:84%
You've got the
bloodlines at the top

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:57.340 align:middle line:84%
of this pyramid, this
permanent government pyramid.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And this pyramid, both
nationally and globally,

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.060 align:middle line:84%
controls the
banking system, thus

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.420 align:middle line:84%
money and the financial
system, controls

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.020 align:middle line:84%
the major corporations,
controls the major media,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.490 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:15.190 align:middle line:84%
All these institutions,
the institutions

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.110 align:middle line:84%
of the big
pharmaceutical cartel,

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.980 align:middle line:90%
the biotech cartel, et cetera.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And you come down,
and then eventually,

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:25.840 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of
this pyramid, you

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.690 align:middle line:84%
meet what we call politics,
the political party

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.580 align:middle line:90%
level of government.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And the trick is
to persuade people

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:41.860 align:middle line:84%
that that bottom level of
the permanent government

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:45.130 align:middle line:84%
pyramid, the here
today, gone tomorrow

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.500 align:middle line:84%
level of political
parties and presidents

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and prime ministers,
et cetera, that that

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.740 align:middle line:84%
is where the power
is, and that's

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:84%
where the decisions
are made that decide

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.650 align:middle line:90%
the direction of the world.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.330 align:middle line:90%
So everyone's focused on that.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:02.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I love Trump.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:03.610 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I hate Trump.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Or I like him.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:06.010 align:middle line:90%
All that stuff.

00:15:06.010 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's a complete diversion
because whether the Democrats

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:16.540 align:middle line:84%
come in through Obama, or
whether the Republicans come in

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:90%
through Trump--

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:84%
same with Bush and Clinton, same
in Britain and other countries

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:29.030 align:middle line:84%
with their apparent
political party opposition--

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:90%
they come and they go.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
They're here for
a few years, gone.

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is that while
they're coming and going,

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.420 align:middle line:84%
the permanent government
is running the show

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.850 align:middle line:84%
and making all the major
decisions because it controls

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:51.690 align:middle line:84%
all the institutions through
which those decisions are made.

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And so when you observe the
coming and going of opposition

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:84%
political parties, and you take
a step back and you look at it,

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:90%
nothing really changes, does it?

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:08.000 align:middle line:10%
All the rhetoric changes,
but not the direction,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.550 align:middle line:10%
overwhelmingly, of where the
world goes and the country goes

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:10%
because how it works is this.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.310 align:middle line:90%
Take the American example.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:middle line:84%
You have, in the
Republican Party,

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.130 align:middle line:84%
a group of people,
actually a network,

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.250 align:middle line:84%
called the Neocons or
Neoconservatives, that

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.850 align:middle line:84%
drive and control that
party, and whoever's

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:38.630 align:middle line:84%
in power, if they
become president,

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:40.640 align:middle line:90%
representing that party.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.550 align:middle line:84%
In the Democrats you
have a similar group

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:90%
which I call the Democons.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.130 align:middle line:10%
And they control
the Democratic party

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:10%
and whichever Democratic
president may come in.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.790 align:middle line:84%
You go one step back into
the shadows, one step

00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.530 align:middle line:84%
back further into the web, and
the Neocons and the Democons

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.390 align:middle line:90%
answer to the same master.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:09.650 align:middle line:84%
So whoever's coming and
going as the political leader

00:17:09.650 --> 00:17:14.390 align:middle line:84%
of whichever party, that
is always in control.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.280 align:middle line:84%
That's why nothing
really ever changes.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
permanent government.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked in
this series many times

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:27.970 align:middle line:84%
about the foundation
of human control, which

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:29.530 align:middle line:90%
is control of human perception.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And human perception comes
from, and is formed from,

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:90%
information received.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.970 align:middle line:84%
This permanent government
also own the major media.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:90%
It owns Silicon Valley.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:84%
And thus, to a
very large extent,

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.850 align:middle line:84%
it controls the information
that people see.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Increasingly now, it's deciding
and controlling who is censored

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.410 align:middle line:90%
and who isn't censored.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And so you've only got
to look at how easy it

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:84%
is to dictate the
direction of the world

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.760 align:middle line:84%
when you control these
institutions that decide

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that direction, while
at the same time,

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:20.570 align:middle line:84%
instead of looking at
where the power really is,

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:22.880 align:middle line:84%
you have manipulated
the population

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.820 align:middle line:84%
to look where it's
not, and that is

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.540 align:middle line:84%
at the level of political
parties and presidents

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and prime ministers,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So the thing to grasp
is that major events

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.780 align:middle line:84%
in the world that dictate
the direction of the world

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.600 align:middle line:90%
are not random.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And when you kind of look at
the world from this perspective,

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and you see the connections
through this web,

00:18:54.470 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
so many things start to
take on a new perspective.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:07.310 align:middle line:84%
For example, when a group
of apparently unconnected

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:11.630 align:middle line:84%
corporations suddenly
come out in unison

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and censor someone
or ban someone

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.800 align:middle line:84%
who is putting out
information challenging

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.070 align:middle line:84%
the official narrative and
exposing some of the stuff I'm

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:84%
talking about, who
coordinates that?

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And you see coordination,
for instance,

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:34.220 align:middle line:84%
in this way, because it's
all a mind game in the end.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.870 align:middle line:84%
You'll get a corporation,
maybe involved in media,

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and that which controls it wants
to use that organization, that

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:52.350 align:middle line:84%
media, to control what people
see and hear, therefore, to ban

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:57.450 align:middle line:84%
or censor people putting
out information they

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.400 align:middle line:90%
don't want the public to see.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:84%
But the corporation
really doesn't

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:84%
want to come out and
just do it because

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:84%
of their reputation
for being anti-freedom,

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.750 align:middle line:90%
anti-freedom of speech.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So what the web does is it
goes through its political wing

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:28.220 align:middle line:84%
and has politicians demanding
that something is banned or is

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:34.790 align:middle line:84%
censored for some often
made up reason, which allows

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:84%
the corporation to come out
and say, well, you know,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.750 align:middle line:84%
we're under pressure from
the governments to do this.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.790 align:middle line:84%
We don't really want
to do it, not really.

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:90%
But we've got no choice.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have to do this.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.612 align:middle line:84%
You see that scam
played all the time

00:20:50.612 --> 00:20:53.850 align:middle line:90%
across many areas of society.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.410 align:middle line:84%
And people would look
at that in isolation

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.392 align:middle line:84%
and think that what they
see is what they get.

00:20:59.392 --> 00:21:01.850 align:middle line:84%
This corporation doesn't really
want to do this censorship,

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:04.160 align:middle line:84%
but they're under pressure
from politicians to do it.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:04.960 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Take the politicians,
take the corporations,

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.190 align:middle line:84%
and come back into the
web, and the same force

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.480 align:middle line:90%
is controlling both sides.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And what the public
are experiencing

00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:18.230 align:middle line:84%
is just a mind game to
scam their perception.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:21.320 align:middle line:90%
So where is this going?

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to cover that
in many of these programs

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.900 align:middle line:84%
because it's going
into many areas.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:32.990 align:middle line:84%
But one of the most blatantly
necessary and blatantly

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:39.580 align:middle line:84%
happening expressions of this
web is centralization of power.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:84%
You see, if there's
a few of you,

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.830 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
control the many,

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.350 align:middle line:90%
you have to centralize power.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:middle line:10%
The more points of
decision making there are,

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.570 align:middle line:10%
the less control
any central few are

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.010 align:middle line:10%
going to have over
those decisions

00:21:56.010 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:10%
because there's just too many
points of decision making.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:06.150 align:middle line:84%
You want to pull the
decision making process power

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.430 align:middle line:90%
into fewer and fewer hands.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:12.000 align:middle line:84%
So for decades and
decades and decades now,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.630 align:middle line:84%
we've had something
called globalization.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.670 align:middle line:90%
What is globalization?

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.580 align:middle line:84%
The centralization of
power on a global level

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:28.060 align:middle line:84%
across the great spectrum of
human society, business, et

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.010 align:middle line:90%
cetera.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:35.500 align:middle line:84%
What is that globalization
except exactly the phenomena

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:90%
that I've been describing?

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
going for a long time.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:90%
This is not a modern phenomenon.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:48.360 align:middle line:84%
This has been pushed
along for centuries

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and centuries and
centuries and more,

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:84%
centralizing more
and more power.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:84%
And at every point power
is more centralized,

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:84%
more power for the
few over the many.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So human society, at one
point, was organized in tribes.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And the people in the
tribe made the decisions

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.610 align:middle line:84%
about what happened
in the tribe.

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.980 align:middle line:84%
Then we reached a
real pivotal point

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:18.080 align:middle line:84%
where many, many, many
tribes were brought together

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:20.900 align:middle line:90%
into what are called nations.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:25.970 align:middle line:84%
At that point, a few people
at the center of the nation

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:29.790 align:middle line:84%
were now dictating to
all the former tribes.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And in Europe-- and this is
planned to happen globally--

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:39.260 align:middle line:84%
in Europe, we have the European
Union, which is the next stage.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And that is to pull all the
nations of Europe together,

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:49.580 align:middle line:84%
and from a central point,
with unelected bureaucrats,

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:57.110 align:middle line:84%
dictate the fine detail of
what happens in all the nations

00:23:57.110 --> 00:24:00.740 align:middle line:84%
that were an amalgamation
of all the former tribes.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And the next stage, which we're
already seeing talked about--

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.910 align:middle line:84%
it's been predicted in
my books for 30 years--

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.210 align:middle line:84%
is a world government
and a world structure,

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
a world government dictating
everything globally

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.400 align:middle line:84%
from a central point,
a world central bank

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.890 align:middle line:90%
dictating all global finance.

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:26.600 align:middle line:84%
The European Central Bank
is a stepping stone to that.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.750 align:middle line:84%
A world currency--
now here's something.

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I've been predicting
this and saying

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:84%
this was part of the agenda,
again, for nearly 30 years--

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
a world currency with all
other currencies deleted.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.810 align:middle line:84%
What they've done
in Europe is create

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:51.430 align:middle line:84%
the euro which deleted so many
of the previous individual

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:52.480 align:middle line:90%
European currencies.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.050 align:middle line:84%
That was a stepping stone,
again, to this global currency,

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.510 align:middle line:84%
and this global
currency is designed

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:02.860 align:middle line:90%
to be digital, no cash.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And what has happened
since I started

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.640 align:middle line:90%
writing about this decades ago?

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Cash is flying out
of circulation.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.130 align:middle line:90%
So why would they do that?

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.930 align:middle line:90%
Simple.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Like everything else that this
web does, it's about control.

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:27.490 align:middle line:84%
You go into a store
now, or anywhere else,

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and you hand over a credit
card, electronic money,

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:34.520 align:middle line:84%
which is designed to be
a microchip, eventually.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And the computer system says
it won't accept your card.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:90%
Well, at the moment--

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.820 align:middle line:84%
but not for much longer,
the way things are going--

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:84%
you can pull out some cash
and say, I'll pay cash.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:51.920 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
there's no cash,

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.620 align:middle line:84%
and that computer system says no
to your card or your microchip?

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:02.630 align:middle line:84%
You have no other means
of purchase except barter.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:04.870 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you what
the plan is for barter.

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:13.970 align:middle line:84%
It's a plan to ban it on the
excuse that they can't tax it.

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.100 align:middle line:84%
And what that will
mean is whoever

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:25.500 align:middle line:84%
controls the computer system of
digital, single currency money

00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:29.747 align:middle line:84%
will decide if you
purchase, what you purchase.

00:26:29.747 --> 00:26:30.830 align:middle line:90%
They'll dictate your life.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:34.310 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And let no one think that
those who are, if you like,

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:84%
challenging and
dissidents of the system

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.530 align:middle line:84%
will go off the Christmas
card list of the computer

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.930 align:middle line:90%
program very early on, indeed.

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:90%


00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And this is what's
been unfolding century

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:84%
after century,
decade after decade,

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:06.290 align:middle line:84%
the walls closing
in on human freedom

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:10.490 align:middle line:84%
in the form of incessant,
unfolding human control.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's now a sprint, almost,
it's happening so fast.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to keep
the population focused

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.430 align:middle line:84%
on other things, focused
on irrelevant things,

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:28.370 align:middle line:84%
focused on I hate
Trump, oh, I love Trump.

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.380 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah, Trump.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.310 align:middle line:90%
Do you like Trump?

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, I don't like Trump.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.390 align:middle line:10%
And while people are doing
that and getting their knickers

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:41.190 align:middle line:10%
in a twist, the
permanent government

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:10%
sits there with a
big grin on its face,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:49.800 align:middle line:10%
pushing the world where it wants
to go without anyone looking,

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.920 align:middle line:10%
or almost no one
looking, and saying,

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.010 align:middle line:10%
ah, that's where the power is.

00:27:56.010 --> 00:28:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And the other level of this
human control is a mind game.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:07.900 align:middle line:84%
It's manipulating
human perception

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:14.140 align:middle line:84%
to either agree that the
direction that this agenda is

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.810 align:middle line:84%
taking the world
is a good thing,

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:84%
or to censor and
silence those who

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:84%
can see it and want to tell
everyone else that the world is

00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:37.210 align:middle line:90%
not what they think it is.

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.840 align:middle line:10%
And to understand
the mind game is

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.320 align:middle line:10%
to understand so much
about human control,

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:49.360 align:middle line:10%
and therefore, so
much about how we

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:54.190 align:middle line:10%
take that control back
from the few in the shadows

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:58.060 align:middle line:10%
and start to dictate our lives
ourselves instead of being

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.250 align:middle line:10%
the pawns in a game that
most people don't even know

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:06.190 align:middle line:10%
is being played.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.000 align:middle line:90%
