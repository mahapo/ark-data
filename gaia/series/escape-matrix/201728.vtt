00:00:04.392 --> 00:00:07.320 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.760 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm David Icke.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And today, I'm going to be
chatting about the most crucial

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.490 align:middle line:90%
of all subjects--

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.410 align:middle line:90%
remembering who we are.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:29.890 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.509 align:middle line:10%
Who are we?

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.110 align:middle line:10%
What is this I that
people talk about?

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.910 align:middle line:10%


00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.750 align:middle line:10%
Let's start with what
we're told it is.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:84%
We are told that we are our
name, our family, our life

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:84%
story, our job, our income, our
religion, our race, our color,

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:90%
our sexuality.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:10.200 align:middle line:84%
These are all these expressions
of the I that we are supposed

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.240 align:middle line:90%
to accept is who we are.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And what those labels
are is nothing more

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.360 align:middle line:84%
than a brief experience in
a tiny band of frequency

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:90%
that we call "the world."

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.480 align:middle line:84%
But these are the
versions of self-identity

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.720 align:middle line:84%
that dictate our sense of
the I from cradle to grave.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And these individualized
senses of the I

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.750 align:middle line:84%
are then played off
against each other

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.230 align:middle line:84%
to divided rule, which allows
the few to control the many.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And what we're seeing now
if you observe the world

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:84%
is the subdividing
of previous labels--

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:90%
man, woman, all the rest of it--

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.820 align:middle line:84%
into more and more
minutia of labels.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And the more that you
squeeze and define

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
your sense of the
"I," the more you

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:84%
are withdrawing from
the greater "I," which

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:90%
is that there is one I only--

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.290 align:middle line:84%
the I that is all that has
it, has been, and ever can be.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.390 align:middle line:84%
And we are unique points of
attention in that infinite "I,"

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.810 align:middle line:84%
that infinite unity,
that infinite oneness.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So I would say to people that
feel the need to self-identify

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.660 align:middle line:84%
with a label, like I say,
getting smaller and smaller,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.490 align:middle line:84%
why do you need to define
yourself in that way?

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Why do you need a label?

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Why can you not
just be what you are

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and say, this is how I
live my life, and live it?

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's this need to create
a construct with which

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
to self-identify which
I call a "label."

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And the totality of these
labels I call "phantom self"--

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.100 align:middle line:84%
phantom self because
it is an illusory self.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.190 align:middle line:84%
It is the construction
of a self-identity,

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
which is nothing more than
a series of experiences.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.070 align:middle line:84%
And so what we've
be manipulated to do

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
is self-identify
with what we are

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
experiencing instead of the I
which is having the experience.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.570 align:middle line:84%
And so then you've got
all these phantom selves.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.945 align:middle line:84%
And you play these phantom
selves off against each other.

00:04:16.945 --> 00:04:21.690 align:middle line:90%
And oh, yes, we'll run the show.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest
of all religions

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:35.240 align:middle line:84%
is the religion that
basically spawns the others.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's the religion, the
greatest religion, in my view,

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.710 align:middle line:90%
of human society.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.140 align:middle line:84%
It's the religion of "I am
a," the religion of "I am."

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:90%
And it has its own mantra.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.490 align:middle line:90%
And it goes like this--

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.560 align:middle line:90%
I am a, I am a.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.660 align:middle line:90%
And it plays out like this.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:08.350 align:middle line:84%
I am a man, woman, black, white,
this religion, that religion,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:90%
this sexuality, that sexuality--

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.160 align:middle line:90%
I am a.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:84%
And what it's saying is, I
am a label or set of labels.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:90%
I am a phantom self.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:31.210 align:middle line:84%
So what is social
media as it plays out?

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:40.050 align:middle line:84%
It's policing the orthodoxy
of the "I am a" religions,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.290 align:middle line:84%
ensuring that anyone
that doesn't conform

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.450 align:middle line:84%
gets the abuse and the
ridicule and the condemnation.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:90%
And what this has done--

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.490 align:middle line:84%
losing sight of the true
self-identity, which

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.360 align:middle line:84%
is infinite I,
infinite consciousness,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:84%
having an experience,
and getting

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.770 align:middle line:84%
pulled into the "I am a"
orthodoxies of self-identity

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.780 align:middle line:84%
has created catastrophic
consequences.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
This is a few of
the figures in terms

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:26.438 align:middle line:84%
of the consequences of social
media in a documentary--

00:06:26.438 --> 00:06:27.730 align:middle line:90%
you can see it on the internet.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.360 align:middle line:84%
I do recommend it--
called "Plugged In."

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.040 align:middle line:84%
And these are figures
relating to how

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
young people have been
affected psychologically

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:90%
by social media.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:52.490 align:middle line:84%
Teenage suicide-- a 50%
increase in female suicides

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:59.540 align:middle line:84%
under the age of 17 and
a 30% increase in boys.

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:05.660 align:middle line:84%
This is in the social
media smartphone era.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Teenage anxiety and
depression have increased

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.560 align:middle line:90%
by 70% in the last 25 years.

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The number of children
and young people treated

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.230 align:middle line:84%
at accident and emergency units
for psychiatric conditions

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:29.370 align:middle line:84%
has more than
doubled since 2009.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:84%
Hospital admissions for
teenagers with eating disorders

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.360 align:middle line:84%
have almost doubled
in three years.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
The fact that this has happened
in the social media smartphone

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.210 align:middle line:90%
era is not a coincidence.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a cause and effect.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.190 align:middle line:84%
The pressure is to
conform to orthodoxy, even

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.710 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of
the way you look.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:90%
You have to look a certain way.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And what is an obsession with
the body but an obsession

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and a total self-identity
with a label?

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I self-identify
with the way I look.

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And because I don't get
inner security in myself

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:31.850 align:middle line:84%
from the true I, I am looking
all the time for confirmation

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
that I'm OK from
external sources.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have that sense of
security of being the true I,

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.850 align:middle line:84%
then you are looking for
external confirmation

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:90%
and support and likes.

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Then what do you have to do?

00:08:53.940 --> 00:09:00.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to post things that
you know most people will like,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.540 align:middle line:84%
even though you may
not believe them,

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:84%
so that you will
get that feedback

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:12.170 align:middle line:84%
that you're desperate for
to feed your own insecurity.

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to Photoshop
all the pictures of me.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to be at
peace with my uniqueness

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.520 align:middle line:90%
in the way I look.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:84%
I am going to Photoshop,
even go into plastic surgery,

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:28.520 align:middle line:84%
so that my, if you
like, physical "I am a"

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
is acceptable to
the orthodoxy so

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that they'll give me the
feedback to feed my insecurity.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:42.430 align:middle line:84%
And this is destroying
young people,

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.870 align:middle line:90%
even what we call "trolls."

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Trolls are a "I am a."

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.190 align:middle line:84%
They get their self-identity
from their ability

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:90%
to hurt others.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.140 align:middle line:90%
That's their "I am a."

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, they
are in that state

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:06.690 align:middle line:84%
of being and therefore
doing that because they've

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.800 align:middle line:84%
lost the understanding
that they are

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:84%
an expression of the infinite
I, which is love, which

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.373 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want to hurt anybody.

00:10:18.373 --> 00:10:19.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's kind of systematic.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:25.150 align:middle line:84%
In this documentary,
there's an interview

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:31.390 align:middle line:84%
with a psychology professor
called Sam Vaknin or "Vacknin."

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.390 align:middle line:90%
And this is what he said.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:39.400 align:middle line:84%
"Facebook, Twitter all these
networks, are surfing the wave.

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:90%
They know it's a dangerous wave.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.590 align:middle line:90%
They know people are drowning.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:84%
They read all the statistics,
the increase in suicide rate,

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.080 align:middle line:90%
depression, anxiety.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.380 align:middle line:90%
They know absolutely everything.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.010 align:middle line:84%
They have designed maliciously,
malevolent, and possibly

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.780 align:middle line:90%
criminally," he said.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:84%
"They have designed the
algorithms and the networks

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:84%
exactly to cater
to human pathology

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:90%
in its most extreme form."

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And the only way out
of this onslaught

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.710 align:middle line:84%
on the human mind and
the human emotions

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:30.810 align:middle line:90%
is to remember who we are.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Remember that we're
not the labels.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:90%
We're not the phantom self.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:84%
We are the consciousness
having the experiences.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.520 align:middle line:84%
We are not the
experiences themselves.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Instead of people,
especially the young,

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
who are so vulnerable
in terms of all this,

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.710 align:middle line:90%
instead of allowing society--

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.500 align:middle line:90%
I say this.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.770 align:middle line:90%
Are there kids watching this?

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:90%
Define yourself.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Do not let anybody
do it for you--

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:20.550 align:middle line:84%
no parents, no trolls, no people
who tell you what you must be.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:90%
Define yourself.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:30.750 align:middle line:84%
You are a unique expression
of infinite possibility.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Pick out your unique
expression of that.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And live it, and love
it, and get joy from it

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:45.590 align:middle line:84%
instead of some people stuck in
their own phantom self-prison

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.260 align:middle line:90%
telling you what you must be.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm in prison.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.410 align:middle line:90%
Why should you not be?

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.860 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.380 align:middle line:84%
Who are you really, I would say
to those young people, someone

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:02.730 align:middle line:84%
who has to conform to some
idiot in a bedroom hiding

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.340 align:middle line:90%
behind a login name?

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.530 align:middle line:84%
People talk about and I talk
about being an expression

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.940 align:middle line:90%
of one consciousness.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.550 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean
everyone's the same.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
That consciousness
is all possibility

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.190 align:middle line:90%
waiting to manifest.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So expressing and
celebrating our uniqueness

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:84%
is to celebrate being an
expression of one whole.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're not like
everyone else.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:90%
And round of applause.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:90%
We've started.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.880 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So people don't agree
with what you say.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.480 align:middle line:90%
So?

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:90%
And your point is?

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.700 align:middle line:84%
If you want to take
your power back,

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.190 align:middle line:84%
we need to stop comparing
ourselves with others.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.490 align:middle line:90%


00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Why do you want to be-- why
does anyone want to be--

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:84%
like anyone else
or everyone else?

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.260 align:middle line:90%
Why do people want to conform?

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.690 align:middle line:90%
Through insecurity.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:16.640 align:middle line:84%
To conform to the group
is to get security

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.210 align:middle line:84%
from the group and
feedback from the group

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that you're all right
because you're one of us

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:27.380 align:middle line:84%
because you believe what we
do and you live like we do.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.820 align:middle line:90%
And what the true I says--

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.330 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.710 align:middle line:90%
conform to a group?

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:41.270 align:middle line:84%
I am a unique expression of
all that is, has been, and ever

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:43.570 align:middle line:90%
can be.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.685 align:middle line:84%
And I have to
conform to a group?

00:14:47.685 --> 00:14:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:52.930 align:middle line:90%
Madness.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:15:01.050 align:middle line:84%
Are we going to have our
uniqueness suppressed

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:06.900 align:middle line:84%
by someone who has so little
respect for our uniqueness

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.860 align:middle line:84%
that they will abuse us for not
conforming to someone else's

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:13.525 align:middle line:90%
sense of what we should be?

00:15:13.525 --> 00:15:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And we should
remember this, too,

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
as we take our power back as we
remember the true I that this

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.990 align:middle line:90%
is where the power is.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:84%
The power is not with
those that abuse us.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:34.850 align:middle line:84%
The power is with
how we respond.

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So if you are hurt
by what people

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:84%
say about you because you won't
conform to their phantom self

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:50.080 align:middle line:84%
fantasy, then you are
giving your power to them.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.990 align:middle line:84%
So you say to people, what do
you think of these people that

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:02.350 align:middle line:84%
were abusing you, that are
causing such distress to you?

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Well, they're horrible.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.115 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:05.115 --> 00:16:06.990 align:middle line:84%
So why are you giving
your power to them for?

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:11.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:17.700 align:middle line:84%
Being hurt, being
pressured into being

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:84%
something else that
you're not is the power

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:29.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have not to be affected
by what people say about us.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll tell
you from experience

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:35.707 align:middle line:84%
as someone who's been subject
to constant abuse for 30 years,

00:16:35.707 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:84%
they'll think something
else tomorrow.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.960 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:84%
I can walk down any
street in Britain.

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:90%
It was before social media.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.050 align:middle line:84%
But this is my version
of social media.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:51.300 align:middle line:84%
I can walk down any
street in Britain

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.940 align:middle line:84%
in the early 1990s, the
early years in the 1990s,

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:58.410 align:middle line:84%
without being laughed at
by most of the people.

00:16:58.410 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:10%
If I went into a bar, uproar.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:07.619 align:middle line:84%
I've spoken at
Students' Union events.

00:17:07.619 --> 00:17:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And they only invited me along
to laugh and ridicule me.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.329 align:middle line:84%
And I've stood on
the stage, and I've

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:19.170 align:middle line:84%
had plastic cups thrown at me,
plastic beer glasses thrown

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.680 align:middle line:90%
at me.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it was 10 minutes
before the uproar died down

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.740 align:middle line:90%
and I could actually speak.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:34.830 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:39.030 align:middle line:84%
But I refuse to give
my power to that.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.330 align:middle line:84%
I was going to speak my
uniqueness whether they laughed

00:17:42.330 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
or whether they didn't
because that's my uniqueness.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.020 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
theirs, but it's mine.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:52.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's precious.

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's non-negotiable.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:90%


00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you apply that to social
media, it's the same thing.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.630 align:middle line:90%
You apply that to peer pressure.

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.220 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to
pressure you to be

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:06.762 align:middle line:84%
what they believe you should be
because that's what they are.

00:18:06.762 --> 00:18:08.970 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.520 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to conform.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:16.050 align:middle line:84%
You can be your own
unique self by realizing

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:90%
that's what we are.

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:19.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you
what you find, again,

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:23.170 align:middle line:90%
in my experience, anyway.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:31.000 align:middle line:84%
You find that when you
refuse to compromise

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.850 align:middle line:84%
on your own
uniqueness, the world

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:39.650 align:middle line:84%
starts to come towards
you instead of you

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.520 align:middle line:90%
trotting behind the world.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So I have things
posted on social media.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:47.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't post them myself.

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:90%
My son does.

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:54.530 align:middle line:84%
But I post them on
the basis of whether I

00:18:54.530 --> 00:18:57.920 align:middle line:84%
think the information is
valid and whether I think

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.760 align:middle line:84%
people would find
them interesting

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and whether I think that people
need to see this information.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is ever posted
on the basis of,

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:90%
what do people want to hear?

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And what do I post to
get the least abuse back?

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:18.410 align:middle line:90%
I don't care.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
abuse I get back.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:21.800 align:middle line:90%
It's of no interest to me.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:30.970 align:middle line:84%
It's an irrelevant concept
because to edit yourself

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
and to reform yourself
on the basis of what

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.670 align:middle line:84%
will get me least
abuse or most likes

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:44.340 align:middle line:84%
is to contemplate not
expressing your uniqueness

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:84%
and what you
believe to be right.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.590 align:middle line:90%
And this is a fantastic quote--

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that is, two-- from the
mystic Osho on this subject.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.055 align:middle line:90%
I think these are fantastic.

00:20:02.055 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:84%
The first one-- "the
greatest fear in the world

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.490 align:middle line:90%
is the opinion of others.

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And the moment you are
unafraid of the crowd,

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.690 align:middle line:90%
you are no longer a sheep.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:22.650 align:middle line:90%
You become a lion.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:32.860 align:middle line:84%
A great roar arises
from your heart"--

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:90%
the roar of freedom.

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:41.900 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sorry that I
almost broke into tears there.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.570 align:middle line:90%
You know why?

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:90%
I am unique.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:21:00.468 align:middle line:84%
I don't need to express
my macho man state,

00:21:00.468 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:90%
because what will people think?

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:05.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.290 align:middle line:90%
I am what I am.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:14.120 align:middle line:90%
We are all what we are.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Remember that, and the
true I starts to return.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.880 align:middle line:90%
And another Osho quote--

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.980 align:middle line:84%
"people are afraid, very
much afraid of those

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:38.750 align:middle line:84%
who know themselves, who know
they are the true I. They have

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
a certain power, a certain
aura, and a certain magnetism,

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:50.760 align:middle line:84%
a charisma, that can take
out alive young people

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.200 align:middle line:84%
from the traditional
imprisonment.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:59.040 align:middle line:84%
The awakened person
cannot be enslaved.

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:01.080 align:middle line:90%
That is the difficulty.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And they cannot be imprisoned.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:09.310 align:middle line:84%
The awakened person is the
greatest stranger in the world.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:13.960 align:middle line:84%
They do not seem to
belong to anybody.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.080 align:middle line:90%
No organization confines him--

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:22.520 align:middle line:84%
no community, no
society, no nation."

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know why the awakened
person cannot be defined?

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Because they are unique
and thus have no comparison

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:43.980 align:middle line:90%
to compare with.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:57.100 align:middle line:84%
And this transformation
of self and life

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:07.160 align:middle line:84%
comes from simply re-evaluating
self-identity from "I am a"

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.335 align:middle line:90%
to "I am all."

00:23:10.335 --> 00:23:13.980 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.410 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it funny when you think--

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:23.030 align:middle line:84%
I talk about a few
people manipulating

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:27.260 align:middle line:84%
the human population, pushing
them in a certain direction,

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.840 align:middle line:84%
and keeping them in
ignorance of their true self

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:90%
so that can happen--

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that one of the
greatest fears, if not

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.690 align:middle line:84%
the greatest fear,
that people have

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:42.550 align:middle line:84%
is the fear of being
who they really are?

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.250 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.480 align:middle line:84%
And I would just say
this to those people

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:54.130 align:middle line:84%
in the spiritual
community, shall we say,

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.150 align:middle line:84%
who talk about reality
and consciousness and all

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:03.580 align:middle line:84%
that who are saying,
people must wake up.

00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Oh, those conspiracy theorists--
they're just negative.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.180 align:middle line:90%
How about asking this question?

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.470 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:24.980 align:middle line:84%
If people must wake up, why are
they asleep in the first place?

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Because in so many
ways, people that

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:34.510 align:middle line:84%
consider themselves spiritual
are also playing out

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:39.260 align:middle line:90%
a version of "I am a."

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:46.690 align:middle line:84%
It's another bubble
which will not encompass

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.730 align:middle line:90%
that people need to wake up.

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:54.880 align:middle line:90%
But why are they asleep?

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And bring the two
together, and then

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:58.270 align:middle line:84%
we might get
somewhere by removing

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:03.590 align:middle line:84%
the cause of the problem
so the slumber will end.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to finish
with a great man--

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.920 align:middle line:90%
I say he was a great man--

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.283 align:middle line:84%
an American comedian,
sadly no longer with us,

00:25:16.283 --> 00:25:17.700 align:middle line:84%
although he won't
think it's sadly

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.962 align:middle line:84%
because he's exploring
forever forever now,

00:25:20.962 --> 00:25:24.490 align:middle line:90%
a guy called Bill Hicks.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Bill Hicks was a
comedian from the South.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:84%
But he was a very profound
man, very deep man.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:84%
He took the potions
that showed him

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:41.570 align:middle line:84%
that this reality we call
"physical" is an illusion.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And he used to finish
his act like this

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:51.270 align:middle line:84%
so that people would
ponder on the fact

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:55.413 align:middle line:84%
that maybe this world is not
like they thought it was.

00:25:55.413 --> 00:25:56.330 align:middle line:90%
And he would say this.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:58.970 align:middle line:90%


00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:05.470 align:middle line:84%
The world is like a ride
in an amusement park.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And when you go on it, you
think it's real because that's

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:90%
how powerful our minds are.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.550 align:middle line:84%
The ride goes up and
down, round and round.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:15.260 align:middle line:90%
It has thrills and chills.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.730 align:middle line:90%
And it's very brightly colored.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's very loud.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's fun for a while.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Some have been on the
ride for a long time.

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:25.990 align:middle line:90%
And they begin to question.

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:90%
Is this real?

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.725 align:middle line:90%
Or is this just a ride?

00:26:30.725 --> 00:26:31.850 align:middle line:90%
And others have remembered.

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:32.892 align:middle line:90%
And they come back to us.

00:26:32.892 --> 00:26:34.868 align:middle line:84%
And they say, hey,
don't be afraid ever

00:26:34.868 --> 00:26:36.035 align:middle line:90%
because this is just a ride.

00:26:36.035 --> 00:26:38.660 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.560 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.390 align:middle line:90%
And we kill those people.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:43.218 align:middle line:90%
Shut him up.

00:26:43.218 --> 00:26:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I've got a lot
invested in this ride.

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:46.268 align:middle line:90%
Shut him up.

00:26:46.268 --> 00:26:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Look at my furrows of
worry and my big bank

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:49.140 align:middle line:90%
account and my family.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:50.280 align:middle line:90%
This has to be real.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.600 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:56.762 align:middle line:90%
It's just a ride.

00:26:56.762 --> 00:26:58.220 align:middle line:84%
We always kill
those good guys that

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.350 align:middle line:84%
try to tell us that and
let the demons run amok.

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:04.270 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't matter
because it's just a ride.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And we can change it
any time we want--

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:84%
no effort, no work, no
job, no savings of money,

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:84%
just a choice right now
between fear and love.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:21.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's all it is.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.650 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.292 align:middle line:84%
I hope you've
enjoyed the series.

00:27:26.292 --> 00:27:27.750 align:middle line:84%
I hope you got
something out of it.

00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:31.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the the
whole point, really.

00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.900 align:middle line:10%
If you remember
only one thing, I

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.460 align:middle line:10%
would suggest it's
to remember that.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.980 align:middle line:10%


00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.310 align:middle line:10%
What kind of world do
we want to live in?

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:44.340 align:middle line:90%


00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:52.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just a choice right
now between fear and love.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:28:03.230 align:middle line:84%
That's all it is, has
been, and ever will be.

00:28:03.230 --> 00:28:05.280 align:middle line:90%
See you soon.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.000 align:middle line:90%
