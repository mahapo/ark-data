00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm David Ike.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And today I'm going to
ask two big questions.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Who are we?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.500 align:middle line:10%
What is this I?

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.330 align:middle line:90%
And where are we?

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:38.630 align:middle line:10%
What is this place, this reality
that we daily experience?

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.190 align:middle line:10%
These big questions
are so rarely asked

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:10%
when you think they would be at
the forefront of what everyone

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:10%
would want to know.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And part of the answer to that
is that we take it for granted

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.830 align:middle line:84%
that what we're told
about reality is true.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:90%
So what are we told?

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Basically, we're led
to believe that we

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.370 align:middle line:84%
live in a solid world, a
physical world, a material

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.660 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And everything has
space between it.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
There is such a thing as
time that moves from past

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.345 align:middle line:90%
through present to future.

00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:23.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:84%
The interaction of this
materiality is random.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.110 align:middle line:90%
Just happens.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.180 align:middle line:90%
There's no force behind it.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.680 align:middle line:90%
There's no unity behind it.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So we are told that everything
is apart from everything else.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.650 align:middle line:84%
We are basically
cosmic accidents

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:84%
to come out of nowhere and
then die at the end of it.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's all a mess and
totally unexplainable.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:84%
But there is another
way of looking

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.640 align:middle line:84%
at it, which puts
everything into a completely

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.440 align:middle line:90%
different light.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.310 align:middle line:10%
What if-- and it's
more than a what if--

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.290 align:middle line:10%
this reality wasn't solid,
wasn't physical at all?

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:84%
We just experience it like
that because it's an illusion.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.040 align:middle line:84%
The question that comes
from that is OK then,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:90%
why am I sitting in this chair?

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.340 align:middle line:84%
Why haven't I falling through
it if there is no solidity?

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, you could
say why when you're

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.030 align:middle line:84%
watching a video game or one
of these virtual reality games,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.880 align:middle line:84%
even more appropriate,
the people sitting

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
in the chairs in the
virtual reality game

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.370 align:middle line:90%
don't fall through them either.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.370 align:middle line:84%
The resistance that allows
me to sit-in this chair

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.360 align:middle line:90%
is not physical resistance.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.210 align:middle line:90%
It's electromagnetic resistance.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.050 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a resistance
within the same band

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.760 align:middle line:84%
of frequency, we experience
that, for reasons I'll come to,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.890 align:middle line:90%
as physical resistance.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.930 align:middle line:84%
But when people have experiences
of what we call ghosts,

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:29.070 align:middle line:84%
and they see figures, ethereal
figures floating through walls,

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.420 align:middle line:90%
people say that's impossible.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:90%
You can't go through a wall.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Well you can if you're
not on its frequency

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.760 align:middle line:84%
and thus not subject to its
electromagnetic resistance

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.730 align:middle line:84%
that we experience as
apparent physical resistance.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.050 align:middle line:90%
This reality is not physical.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.460 align:middle line:84%
It's like a virtual
reality game.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:90%
Think of Wi-Fi.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.260 align:middle line:84%
You have Wi-Fi fields
of information.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.060 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:84%
They're fields of radiation
carrying information.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And the computer then
connects with that radiation

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
field of Wi-Fi and takes
information from it

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:84%
and puts it on the screen in a
totally different form to how

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.250 align:middle line:84%
that information is
expressed in the Wi-Fi field.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:84%
What the computer has done
is decode that information

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.090 align:middle line:90%
into a different form.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:90%
That's how we experience it.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:84%
You know, you say to people,
what is the internet?

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:10%
And they'll say, oh,
well, it's graphics,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:10%
and colors, and movies, and
videos on a computer screen.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, yes it is, but
only on the screen.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the only place the
internet looks like that.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere else it
is Wi-Fi fields,

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.590 align:middle line:84%
electrical communications
systems, codes, and so on.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And what we are
doing through what

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:84%
I call the biological
computer, the body,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.660 align:middle line:84%
is to decode
information from what

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I call the cosmic Wi-Fi
field into a totally

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:41.800 align:middle line:84%
different form on our
screen, which is in here.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
I'll explain this more in a
moment how that process works.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But let's put to bed,
first of all, the idea

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.480 align:middle line:90%
that we live in a solid world.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, we must live
in a solid world

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.040 align:middle line:90%
because it's made of atoms.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:90%
Oh really?

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.890 align:middle line:90%
So atoms must be solid then?

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:08.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's a
quote about atoms.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:84%
Now atoms, of course, are
a nucleus with electrons

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.820 align:middle line:90%
flying around them.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.700 align:middle line:90%
Here's a quote.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:84%
If the nucleus were
the size of a peanut,

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.860 align:middle line:84%
the atom would be about the
size of a baseball stadium.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
If we lost all the dead
space inside our atoms,

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.500 align:middle line:84%
we would each be able to
fit into a particle of dust

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and the entire human race would
fit into the volume of a sugar

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:90%
cube.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.745 align:middle line:90%
The world ain't solid.

00:06:48.745 --> 00:06:51.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.550 align:middle line:90%
But we decode it to appear so.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.600 align:middle line:90%
So we experience it that way.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Now the whole base
form of this reality

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.340 align:middle line:84%
is wave form, wave
form information.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.520 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as,
like I say, Wi-Fi.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And we are decoding
that into this reality

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:21.450 align:middle line:84%
that we think is outside of
us but actually is in here.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So mainstream science
has this perception

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.460 align:middle line:84%
of what it calls
the observer effect.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:39.880 align:middle line:84%
What it says is that there is a
wave form field of information

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
which is the base
form of this reality

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and that only when we
look at it as they say,

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:57.070 align:middle line:84%
observe it, does that wave
form state become what

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:59.410 align:middle line:90%
we call the physical state.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And when we're
not looking at it,

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.140 align:middle line:84%
it's back in its
wave form state.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.180 align:middle line:90%
It's like Wi-Fi again.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
When a computer is not
decoding it into the form

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:84%
you see on the screen, then
it's in its Wi-Fi state.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
I say that when they call
it the observer effect,

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:90%
they've got the word wrong.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I would call it
the decoder effect.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:31.060 align:middle line:84%
The act of observation
triggers the process

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:84%
through which we decode
the wave form information

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:37.720 align:middle line:90%
into physical reality--

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:43.330 align:middle line:84%
actually holographic
reality-- illusory physical.

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.130 align:middle line:90%
So how does this work?

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, just look at
the five senses.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.860 align:middle line:84%
The five senses take
wave form information.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.710 align:middle line:84%
They turn it into
electrical information.

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And they communicate
it to the brain

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
which then decodes it
into digital holographic

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.010 align:middle line:90%
information.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's the world we
experience as outside of us

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.830 align:middle line:84%
when it's all going on in
here just as the internet

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:84%
as we experience it is all
going on inside the computer.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:90%
And so if you take--

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.300 align:middle line:84%
take the obvious one, the
ear, but all the senses work

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.920 align:middle line:84%
like this, the ear
picks up wave form.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:33.340 align:middle line:84%
As I'm speaking now, I'm sending
out wave form information

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:38.380 align:middle line:84%
fields which people decode
through the ear sensors

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.620 align:middle line:84%
into electrical information,
communicate it to the brain,

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:47.020 align:middle line:84%
and it becomes holographic
and digital information,

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:90%
digital holograms.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:55.750 align:middle line:84%
And what happens when the
brain is decoding that is

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
it only takes enough information
to construct a reality.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take all the
information that it receives.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.150 align:middle line:84%
According to mainstream
science, the brain

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:17.770 align:middle line:84%
is receiving through the site
senses 11 million sensations

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.730 align:middle line:84%
as they call them, pieces of
information, every second.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:28.240 align:middle line:84%
And then it takes around 40
a second out of 11 million

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.700 align:middle line:90%
to construct our reality.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.680 align:middle line:84%
And all the way through
history, whether it's religion

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:42.690 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's other human
phenomena and pressures,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:84%
we have been discouraged from
exploring what reality really

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:51.890 align:middle line:90%
is.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.910 align:middle line:84%
And I would suggest
there's a reason for that.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Once you realize
how reality works,

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:07.880 align:middle line:84%
you realize we are in control
of it and not random events.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.795 align:middle line:90%
We are not at the mercy of life.

00:11:11.795 --> 00:11:15.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:21.020 align:middle line:84%
We are creating that life
even though we may not

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:90%
realize that we're doing so.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:32.060 align:middle line:84%
So we will live within this
what I call cosmic Wi-Fi, what

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.090 align:middle line:84%
is described by
others in science

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:40.910 align:middle line:84%
as the cosmic field or the
quantum field of possibility

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:43.340 align:middle line:90%
and probability.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And so within that field
is infinite possibility.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:56.480 align:middle line:90%
What from that field do we take?

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.800 align:middle line:84%
In the same way as you have
a Wi-Fi field containing

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:84%
the entire internet and
your perceptions of reality

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:14.070 align:middle line:84%
if you like, what you like, what
you're enthusiastic about, how

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:20.700 align:middle line:84%
you feel decides what
part of that internet

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:25.220 align:middle line:84%
you are going to access to put
on the screen as an experience.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:28.000 align:middle line:90%


00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.040 align:middle line:84%
We are doing that
in the same theme

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:41.600 align:middle line:84%
as we live our lives,
because the key to everything

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.450 align:middle line:90%
is perception.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.950 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a frequency.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Every thought is a frequency.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.920 align:middle line:90%
Hate is a frequency.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.400 align:middle line:90%
Love is another frequency.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.630 align:middle line:90%
Every emotion is a frequency.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And so perceptions are
represented by frequencies.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a perception
and self-identity

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:84%
that you are little
me, I have no power,

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:84%
then that is represented-- that
self-identity self-perception

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:21.110 align:middle line:84%
is represented as a
band of frequency.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And you are therefore
interacting with this quantum

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:84%
field of possibility
and probability

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.950 align:middle line:90%
within that band of frequency.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.400 align:middle line:84%
And what you're going to
create with that feedback loop

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:90%
is a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:41.650 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
live a life that is

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:84%
manifested from your perception
of little me, I have no power.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.930 align:middle line:84%
It will be a life of
little me, I have no power.

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:55.430 align:middle line:84%
But if you have another
self-identity, which

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
is that I am consciousness,
I am awareness,

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.520 align:middle line:84%
my body is the vehicle
for my awareness

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:11.430 align:middle line:84%
to experience in a very
transitory way, very brief way,

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
this reality we call the
world, but I am consciousness.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:22.880 align:middle line:84%
I am infinite awareness,
exploring the infinite forever

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.920 align:middle line:84%
forever and this is just
one step on the road.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle line:84%
Now that self-identity,
that perception of self,

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.800 align:middle line:84%
has a completely different
band of frequency.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.190 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
expanded sense of self,

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:84%
you have an expanded
frequency range

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.660 align:middle line:84%
in which you are
interacting with possibility

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.510 align:middle line:84%
and probability in
the quantum field.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.425 align:middle line:84%
And that is going to create
a feedback loop between you

00:14:55.425 --> 00:14:59.190 align:middle line:84%
and the field, which is going to
bring you a very different life

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.555 align:middle line:90%
to little me, I have no power.

00:15:00.555 --> 00:15:03.170 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Those that have been through
this process of awakening

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:10.730 align:middle line:90%
have noticed--

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.060 align:middle line:90%
I did in my own life--

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:14.140 align:middle line:84%
the suddenly amazing
synchronicity

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.870 align:middle line:84%
starts to happen that
wasn't happening before--

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Amazing bits of luck,
things happening

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:24.600 align:middle line:84%
just when you need them. oh,
crikey, that's a miracle there.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:26.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you are now,
because of your awakening

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and your expansion
of consciousness,

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.740 align:middle line:84%
interacting with the
quantum field of possibility

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:84%
and probability in a much more
expanded and high frequency

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:84%
way, you are going to
manifest that synchronicity

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:42.550 align:middle line:90%
that little me is not.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
So perception is the
dictator of our lives.

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:90%
And I tell you the good news.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.870 align:middle line:90%
We can control the perception.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:02.605 align:middle line:84%
And here's a is a great
quote kind of encapsulates

00:16:02.605 --> 00:16:03.480 align:middle line:90%
what I'm saying here.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.850 align:middle line:90%
It's by a man called Alan Watts.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.830 align:middle line:90%
He was a very aware man.

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Died some decades ago now but
he is still very, very popular

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.870 align:middle line:84%
on the internet with the talks
he did, which he did many.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:19.790 align:middle line:90%
But here's what he said.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Without the brain, the world is
devoid of light, heat, weight,

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.130 align:middle line:84%
solidity, motion,
space, time, or

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.040 align:middle line:90%
any other imaginable feature.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:10%
All these phenomena are
interactions or transactions

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:44.180 align:middle line:10%
of vibrations with a certain
arrangement of neurons.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.620 align:middle line:90%
And that's what they are.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.600 align:middle line:90%
Solidity is an illusion.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:84%
Weight, motion, these
are all decoding

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:57.540 align:middle line:84%
phenomena of the brain from the
wave form information field.

00:16:57.540 --> 00:16:59.580 align:middle line:90%
And then you talk about--

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.305 align:middle line:90%
talk about here time.

00:17:01.305 --> 00:17:04.800 align:middle line:90%


00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.069 align:middle line:90%
There is no time.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.869 align:middle line:90%
Oy, there is.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:07.669 align:middle line:90%
I've got a watch.

00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:90%
Well, what is that?

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.109 align:middle line:90%
That's human created.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Time, which we believe is real.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:84%
There is only one
moment that exists.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:20.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's the now moment.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.569 align:middle line:84%
All the rest is illusion,
creation of the decoding

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:90%
processes of the brain.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.465 align:middle line:84%
So people will say,
well, time exists.

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:30.090 align:middle line:84%
But what about the
past and the future?

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:30.890 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:33.990 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, let's go
through that then.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.520 align:middle line:84%
When you're thinking
about the past,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.670 align:middle line:84%
and you're regretting all that
stuff, and saying if only,

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:40.940 align:middle line:90%
where are you?

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:42.540 align:middle line:90%
Well, you're in the now.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:46.240 align:middle line:84%
And when you're worrying
about the future

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:51.010 align:middle line:84%
or being ambitious about
the future, where are you?

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.850 align:middle line:90%
You're in the now.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And then when what we call the
future becomes an experience,

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:00.250 align:middle line:90%
that experience is in the now.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.710 align:middle line:90%
There is only the now.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:90%
And yet you look at our society.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:09.040 align:middle line:84%
It is dominated by
the illusion of time.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.790 align:middle line:90%
But time is just that.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.910 align:middle line:90%
It's an illusion.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:90%
And here's another quote.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:21.100 align:middle line:90%
You'll probably know this one.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Very famous one from
"The Matrix" movie,

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:29.200 align:middle line:84%
the first one, when
Neo is being given

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:35.350 align:middle line:84%
the rundown on the illusion
that he's been living in what he

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.110 align:middle line:90%
thought was a physical world.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And he's taken into a computer
program which looks just as

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:44.360 align:middle line:90%
real as his real world.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And he says to the Morpheus
character, "This isn't real."

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.290 align:middle line:90%
And Morpheus said this.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:54.140 align:middle line:90%


00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:90%
"What is real?

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:90%
How do you define real?

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.500 align:middle line:84%
If you're talking about
what you can feel,

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.260 align:middle line:84%
what you can smell,
taste, and see,

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:11.580 align:middle line:84%
then real is simply
electrical signals

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle line:90%
interpreted by your brain."

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:19.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's all it is.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Now what power
would it give anyone

00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:38.260 align:middle line:84%
who knew that this is how we
create reality, but created

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:41.190 align:middle line:84%
a society to keep this
knowledge from us?

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.030 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:48.510 align:middle line:84%
What if they had the knowledge
that if they can manipulate

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:57.810 align:middle line:84%
your brain to decode
reality in a certain way,

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:03.680 align:middle line:84%
they could ensure by that
manipulation that you created,

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:09.620 align:middle line:84%
thus experienced, thus believed
in a reality that suited them

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:10.920 align:middle line:90%
even if it didn't suit you?

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.880 align:middle line:90%


00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
we're looking at.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:21.350 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at a human society
that has been systematically

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:27.200 align:middle line:84%
structured to keep the
truth about reality from us.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:84%
So we are living the
illusion of a physical world

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.990 align:middle line:84%
with all its sense
of limitation,

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.430 align:middle line:84%
and I can't, and
it's not possible

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:43.950 align:middle line:84%
while, from the shadows,
our perceptions are

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:49.760 align:middle line:90%
being manipulated and imposed.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:53.360 align:middle line:84%
Those perceptions
then dictate how

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.290 align:middle line:84%
the brain decodes
that information

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:84%
that we're receiving into a
reality that we experience.

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
the more you can

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.800 align:middle line:84%
persuade people they're
little me and have no power,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.390 align:middle line:84%
the more they will live little
me I have no power lives

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:16.610 align:middle line:84%
and thus be no problem
to the prevailing order

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:20.310 align:middle line:90%
and the prevailing authority.

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:23.730 align:middle line:84%
And this has been
going on for centuries

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:28.890 align:middle line:84%
and is reaching ridiculously
extreme proportions now

00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:35.000 align:middle line:84%
in terms of humanity's
perception being manipulated.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And so to make strange,
amazing things happen

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.677 align:middle line:84%
that are called miracles
and stuff like that, which

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:44.510 align:middle line:84%
in many ways that
experience of mine in Peru

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.300 align:middle line:84%
would have been called,
all you've got to do

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.670 align:middle line:84%
is introduce information
into the field

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:54.650 align:middle line:84%
and people will decode that
information into an experience.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.020 align:middle line:90%
That's all this world is.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:01.070 align:middle line:84%
It's information,
decoding information,

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:02.960 align:middle line:90%
interacting with information.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:09.590 align:middle line:84%
A computer is information
encoded to decode information.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:11.390 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And thus if you can
control the information,

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:90%
you control the reality.

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we have
this obsession by authority

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:90%
in controlling information.

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:28.430 align:middle line:84%
That's why we're having
now this explosion,

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
this hysterical explosion
of censorship by the Silicon

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Valley corporations as
we've had in the mainstream

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.370 align:middle line:84%
media over a much longer
period, because if you control

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:42.830 align:middle line:84%
information, you
control perception.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.080 align:middle line:84%
Where do people get
their perceptions from?

00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:46.730 align:middle line:84%
They get it from
information received.

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:48.063 align:middle line:90%
It might be the 10 o'clock news.

00:22:48.063 --> 00:22:50.950 align:middle line:90%
It might be a teacher at school.

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:52.760 align:middle line:84%
It might be a
personal experience.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:56.210 align:middle line:84%
But that information
then forms a perception.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.725 align:middle line:90%
And what does perception become?

00:22:57.725 --> 00:22:59.630 align:middle line:90%
Becomes behavior.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you can
control information,

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:02.648 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
control perception.

00:23:02.648 --> 00:23:05.840 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
control behavior.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And that is the foundation
of human control.

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:16.590 align:middle line:84%
And it's all founded on
keeping us in ignorance--

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:26.680 align:middle line:84%
ignorance-- of the very reality
that we are experiencing.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And thus the entirety of
human society day after day,

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:37.840 align:middle line:84%
minute after minute,
is founded and is

00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.220 align:middle line:84%
lived on a complete
illusion of the very world

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:90%
that we're experiencing.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:84%
And if there is going
to be, and there

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:57.190 align:middle line:84%
is, a revolution
to free humanity

00:23:57.190 --> 00:24:01.710 align:middle line:84%
from this manipulated
ignorance, it

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:09.550 align:middle line:84%
has to be a revolution
of perception,

00:24:09.550 --> 00:24:12.880 align:middle line:84%
because from perception
comes everything.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Change perception,
change reality.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.170 align:middle line:84%
Change perception,
change the world

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.750 align:middle line:84%
for all the reasons
I'm talking about.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:90%


00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the world went
through that transformation.

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's beginning
to faster and faster.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:35.740 align:middle line:84%
The more people come
out of little me,

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.400 align:middle line:84%
the more people come out of
I can't, it's not possible,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:46.110 align:middle line:84%
the more this world will
change in dramatic ways.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:52.410 align:middle line:84%
And it won't take a
single gun, a single tank,

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.070 align:middle line:90%
even a single protest.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:03.480 align:middle line:84%
It will just take expressions of
all that is, has been, and ever

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:06.210 align:middle line:84%
can be who have bought
the illusion that they are

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:10.710 align:middle line:84%
their labels, and
their limitations that

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:18.150 align:middle line:84%
come with those labels,
remembering who we are.

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.540 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness,
infinite potential,

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:25.770 align:middle line:84%
having a brief
experience called human.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.250 align:middle line:10%
This understanding of
reality, how we create it,

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:10%
how we experience it, is
not just esoteric navel

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.660 align:middle line:10%
contemplating.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.385 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a bit of interest.

00:25:39.385 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that's interesting.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:84%
It's absolutely fundamental,
this understanding,

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:53.020 align:middle line:84%
to humanity taking the
power back from the few

00:25:53.020 --> 00:26:02.270 align:middle line:84%
by realizing that although
we let life live us,

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:09.370 align:middle line:84%
we have the power to
live life on our terms

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:14.960 align:middle line:84%
because we are the
governor of experience.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:20.050 align:middle line:84%
At the moment, what's
happening is we are being

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:26.510 align:middle line:84%
or we are having our perceptions
externally manipulated.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:29.840 align:middle line:84%
Those perceptions manifest
as a frequency band

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.630 align:middle line:84%
which is the band
of limitation we

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:36.110 align:middle line:84%
interact with the quantum field
of possibility and probability.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And that feedback loop
becomes our experience reality

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:90%
which reflects our perception.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:45.942 align:middle line:84%
So our perceptions
today, even though we

00:26:45.942 --> 00:26:47.900 align:middle line:84%
don't realize there's a
connection between that

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.890 align:middle line:84%
and what we experience,
are dictating our reality.

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:58.850 align:middle line:84%
What the awakening really
is is to take that knowledge

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and then say now, instead of
my perceptions being externally

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:08.000 align:middle line:84%
manipulated, or me being
told that I have no power

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and I'm little me
and irrelevant,

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:84%
and thus creating
that life, I'm now

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:17.540 align:middle line:84%
going to dictate what
my perceptions are

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and particularly
my self identity.

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.780 align:middle line:90%
What is this I?

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:26.730 align:middle line:84%
And from that
expanded self-identity

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.060 align:middle line:90%
comes expanded life experience.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And the few cannot control the
many once they lose control

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.900 align:middle line:90%
of human perception.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:84%
And that bottom line is what we
call the human awakening, which

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:48.890 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you from experience
going around the world

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:53.450 align:middle line:84%
is happening on a scale
now I've never seen before.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:57.050 align:middle line:90%


00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And it's understanding
reality that

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:04.280 align:middle line:90%
holds the key to everything.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
authorities have

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:15.020 align:middle line:84%
spent centuries, eons, keeping
the nature of that reality

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.400 align:middle line:90%
from us.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And now that information
is returning.

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.580 align:middle line:84%
And with it, we'll
become a human world

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.960 align:middle line:84%
that we would think from today's
perspective is just utopia.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.120 align:middle line:90%
That could never happen.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:41.920 align:middle line:10%
That utopia is simply a change
of human perception away.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:48.280 align:middle line:10%
And that is in our power to do.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.430 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.000 align:middle line:90%
