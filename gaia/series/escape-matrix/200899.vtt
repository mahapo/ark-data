00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.350 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.175 align:middle line:84%
I'm David Icke, and the subject
today is the human program.

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:25.380 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.390 align:middle line:10%
When you break it
down, human life

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.660 align:middle line:10%
is one long perceptual download.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.630 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't have to be.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.210 align:middle line:84%
We can take our power
back and override it.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:84%
But, overwhelmingly,
that's what it is.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:84%
Just break it down
into the sequence

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:90%
that we call human life.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
You come into the
world as a baby.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.250 align:middle line:84%
Immediately your
perceptions of reality

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:84%
are influenced by your parents,
not because they are malevolent

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.370 align:middle line:84%
but because they've been through
the programming process you're

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.050 align:middle line:90%
about to go through.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.270 align:middle line:90%
They bought it.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.990 align:middle line:84%
They bought its
version of normal.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And they think the
best thing they can

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:90%
do for you is to pass it on.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.950 align:middle line:90%
So it starts early.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And then you've only just
come into the world, right?

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.040 align:middle line:84%
You come into this
reality, blinking

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:90%
and trying to get a fix on it.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as
you've arrived, what

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:90%
is it now, three, four years?

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.220 align:middle line:84%
You find yourself sitting
at a desk with an authority

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.290 align:middle line:84%
figure representing the state
telling you what to believe,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.360 align:middle line:84%
what's real, what's
not real, what's right,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.920 align:middle line:90%
what's not right, and so on.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
And so you are then
taken from your parents

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
for the waking day, much of
it, week after week after week

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:90%
to receive the download.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Starts with the smallest
children, and then it

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:90%
gets more and more intense.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And you go through
school, and you go

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.670 align:middle line:90%
through college and university.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.670 align:middle line:84%
And day after day
after day, you are

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.790 align:middle line:84%
receiving the system's version
of everything-- of history,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.070 align:middle line:84%
of medicine, of
science, all of it.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And if you succumb to the
download and you accept it

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:90%
and you take your exams--

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:90%
what are exams, really?

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
They're an examination
of whether you've

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.990 align:middle line:84%
taken the program or not because
an exam is the system saying

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.340 align:middle line:84%
to you, tell me what
I've told you to believe,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and if you tell
me well enough, we

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.430 align:middle line:84%
are going to reward
you with an exam pass.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.490 align:middle line:84%
If, however, you are in the
system, in the school system,

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:33.300 align:middle line:84%
in the education system and
you're not buying the program

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
and you want to ask
questions, well, then there's

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.790 align:middle line:90%
a problem often.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Teacher's on the phone to
their mother or their father.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.330 align:middle line:90%
Hello, Mrs. Smith.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Um, we've got a
problem with Johnny.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:90%
All right, what's happening?

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.040 align:middle line:90%
He's asking questions.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do it.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And you're called a
disruptive influence.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:90%
He can't concentrate.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.500 align:middle line:90%
She can't concentrate.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And you get the
stick as the people

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.590 align:middle line:84%
accepting the programming and
repeating it get the carrot.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And, oh, by the way,
there's some big changes.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.149 align:middle line:84%
When you go from the school
education, college university

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:84%
system, and you go
out into the world,

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:23.370 align:middle line:84%
everything changes because it's
all about control and accepting

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.170 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.120 align:middle line:84%
That's fundamentally
part of the programming.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So all the way through
your school life,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.420 align:middle line:84%
you've been in bed in
the morning, like, mm,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and your mom comes in
or your dad and says,

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:90%
quick, get out of bed.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.500 align:middle line:90%
You'll be late for school.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.520 align:middle line:90%
What will the teacher say?

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.320 align:middle line:90%
You get up.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.542 align:middle line:90%
Oh, can't be late for school.

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:47.500 align:middle line:90%
Prison door's shutting.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.100 align:middle line:90%
Quick, let me in.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.930 align:middle line:84%
And then it all changes
when you leave school

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:84%
because then you go out
into the world of work,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.580 align:middle line:84%
and you're in bed, and your
partner comes in and says,

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.720 align:middle line:90%
quick, get out of bed.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.830 align:middle line:90%
You'll be late for work.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.820 align:middle line:90%
What will the boss say?

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.560 align:middle line:90%


00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:15.490 align:middle line:84%
In other words, nothing
changes except the personnel

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:90%
and the title.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.300 align:middle line:90%
Control-- do as you're told.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.190 align:middle line:84%
And so you go out
into the institutions.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And because everyone's been
through the same program

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.890 align:middle line:84%
and overwhelmingly accepted
it, everyone's confirming

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.800 align:middle line:84%
to everyone else that
this version of normal--

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.140 align:middle line:84%
what I call the postage
stamp consensus--

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.710 align:middle line:90%
is how things are.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And so anyone that steps off the
postage stamp, people like me

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.250 align:middle line:84%
that sprint off it,
heading for the horizon

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.490 align:middle line:84%
as fast as possible, you're
mad, mate, you're crazy,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.790 align:middle line:90%
or even you're dangerous.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.170 align:middle line:84%
In my case, all
of them, it seems.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this postage
stamp consensus

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:12.920 align:middle line:84%
is what dominates the perception
of reality of politicians that

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.650 align:middle line:84%
are making decisions about what
happens in the world-- at least

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.240 align:middle line:90%
on the surface, they are.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.645 align:middle line:84%
Shadow people really make
them, but on the surface.

00:06:20.645 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And they perceive
reality and thus

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
make the decisions in
relation to that reality

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.710 align:middle line:84%
only on the basis of the
programming of reality

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:84%
that they've been
downloading all their lives.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
make terrible decisions

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:84%
because they're making
decisions about a reality based

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:84%
on information that's almost in
total nonsensical and not true.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Then they go out to be doctors,
and they're making decisions

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.290 align:middle line:84%
on how to treat people in
terms of health and illness

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:07.370 align:middle line:84%
on the basis of an understanding
of the body that is nothing

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:90%
like the body really is.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the postage stamp
normal version of the body.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:15.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a physical body,
and you can only

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.512 align:middle line:84%
treat it with physical things,
the scalpel and the drug,

00:07:22.512 --> 00:07:24.970 align:middle line:84%
which, by the way, has the
added benefit of making billions

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:26.920 align:middle line:84%
of billions of
billions of dollars

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:84%
for the pharmaceutical
cartel, which

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
those that own the education
programming system also

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.170 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.720 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And scientists pursue
the nature of reality

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.800 align:middle line:84%
often or don't feel
it's worth doing that,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.010 align:middle line:84%
and they lay their lives on
the basis of the postage stamp

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.670 align:middle line:90%
version of normal.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Journalists-- journalists
constantly all reporting

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.270 align:middle line:84%
the world on all the
different expressions of media

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:90%
on the basis--

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.880 align:middle line:84%
their points of reference from
which they judge everything--

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.995 align:middle line:84%
from this same postage
stamp consensus normal.

00:08:14.995 --> 00:08:16.620 align:middle line:84%
So they don't even
understand the world

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.537 align:middle line:90%
they're writing about.

00:08:17.537 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:84%
That's why they write so much
nonsense and ridicule and abuse

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:84%
anyone who is an
off-stamp perceiver.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.740 align:middle line:90%


00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And what is this
postage stamp consensus?

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:44.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a narrow band of
possibility, which is taught--

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:51.070 align:middle line:84%
downloaded-- throughout a
person's educational life.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's then when they go
out into the adult world,

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:58.150 align:middle line:84%
underpinned and confirmed by
all these institutions and 24/7

00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:00.540 align:middle line:90%
by the mainstream media.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, if all you've ever heard
is one set of information

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.730 align:middle line:84%
and possibility, what are
the chances that you're going

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:11.250 align:middle line:84%
to believe it's real and live
your life on the basis of this

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.150 align:middle line:84%
information being real,
being true when it ain't?

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is how it's gone on
generation after generation

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.490 align:middle line:90%
after generation.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And the nature of the postage
stamp might have changed.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.040 align:middle line:84%
At one time in the
Christian world,

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:84%
it was if it's not in the Bible
you're off the postage stamp.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a bit
wider because it's

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.650 align:middle line:84%
encompassed things like
mainstream science and all

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.450 align:middle line:90%
that stuff.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:84%
But it's still of
enormous limitation.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:90%


00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:54.200 align:middle line:84%
And what it means is that
throughout people's lives

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.850 align:middle line:84%
from what we call
cradle to grave,

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:84%
people are downloading a
perception of normal, which

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
is overwhelmingly
nonsensical, simply not true,

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:13.610 align:middle line:84%
and at best a fraction
of what there is to know.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you are a
network, the network

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.870 align:middle line:84%
I've been exposing
for 30 years, that

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:32.420 align:middle line:84%
wishes to direct human
society to unfold

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:39.520 align:middle line:84%
an agenda for human society
which needs humanity to trot on

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:49.700 align:middle line:84%
behind it, then do you want
free-thinking, open-hearted,

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:56.750 align:middle line:84%
all-possibility-exploring
humans or do

00:10:56.750 --> 00:11:01.730 align:middle line:84%
you want people programmed
with a perception of reality

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:84%
of great limitation, especially
in perception of self-identity

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:12.850 align:middle line:84%
and self, which suits right
now your agenda for humanity?

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.220 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you want the latter.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's why they've
set up this system

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:25.330 align:middle line:84%
of perceptual programming
underpinned in the earliest

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:84%
period of someone's life by the
education system and then that

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.390 align:middle line:84%
constantly supported
and confirmed

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:90%
through the rest of their life.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.870 align:middle line:84%
So basically what they want
is people walking from cradle

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
to grave through a little
tunnel of immense limitation

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:50.920 align:middle line:84%
of possibility and then
drop off the other end--

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.270 align:middle line:84%
so never exploring beyond
it, because when you do,

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.910 align:middle line:84%
you start to find out
things and understand things

00:11:57.910 --> 00:12:05.140 align:middle line:84%
and perceive things, which is
extremely bad for this agenda

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.925 align:middle line:90%
of human control.

00:12:06.925 --> 00:12:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And all we're seeing today with
this postage stamp consensus

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.030 align:middle line:84%
sausage machine is a modern-day
expression of something

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:24.380 align:middle line:84%
that's been going on,
like I say, generation

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:90%
after generation.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:30.440 align:middle line:84%
And the common theme of all
its different expressions

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:37.710 align:middle line:84%
is control of information, which
leads to control of perception.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.810 align:middle line:84%
So religion was the big
controller of perception.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And as that waned, so other
controllers of perception

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:46.010 align:middle line:90%
came in.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same principle.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:52.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the same blueprint going
on generation after generation.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:90%
And what we're seeing today--

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.380 align:middle line:84%
well, I say what
we're seeing today.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It's more extreme
and obvious now.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's been going on all
the way through this period.

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:05.690 align:middle line:84%
One of the great ways
that they achieve

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.480 align:middle line:84%
their end of human
perceptual control

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and keep them on
the postage stamp

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:17.120 align:middle line:84%
is by getting the sheep that
have accepted this to sheep

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.910 align:middle line:90%
the other sheep into line.

00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Humans have been manipulated
to keep each other in line

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
because it's those that have
accepted the postage stamp

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:37.530 align:middle line:84%
version of everything that then
give a hard time to anyone who

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:90%
doesn't want to accept that.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:84%
So in the religious-dominated
days-- of course,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.910 align:middle line:84%
they still are, but, I mean, in
the way of the Christian world,

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:84%
for instance, that had
enormous levels of control

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.630 align:middle line:84%
and domination more
than it has now--

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.150 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.830 align:middle line:84%
it was you're a blasphemer or
you're a this, you're a that,

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:84%
you're the devil's child, if you
wanted to step off the postage

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.750 align:middle line:84%
stamp, which in those days was
to not accept every last word

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:84%
and syllable in the Bible might
actually be literally true.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.510 align:middle line:90%
Today, it's moved on.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:22.530 align:middle line:84%
It's become much more
multi-leveled and much more

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.190 align:middle line:90%
obvious, really.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And you've only got to look at
the policing of opinion today

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:40.800 align:middle line:84%
and the policing of
freedom of speech

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:46.850 align:middle line:84%
to see how the herd
has been manipulated

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:51.530 align:middle line:84%
to police and control the
herd and to frighten them

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.730 align:middle line:90%
into a line.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So if you say things now or
have opinions that are outside

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.860 align:middle line:84%
the postage stamp, which
get narrower and narrower

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:84%
and narrower-- you can't say
that, you can't say that,

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:84%
you can't say that, it's that,
it's that, it's the other--

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.110 align:middle line:84%
then the tidal wave
comes down on you.

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:84%
You are subject to
abuse, to ridicule,

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:28.450 align:middle line:84%
to labels that usually have an
"ism" or an "ist" at the end.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:31.980 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And you're given labels
of abuse because you

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.130 align:middle line:84%
have a different opinion
or you see a situation

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:84%
different from what the
official narrative says

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:48.010 align:middle line:84%
you should be thinking,
seeing, and accepting.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.520 align:middle line:90%
And we've now moved--

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.990 align:middle line:84%
and this was the
natural outcome of this.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:16:00.270 align:middle line:84%
We've moved into now
the realm of even

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:02.790 align:middle line:84%
going beyond just abuse
and ridicule for having

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:90%
the wrong opinion.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:84%
We've gone into the realm
of hysterical levels

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:13.945 align:middle line:84%
of censorship, not least
coming out of Silicon Valley.

00:16:13.945 --> 00:16:16.480 align:middle line:90%


00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:90%
And this is systematic.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.640 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Because two things--
as more people awaken,

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.610 align:middle line:84%
they start to see things
they hadn't seen before.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.640 align:middle line:84%
They start to see
actually the world is not

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.540 align:middle line:90%
like they thought it was.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And this world event
or that world event

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
was not actually like
they were told it was.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.530 align:middle line:90%


00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And as this agenda
of human control,

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:84%
which was so
predicted decades ago

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:01.420 align:middle line:84%
by people like George Orwell
and Aldous Huxley in "1984"

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.357 align:middle line:84%
and "Brave New
World--" why did they--

00:17:04.357 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:90%
why were they so accurate?

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.119 align:middle line:84%
Because they had a good
idea what was coming,

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:10.660 align:middle line:84%
because this thing is
not made up by the day.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:90%
It's long planned.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:18.890 align:middle line:84%
So as people start to
awaken and as the nature

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:23.810 align:middle line:84%
of this human control, this
Orwellian state, global state,

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:28.069 align:middle line:84%
national state starts to come
in more obviously, people

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:34.670 align:middle line:84%
are starting to realize, whoa,
I can see what's happening here.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, perception is
controlled by information.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to
control perception,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:90%
you have to control information.

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:84%
And what's unfolded in
the period of the internet

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:53.270 align:middle line:84%
is what's known as
the alternative media

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.890 align:middle line:84%
and different
expressions of what's

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:56.420 align:middle line:90%
called the alternative media.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And they have been
putting out information

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.510 align:middle line:84%
which is challenging
the official narrative

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:06.380 align:middle line:90%
of everything, of reality--

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.595 align:middle line:84%
some of it-- and mostly
of what is really

00:18:10.595 --> 00:18:12.470 align:middle line:84%
happening in the world
and why it's happening

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.300 align:middle line:84%
and where the world
is being taken.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you're going to
control perceptions

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.440 align:middle line:84%
so people don't
see what's going on

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.820 align:middle line:84%
and react to it in a way
that doesn't suit you,

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:27.180 align:middle line:84%
you've got to stop people having
access to that information.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And so we've had this gathering
censorship to just cut it out.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And then we've had
this phenomenon

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:84%
that has risen in recent
times called progressive.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:51.810 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:55.200 align:middle line:90%
What is progressive?

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.120 align:middle line:90%
It's called liberal.

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Liberal and progressive
are interchangeable.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.730 align:middle line:90%
No, they're not.

00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I come from a background
in working-class Leicester

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:84%
in England that you
would call liberal.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.023 align:middle line:90%
What does a liberal believe in?

00:19:15.023 --> 00:19:16.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a political liberal.

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm not political anything.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But a dictionary definition
of the word "liberal,"

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.050 align:middle line:90%
what does it mean?

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:26.270 align:middle line:84%
It means a desire for
maximum freedom of lifestyle,

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:84%
maximum freedom of choice,
maximum freedom of expression,

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.325 align:middle line:90%
maximum freedom of opinion.

00:19:31.325 --> 00:19:34.290 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.997 align:middle line:84%
And basically my
philosophy on life

00:19:35.997 --> 00:19:38.080 align:middle line:84%
is do what you like so
long as you don't impose it

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.440 align:middle line:90%
on anyone else.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.520 align:middle line:90%
That's liberal.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:52.110 align:middle line:84%
What's-- again, it's come out
of the education system and this

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.923 align:middle line:84%
college university
system overwhelmingly,

00:19:54.923 --> 00:19:56.340 align:middle line:84%
first of all in
the United States.

00:19:56.340 --> 00:20:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Well, I tell you, it's happening
in Britain now and elsewhere.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.230 align:middle line:90%
That's called progressive.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And this progressive is
the opposite of liberal.

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.170 align:middle line:90%
It's the inversion of liberal.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:13.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not about freedom
of all those things.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:90%
It's about destroying them.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It's about not saying
freedom of speech.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.580 align:middle line:84%
It's telling you
what you can't say

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.380 align:middle line:84%
and what you must
say if you don't

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.850 align:middle line:90%
want a tidal wave of abuse.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:31.140 align:middle line:84%
It's about telling you how
you must live your life

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:84%
and how, if you don't
agree with my opinion,

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:39.990 align:middle line:84%
you are by definition
wrong because I'm right.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:90%
The only right is I am right.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And because I'm right and you
have a different opinion to me,

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.950 align:middle line:90%
therefore, you must be wrong.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And what this is doing is
squeezing even the postage

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:84%
stamp and destroying
human discourse.

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:11.690 align:middle line:90%
And what is human discourse?

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:84%
It is the exchange of
opinion and information,

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.540 align:middle line:90%
which impacts upon perception.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.900 align:middle line:84%
Do people want to
form their perceptions

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.770 align:middle line:84%
from that much information
and possibility and ways

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:30.463 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the
different situations

00:21:30.463 --> 00:21:32.630 align:middle line:84%
or do they want to form
their perceptions from that?

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:90%
That's freedom.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.625 align:middle line:90%
That is tyranny.

00:21:38.625 --> 00:21:41.130 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:45.060 align:middle line:84%
Those that want to control
that discourse and control what

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:50.970 align:middle line:84%
people see and hear and
only limit that to what

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:54.120 align:middle line:84%
suits the agenda
because the perceptions

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:84%
that that see and hear
information generates

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.720 align:middle line:84%
are the perceptions
the network of control

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.720 align:middle line:90%
wants humans to have.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
What's the-- what's one of
the major pressures that

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:23.600 align:middle line:84%
gets people to conform to
the official narrative,

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.940 align:middle line:90%
to the postage stamp?

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:32.780 align:middle line:84%
Peer pressure, not pressure from
those in positions of power,

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:36.470 align:middle line:84%
not pressure from Donald
Trump or Barack Obama

00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:42.500 align:middle line:84%
or George Bush or
Bill Clinton, pressure

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.650 align:middle line:84%
from those around
them, their peers,

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:52.240 align:middle line:84%
who are insisting that they
must believe what they believe

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:90%
or else.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's becoming more and
more extreme, as I say.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And so I observe
the world and I see

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:84%
people who think
they are anti-system,

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:12.660 align:middle line:84%
who think they are radical,
and they are playing the game

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:20.400 align:middle line:84%
exactly as those they think are
opposing want them to play it.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.470 align:middle line:90%
Destroy human discourse.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.110 align:middle line:90%
Destroy freedom of speech.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Destroy freedom of lifestyle,
freedom of opinion.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.930 align:middle line:84%
And the more that
happens, the more

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:39.420 align:middle line:84%
the ability to circulate the
information that gives people

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:44.850 align:middle line:84%
another fix on the
world will be deleted.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.340 align:middle line:90%
And it's like everything.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:54.340 align:middle line:84%
When you look at any situation
where the few are controlling

00:23:54.340 --> 00:24:02.270 align:middle line:84%
the many, the acquiescence of
the many and the activation

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
of the many to police
and control the many

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:90%
is absolutely essential.

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:15.600 align:middle line:90%
So where does this take us?

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:20.750 align:middle line:84%
It takes us to an
understanding, I

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:26.680 align:middle line:84%
would suggest, that if we are
going to break the program

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and take back control of our
perceptions, which means taking

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:33.590 align:middle line:84%
back control of
our lives, then we

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
have to stall downloading the
system's version of everything

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.320 align:middle line:84%
and start with a
blank sheet of paper,

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:48.710 align:middle line:84%
symbolically or literally,
and say, OK, from now on,

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:53.570 align:middle line:84%
what I'm going to accept
as my perception of reality

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.810 align:middle line:84%
or perception of this
situation has got to earn

00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.410 align:middle line:90%
its place on this paper.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.950 align:middle line:84%
And to earn its
place, it's not going

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:84%
to get there by me
just accepting it

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:12.590 align:middle line:84%
because someone with a title
or some position of authority

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:90%
tells me that's how things are.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to say, OK, what's
the evidence to back this up?

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:24.400 align:middle line:84%
You're saying this is true,
but let's check this out.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:90%
Is it true?

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Scientist, you
may be a scientist.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.590 align:middle line:90%
You may be an eminent professor.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.800 align:middle line:84%
But you are not getting
on my piece of paper

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.490 align:middle line:84%
unless you justify what
you're asking me to believe.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and by the way,
what I'm going to do

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.010 align:middle line:84%
is not just get my
information from you anymore.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to explore myself.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to research and
question myself and see

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.340 align:middle line:84%
what I come up with
in terms of what

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:90%
gets on my sheet of perception.

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:02.700 align:middle line:90%
And what you find--

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:04.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you from experience--

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:84%
when you start to do
that, in a few strides,

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:84%
you're off the
postage stamp and away

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and you start to realize that
the perceptional information

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.290 align:middle line:84%
sources that have been
controlling your life

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:25.580 align:middle line:84%
turn out to be or to
have feet of clay.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:84%
They're only believed
because of repetition.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.690 align:middle line:90%
Everyone knows that, mate.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:33.860 align:middle line:90%
Why do you say that?

00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Because that's all
you've ever heard--

00:26:37.530 --> 00:26:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and increasingly
so with the control

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.040 align:middle line:90%
of information and censorship.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And the other part of this
is to set ourselves free,

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:57.460 align:middle line:84%
to make it OK to have
a different opinion,

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:04.070 align:middle line:84%
to make it OK for someone to say
something you don't agree with,

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:10.830 align:middle line:84%
to conclude occasionally that
maybe we don't know it all

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and maybe other people might
have a contribution to give us

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.490 align:middle line:90%
a greater understanding.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.160 align:middle line:84%
But while we're saying I
am right and therefore,

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.400 align:middle line:84%
by definition, you must be
wrong, how can that happen?

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.670 align:middle line:90%
It can't.

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:30.600 align:middle line:84%
So people go deeper
and deeper and deeper

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:36.683 align:middle line:84%
into the illusion of
awareness, as they

00:27:36.683 --> 00:27:38.100 align:middle line:84%
go in deeper and
deeper and deeper

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.510 align:middle line:90%
into ignorance about everything.

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:84%
So we set ourselves
free by no longer taking

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:54.200 align:middle line:84%
what the system in all its
forms tells us we must believe,

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.530 align:middle line:84%
and we set each other
free to do the same.

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:01.550 align:middle line:90%
And what will happen?

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:06.110 align:middle line:84%
The amount of information and
opinion that is circulating

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:90%
will vastly increase.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:middle line:84%
People are going,
oh, I can say it now.

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.440 align:middle line:90%
Can I say it now?

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Oh my goodness, thank
goodness for that.

00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.610 align:middle line:84%
'Cause all over
this human society

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:27.230 align:middle line:84%
today, because of
the I am rights,

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:35.210 align:middle line:84%
are people self-censoring what
they think, what they say,

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:40.930 align:middle line:84%
and thus the discourse and the
information to form perception

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:42.890 align:middle line:84%
gets squeezed and
squeezed and squeezed.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:48.940 align:middle line:10%
Once again, we come to the
end of one of these programs,

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:59.580 align:middle line:10%
and the problem seems so vast,
but the solution is so simple.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.360 align:middle line:10%
You want to be free.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.850 align:middle line:10%
Set yourself free.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:07.480 align:middle line:90%
You want a world of freedom.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:12.430 align:middle line:90%
Then set everybody else free.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:15.860 align:middle line:84%
And what must that
create by definition,

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:16.850 align:middle line:90%
by cause and effect?

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.550 align:middle line:90%


00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Freedom.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.960 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:90%
