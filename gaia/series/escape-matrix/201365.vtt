00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm David Icke.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.255 align:middle line:84%
And today I'm going to look
at the power of the heart.

00:00:17.255 --> 00:00:21.039 align:middle line:90%

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.310 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.080 align:middle line:10%
You hear people talking
about the heart,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.520 align:middle line:10%
coming from the heart.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.440 align:middle line:10%
What does your heart say?

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:10%
So what does it mean
by the use of the term

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.830 align:middle line:10%
"heart" in this context?

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, not the physical heart,
although, they are connected,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.820 align:middle line:84%
but we're back to where
the fundamental level

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.740 align:middle line:84%
of the human body, the
human form, really lies,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and it's not in the
apparently physical level

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.569 align:middle line:84%
but in the human energetic
field, of which the body is

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:90%
a projection, an extension.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And within the
human energy field

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.050 align:middle line:84%
are many lines of
energetic flow.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.210 align:middle line:84%
And energetic flow, what's
another word for energetic?

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.530 align:middle line:90%
Information.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:90%
Information flow.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:84%
What's passing through the human
energy field is information.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.520 align:middle line:84%
In acupuncture,
they base their form

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.080 align:middle line:84%
of healing on meridian
lines of energy,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.170 align:middle line:90%
carrying an energy they call qi.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:90%
And qi is information.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And when the flow of
information is not

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.330 align:middle line:84%
passing through the field in
its most balanced, effective,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.010 align:middle line:84%
powerful form, then that
creates an imbalance,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.560 align:middle line:84%
which we experience as, quote,
"physical" or psychological

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:84%
disease, disturbance,
disharmony.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
a computer, when

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.960 align:middle line:84%
something is affecting
the computer, say a virus,

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.930 align:middle line:84%
and it affects the
flow of information

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.410 align:middle line:84%
through the computer,
the first thing

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:84%
that people say is, oh,
my computer is slow today.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.638 align:middle line:84%
Then they notice other
malfunctions in the computer.

00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:41.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is coming from the fact
that the flow of information

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.820 align:middle line:84%
through the computer, and the
way that information is being

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.580 align:middle line:84%
decoded, is being affected
by whatever the problem is--

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:90%
the virus, whatever.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same in the
human energetic field.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:84%
When this information is
not flowing as it should

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.220 align:middle line:84%
we go into a state of
imbalance, which is disease,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.520 align:middle line:84%
disharmony, and all the
effects that come from that.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:84%
But these energetic
lines are part

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:15.170 align:middle line:84%
of an energetic information
system, an interlevel system,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.230 align:middle line:84%
which connects the human form
and the human energetic field

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:84%
to other levels of reality,
which are vortexes.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Seven main ones through
the field, but there's

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.770 align:middle line:90%
lots of others.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And the lower ones are
connected to our interaction

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.610 align:middle line:84%
with Earth, if you like,
and so-called physicality.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
And the higher ones
are about taking us

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:90%
into other levels of reality.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And in the East, they
call these vortex points

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:90%
chakras or wheels of light.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.470 align:middle line:84%
And the key one, the balance
point of all these chakras,

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:90%
is here--

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.360 align:middle line:84%
the heart chakra, the heart
vortex, I'll call it--

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.070 align:middle line:90%
in the center of the chest.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is the heart that
I'm talking about when I refer

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.490 align:middle line:90%
to the power of the heart.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:21.399 align:middle line:84%
Where we interact with reality
and how we process information

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
dictates everything in
terms of our psychology,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.180 align:middle line:90%
in terms of our perceptions.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.900 align:middle line:84%
So people say, what
does your heart say?

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And they say, what does
your head tell you?

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Because they're acknowledging--
because it's painfully true--

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.350 align:middle line:84%
that the way the head processes
information thus sees reality,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.850 align:middle line:84%
and the way the heart does
is very, very different.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.380 align:middle line:90%
There's another one, of course.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:90%
What does your gut say?

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.980 align:middle line:84%
Down here in the
emotional chakra area.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And the difference between
perceptual domination

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:11.330 align:middle line:84%
by the heart and by the brain
is very, very different.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.180 align:middle line:84%
For instance, the
heart knows why,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.270 align:middle line:84%
because it's connecting
you to levels

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:27.950 align:middle line:84%
of awareness outside of this
perceptually manipulated world

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:84%
of humanity to higher,
more expanded levels

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness that do know.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.700 align:middle line:84%
This is why you see
the body language when

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:84%
people have an
intuitive knowing,

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and you watch where
their hands go.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:90%
I just know, I know.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.980 align:middle line:90%
I just know it.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:84%
Where do they go
when they're thinking

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and their head is the arbiter
of perception and reality?

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.150 align:middle line:90%
They go here.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.738 align:middle line:90%
I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

00:06:00.738 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:84%
They don't say, I'm
thinking, I'm thinking.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.880 align:middle line:90%
They say, I'm thinking.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, this body
language is telling you

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.210 align:middle line:84%
where the information,
thus perception,

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.090 align:middle line:90%
is actually coming from.

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So the heart connects us
with an expanded level

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.850 align:middle line:90%
of awareness, which knows.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And you know, it's connecting
us with a level of awareness

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:90%
that is beyond human language.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Human language is a way for
the head sense of reality,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.150 align:middle line:84%
within the limited
perceptions of human society,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:51.960 align:middle line:84%
to communicate, whereas the
heart doesn't need words.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.600 align:middle line:90%
It just knows.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.280 align:middle line:84%
What happens with the head,
which doesn't work on knowing,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
it works on thinking,
trying to work it out?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So the reaction of the
head, to I just know,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:90%
is, well, why do you know?

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.850 align:middle line:90%
Explain to me.

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:17.910 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to see
this list of reasons

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.830 align:middle line:84%
why what you know to
do shouldn't happen.

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.350 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.768 align:middle line:84%
Because this is trying
to work something out,

00:07:25.768 --> 00:07:27.310 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't
know and this does

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.300 align:middle line:84%
know, and thus it doesn't
need to work it out.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And so when you start to go
with your intuitive knowing

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
and let the head become the
servant of the heart instead

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.520 align:middle line:84%
of the governor, then your
life changes dramatically.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Mind did, anyway.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Because now you are being guided
by a level of awareness that

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.550 align:middle line:84%
is able to see
from a perspective

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.810 align:middle line:84%
beyond this manipulated world
of manipulated perception,

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.040 align:middle line:84%
whereas the head is in the
world and of the world.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.460 align:middle line:84%
And so its information,
giving its perception,

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.740 align:middle line:84%
is all coming from the
world that it's occupying.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.460 align:middle line:84%
It has no other
radar to see what

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:84%
its processing and
the perceptions

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:84%
that it's coming to
as a result. It's

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:84%
not able to see the
context and the perspective

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:31.130 align:middle line:84%
from a greater point of
observation as the heart.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:38.820 align:middle line:84%
So heart people live different
lives to head people.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And even the head is
in basically two parts,

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.190 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the way it
processes information.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.920 align:middle line:84%
You've got the left
side of the brain, which

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:58.320 align:middle line:84%
is dominated by perceiving
everything to be apart

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:90%
from everything else.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:07.560 align:middle line:84%
If you are researching
world events, et cetera,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.370 align:middle line:84%
which actually
connect and you only

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:84%
do it through the left
side of the brain,

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:84%
you'll never get it, because
the left side of the brain

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.310 align:middle line:84%
keeps producing a
perception of everything

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:90%
apart from everything else.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So events become
random and unconnected

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.950 align:middle line:84%
and in and of themselves,
whereas the right side

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.710 align:middle line:84%
of the brain is
much more connected

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
to the intuition of the
heart and is much more

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:84%
adept at connecting dots
and seeing the unity

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
that the left side of
the brain can't see.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And the idea through the
connections between the two

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.180 align:middle line:84%
hemispheres is that we
are whole-brain people,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:84%
and thus we have all
these perspectives

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and we form a whole from that in
terms of the way we see things.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.530 align:middle line:84%
What opens the right
side of the brain,

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:08.840 align:middle line:84%
the side of the brain that can
see connections, that perceives

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:84%
reality in a much more expanded
way, where imagination exists?

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.745 align:middle line:90%
Well, how about play?

00:10:21.745 --> 00:10:24.460 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.460 align:middle line:90%
And we'll remember that.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.160 align:middle line:84%
When kids played, when they
were allowed to play and climb

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:84%
trees and dress
up and play games

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.380 align:middle line:84%
where they imagined themselves
to be someone else doing

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:38.160 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.620 align:middle line:84%
What play does-- especially
ad-lib play where kids are just

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
making it up and using
their imagination--

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.750 align:middle line:84%
it's opening the right
side of the brain.

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:90%
What does music and the arts do?

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.880 align:middle line:90%
It's about creativity.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.160 align:middle line:90%
It's about imagination.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.260 align:middle line:84%
It opens up the right
side of the brain.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:90%
Worst nightmare for the system.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.690 align:middle line:90%
It wants people here.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:90%
Bom, bom, bom.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And the antidote to
this is to open this

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and to start letting this be
the arbiter of perception,

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.660 align:middle line:84%
connecting with that
level that knows.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:84%
And because of its connection
to the right side of the brain

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.760 align:middle line:84%
it also has this information,
this intuitive knowing.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:90%
It communicates with the brain.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
It's also opening the
right side of the brain.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:35.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's an organization
in California called

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:90%
the Institute of HeartMath.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.110 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking at their
information for a long time.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And what they do is study
the influence of the heart--

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:50.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the energetic heart--

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:56.210 align:middle line:84%
on human behavior and human
health, human psychology.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:12:01.370 align:middle line:84%
And they've come up with some
very interesting findings

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
which put into perspective
the true nature of the heart.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And you realize that this is
merely learned intelligence--

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:90%
often what passes for it--

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:84%
that comes from the
information that the brain

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:24.780 align:middle line:90%
receives from its environment.

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:84%
While this is innate
intelligence that

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:84%
doesn't learn, it knows,
because it's connected

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.340 align:middle line:90%
to that level that does know.

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:40.500 align:middle line:84%
So here's a few points that
the Institute of HeartMath

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:90%
has found in its research.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.840 align:middle line:84%
"Heart rhythms affect
the brain's ability

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.790 align:middle line:90%
to process information."

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:52.660 align:middle line:90%
If the heart is not in balance--

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.680 align:middle line:90%
what they call coherence--

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.980 align:middle line:84%
with the brain, then
the brain starts

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.880 align:middle line:84%
to malfunction because
of the heart's influence

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.710 align:middle line:90%
on the workings of the brain.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:10.870 align:middle line:84%
And this cabal that I talk
about that's behind world events

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and behind the manipulation
of human perception

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.390 align:middle line:90%
knows how this process works.

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's targeted
the heart all along.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:24.900 align:middle line:84%
It wants the heart closed
down, this heart vortex,

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.900 align:middle line:84%
so it does not impact
on human perception,

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.380 align:middle line:84%
because human perception will
be way different if the heart is

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:84%
open and influencing the
brain than if it's closed

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.290 align:middle line:84%
and the brain is governor
of perception and arbiter

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.080 align:middle line:90%
of reality.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.740 align:middle line:84%
"The heart field is the
most powerful in the body."

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:84%
The electromagnetic field
generated by the heart vortex

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.840 align:middle line:84%
is the most powerful
field in the human body.

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Because this, in truth, is the
center of human intelligence,

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.210 align:middle line:90%
not this.

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.780 align:middle line:84%
"The heart has 40,000
sensor neurons."

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Neurons, like the
brain, so they call

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.460 align:middle line:90%
this process the heart brain.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:22.090 align:middle line:84%
The heart does not only know,
it has connections to the brain,

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.780 align:middle line:84%
also, and operates as a
brain, but a brain that's

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:84%
coming from a very much
higher, more expanded

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:90%
level of awareness.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:84%
"The heart sends more
information to the brain

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:90%
than comes the other way."

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Because this is the center
of human perception, if only

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:90%
we realized it.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And because it's the
center of human perception

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and the connection out
to expand it awareness,

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.030 align:middle line:84%
this is why that which
is manipulating humanity

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.480 align:middle line:90%
wants this closed down.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things they found
is that when the heart field

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:04.370 align:middle line:84%
and the brain field and the
central nervous system field--

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.680 align:middle line:84%
because they're all
electromagnetic fields at this

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:90%
level--

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:84%
are in coherence and
harmony, that person

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.820 align:middle line:84%
goes onto a higher level of
consciousness, awareness.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And when there's
incoherence-- in other words,

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:22.730 align:middle line:84%
the connections are not as they
should be between the central

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.500 align:middle line:84%
nervous system, the
brain, and the heart--

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:84%
the person goes
into a lower level

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.950 align:middle line:90%
of awareness and consciousness.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So there you see another
reason why to target the heart

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and to close the heart to
try to stop it influencing us

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:84%
in a harmonious way is to
throw everything out of kilter

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.030 align:middle line:84%
and to bring humanity into a
lower level of consciousness

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:90%
than they normally would be.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And I've read accounts
by therapists-- in fact,

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.100 align:middle line:84%
one of them connected to
the Institute of HeartMath,

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:90%
as I recall--

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:09.113 align:middle line:84%
where they were describing
how when they were working

00:16:09.113 --> 00:16:11.280 align:middle line:84%
with a client over the
problems, whatever they were,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.400 align:middle line:84%
they had in their life,
they would do this.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.680 align:middle line:84%
They would put them in a
chair and they'd say to them,

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:20.660 align:middle line:84%
tell me about your
problem from your head.

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.200 align:middle line:90%
And they would.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.600 align:middle line:10%
And then symbolically they
would say, change chairs.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Now tell me about the same
problem from your heart.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.830 align:middle line:84%
And what they said
was that you'd

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:38.570 align:middle line:84%
think you were talking to
two totally different people.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And in some ways they were,
because the perspective

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:84%
of everything that the heart
has from its expanded state

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:54.420 align:middle line:84%
of awareness is massively
different from what

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:59.160 align:middle line:84%
the head has in its
isolated information

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.095 align:middle line:90%
source, when the heart's closed.

00:17:01.095 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And in league with
this and this,

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:11.650 align:middle line:84%
fear is the dominant
prison that people live in.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:90%
Fear of what other people think.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:17.560 align:middle line:84%
If you say this, even though
you know it to be true,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.775 align:middle line:90%
what will people say?

00:17:18.775 --> 00:17:21.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.030 align:middle line:84%
If you do this,
what will people do?

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
Because people talk about
having fear in their heart

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and having, for instance,
well, hate in their heart.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.960 align:middle line:90%
Load of rubbish.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.590 align:middle line:84%
You can't have
fear in your heart,

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.000 align:middle line:84%
because it's connecting us to
that level of awareness that

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:90%
knows there's nothing to fear.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.380 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:84%
This is manipulated
24/7 to fear everything.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:90%
That's how we're controlled.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.630 align:middle line:84%
How many people are
not saying and doing

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:01.310 align:middle line:84%
what they know to be
right in the world

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.970 align:middle line:84%
today because they fear
the consequences of abuse

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and being called this,
that, or the other?

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.950 align:middle line:90%
So they self-censor.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.775 align:middle line:84%
This will give you every reason
why you should self-censor,

00:18:14.775 --> 00:18:17.400 align:middle line:84%
because it will tell you all the
things that will happen if you

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.330 align:middle line:90%
don't.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.927 align:middle line:84%
This, do it anyway,
because to consider

00:18:21.927 --> 00:18:24.510 align:middle line:84%
not doing it is to consider not
doing what I know to be right.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:26.270 align:middle line:90%
So we never do that.

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:84%
So if we just ponder on how
different the world would be,

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:84%
even from this perspective of
no fear, it would be dramatic.

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.710 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
self-censorship.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.570 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
silencing of what

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.750 align:middle line:84%
needs to be said for fear of
the consequences of saying it.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another
level of the heart,

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.730 align:middle line:90%
which is what we call love.

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:84%
Love has been completely
misrepresented.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Love is connected
to, "I love you

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:90%
because I'm attracted to you."

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:17.950 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's all right.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
But if what you
call love is only

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.740 align:middle line:84%
attraction, like
physical attraction,

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:84%
well, what happens when that
physical attraction maybe

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:90%
starts to wane?

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:90%
What's left?

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:34.450 align:middle line:84%
If nothing else, see
you later or in court.

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But if you love
on the level of--

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.510 align:middle line:84%
we have to put a word in front
of it to get the real meaning--

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.190 align:middle line:90%
of unconditional love--

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I love you because you exist not
because of this list of things

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:90%
you have to do so I love you.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:57.260 align:middle line:90%
I love you because you are.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.440 align:middle line:84%
That even when physical
attraction wanes,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:84%
the love connection
is still there.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
And because this knows, because
of what it's connected to,

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:17.240 align:middle line:84%
that human division
is an illusion,

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.050 align:middle line:84%
that all the labels we give
ourselves and we're given

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:26.510 align:middle line:84%
are only names for brief
transitory experiences

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:84%
that will soon be
over as we continue

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:34.100 align:middle line:84%
our exploration of
forever, forever

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.930 align:middle line:90%
at the end of this human life.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.630 align:middle line:90%
It knows we're all connected.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.330 align:middle line:84%
It knows these fault lines--
of division, of race,

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:46.100 align:middle line:84%
and sexuality, and culture,
and income bracket--

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.555 align:middle line:90%
are all illusory nonsense.

00:20:47.555 --> 00:20:50.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:84%
It sees, knows, that we are
all points of attention--

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:58.200 align:middle line:90%
unique points of attention--

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.420 align:middle line:84%
within the same flow
of infinite awareness.

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.980 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:09.480 align:middle line:84%
And thus it understands
the unity of everything.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
It understands the transitory
nature of human experience.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:20.430 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't get pulled into
hate because of some action

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.540 align:middle line:84%
by some perceived
self-identified label

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.180 align:middle line:84%
with another different
self-identified label.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.150 align:middle line:84%
It just shakes its head and sees
everything that's connected.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:32.700 align:middle line:90%
I love you anyway.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:36.630 align:middle line:84%
And from the heart
comes empathy--

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.020 align:middle line:84%
being able to put
yourself in the feelings

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:44.070 align:middle line:84%
and the consequences that
you create for other people

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.730 align:middle line:84%
and feel how they must
be feeling because

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.820 align:middle line:90%
of your impact upon them.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And empathy is the failsafe
mechanism, I call it,

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.320 align:middle line:90%
of human society.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have
empathy, the fact

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:06.450 align:middle line:84%
that you could feel what you are
making other people experience

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:84%
will limit the extremes
of what you will do.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Take away empathy, there are
no consequences emotionally,

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:84%
so there are no limits to what
you will do to other people.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And we call that
state a psychopath.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So the heart is an extraordinary
center of innate intelligence.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:39.220 align:middle line:84%
And if this was the arbiter of
our perception and the arbiter

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.630 align:middle line:84%
of our into action with each
other and our understanding

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:51.350 align:middle line:84%
of each other and our
love of each other--

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:54.080 align:middle line:84%
from that perspective
I'm talking about--

00:22:54.080 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
the world that we see today
would be a figment of history,

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.690 align:middle line:84%
just disappearing as
another world emerges.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Because this world, what
we call human society,

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:84%
is merely the sum total
of human perception

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:middle line:84%
which becomes the sum
total of human behavior.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:26.480 align:middle line:84%
When this is the
governor, we see the world

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.520 align:middle line:90%
that we have today.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.980 align:middle line:84%
When this becomes the
governor, the arbiter

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:84%
of reality and interaction, we
see a totally different world.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And here's a quote
from the mystic

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:49.980 align:middle line:90%
known as Osho, who came out--

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:53.760 align:middle line:84%
he's now continuing his
explanation of forever,

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.280 align:middle line:90%
forever--

00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:00.130 align:middle line:84%
He came out with some
very, very profound quotes.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.990 align:middle line:90%
And here's one.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
"Our universities, our
colleges, our schools,

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:90%
are all destroying humanity.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.980 align:middle line:84%
They think they are
serving, but they are simply

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:90%
fooling themselves.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Unless man becomes balanced,
unless the heart and head

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:84%
both grow, man will
remain in misery,

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.470 align:middle line:84%
and the misery
will go on growing.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.640 align:middle line:84%
As we become more
and more oblivious

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.820 align:middle line:84%
of the existence
of the heart, we

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:41.480 align:middle line:90%
become more and more miserable.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.390 align:middle line:84%
We are creating hell
on Earth, and we will

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:47.330 align:middle line:90%
create more and more of it.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Paradise belongs to the heart.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.050 align:middle line:90%


00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:58.940 align:middle line:84%
But this is what has
happened," he said,

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:02.070 align:middle line:84%
"the heart is
completely forgotten,"

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:middle line:84%
thus, as I would put
it, has lost its impact

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:11.090 align:middle line:84%
on human perception, thus human
behavior, thus human society.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:16.500 align:middle line:84%
"Nobody understands
that language anymore.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:84%
We understand logic, we
don't understand love.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:28.200 align:middle line:84%
We understand mathematics,
we don't understand music.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.690 align:middle line:84%
We become more and more
accustomed to the ways

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.120 align:middle line:84%
of the world, and
nobody seems to have

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:40.050 align:middle line:84%
the guts to move into unknown
paths, the unknown labyrinths

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:45.740 align:middle line:90%
of love, of the heart."

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.160 align:middle line:90%
And he is absolutely right.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:51.050 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:54.980 align:middle line:84%
Because this has been
systematically closed--

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.500 align:middle line:84%
not in everybody, of course
not, but overwhelmingly

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:02.120 align:middle line:84%
in terms of its influence
on perception and behavior.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.990 align:middle line:84%
The world has become
a manifestation

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:12.560 align:middle line:84%
of the head and the gut, which
are different states often--

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:90%
not least the head--

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.770 align:middle line:90%
of ignorance.

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.670 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you my own
experience in relation to this.

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:23.310 align:middle line:90%


00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:27.120 align:middle line:84%
I reached a point,
long time ago now,

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:31.770 align:middle line:84%
where this harmony came
together and the war stopped.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And so when my heart
now, my knowing says,

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:90%
I need to do this.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.220 align:middle line:90%
This says, OK, let's go.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.800 align:middle line:90%


00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:51.550 align:middle line:84%
It's and an incredible
way of living your life,

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:53.660 align:middle line:90%
in my experience, anyway.

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:90%
It brings joy.

00:26:54.940 --> 00:27:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And it brings what
we call achievement.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:07.590 align:middle line:10%
Because this knows, and
it will guide you always

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:11.850 align:middle line:10%
where you need to go
to know even more.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.930 align:middle line:10%
That's been my
experience in 30 years,

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.770 align:middle line:10%
and I'm just passing it on now.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:10%
If people can get out of this
into this, their life changes.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And if enough of us do
it, human society changes.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.340 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, it's that simple.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.190 align:middle line:90%
See you next time.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:middle line:90%
