>>900 years ago, the
holy city of Jerusalem

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
was conquered by Christianity's
First Crusade against Islam.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.430 align:middle line:84%
The victorious crusader knights
occupied the Muslim holy sites,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.650 align:middle line:84%
including the sacred Dome of
the Rock and the nearby Al Aqsa

Mosque.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
The Crusaders
believed the Al Aqsa

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.510 align:middle line:84%
rested on the ancient remains
of King Solomon's temple.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.570 align:middle line:84%
And the knights who
came to live there

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.274 align:middle line:84%
were known ever after
as the Knights Templar.

At the height of their
power, the Knights

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Temple of Solomon were
the elite military spearhead

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:90%
of the medieval Catholic Church.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.120 align:middle line:84%
The knights were unique, both
warrior and monk, utterly

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to killing
and dying for their God.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.530 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were the epitome
of Christianity's crusade

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.270 align:middle line:90%
against Islam.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.650 align:middle line:84%
The Knights Templar were not
just front-line soldiers;

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.910 align:middle line:84%
they also constructed a
remarkable supply and support

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
network that enveloped
every nation in Europe.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.020 align:middle line:84%
The Templar network acquired
vast business interests

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
in farming, shipping, and
banking, which eventually

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
turned the order into the most
powerful financial institution

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.850 align:middle line:90%
in Europe.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Order of
the Temple of Solomon

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.055 align:middle line:84%
was the world's first
multinational corporation.

Just 200 years after
its foundation,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
the Order's leaders
were burned alive

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.470 align:middle line:90%
and its vast wealth seized.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Were the Templars
heretical devil worshippers

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.040 align:middle line:84%
or innocent victims
of a greedy king?

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Their sudden destruction was
so shocking to the people

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
of Europe that, for
centuries to come,

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.170 align:middle line:84%
legends would grow up around the
remnants of the doomed order.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.890 align:middle line:84%
Buried treasure, secret
societies, the Turin Shroud,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and even the Holy Grail
would find their way

Could any of these fantastic

And if so, who has kept
their amazing secrets

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.370 align:middle line:90%

>>Pope Urban II
called what we now

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.010 align:middle line:10%
describe as a crusade in 1096.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And as a consequence
of that, Latin armies

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
captured a number of key
places in Palestine and Syria,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.260 align:middle line:84%
including Jerusalem
and the holy places.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
The problem was, however, that
when the crusade was finished,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.190 align:middle line:84%
many people left the
East, having fulfilled

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.910 align:middle line:84%
their Crusades vows, and
returned to the West.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And the Crusaders were left--
the crusade settlers were

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.760 align:middle line:84%
left with very little
in the way of defenses.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But this didn't stop
masses of pilgrims coming

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.720 align:middle line:84%
to the East, many of
whom were unarmed,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
were elderly, were vulnerable,
and needed to be defended.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And in essence,
really, the Templars

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:84%
were founded by a group
of Western knights,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.320 align:middle line:84%
French knights, who were
living in the East, who

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.180 align:middle line:84%
wanted to engage
in a charitable act

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps also ensure their
own salvation by defending

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and protecting these
groups of pilgrims

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:90%
who went to see the holy places.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.335 align:middle line:84%
So in its simplest form, that's
how they came into being.

>>The first Templars who
dedicated their lives to God

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.150 align:middle line:84%
by protecting pilgrims
in the holy land

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.250 align:middle line:84%
had to give up all their
worldly possessions.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.930 align:middle line:84%
They were proud
of their poverty.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:84%
And one of the seals shows
two knights sharing a horse.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.440 align:middle line:84%
The poor knights
needed nothing to do

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.430 align:middle line:84%
God's work but a
horse and a sword.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.070 align:middle line:84%
It took 10 years of
dedicated perseverance

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.740 align:middle line:84%
before the Pope officially
recognized the Templars.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.410 align:middle line:84%
In the year 1129 at the
Council of Troyes in France,

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
the Knights Templar
became a monastic order

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.150 align:middle line:84%
of the Catholic Church, the
Order of the Temple of Solomon.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.310 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.960 align:middle line:84%
The Templars had
become monks and joined

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:84%
their brothers, the
Knights Hospitaller,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:84%
protecting pilgrims
as servants of God.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:06.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.580 align:middle line:84%
But not everyone
believed that it

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.220 align:middle line:84%
was possible to serve
God as a warrior.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some leading clerics
believed the very idea

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:90%
to be an abomination.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.950 align:middle line:84%
How could violence and
the taking of human life

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.810 align:middle line:84%
be in any way reconciled
with the teachings of Jesus

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.755 align:middle line:84%
Christ, who valued
patience and understanding?

00:06:24.755 --> 00:06:37.140 align:middle line:90%


00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.020 align:middle line:84%
>>I think the reason
that there was initially

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:84%
a rather ambiguous reaction
towards the creation

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.920 align:middle line:84%
of the Templar was that they
were quite-- a quite unique

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.130 align:middle line:84%
creation, a combination
of monk and warrior,

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.910 align:middle line:90%
which nobody had seen before.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.430 align:middle line:84%
And many men in the
12th century were uneasy

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
in the face of innovation,
despite the fact

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.110 align:middle line:84%
that, in many ways, it was
a very innovative century

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.370 align:middle line:84%
in a wide range of intellectual
and cultural fields.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So they needed time to get used
to it before they could perhaps

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.390 align:middle line:90%
fully recognize its value.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:84%
So in the early
years, the Templars

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.070 align:middle line:84%
didn't gain a great
deal of support.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
But within about 20 years
or so of their foundation,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:29.130 align:middle line:84%
people began to adjust, and
the voices against the Order

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.915 align:middle line:84%
became fewer and fewer and
less and less influential.

00:07:31.915 --> 00:07:38.830 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the most influential
supporters of the Templars

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.120 align:middle line:84%
was the greatest church leader
of the age, the Cistercian

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.020 align:middle line:90%
abbot Bernard of Clairveaux.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Bernard saw the Knights
Templar as more than warriors

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.710 align:middle line:84%
fighting the flesh
and blood of Muslims.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:55.410 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.825 align:middle line:84%
Bernard believed the
knights were fighting evil

00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:01.910 align:middle line:84%
and were therefore
purifying the Holy Land.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.265 align:middle line:84%
In the eyes of the Church,
the Knights Templar

00:08:04.265 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:84%
were not committing homicide,
but malicide, not killing man,

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.036 align:middle line:90%
but evil itself.

00:08:10.036 --> 00:08:15.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:19.920 align:middle line:84%
If a Templar died in battle, he
would obtain eternal salvation

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:90%
and the remission of his sin.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.710 align:middle line:84%
A Templar Knight had
no fear of death.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.000 align:middle line:84%
There could be no higher
motivation for a man

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000 align:middle line:84%
to enter battle,
and this, together

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.090 align:middle line:84%
with their strict
discipline, would soon

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.960 align:middle line:84%
make the Knights Templar
the most deadly fighting

unit in the Crusader armies.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Templars
were Europe's

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.480 align:middle line:84%
first professional standing
army since the Romans.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:10.830 align:middle line:84%
>>It's important to notice that
the Templar military function

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.740 align:middle line:84%
is central to the
Crusader armies.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.810 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were
governed by monastic rule,

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:90%
which demanded obedience.

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And this enabled them to act
in a structured and prearranged

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:29.770 align:middle line:90%
way in a battle situation.

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:84%
Here, in many ways, you have the
origins of military discipline.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:37.592 align:middle line:84%
And this made the Templars more
valuable to the Crusader armies

00:09:37.592 --> 00:09:39.300 align:middle line:84%
than perhaps their
numbers might suggest.

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:46.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.420 align:middle line:84%

was still standing.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%

The order was forbidden
to pay ransom,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.543 align:middle line:84%

mosque, the Marwani

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:03.170 align:middle line:84%
where the Templars kept
their horses and camels

00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:84%
and which the Crusaders
believed to have

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.410 align:middle line:84%
been the stables
of King Solomon.

Although the Templars
lived and worked

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.012 align:middle line:84%
in the sacred Islamic buildings,
it was the Christian sites

00:11:23.012 --> 00:11:24.345 align:middle line:90%
that they were there to protect.

The most important
Christian site of all

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.050 align:middle line:84%
was the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre, built

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.400 align:middle line:84%
on Calvary, the rock on
which Jesus Christ had

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.025 align:middle line:90%
been crucified.

Today, the Church
still bears the myriad

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
of crosses carved into the
walls by these pious Crusaders

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:01.270 align:middle line:90%

Beyond the relative
safety of Jerusalem

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.330 align:middle line:84%
were the numerous
Biblical holy sites

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.830 align:middle line:84%
that required pilgrims to
journey along lonely roads

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.635 align:middle line:84%
and through dangerous

The Templars built

set up patrols and

It was not long before
the discipline and skill

00:12:57.376 --> 00:12:59.695 align:middle line:84%
of the Templar Knights
demonstrated to all

00:12:59.695 --> 00:13:02.415 align:middle line:84%
that they were capable
of far more than just

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:03.405 align:middle line:90%
protecting pilgrims.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the most
important early examples

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.970 align:middle line:84%
of Templar military
skill is their role

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.910 align:middle line:84%
in the reorganization
and the protection

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:25.870 align:middle line:84%
of the army of King
Louis VII of France

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:31.780 align:middle line:84%
during the Second Crusade, which
in the course of 1147, 1148,

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:84%
was trying the very difficult
feat of crossing Asia Minor

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and was suffering, both
from the environment

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.790 align:middle line:90%
and from Turkish attack.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were entrusted
with reorganizing the army

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.110 align:middle line:90%
and with defending it.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:84%
And that enabled what
was left of that army

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.640 align:middle line:84%
to cross Asia Minor without
too many further mishaps.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And that did greatly enhance
the Templars' reputation.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:04.060 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
>>The Second Crusade also saw
the Knights Templar awarded

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.430 align:middle line:84%
the right to wear their
distinctive red cross.

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.060 align:middle line:84%
The cross, with its splayed
ends, was at the time

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:90%
unique to the Templars.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.380 align:middle line:84%
Their flowing white
robes and the red cross

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.625 align:middle line:84%
fueled their growing sense
of collective identity.

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:22.710 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:26.010 align:middle line:84%
This military uniform was just
one of the many innovative ways

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:30.620 align:middle line:84%
that the Knights Templar
foreshadowed a modern army.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
Their main weapon, however,
had been tried and tested

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.220 align:middle line:90%
over generations.

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.180 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.800 align:middle line:10%
>>The cavalry charge
was their-- effectively

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:10%
their only offensive tactic.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.550 align:middle line:84%
Now of course, they developed
other things to back this up.

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:51.680 align:middle line:84%
Infantry played an
absolutely essential role,

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:58.410 align:middle line:84%
because they provided the
launch pad, the defended entity,

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:02.020 align:middle line:84%
even within an open battle,
from which the armored cavalry

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:90%
launched their charge.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And they had other
troops as well.

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:middle line:84%
They had light cavalry,
the famous turcopoles.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And the Templars
had all these units.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:19.920 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>>The Templar's famous
turcopoles were former Muslims

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:84%
who had converted
to Christianity

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and who, like the
Templars themselves,

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.525 align:middle line:84%
could be counted on
to fight to the death,

00:15:29.525 --> 00:15:32.010 align:middle line:84%
as they also faced
immediate execution if they

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:32.958 align:middle line:90%
were captured.

00:15:32.958 --> 00:15:40.350 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Horses were vital
to the Crusaders,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.670 align:middle line:84%
not just for warfare, but for
communications and transport.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.040 align:middle line:84%
Templar care of horses
was second to none,

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.160 align:middle line:84%
as they were expensive,
did not live long,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:84%
were particularly vulnerable
to sickness in the Holy Land,

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.185 align:middle line:90%
and soon learned to fear battle.

00:15:56.185 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:90%


00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
As a result, the decision
to deploy a cavalry charge

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:90%
was not taken lightly.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.680 align:middle line:84%
And Templar military
policy in the Holy Land

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.540 align:middle line:90%
was, on the whole, cautious.

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
As the skill and reputation
of the Templars began to grow,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:84%
so did their role in the overall
defense of the Crusader states.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.900 align:middle line:84%
In the second half
of the 12th century,

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:35.480 align:middle line:84%
the Crusaders' 400-mile
coastal strip of the Holy Land

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:38.740 align:middle line:84%
was based around the
cities of Antioch, Tripoli,

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:90%
and the capital, Jerusalem.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.000 align:middle line:84%
The Christians controlled
the Mediterranean,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.550 align:middle line:84%
which was vital for
supplies, especially

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.220 align:middle line:84%
through the Port of
Acre, while mountains

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.150 align:middle line:84%
on the eastern frontier
and the River Jordan

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.206 align:middle line:84%
provided excellent
natural defenses.

00:16:57.206 --> 00:17:01.260 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.490 align:middle line:84%
Castles and fortifications,
many of them Templar,

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:07.365 align:middle line:84%
guarded the main entry points
into the Christian states.

00:17:07.365 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:90%


00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:18.859 align:middle line:10%
Although the Christian
sliver of the Holy Land

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:10%
was surrounded by Islam,
political and religious

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.690 align:middle line:10%
divisions had prevented
any unified attempt

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.109 align:middle line:10%
to drive the Christians out.

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:30.460 align:middle line:10%
When the Sunnis from Syria
imposed their orthodoxy

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:10%
on Shia Egypt, the Crusaders
faced a united Islamic frontier

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.165 align:middle line:10%
for the very first time.

00:17:36.165 --> 00:17:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.700 align:middle line:10%
In 1178, the Templars began
construction of a new castle

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.890 align:middle line:10%
at Jacob's Ford, where the main
road from Cairo to Damascus

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.206 align:middle line:10%
crossed the River Jordan.

00:17:50.206 --> 00:17:59.690 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:10%
>>The most important road
between Syria and Palestine

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.630 align:middle line:10%
passes very close to the castle.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.865 align:middle line:84%
You can see it-- you
can still see it now.

00:18:09.865 --> 00:18:12.250 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
metal road, which

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:15.900 align:middle line:84%
leads from Palestine
to the Golan Heights.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And from there, hopefully
very soon, to Damascus.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:84%
This is the old VMIs, which
goes from Egypt to Damascus

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:31.950 align:middle line:84%
and crosses the Jordan
in this crucial site.

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:90%


00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.630 align:middle line:84%
There are only few
hundreds of meters

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.900 align:middle line:84%
where the roads can
cross the Jordan River.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:49.520 align:middle line:84%
But until 1178, this crossing,
this vadum, this fault,

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:54.635 align:middle line:84%
the faults of the Jordan, were
not protected by the Franks.

00:18:54.635 --> 00:19:05.930 align:middle line:84%
In 1178, a year after
a very decisive victory

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:10.540 align:middle line:84%
of the Franks over
the Muslim enemies,

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:16.060 align:middle line:84%
the Knight Templars succeeded
to convince the king

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:22.920 align:middle line:84%
to build a new castle very
close to Damascus, two days'

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:84%
walk from Damascus, and in a
territory which was considered

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:32.035 align:middle line:84%
by both Franks and Muslims
as a Muslim territory.

00:19:32.035 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:90%

>>The Templars' newly
built castle on the Jordan

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.660 align:middle line:84%
was in just too important
a location for Saladin

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.320 align:middle line:90%
to do nothing.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.380 align:middle line:84%
In the year 1179, he
moved to destroy it.

00:19:51.845 --> 00:20:01.770 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:03.500 align:middle line:84%
With so much at
stake, the Templars

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.160 align:middle line:84%
had no choice but to abandon
their policy of caution.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:84%
They launched a
relief expedition,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.605 align:middle line:84%
which Saladin intercepted
and destroyed.

00:20:14.605 --> 00:20:17.390 align:middle line:84%
The grandmaster, the
highest ranking Templar,

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:19.906 align:middle line:84%
was captured and
later died in prison.

Saladin's first great invasion
of the Christian state

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:90%
came not long afterwards.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.760 align:middle line:84%
The Templars once more
put their faith in God

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.660 align:middle line:84%
and launched their
heavy cavalry charge

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:35.400 align:middle line:84%
against a numerically
superior enemy.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.980 align:middle line:84%
The charge caught the
Muslim forces by surprise

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:39.550 align:middle line:90%
and inflicted a crushing defeat.

00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:84%
The Templars deployed
the same proven tactics

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:48.360 align:middle line:84%
a few years later
in 1187, when they

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.700 align:middle line:84%
discovered one of Saladin's
armies had crossed the Jordan

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:55.740 align:middle line:84%
and was reconnoitering around
the Springs of Cresson.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.720 align:middle line:84%
The Templars once more
put their faith in God

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and launched a
cavalry charge right

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:84%
into the heart of a Muslim
force at least three times

their size.

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:08.120 align:middle line:90%
This time, the cavalry failed.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.750 align:middle line:84%
60 Templar Knights
died, and just three

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:11.777 align:middle line:90%
escaped the massacre.

00:21:11.777 --> 00:21:20.060 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:24.500 align:middle line:84%
>>The cavalry charge failed,
on almost every occasion

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:27.640 align:middle line:84%
when it did fail, because
it failed to hit its target.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.020 align:middle line:90%
It just missed.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And this is an absolutely
fundamental point

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:84%
that has to be emphasized
in military history.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.660 align:middle line:84%
The cavalry charge was
unstoppable, almost

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
unstoppable, if
it hit its target.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.610 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:46.700 align:middle line:84%
The Muslims' increasing ability
to counter the Crusaders'

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.320 align:middle line:84%
offensive tactics was
not enough to explain

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:84%
why God had apparently deserted
his most loyal servants.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Some Christians felt that
Templar pride must be to blame.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:02.370 align:middle line:84%
What the Templars saw as
a noble collective spirit

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
seemed to many to be merely
arrogance and conceit.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:12.460 align:middle line:90%


00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Some believed the Holy
Land itself was now

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.860 align:middle line:90%
threatened by their Godlessness.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:19.360 align:middle line:84%
For the Muslims,
their great victory

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:22.030 align:middle line:84%
at the Springs of Cresson
was a huge morale booster.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And a few weeks later,
Saladin assembled the largest

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.960 align:middle line:90%
ever Muslim army.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:42.500 align:middle line:84%
By the end of June
1187, the Muslims

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.610 align:middle line:84%
had mustered an
army of 45,000 men,

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:48.570 align:middle line:90%
including 12,000 light cavalry.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:84%
The Crusaders had
just over 20,000,

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:90%
including nearly 6,000 cavalry.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
On July 1, Saladin
crossed the River Jordan

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.510 align:middle line:84%
and laid siege to the
Christian-held city

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:90%
of Tiberius.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.630 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.850 align:middle line:84%
The Christian leadership
feared a trap.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
But finally, urged on by
many, including the Templar

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:12.670 align:middle line:84%
grandmaster, they decided
to try and relieve Tiberius.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:16.160 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:84%
The Crusaders dry
and tortuous route

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.170 align:middle line:84%
would take them
past a landmark hill

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:22.895 align:middle line:90%
called the Horns of Hattin.

00:23:22.895 --> 00:23:26.360 align:middle line:90%

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:44.170 align:middle line:84%
At the Horns of Hattin,
Saladin's army was waiting.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
The Christians were
enveloped and crushed.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:56.814 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of Christians
were killed and captured.

00:23:56.814 --> 00:24:06.470 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Nearly all of the Crusaders
were released for ransom,

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.740 align:middle line:84%
except for the knights
of the military orders,

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:84%
the Hospitallers
and the Templars.

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.900 align:middle line:90%


00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:19.820 align:middle line:84%
>>Following the
battle of Hattin,

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:26.330 align:middle line:84%
the captured members, or at
least knights, of the Temple,

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and I believe the Hospital
as well, were executed.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, this sounds incredibly
brutal and ruthless,

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
but I think what you have to
bear in mind is that Saladin

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:48.370 align:middle line:84%
recognized that these
were dangerous, dedicated,

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.970 align:middle line:90%
implacable foes.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.320 align:middle line:84%
>>As one Muslim
chronicle put it,

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.130 align:middle line:84%
they were the fiery heart
of the Frankish armies.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.990 align:middle line:90%
They were the best disciplined.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.690 align:middle line:90%
They were well equipped.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.830 align:middle line:90%
They were committed.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.700 align:middle line:90%
And they were permanent.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.960 align:middle line:84%
And I think Saladin's
aim there is really

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.230 align:middle line:84%
to try to eliminate what he
saw as the core of the Frankish

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:84%
armies so that in the future the
land reconquered by the Muslims

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.410 align:middle line:90%
would remain in Muslim hands.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
>>Saladin had also captured
a large number of them.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So, executing them might,
from his point of view,

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.820 align:middle line:84%
break the back of
the organization.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:37.387 align:middle line:84%
It's not merely a matter of
vengeance against a feared foe.

00:25:37.387 --> 00:25:39.470 align:middle line:84%
in fact, I don't think
it's even vengeance at all.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:44.185 align:middle line:84%
This was a rather
cold; calculating;

00:25:44.185 --> 00:25:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and, seen from a modern point
of view, ruthless action.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.000 align:middle line:90%
But it made sense at the time.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.087 align:middle line:84%
>>I also think that he did
it-- he executed the Templars

00:25:56.087 --> 00:25:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and Hospitallers after
the Battle of Hattin.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:84%
I think he did that also because
it enhanced his own image

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.640 align:middle line:84%
as a holy war
leader, as a leader

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:10.140 align:middle line:84%
of the jihad and, therefore,
somebody who's, in the future,

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:10.850 align:middle line:90%
a hero of Islam.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:16.840 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>>In the space of six months,
half of the Templars' Holy Land

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:23.350 align:middle line:84%
army had been killed and
not a single fortification

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.625 align:middle line:90%
remained with a full garrison.

00:26:24.625 --> 00:26:29.230 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.330 align:middle line:84%
The Order of the
Temple of Solomon

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:35.130 align:middle line:84%
had lost 230 knights
at Hattin and 60

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.340 align:middle line:90%
at the Springs of Cresson.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.950 align:middle line:90%

With the destruction
of the Templar force,

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.790 align:middle line:84%
the mainstay of the
Crusade estate was gone.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:53.640 align:middle line:90%


00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:57.730 align:middle line:10%
Saladin, having destroyed the
Christian field army at Hattin,

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:00.220 align:middle line:10%
moved to capture the
Crusader coastal ports

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:02.550 align:middle line:10%
to prevent any reinforcements
getting through

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.050 align:middle line:10%
to the Christians by sea.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:09.646 align:middle line:10%
One week after Hattin, Saladin
captured the key port of Acre.

00:27:09.646 --> 00:27:13.324 align:middle line:10%
His main army moved on
south, and in October,

00:27:13.324 --> 00:27:14.240 align:middle line:10%
took Jerusalem itself.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:22.270 align:middle line:90%


00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.810 align:middle line:10%
Over the next few months,
Saladin recovered nearly all

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.120 align:middle line:10%
of the land lost to the
First Crusaders almost

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.950 align:middle line:10%
a century before.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:10%
Only the arrival of the
German Crusader Conrad

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:35.180 align:middle line:10%
of Montferrat at Tyre
prevented its fall.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.850 align:middle line:10%
This toehold and a
few meager garrisons

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.520 align:middle line:10%
at Antioch and
Tripoli were all that

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.624 align:middle line:10%
remained of the
Christian Holy Land.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:55.830 align:middle line:84%
On liberating Jerusalem, Saladin
entered the Dome of the Rock

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:59.000 align:middle line:84%
and conducted a
purifying ceremony.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.940 align:middle line:84%
Rose water was used to wash
away all trace of Crusaders,

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.570 align:middle line:90%
who had defiled the holy site.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.610 align:middle line:84%
The capture of Jerusalem
was the crowning moment

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:84%
of a monumental career,
which had seen Saladin

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.050 align:middle line:84%
unite the Islamic world
and drive out nearly all

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.104 align:middle line:84%
the Crusaders from
the Holy Land.

The Templars had been almost
eliminated from the East.

had prepared themselves

an enormous support network.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.150 align:middle line:84%
This multinational
corporation had headquarters

00:28:45.150 --> 00:28:48.660 align:middle line:84%
in London and Paris and
was built with one aim,

soon get their chance

to begin the fight back.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:59.980 align:middle line:84%
Saladin's victories
had sent shock waves

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.190 align:middle line:84%

Europe and ignited
