00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:54.670 align:middle line:90%


00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.820 align:middle line:84%
>>For nearly 200
years, the Knights

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.220 align:middle line:84%
of the Temple of
Solomon were the epitome

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:84%
of Christianity's Medieval
Crusade against Islam.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.100 align:middle line:84%
The Templars had
maintained a standing army

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and had constructed
fortifications

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.550 align:middle line:84%
throughout the Holy Land, all
financed by a vast business

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.845 align:middle line:84%
empire created in
Western Europe.

00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:18.190 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.360 align:middle line:84%
But in year 1291, the
Islamic Mamluks of Egypt

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:84%
had finally driven the
Templars and all the Crusaders

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.685 align:middle line:90%
from Palestine.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.060 align:middle line:84%
The Templars' entire
reason for being

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.320 align:middle line:84%
was the defense of
Christian holy sites.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.320 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.694 align:middle line:84%
What role could there now
be for the warrior monks?

00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:40.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:84%
If they had no role, why did
they still need such wealth?

00:01:46.430 --> 00:02:09.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.640 align:middle line:84%
The triumph of Islam over the
Christians in the Holy Land

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.264 align:middle line:84%
was a blow to Western
European prestige,

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:16.430 align:middle line:90%
but not a total catastrophe.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.080 align:middle line:90%


00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.510 align:middle line:84%
Enthusiasm for
major crusades had

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.300 align:middle line:84%
declined over the last
century, as the Christians

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.090 align:middle line:84%
had suffered defeat
after defeat.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.040 align:middle line:84%
To many, there must have
been some reason why

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.185 align:middle line:84%
God had seemingly
abandoned the Crusaders.

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:34.370 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.460 align:middle line:84%
The sins of pride,
arrogance, and avarice

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.750 align:middle line:84%
were accusations the Templars
had faced many times.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.057 align:middle line:84%
But the Templars had never
once given up the fight

00:02:44.057 --> 00:02:44.890 align:middle line:90%
against the Muslims.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
The Grand Master
himself had died

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.830 align:middle line:84%
in their last battle at Acre,
and the remaining Templars

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.390 align:middle line:90%
had all fought to the death.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
For the Order as a
whole, the annihilation

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.720 align:middle line:84%
of the Christian state was
merely a temporary setback.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.680 align:middle line:10%
>>The Templars fought
very gallantly to defend

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.860 align:middle line:10%
Acre in 1291.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:10%
And even though they were
driven back on Cyprus

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.980 align:middle line:10%
in the course of
the 1290s, there's

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:10%
plenty of evidence to show
that they were continuing

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.695 align:middle line:10%
to maintain the
cause of the Crusade.

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:20.770 align:middle line:90%


00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:90%
They hired fleets.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.960 align:middle line:84%
They attacked the Egyptian
and Syrian mainlands.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.750 align:middle line:84%
They attempted to establish
a base on the Island of Ruad,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:30.395 align:middle line:90%
off of Tortosa.

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:34.532 align:middle line:84%
It was unsuccessful, but
the will was there to do it.

00:03:34.532 --> 00:03:36.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>Neither did the Templars
halt their recruiting

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.655 align:middle line:90%
and fundraising activities.

00:03:39.655 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Crusading enthusiasm
had dampened in Europe

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:90%
but had, by no means, died.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.275 align:middle line:84%
The Templars had no difficulty
attracting new recruits.

00:03:49.275 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.410 align:middle line:10%
>>An individual's
motivation for joining

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.660 align:middle line:10%
one of the military
orders, I am quite sure,

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.835 align:middle line:10%
was almost entirely religious.

00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:06.590 align:middle line:10%


00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.740 align:middle line:10%
So if he succeeded in
saving his soul, then,

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.345 align:middle line:10%
from his point of view,
he was victorious.

00:04:13.345 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.740 align:middle line:84%
The fact that he had lost
a battle, lost a fight,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:19.300 align:middle line:84%
that the Crusader
states had fallen

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.430 align:middle line:84%
was-- I won't say secondary--
it was a disaster.

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.470 align:middle line:84%
But as far as the individual
motivation of a recruit

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is concerned, if he fought
and died in the cause

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.600 align:middle line:84%
that he believed in
and went to heaven,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.880 align:middle line:84%
then he, as an individual,
was victorious.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.640 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>>With a new headquarters in
Cyprus, new recruits, a highly

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.770 align:middle line:84%
productive network still
providing immense funds,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.560 align:middle line:84%
the Order of the
Temple continued

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.690 align:middle line:84%
its 200-year-old
struggle against Islam.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.540 align:middle line:84%
After each catastrophe,
the resilient Templars

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.385 align:middle line:84%
had always regrouped and
returned to the fray.

00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:30.390 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.100 align:middle line:84%
In the early hours
of October 13, 1307,

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.630 align:middle line:84%
the officials of Philip the
Fair, the king of France,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.060 align:middle line:84%
suddenly arrested the
Templars in the lands which

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.780 align:middle line:84%
the king controlled
and charged them

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.320 align:middle line:84%
with a variety of
heretical crimes:

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.505 align:middle line:84%
of obscenities, of the
worship of an idol.

00:05:53.505 --> 00:05:54.670 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And very quickly
extracted confessions

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.286 align:middle line:84%
from many of the Templars that
had been arrested at that time.

00:06:03.286 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.510 align:middle line:84%
>>The charges brought
against the Templars

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.050 align:middle line:84%
could not possibly
be more serious.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:84%
They included treason with the
Muslims, worshipping an idol,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.340 align:middle line:84%
denying Jesus Christ,
spitting on the cross,

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.440 align:middle line:84%
sleeping with the devil,
eating the ashes of their dead,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.025 align:middle line:84%
impregnating virgins, and
various homosexual activities.

00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:30.370 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
If the Templar knights
were found guilty

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.631 align:middle line:84%
of any one of these crimes,
they would be burned alive.

00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:41.760 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.095 align:middle line:84%
More than 5,000 Templars
throughout France

00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:47.785 align:middle line:84%
had been arrested in a highly
coordinated dawn sweep.

00:06:47.785 --> 00:06:48.940 align:middle line:90%


00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Even the Grand Master of
the Order of the Temple,

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle line:84%
James of Molay,
had been captured.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.482 align:middle line:84%
And he, too, had confessed
to many of the accusations.

00:06:56.482 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.725 align:middle line:84%
Could one of the most respected
orders of the church really

00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:14.794 align:middle line:84%
have been a secret society
of devil worshippers?

00:07:14.794 --> 00:07:17.660 align:middle line:90%


00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.390 align:middle line:84%
At the same time as the arrests,
Philip, the King of France,

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.120 align:middle line:84%
had seized all the Templar
lands and properties,

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and urged the crowned heads
of Europe to do the same.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.530 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.062 align:middle line:84%
But not all of
them were convinced

00:07:30.062 --> 00:07:31.020 align:middle line:90%
of the Templars' guilt.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.732 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.732 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:84%
>>Those rulers who were not
linked to the French monarchy

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.530 align:middle line:84%
were very, very
skeptical, as were

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:90%
many independent commentators.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:49.080 align:middle line:84%
The Italians, in particular,
who wrote about it at the time,

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.600 align:middle line:84%
were quite convinced there was
a financial motive behind it.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And we have to take
their view seriously.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:56.780 align:middle line:84%
Nobody knew more about
money than the Italians

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.650 align:middle line:90%
in the early 14th century.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.125 align:middle line:84%
So there was
widespread skepticism.

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:02.280 align:middle line:90%


00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Edward II of England,
for instance,

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.290 align:middle line:84%
said that he simply
did not believe it.

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.650 align:middle line:84%
That these had been gallant
defenders of the Holy Land

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:84%
and important servants of
the English crown, and that

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.385 align:middle line:84%
he found the whole thing
impossible to believe

00:08:17.385 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:90%
and quite astounding.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:84%
>>It was well-known
that the French crown

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.140 align:middle line:84%
was in severe
financial difficulties.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.420 align:middle line:90%


00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.050 align:middle line:84%
In the preceding years, the
king had debased the coinage,

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:84%
expelled the Lombard
bankers, and confiscated

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:34.489 align:middle line:90%
all properties of the Jews.

00:08:34.489 --> 00:08:35.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.276 align:middle line:84%
Philip was exceptionally pious
and probably even believed

00:08:39.276 --> 00:08:42.664 align:middle line:84%
the accusations brought
against the Templars.

00:08:42.664 --> 00:08:46.504 align:middle line:84%
If they were true, it was
his duty to purify his realm.

00:08:46.504 --> 00:08:52.770 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:54.880 align:middle line:84%
The arrest of the
Templars, however,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.060 align:middle line:84%
was a long-awaited
opportunity for the king

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.956 align:middle line:84%
to assert his dominance over
an increasingly weak papacy.

00:09:01.956 --> 00:09:05.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.770 align:middle line:84%
One notable aspect
of the trial is

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:13.380 align:middle line:84%
that the reigning pope, Clement
V, wasn't told in advance.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.740 align:middle line:84%
So it came as much
as a surprise to him

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.585 align:middle line:90%
as it did to the Templars.

00:09:18.585 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:90%


00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:90%
And he was very affronted by it.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.130 align:middle line:84%
He was, perhaps, less concerned
about the fate of the Templars

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.400 align:middle line:84%
than he was about his
own authority, I think.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, having seen
that the event had occurred,

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:40.055 align:middle line:84%
he was most interested in
reasserting his own position,

00:09:40.055 --> 00:09:44.470 align:middle line:84%
vis a vis, a powerful secular
monarch, like Phillip IV.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So he actually tried
to take over the trial,

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:84%
having found that he
couldn't really reverse it.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
reason that the trial

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.600 align:middle line:84%
spread to other countries,
because the pope ordered

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:84%
a general arrest of the
Templars in other countries

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.175 align:middle line:84%
in order to try to find the
truth of the charges that

00:10:02.175 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:90%
were brought against the Order.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>>The intervention
of the pope was

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.930 align:middle line:84%
what the Templars
had been waiting for.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.180 align:middle line:84%
All immediately withdrew
their damning confessions,

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:84%
as it was a custom of the
time for an accused man

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.090 align:middle line:84%
to confess and
later retract when

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.080 align:middle line:90%
he was back on safe ground.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.165 align:middle line:84%
But the Templars were blind
to the political realities.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.730 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Europe was seeing a massive
power struggle, nothing less

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.820 align:middle line:84%
than the birth of
a nation state.

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.020 align:middle line:84%
As the King of France
attempted to limit

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.170 align:middle line:84%
the centuries-old
political influence

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
of the church in France,
nothing would stand in his way.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:45.130 align:middle line:90%


00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.325 align:middle line:84%
King Philip was set on
destroying the Templars

00:10:47.325 --> 00:10:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and had launched an enormous
public relations offensive,

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.880 align:middle line:84%
circulating the
sensational confessions

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.305 align:middle line:90%
throughout his kingdom.

00:10:55.305 --> 00:10:58.630 align:middle line:90%


00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:01.450 align:middle line:84%
To the people of medieval
France and Europe,

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.755 align:middle line:84%
news of the blasphemous
Templar confessions

00:11:03.755 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:90%
was profoundly shocking.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:84%
Even today, many people still
believe that these confessions

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.052 align:middle line:84%
must have contained at
least a grain of truth.

00:11:12.052 --> 00:11:15.364 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.364 --> 00:11:17.030 align:middle line:84%
>>Some historians
have actually believed

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.405 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars were guilty
of the crimes of which they

00:11:19.405 --> 00:11:20.220 align:middle line:90%
were accused.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And they point to the
large number of confessions

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.570 align:middle line:84%
that were made, and, indeed,
the great detail that one

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.910 align:middle line:84%
can see in the confessions
of participation

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.452 align:middle line:84%
in obscene and
blasphemous rights, which

00:11:32.452 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:90%
the Templars were accused of.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.800 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.780 align:middle line:84%
I think, though, for
those of us looking back

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:84%
on the 20th century,
the century is

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:84%
scarred by
governmental pressures,

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.130 align:middle line:90%
both mental and physical.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:49.750 align:middle line:84%
In particular, a
century in which torture

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:84%
has been used
extensively by most

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.145 align:middle line:90%
of the governments of the world.

00:11:54.145 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.640 align:middle line:84%
We, I think, can
have a good deal

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.640 align:middle line:84%
less faith in
confessions extracted

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.210 align:middle line:90%
under that kind of pressure.

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.240 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, most
of these Templars

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:09.020 align:middle line:84%
were tortured in all kinds of
horrendous and painful ways.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And not one of us could
say that we wouldn't

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:15.050 align:middle line:84%
be forced to confess almost
anything, perhaps anything,

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.920 align:middle line:84%
if we were put under
sufficient pressure.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>>The confessions were
damning evidence enough.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:28.250 align:middle line:84%
But following two centuries
of suspicion and rumor,

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:31.035 align:middle line:84%
they found fertile ground in
the minds of many Europeans.

00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:32.400 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:84%
The Templars' vast
wealth, their failure

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
to defend the Holy Land,
their unusual relationship

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.490 align:middle line:84%
with the Muslims
and Islamic culture

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:43.210 align:middle line:84%
was enough to convince
the pope that there

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.232 align:middle line:84%
may be some truth
in the allegations.

00:12:45.232 --> 00:12:46.600 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.050 align:middle line:84%
But more importantly
for the papacy,

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.940 align:middle line:90%
its own prestige was at stake.

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.312 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.312 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:84%
The pope had seen no
option but to abandon

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.425 align:middle line:90%
the Order of the Temple.

00:12:56.425 --> 00:12:58.850 align:middle line:90%


00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.760 align:middle line:84%
The Templars had few
among their ranks

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.525 align:middle line:84%
who were capable of
defending themselves

00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:90%
against such abominable charges.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:11.260 align:middle line:84%
>>The fact that the Templars
regarded themselves and were

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:84%
regarded by others
as unqualified

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:18.900 align:middle line:84%
in strictly religious
or doctrinal matters

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.740 align:middle line:84%
was not a problem
in the early years.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.990 align:middle line:84%
But I suspect that it laid
them open to criticism later.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Or at least, it was like
a chink in their armor.

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
The fact that they
had always claimed

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:39.120 align:middle line:84%
not to be scholarly
in religious matters

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:46.240 align:middle line:84%
meant that they could be accused
of deviant religious beliefs

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:46.925 align:middle line:90%
or activities.

00:13:46.925 --> 00:13:48.000 align:middle line:90%


00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And they would find it
very, very difficult

00:13:49.930 --> 00:13:51.810 align:middle line:84%
to justify themselves
or to explain this.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.345 align:middle line:84%
Because in the past, they had
never claimed any knowledge.

00:13:54.345 --> 00:13:55.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.370 align:middle line:84%
So in a sense, their only
excuse was ignorance.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:06.630 align:middle line:90%


00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>>The trial of the
Templars took five years.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Midway through,
the King of France

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.970 align:middle line:84%
had 54 Templars burned
as relapsed heretics,

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.490 align:middle line:84%
quickly ending a brief but
spirited Templar defense.

00:14:17.490 --> 00:14:37.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Finally, in March 1312, five
years after the arrests,

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:84%
the pope announced the
abolition of the Order

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.710 align:middle line:90%
of the Temple of Solomon.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.080 align:middle line:84%
All of their vast
lands and treasure

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.900 align:middle line:84%
were handed over to the
Knights Hospitaller,

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:53.414 align:middle line:84%
much to the fury
of the French king.

00:14:53.414 --> 00:14:56.330 align:middle line:84%
Philip immediately
sued the Hospitallers

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.170 align:middle line:84%
for the legal
costs of the trial.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.182 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.182 --> 00:15:02.265 align:middle line:90%
All of Europe was stunned.

00:15:02.265 --> 00:15:03.320 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:84%
The abolition of the
Templars was unprecedented.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:06.830 align:middle line:90%


00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:10.130 align:middle line:84%
Many still refused to
believe the Templars' guilt.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.300 align:middle line:84%
But Europe's crowns could
not resist the rich pickings

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.450 align:middle line:90%
of the Templar properties.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.240 align:middle line:84%
>>In England, for
instance, Edward II

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
took over the Templar lands
and the Templar treasury,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and he made assignments on
these lands and on this money.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:32.990 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And though, in the
long-term, once the Templars

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.130 align:middle line:84%
were suppressed in
1312, the property

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.980 align:middle line:84%
was transferred to
the Hospitallers.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
We know from Hospitaller
records that the Order

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.460 align:middle line:84%
of the Hospitaller was still
trying to get hold of lands

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:84%
that Edward II had assigned
to political friends

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.340 align:middle line:84%
and political favorites
of his in the late 1330s.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.890 align:middle line:84%
We know from
Hospitaller inventories

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.350 align:middle line:90%
that that's the case.

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So once the process had
started, it was equally damaging

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.860 align:middle line:84%
to the temple in those countries
where the monarchs had,

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.690 align:middle line:84%
in the first place, been quite
skeptical of their guilt.

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:13.400 align:middle line:90%


00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:17.390 align:middle line:84%
>>In the year 1314, the
two most senior Templars,

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:84%
the last Grand Master, James of
Molay and Geoffrey of Charnay

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.110 align:middle line:84%
were burned alive
as relpsed heretics.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:28.690 align:middle line:90%


00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Ordinary knights who
confessed and repented

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.130 align:middle line:84%
were given prison
sentences and were then

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.578 align:middle line:90%
allowed to join other orders.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:90%


00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
Over nearly 200
years of warfare,

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.340 align:middle line:84%
20,000 knights had
died fighting Islam.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:84%
But in the end, it was
Christianity itself

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:84%
that destroyed the Order
of the Temple of Solomon.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:53.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Today, little remains
of the Order's empire.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.560 align:middle line:84%
Ruins of enormous
castles, a few remnants

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.910 align:middle line:84%
of the vast European
network, which

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
once owned more than
900 perceptories.

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.910 align:middle line:84%
However, modern warfare,
trading, shipping,

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.859 align:middle line:84%
communications,
banking, and farming all

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:15.990 align:middle line:84%
owe something to the innovations
of the Knights Templar.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:23.579 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:84%
>>The history of the
Templars, taken overall,

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.810 align:middle line:84%
is a very neat story
of rise and fall,

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:84%
of initial popularity, of
initial humility, which

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:39.580 align:middle line:84%
turned into over-weaning
power, arrogance,

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and avarice-- ultimately,
leading to their trial.

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:90%


00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.210 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't
think that that is

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:84%
a very good way of
looking at their history.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:55.587 align:middle line:84%
I think that we are far too
much influenced by the fact

00:17:55.587 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:90%
that they were brought to trial.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.610 align:middle line:90%


00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:84%
All the time,
therefore, if one is

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.350 align:middle line:84%
trying to examine the
history of the Templars

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:04.590 align:middle line:84%
in the course of the
12th and 13th centuries,

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.430 align:middle line:84%
one must try to do it without
bearing in mind the trial that

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.990 align:middle line:90%
occurred.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.190 align:middle line:84%
To try to think as if
the trial never happened

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and then look at the
history of the Templars.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And I think one would find it
would look rather different.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:84%
Because in my view, the trial
was not a direct consequence

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:26.560 align:middle line:84%
of any actions or
omissions that could

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.300 align:middle line:84%
be laid at the Templars'
door in the period

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:31.760 align:middle line:90%
from the 1290s onwards.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that the action against
the Templars in the trial

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:84%
was largely generated
by circumstances

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.910 align:middle line:84%
within France, and in
particular, circumstances

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:44.970 align:middle line:84%
within the Capetian government
at that particular time.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:57.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.050 --> 00:18:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>>The story of the
Knights Templar

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:00.950 align:middle line:84%
does not end with the
destruction of the Order

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.830 align:middle line:84%
and the immolation of James of
Molay and Geoffrey of Charnay.

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:06.510 align:middle line:84%
The dramatic rise
and fall of one

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:84%
of the most powerful
institutions of the day

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.940 align:middle line:84%
has fascinated people for
the last seven centuries.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:90%


00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:84%
>>The fact that they were
brought to trial in 1307

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and eventually
suppressed in 1312

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:33.980 align:middle line:84%
inevitably colors the
way that we look at them.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And then, in turn, the way that
they've been written about,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.110 align:middle line:84%
in particular, I think, by
Sir Walter Scott in the novel

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
"Ivanhoe," which was
published in 1819,

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:52.980 align:middle line:84%
has helped to reinforce the idea
of the arrogant, overconfident,

00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:56.940 align:middle line:84%
overbearing Templar who
was, nevertheless, also

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:01.215 align:middle line:84%
the possessor of mysterious
esoteric anti-Christian

00:20:01.215 --> 00:20:01.715 align:middle line:90%
secrets.

00:20:01.715 --> 00:20:06.510 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:84%
>>Soon after the abolition
of the Knights Templar,

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:13.480 align:middle line:84%
legends grew up of escaped
Templars, secret societies,

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:84%
hidden treasure,
mysterious scrolls,

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and strange connections to
some of the world's greatest

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.103 align:middle line:90%
religious icons.

00:20:20.103 --> 00:20:21.569 align:middle line:90%


00:20:21.569 --> 00:20:24.110 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the reasons, I think,
for the continuing fascination

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:84%
with the Templars is that they
have a long after-history,

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:33.770 align:middle line:84%
which begins almost immediately
with the burning of James

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.870 align:middle line:84%
of Molay and Geoffrey
of Charnay in Paris

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:90%
as relapsed heretics in 1314.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Various chroniclists
claimed that Molay

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:84%
had brought a curse down
upon the Capetian house,

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:51.760 align:middle line:84%
and in particular,
upon Philip the Fair,

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:55.470 align:middle line:84%
as well as upon
Clement V, calling

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
upon the vengeance
of God to bring them

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:03.735 align:middle line:84%
before the tribunal of
heaven within the year.

00:21:03.735 --> 00:21:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, it was
easy for them to say this,

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
because both Philip the Fair
and Clement V did actually

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.010 align:middle line:90%
die within the year.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So one could make it look as
if that really did make sense.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.760 align:middle line:84%
But that-- there were
those dramatic ideas

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:28.450 align:middle line:84%
that one sees in near
contemporary chronicles

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:84%
have since been
embroidered and developed

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.830 align:middle line:84%
by other people
seeking sensationalism,

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
seeking a story that
continues after the Templars'

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.520 align:middle line:90%
sensational end.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
In my view, there
is no substance

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.220 align:middle line:90%
in any of these stories.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.020 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
stop them being used

00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.140 align:middle line:84%
by different people in different
periods for their own purposes.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And this continues right
down to the present day.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:03.060 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the most persistent
legends associated

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:05.180 align:middle line:84%
with the Templars
is their connection

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:84%
with the Shroud of Turin,
which, for many years,

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.815 align:middle line:84%
was believed to have been the
burial shroud of Jesus Christ.

00:22:10.815 --> 00:22:13.620 align:middle line:90%


00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>>In the 1970s and 1980s,
when historians and scientists

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.280 align:middle line:84%
were arguing about
the authenticity

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
of this particular
relic, they needed

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.160 align:middle line:84%
to provide it-- if it was to be
seen as authentic-- they needed

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
to provide it with a
scientific providence.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.340 align:middle line:84%
But they also needed to provide
it with a continuous history.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.160 align:middle line:90%


00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And there, there were
really large gaps.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.000 align:middle line:84%
One of those gaps was filled,
in some people's view,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.630 align:middle line:84%
by the idea that it
was the Templars who

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:90%
had held the Turin shroud.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:52.450 align:middle line:84%
That they had seized it
during the Fourth Crusade

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:90%
sack of Constantinople in 1204.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:23:00.810 align:middle line:84%
That they had kept it
secret among their treasures

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:90%
throughout the 13th century.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.300 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.450 align:middle line:84%
That that was the
origin of the accusation

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:07.310 align:middle line:84%
that they worshipped
idols, that they had

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:10.810 align:middle line:84%
make many copies of it, and it
had been the subject of a cult

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:11.690 align:middle line:90%
within the Order.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:12.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:19.180 align:middle line:84%
And that, before the Templars
were finally suppressed,

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.180 align:middle line:84%
they had managed
to smuggle it away

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:84%
into the possession
of the Charnay family,

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:84%
who were the ones who exhibit it
in the late 14th century, when

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:32.980 align:middle line:90%
it seems to reappear again.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.000 align:middle line:84%
So this seemed like
a plausible theory

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.210 align:middle line:84%
as to what had happened
to the shroud in the 13th

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:42.490 align:middle line:84%
and 14th centuries while
also, rather neatly,

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.990 align:middle line:84%
explaining the accusation
of idol worship

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.950 align:middle line:90%
against the Templars.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:46.852 align:middle line:90%


00:23:46.852 --> 00:23:48.810 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the
theory is that there's not

00:23:48.810 --> 00:23:52.110 align:middle line:84%
one shred of evidence
to support it.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.590 align:middle line:84%
It is entirely theory, and
it's totally incredible

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:56.820 align:middle line:90%
and quite unbelievable.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.900 align:middle line:10%
>>The legend of the Order
of the Temple of Solomon

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:10.360 align:middle line:10%
lives on through the activities
of thousands of modern Templar

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:12.740 align:middle line:10%
societies all over the world.

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:14.390 align:middle line:90%
Many have charitable aims.

00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:84%
And some claim an unbroken
link to the last Templars.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.130 align:middle line:90%


00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.480 align:middle line:84%
But it is the Order's role
in the Free Masonry Movement

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.546 align:middle line:84%
that has done most to give the
Templars worldwide recognition.

00:24:25.546 --> 00:24:29.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>>I don't think that, for the
rest of the medieval period,

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and really, very much into
the 16th and 17th centuries,

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.800 align:middle line:84%
there's massive interest
in the Templars.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.340 align:middle line:84%
Where it really revises
is in the 18th century

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:44.500 align:middle line:84%
with the growth of
Masonic orders, who

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:49.590 align:middle line:84%
liked to believe that
they were directly

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:84%
linked to the Temple of
Solomon and to the Masons who

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:84%
had supposedly built
the Temple of Solomon.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And in this sense, they looked
towards a providence associated

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.970 align:middle line:84%
with institutions that had
lived in those buildings

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:11.416 align:middle line:84%
on the Temple Mount, which
the Crusaders had thought

00:25:11.416 --> 00:25:13.790 align:middle line:84%
had actually been the
Temple of Solomon.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And of course, they
lighted upon Templars

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:18.810 align:middle line:90%
as part of that early history.

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.030 align:middle line:90%


00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:26.410 align:middle line:84%
Given that these Masonic
Orders also sought a providence

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.480 align:middle line:84%
for themselves, as most
new institutions do,

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.250 align:middle line:84%
it seemed logical
to see the Templars

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:38.010 align:middle line:84%
as being part of that
system of esoteric ideas

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and secret ideas,
which they liked

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.595 align:middle line:84%
to believe that they
were guardians of.

00:25:41.595 --> 00:25:42.720 align:middle line:90%


00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And which they
might have believed

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:50.120 align:middle line:84%
were suppressed by the
regime of Philip the Fair

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and the papal monarchy, as
represented by Clement V.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:01.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think that the real
revival in Templar interest

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.210 align:middle line:84%
comes as a consequence of
the Masons, particularly

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:15.630 align:middle line:84%
the German Masons, from
about a 1760s onwards.

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.470 align:middle line:84%
>>Many of the
Templar legends begin

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.590 align:middle line:84%
with the Order's
occupation of the temple

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.770 align:middle line:90%
platform in Jerusalem.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And some people believe
the Templar knights

00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:28.580 align:middle line:84%
must have excavated
beneath the platform.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Here the Templars
are supposed to have

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.055 align:middle line:84%
found, at one time or another,
not just the esoteric secrets

00:26:34.055 --> 00:26:37.545 align:middle line:84%
of King Solomon himself, but
even the Ark of the Covenant.

00:26:37.545 --> 00:26:38.805 align:middle line:90%


00:26:38.805 --> 00:26:40.930 align:middle line:84%
But there are several
problems with these theories.

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:43.980 align:middle line:90%


00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.483 align:middle line:84%
>>The Crusaders actually
called it Solomon's stable.

00:26:47.483 --> 00:26:49.090 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:56.450 align:middle line:10%
And really, although this name
has no base from architecture

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:02.140 align:middle line:10%
or historical point of view,
because that site, as it stands

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.850 align:middle line:10%
today, has nothing to
do with Prophet Solomon.

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:09.130 align:middle line:84%
We know that Solomon
developed Jerusalem, but not

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.110 align:middle line:90%
that site or that area exactly.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Although, the structure,
as it stands today,

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:18.690 align:middle line:84%
especially the bases are Roman,
while the upper courses is

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.435 align:middle line:84%
purely Islamic and from
the Umayyad Dynasty.

00:27:22.435 --> 00:27:26.350 align:middle line:90%


00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>>One Templar legend is that
their vast treasure, together

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.730 align:middle line:84%
with any esoteric secrets they
may or may not have discovered,

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:36.540 align:middle line:84%
escaped the clutches
of the French king.

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:84%
For decades, the discovery
of the lost Templar gold

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.080 align:middle line:84%
and the lost secrets have been
the ambition of many a treasure

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:90%

Rosslyn Chapel in
Scotland, which

00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.400 align:middle line:84%
is the heart of
Scottish Free Masonry,

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.690 align:middle line:84%
is also believed by many to hold
those Templar treasures which

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.365 align:middle line:84%
must have alluded
the king of France.

00:27:55.365 --> 00:27:59.710 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.090 align:middle line:84%
>>When the Templars
were arrested in 1307,

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:84%
the officials of
Philip the Fair very

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:09.730 align:middle line:84%
carefully inventoried
all their possessions.

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.340 align:middle line:84%
And they also took over the
temple fortress and bank

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:15.000 align:middle line:90%
to the north of Paris.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:84%
So it seems very unlikely any
substantial part of the Templar

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.245 align:middle line:84%
possessions was missed
by these people.

00:28:22.245 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:90%


00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.340 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's
any secret treasure.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I think it's much more mundane
and straightforward than that.

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:32.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think, simply, that the
officials of Philip the Fair

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.102 align:middle line:84%
took over the
Templar possessions

00:28:35.102 --> 00:28:36.560 align:middle line:84%
that they could
lay their hands on,

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.435 align:middle line:84%
which was most of what the
Templars possessed in France.

each seeking to
prove conclusively

00:28:53.416 --> 00:28:56.860 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars really are

At one time or
another, the Templars

have been associated
with not just

the Ark of the Covenant
and the Holy Grail,

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.260 align:middle line:84%
