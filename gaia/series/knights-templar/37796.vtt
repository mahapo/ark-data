00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>>Nearly 900 years
ago, the Holy Land

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.206 align:middle line:84%
was home to one of the most
extraordinary organizations

00:00:48.206 --> 00:00:49.475 align:middle line:90%
that has ever existed.

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:53.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.340 align:middle line:84%
The Knights of the
Temple of Solomon

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.020 align:middle line:84%
were elite warriors,
unparalleled entrepreneurs,

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.900 align:middle line:84%
and devoted men of God, ready
at any moment to kill and die.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.513 align:middle line:84%
They had one mission: to
define the Christian Holy Land.

00:01:07.513 --> 00:01:11.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.680 align:middle line:84%
After a severe mauling by
the legendary Islamic leader

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.990 align:middle line:84%
Saladin, the Knights
Templar had mobilized

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:84%
their enormous financial
resources in Western Europe.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.790 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Front line defenses had been
reconstructed and garrisoned,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
but how long could the
outnumbered Templars hold out

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.720 align:middle line:84%
against an enemy that had all
the logistical advantages,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and just how dangerous were
their opponents back in Western

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Europe, envious of
their land and wealth?

00:01:39.690 --> 00:02:03.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.320 align:middle line:84%
A Knight of the Temple of
Solomon, recruited in Europe

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.639 align:middle line:84%
and sent to the front
line in the Holy Land,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
soon became hardened to
the conditions of the east.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.320 align:middle line:84%
As monks of the
Catholic Church, they

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.860 align:middle line:84%
were well accustomed
to strict discipline,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
and their every moment, awake
and asleep, was regulated.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.500 align:middle line:84%
Each day was taken up with
prayer, work, and above all,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.730 align:middle line:90%
constant training for battle.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:84%
There was no leisure time,
and, in fact, most of the time,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.360 align:middle line:84%
there was not much
battle, either.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.210 align:middle line:84%
Warfare was expensive
in men and horses,

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and for decades, the
order had generally

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
pursued a cautious
policy in the east.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.680 align:middle line:84%
This policy had even
included negotiating truces

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.840 align:middle line:84%
with local Islamic
leaders, which

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.540 align:middle line:84%
made other Crusaders
deeply uneasy,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.080 align:middle line:84%
especially when they
negotiated with the leader

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.665 align:middle line:84%
of the Shiite Muslim sect
called the Assassins.

00:02:59.665 --> 00:03:01.100 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.680 align:middle line:84%
The Templars had no qualms in
implementing any policy that

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.986 align:middle line:84%
strengthened their
position in the east.

00:03:07.986 --> 00:03:16.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.280 align:middle line:10%
>>They're not just
professional soldiers;

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.700 align:middle line:10%
the Templars are the
professional defenders

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.105 align:middle line:10%
of the frontier, and that's
more than just military.

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:84%
It has to be diplomatic, it
has to be political and so on,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.500 align:middle line:84%
so maybe this is why
the Templars picked

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.580 align:middle line:84%
up on the possibility of an
alliance with the Assassins

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.085 align:middle line:84%
more readily than did the
secular rulers of the Crusader

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:40.585 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Pilgrims and Crusaders
visiting the Holy Land

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:84%
for the first time were
often angry to discover

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.900 align:middle line:84%
that the resident
Crusaders had negotiated

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.510 align:middle line:90%
a truce with the Muslim enemy.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.600 align:middle line:84%
They had spent a great
deal of money to get there

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.560 align:middle line:90%
and had traveled far.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:90%


00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Newly arrived
travelers could not

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.476 align:middle line:84%
believe that any Christians,
especially the Templars,

00:04:13.476 --> 00:04:14.600 align:middle line:90%
even talked to the Muslims.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>>Fundamentally,
they were intolerant

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.260 align:middle line:90%
on an everyday basis.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.750 align:middle line:90%


00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:84%
For much of the time, they
had to be tolerant-- it's just

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.710 align:middle line:84%
a matter of common sense
and an ability to exist.

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:90%
These people are not stupid.

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.510 align:middle line:90%


00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Their beliefs were intolerant--
much more intolerant

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.460 align:middle line:84%
than ours are
today, but they were

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
living, as I said,
on a frontier.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.290 align:middle line:84%
They had to deal
with their neighbors.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
They were not in a position
to wage perpetual war.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.680 align:middle line:84%
They knew it, their leaders
knew it, everybody knew it.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.500 align:middle line:84%
So pragmatism-- I won't say
it was the order of the day,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.180 align:middle line:84%
but they were perfectly willing
and capable of being pragmatic.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:84%
This does not make
them different

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:90%
to other Medieval people.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.670 align:middle line:10%
>>So there were many day to day
contacts between all the Franks

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:10%
in the east, and some of
these are very colorfully

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.660 align:middle line:10%
described by a Damascene
chronicler called

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:24.910 align:middle line:10%
Usama ibn Munqidh.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.060 align:middle line:90%


00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:84%
One of these stories is
the most well known one

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.940 align:middle line:84%
about a Frank newly
arrived from the west, who

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:40.720 align:middle line:84%
forces Usama to pray facing
east, and one of the Templars

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.560 align:middle line:84%
intervenes, apologizes
to Usama, and says,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:50.660 align:middle line:84%
no, this man is a newcomer, he
doesn't understand our ways,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.609 align:middle line:84%
you can pray in
whatever way you wish.

00:05:53.609 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And this has sometimes
been presented

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.590 align:middle line:84%
as showing that
the Templars were

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.710 align:middle line:84%
very friendly with
the Muslims, but I

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.460 align:middle line:84%
think it really shows much
more, that in daily life,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Templars and other Franks
had frequent contact

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.360 align:middle line:90%
with the Muslims.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Many of them spoke Arabic, many
more than has been previously

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.980 align:middle line:90%
said, spoke Arabic, I think.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.210 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.250 align:middle line:84%
So it was necessary,
in order to exist,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.000 align:middle line:84%
to have these daily contacts,
but that doesn't necessarily

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:84%
affect their commitment
to the Holy War.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:33.320 align:middle line:90%


00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:84%
>>Although the Templars
had, time and time again,

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:84%
proved themselves to be
dedicated enemies of Islam,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.346 align:middle line:84%
there would always
be rumors that they

00:06:41.346 --> 00:06:42.470 align:middle line:90%
fraternized with the enemy.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:43.640 align:middle line:90%


00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.670 align:middle line:84%
One day, the Templars
would actually

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.970 align:middle line:84%
be accused of secretly
being Muslims themselves.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:07:03.460 align:middle line:90%


00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.980 align:middle line:84%
By joining the Order of
the Temple of Solomon,

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.440 align:middle line:84%
a knight believed he
was purifying himself

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.430 align:middle line:84%
of the corruption, temptation,
and superficialities

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.740 align:middle line:90%
of the transitory world.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.050 align:middle line:84%
As such, he was to lead
a hardworking, sober life

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.730 align:middle line:84%
of sacrifice,
dedication, and humility.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.110 align:middle line:84%
For humility is the
guardian of all virtues,

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.935 align:middle line:84%
but few people ever saw much
humility in the Templars.

00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:37.840 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:84%
As individuals, the
Templars stood apart

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.630 align:middle line:84%
with their white
robes and red cross.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.990 align:middle line:84%
As an organization, the Order
of the Temple of Solomon

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.185 align:middle line:90%
prized its independence.

00:07:47.185 --> 00:07:48.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Templar castles ruled
their surrounding areas

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:90%
with complete automony.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.340 align:middle line:84%
They brought little or no
interference from the king.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.400 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
The temple often pursued
its own strategies,

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:05.000 align:middle line:84%
even in direct opposition to
the overall Crusader policy.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:22.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.530 align:middle line:10%
Early in the 13th century,
the Christian enclave

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.910 align:middle line:10%
in the Holy Land stretched
from Antioch to Arsur,

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.500 align:middle line:10%
and the Templars now
controlled a major proportion

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.210 align:middle line:10%
of this from their castles
at Atlit, Chastel Blanc,

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.860 align:middle line:10%
and in the mountains
around Antioc.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.789 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:84%
The undying aim of
all the Crusaders

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.790 align:middle line:84%
remained the capture of
Jerusalem for Christianity.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.110 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.370 align:middle line:84%
The next opportunity arrived
at the Fifth Crusade,

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:84%
whose leaders believed that the
only way to secure Jerusalem

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.920 align:middle line:84%
was by first conquering
Egypt itself.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.180 align:middle line:84%
The Templars joined the Fifth
Crusade, whose objective

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.408 align:middle line:90%
was Egypt's capital, Cairo.

00:09:03.408 --> 00:09:04.830 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:07.970 align:middle line:84%
The city of Damietta
was the first obstacle

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:08.885 align:middle line:90%
facing the Crusaders.

00:09:08.885 --> 00:09:14.590 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.550 align:middle line:84%
The Christian siege of
Damietta was long and bitter,

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:21.760 align:middle line:84%
but finally, the Crusaders
overwhelmed the Muslims.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:10%
This so shocked
the Sultan of Egypt

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.110 align:middle line:10%
that he immediately
offered to surrender

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:10%
the Kingdom of Jerusalem if they
would return the captured city

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.620 align:middle line:10%
and leave.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.220 align:middle line:90%
The Christians hesitated.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:90%


00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.800 align:middle line:84%
They were expecting
reinforcements

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:84%
from Emperor Frederick II, who
had vowed to go on Crusade.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:90%


00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.080 align:middle line:84%
If Frederick's forces
arrived in time,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.865 align:middle line:84%
Cairo itself would be
an attainable goal.

00:09:45.865 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.720 align:middle line:84%
While the Christians
hesitated, the Muslims

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.720 align:middle line:90%
prepared their defenses.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.010 align:middle line:90%


00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Twenty months after the
capture of Damietta,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.235 align:middle line:84%
the Fifth Crusade
finally headed south.

00:10:04.235 --> 00:10:07.720 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians easily
cut their supply line

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.500 align:middle line:90%
and flooded the valley.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
The Christians accepted
the sultan's next offer--

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.257 align:middle line:84%
they returned
Damietta and he let

00:10:16.257 --> 00:10:17.465 align:middle line:90%
them escape with their lives.

00:10:17.465 --> 00:10:27.680 align:middle line:90%


00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.360 align:middle line:84%
The failure of Emperor Frederick
II to arrive in the Holy Land

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
almost certainly resulted
in the destruction

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:34.902 align:middle line:90%
of the Fifth Crusade.

00:10:34.902 --> 00:10:38.680 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.230 align:middle line:84%
>>Frederick eventually
went on crusade in 1228

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.190 align:middle line:84%
but was forced to turn
back because of illness,

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.550 align:middle line:84%
and the papacy excommunicated
him as a result.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:51.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Frederick wasn't deterred by
this-- he then set out again,

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.290 align:middle line:84%
but this very much
complicated his relations

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.110 align:middle line:84%
with the powers that
already existed in Cyprus

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:06.780 align:middle line:84%
and on the mainland
when he arrived there,

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:08.870 align:middle line:84%
and it became rather
difficult for them

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.890 align:middle line:84%
to have dealings with
him in the long term.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:19.010 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, Frederick expected
his own will to be obeyed.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:23.030 align:middle line:84%
He had a quasi absolutist regime
in the Kingdom of Sicily, which

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:25.620 align:middle line:84%
was one of the important
parts of his empire,

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.480 align:middle line:84%
and he found it
difficult to deal

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:84%
with military orders, accustomed
to being at least semi

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:37.000 align:middle line:84%
independent, and a
Jerusalem baronage which

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.420 align:middle line:84%
had a very highly developed
sense of its legal rights.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:84%
So from the very
beginning, Frederick

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.639 align:middle line:84%
was in conflict with
important powers in the east,

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:49.930 align:middle line:90%
and this included the Templars.

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.930 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>>As an order of
the Catholic Church,

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.050 align:middle line:84%
the Templars were not
supposed to have dealings

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.390 align:middle line:84%
with the excommunicated
Frederick,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:84%
but their conflict
with the German emperor

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.824 align:middle line:90%
had begun much earlier.

00:12:02.824 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:90%


00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Back in Europe,
Frederick had angrily

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:11.080 align:middle line:84%
complained that the Templar
network had purchased so much

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
of his lands in
Italy that it was

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.180 align:middle line:84%
trying to control
his entire kingdom.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.800 align:middle line:10%
After quarreling with the
Crusaders in the east,

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.750 align:middle line:10%
Frederick II headed
down the coast

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.590 align:middle line:10%
and actually met with
the Sultan of Egypt.

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
At the city of Jaffa, he
signed a sensational treaty.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians voluntarily
ceded back part of the Kingdom

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.500 align:middle line:84%
of Jerusalem, including the Holy
City itself, to the Christians.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:40.950 align:middle line:84%
Almost single handedly,
and without bloodshed,

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.940 align:middle line:84%
the excommunicate German
emperor had finally

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:45.650 align:middle line:84%
recovered Jerusalem
for Christianity.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Frederick then went to the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:52.542 align:middle line:90%
and had himself crowned.

00:12:52.542 --> 00:13:00.910 align:middle line:90%


00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:04.460 align:middle line:84%
The Christians resident in the
west, especially the Templars,

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
were not impressed with
Frederick's achievement,

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
as one of the
clauses of the treaty

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
prevented the repair
of any fortifications

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.640 align:middle line:90%
in around the Holy City.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.870 align:middle line:84%
>>There does seem, thereafter,
to have been a period of enmity

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.780 align:middle line:84%
between the military
orders, particularly

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.930 align:middle line:84%
between Frederick II and
the Templars, which resulted

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.650 align:middle line:84%
in a number of confiscations
of Templar lands

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:36.860 align:middle line:84%
in Frederick's lands in Italy
when he returned to the west

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:40.424 align:middle line:90%
in 1229.

00:13:40.424 --> 00:13:44.720 align:middle line:84%
One of the consequences of
the enmity between Frederick

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and the Templars was
the Templars' refusal

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:84%
to accept the treaties
that Frederick had signed,

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.780 align:middle line:84%
and, indeed, there are
some sources that claim,

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.340 align:middle line:84%
I think wrongly,
but claim that there

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:01.100 align:middle line:84%
was a plot to murder Frederick
and that the Templars were

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.620 align:middle line:90%
involved in that plot.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:90%


00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:10.490 align:middle line:84%
>>His approach was one
of attempted coexistence

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
on what we believe to have
been a long term basis.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:17.160 align:middle line:84%
He was trying to achieve
peace in the true sense of it,

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:84%
whereas what the Templars
had done in the past,

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.210 align:middle line:84%
in terms of coexistence,
was temporary.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.680 align:middle line:84%
They were making sort of
strategic truces and so on,

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.655 align:middle line:84%
so their approach was
fundamentally different.

00:14:28.655 --> 00:14:33.370 align:middle line:90%


00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:84%
>>Frederick's negotiation
with the Egyptian

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:84%
had greatly increased
the Crusaders' territory

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:90%
in the Holy Land.

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
Over the next few
years, further Crusades

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:45.230 align:middle line:84%
by Theobald of Champagne
and Richard of Cornwall

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:84%
used both military
action and negotiations

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to increase the Christian
state to the largest

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.420 align:middle line:90%
it had been for 50 years.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:15:04.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Despite the apparent success
of the Crusader state,

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:10.200 align:middle line:84%
the Knights Templar
still refused

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.810 align:middle line:84%
to acknowledge
Frederick's treaty

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.810 align:middle line:84%
with the Sultan of Egypt,
and they steadfastly

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.126 align:middle line:90%
pursued their own policies.

00:15:16.126 --> 00:15:17.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:21.010 align:middle line:84%
The Templars opened
negotiation with Egypt's rival,

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.155 align:middle line:90%
the Sultan of Damascus.

00:15:22.155 --> 00:15:23.360 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.550 align:middle line:84%
The Templars believed the
Egyptian empire was growing

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:middle line:84%
weak, a situation they
felt the Crusaders should

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.100 align:middle line:90%
be exploiting to the full.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:90%


00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.430 align:middle line:84%
>>The fact is that the
Muslim states of that region

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.530 align:middle line:84%
had other and far more
important things to worry about,

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:47.130 align:middle line:84%
most obviously the Mongols,
who, unlike the Crusaders,

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.650 align:middle line:84%
did pose a mortal
threat, certainly

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.390 align:middle line:84%
were perceived as
posing a mortal threat,

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:57.410 align:middle line:84%
to the Muslim world, to the
whole civilization of Islam.

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.344 align:middle line:84%
It was on an entirely
different level,

00:16:00.344 --> 00:16:01.885 align:middle line:84%
even compared with
the First Crusade.

00:16:01.885 --> 00:16:09.100 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>The Mongol Empire
created by Genghis Khan

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.410 align:middle line:84%
had expanded across
half a continent

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.825 align:middle line:84%
and now threatened the
Islamic and Christian states.

00:16:16.825 --> 00:16:17.890 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:20.400 align:middle line:84%
Fleeing the Mongol
Horde was an army

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.730 align:middle line:84%
called the Khwarazm, who
also posed a grave threat

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:24.725 align:middle line:90%
to the Christian state.

00:16:24.725 --> 00:16:31.730 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.090 align:middle line:84%
The westernmost Islamic
leader, the Sultan of Damascus,

00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:38.950 align:middle line:84%
felt most threatened, and he had
accepted a nonaggression treaty

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.760 align:middle line:84%
with the Templars
in which he gave

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.783 align:middle line:84%
them back their old
castle of Safad.

00:16:42.783 --> 00:16:44.860 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:49.070 align:middle line:84%
The Sultan of Egypt was stunned
and immediately allied himself

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.490 align:middle line:90%
with the Khwarazm.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.235 align:middle line:84%
The Crusader state
was surrounded.

00:16:52.235 --> 00:16:58.560 align:middle line:90%


00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.085 align:middle line:84%
The Khwarazm struck
first, invading Palestine

00:17:01.085 --> 00:17:02.355 align:middle line:90%
and attacking Damascus.

00:17:02.355 --> 00:17:05.640 align:middle line:90%


00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:84%
The Christians assembled
the largest force

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:11.069 align:middle line:84%
they could, and together
with the Sultan of Damascus,

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.574 align:middle line:90%
took the field at La Forbie.

00:17:12.574 --> 00:17:13.839 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Their Muslim allies
deserted and the Egyptians

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.925 align:middle line:84%
crushed the Christians in one
of the most devastating battles

00:17:19.925 --> 00:17:20.550 align:middle line:90%
of the century.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:31.050 align:middle line:90%


00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Ninety percent of the Templar
force in the Holy Land

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.870 align:middle line:84%
had been killed at the
Battle of La Forbie,

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:84%
but many Christians,
especially Frederick II,

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.725 align:middle line:84%
squarely blamed the Knights
Templar for the catastrophe.

00:17:41.725 --> 00:17:44.770 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:84%
The crisis deepened
over the next few years

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.470 align:middle line:84%
as the weakened
Crusader state lost

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.023 align:middle line:84%
some of its most
powerful castles.

00:17:51.023 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.700 align:middle line:84%
Frederick accused the
Templars of perpetuating war

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:03.930 align:middle line:90%
for their own ends.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:07.350 align:middle line:84%
He claimed that the military
order could not exist in peace,

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:08.956 align:middle line:84%
and that's why
they had sabotaged

00:18:08.956 --> 00:18:10.205 align:middle line:90%
his treaty with the Egyptians.

00:18:10.205 --> 00:18:11.270 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Frederick was not the
first to accuse the Knights

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.485 align:middle line:84%
Templar of warmongering, and
he would not be the last.

00:18:16.485 --> 00:18:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.040 align:middle line:84%
The King of France,
Louis IX, was

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.800 align:middle line:84%
the first to respond to the
Crusaders' frantic pleas

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.280 align:middle line:90%
for help.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:84%
Louis arrived in
the east in 1248

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.635 align:middle line:84%
with a diverse contingent
of European knights.

00:18:45.635 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:90%


00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Louis decided to follow the
strategy of previous Crusades,

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.920 align:middle line:84%
attempting to knock out Egypt
before taking Jerusalem.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.810 align:middle line:90%


00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:84%
>>Unfortunately,
it's very difficult

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:02.560 align:middle line:84%
to attack Egypt
because of the Nile,

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.070 align:middle line:84%
because of the series of
canals that crisscrossed

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.450 align:middle line:84%
the various branches
of the Nile,

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:12.190 align:middle line:84%
and one couldn't
necessarily move one's army

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:84%
across these branches
all in one go,

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and there was one very
important incident when

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.250 align:middle line:84%
the Templars, together with the
Earl of Salisbury and Robert

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.460 align:middle line:84%
of Artois, who was a younger
brother of King Louis

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:28.750 align:middle line:84%
IX of France, had already
crossed one branch of the Nile

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and were opposite the
Egyptian town of Mansoura.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.960 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:84%
Robet of Artois,
keen to gain glory,

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.670 align:middle line:90%
wanted to attack Mansoura.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.320 align:middle line:84%
It would appear that
the Templars wished

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
to adopt their usual,
rather cautious policy

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and wait for the rest of the
army, but when Robert of Artois

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.260 align:middle line:84%
insisted, using, as
one chronicler said,

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:84%
foul and abusive words that were
characteristic of the French,

00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:84%
the Templars agreed
to go along with this,

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
but it proved to be a
disaster because Mansoura was

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.840 align:middle line:84%
a town with small,
tight streets,

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.000 align:middle line:84%
quite inappropriate for a
mounted attack of the sort

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.422 align:middle line:84%
that the Count of Artois and the
Templars were forced to make,

00:20:16.422 --> 00:20:18.630 align:middle line:84%
and many of them were trapped
in these narrow streets

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:23.680 align:middle line:84%
and were killed, so by the time
the bulk of the army appeared,

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:84%
this had turned from
what was planned

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.515 align:middle line:84%
to be a glorious
attack into a riot.

00:20:29.515 --> 00:20:36.940 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>>The disaster of Mansoura
had seen the entire vanguard

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.550 align:middle line:90%
of the Crusader Army eliminated.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:47.076 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the motivation for the
Templar assault on Monsoura,

00:20:47.076 --> 00:20:48.450 align:middle line:84%
the Templars had
found themselves

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.310 align:middle line:84%
central to yet
another catastrophe.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:51.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
They had lost 200 knights
and another grand master

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.664 align:middle line:90%
had been killed in battle.

00:20:55.664 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:84%
The retreating Christians
were eventually surrounded,

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.860 align:middle line:84%
and Louis IX, the
King of France,

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.770 align:middle line:84%
surrendered to the
Egyptian Sultan.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.183 align:middle line:84%
He was put up for an enormous
ransom of 400,000 livre de

00:21:10.183 --> 00:21:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Tours at a time when the annual
income of the entire Kingdom

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:21.240 align:middle line:90%
of France was 250,000 livre.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Templar treasure
ships waiting offshore

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:84%
were targeted by the
king's entourage,

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.210 align:middle line:84%
for the Templars refused
to release the money,

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.089 align:middle line:84%
as much of it had been deposited
with them for safekeeping

00:21:31.089 --> 00:21:31.880 align:middle line:90%
by other Crusaders.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle line:90%


00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>>In fact, there wasn't
any obvious conflict.

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.600 align:middle line:84%
A member of the King's
entourage broke the locks

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:44.040 align:middle line:84%
of some of these trunks
of money in the presence

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.440 align:middle line:84%
of the Templars, who made
a symbolic objection.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.240 align:middle line:84%
In that way, the
Templars managed

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.250 align:middle line:84%
to maintain their integrity
while still making

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.330 align:middle line:84%
a contribution towards
the King's ransom.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.770 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.770 --> 00:22:00.010 align:middle line:84%
>>Immediately on
his release, Louis

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:02.350 align:middle line:84%
went to the Crusader
city of Acre,

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:84%
where he remained
for four years.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Despite the Templars'
support for the French king,

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.470 align:middle line:84%
they would not abandon their
own policies in the Holy Land.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.110 align:middle line:84%
While Louis hoped to
make peace with Egypt,

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.560 align:middle line:84%
he caught the Templars
negotiating, once more,

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.053 align:middle line:84%
with the Muslim
city of Damascus.

00:22:18.053 --> 00:22:19.540 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.596 align:middle line:84%
Louis was shocked and forced the
Templars to submit and repent.

00:22:23.596 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:34.010 align:middle line:84%
When Louis IX eventually
sailed for home,

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:38.220 align:middle line:84%
the Christian Holy Land lost not
just his substantial resources,

00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:84%
but also one of the few leaders
who could unify the state

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.698 align:middle line:90%
and keep the Templars in line.

00:22:43.698 --> 00:22:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Not long after, the
Crusaders' situation

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.365 align:middle line:90%
took a turn for the worse.

00:22:49.365 --> 00:22:53.050 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.210 align:middle line:84%
The Mongols were
on the move again,

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:84%
and Egypt had undergone a coup,
and a new power, the Mamluks,

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:01.625 align:middle line:84%
began carving an
empire for itself.

00:23:01.625 --> 00:23:03.440 align:middle line:90%


00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.790 align:middle line:84%
The Mamluks
recognized the Mongols

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
to be a far greater threat
than the Christians.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:90%


00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:21.740 align:middle line:10%
By the year 1260, the Mongols
had sacked Baghdad, Aleppo,

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.125 align:middle line:10%
and Damascus, leaving no Islamic
power east of the Christians.

00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:27.840 align:middle line:10%


00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.880 align:middle line:10%
The ever diminishing sliver
of the Christian Holy Land

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.180 align:middle line:10%
stood between the world's
two most powerful armies.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:36.910 align:middle line:10%
Incredibly, the Crusaders
allowed the Muslims

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.130 align:middle line:10%
to pass through their land en
route to the Mongol Hordes.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.290 align:middle line:90%


00:23:43.290 --> 00:23:46.500 align:middle line:10%
At the Battle of Ayn
Jalot, it was the Mamluks

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:10%
who were victorious, inflicting
the first major defeat

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.030 align:middle line:10%
on the Mongol Empire.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:56.760 align:middle line:90%


00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.240 align:middle line:84%
The Crusader leaders
quickly made peace

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.520 align:middle line:84%
with the victorious
Mamluk Sultan of Egypt,

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.660 align:middle line:84%
but the Templars
and the Hospittalers

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:84%
refused to hand over their
lucrative Muslim prisoners

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:09.700 align:middle line:90%
of war.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.070 align:middle line:84%
The Mamluks
immediately retaliated.

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:17.340 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.134 align:middle line:84%
The Mamluk advance was slow,
but methodical and relentless.

00:24:21.134 --> 00:24:32.950 align:middle line:90%


00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:38.290 align:middle line:84%
>>The last campaigns of the
crusading epic in the Middle

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:42.645 align:middle line:84%
East, in the Holy Land, are
campaigns of siege warfare.

00:24:42.645 --> 00:24:44.790 align:middle line:84%
The Crusaders are
in their castles

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:46.350 align:middle line:84%
in their fortified
cities-- in fact,

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:47.975 align:middle line:84%
essentially in their
fortified cities--

00:24:47.975 --> 00:24:53.170 align:middle line:84%
we can almost forget the castles
in this last few decades,

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and the Muslim
armies are seeking

00:24:54.930 --> 00:25:01.000 align:middle line:84%
to take these powerfully
defended, strongly walled,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:84%
fortified cities
and a few castles.

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:04.720 align:middle line:90%


00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.190 align:middle line:90%
Siege warfare is slow.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.365 align:middle line:90%


00:25:09.365 --> 00:25:12.320 align:middle line:84%
The-- it's before
gunpowder, of course,

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:16.170 align:middle line:84%
so even though the Muslim armies
were extremely sophisticated

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.600 align:middle line:84%
in this kind of warfare,
it was a slow process.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.760 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.390 align:middle line:84%
>>In the early 1260s,
the Mamluk concentrated

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:30.450 align:middle line:90%
on the southern Christian lands.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:34.080 align:middle line:84%
In the late 1260s, they took
Antioch and the Templars

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.110 align:middle line:90%
abandoned the enclave.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.195 align:middle line:84%
In the 1270s, the
Tripoli enclave crumbled.

00:25:39.195 --> 00:25:44.380 align:middle line:90%


00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.600 align:middle line:84%
Only the arrival of
Prince Edward of England,

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.690 align:middle line:84%
the future Edward I, with
10,000 Mongol allies,

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:56.350 align:middle line:84%
enabled a decade long truce,
but before the truce was up,

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.520 align:middle line:84%
the Mamluks decided to
finish the Christians

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.861 align:middle line:90%
once and for all.

00:25:59.861 --> 00:26:04.440 align:middle line:90%


00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.980 align:middle line:84%
In 1290, the Mamluks
assembled 60,000 cavalry,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.700 align:middle line:84%
160,000 infantry, and 100
Mangonel siege engines

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.647 align:middle line:84%
around the Christian
capital of Acre.

00:26:14.647 --> 00:26:16.140 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:19.160 align:middle line:84%
The temple compound was
the last building to fall,

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and the grand master and
all the remaining Templars

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.580 align:middle line:90%
were killed in the fighting.

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.430 align:middle line:84%
On August 14, 1291,
the Knights Templars

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:84%
evacuated their last
standing castle at Atlit

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:34.460 align:middle line:84%
and set up their new
headquarters on Cyprus.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.030 align:middle line:84%
The Templar castle of
Atlit was the greatest

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:56.080 align:middle line:84%
they had ever built and had
never been taken by siege.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.130 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:00.530 align:middle line:84%
The Mamluks demolished it
so it could never again

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.230 align:middle line:84%
be used against the
forces of Islam.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:90%


00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.540 align:middle line:84%
The destruction of the last
Crusader stronghold in the Holy

00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Land was proof to
many in the west

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.646 align:middle line:84%
that God no longer
approved of such violence.

00:27:14.646 --> 00:27:19.800 align:middle line:90%


00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.930 align:middle line:84%
>>By the 13th century,
the crusading ideal

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:28.120 align:middle line:84%
was recognized as something of
a dream, an impossible dream.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:31.670 align:middle line:84%
There were many
who liked the idea

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:37.050 align:middle line:84%
as a sort of romantic, epic,
heroic, religious concept,

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:84%
but as far as large numbers
of the knightly elite,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.340 align:middle line:84%
the educated classes,
and the rising

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:51.150 align:middle line:84%
bourgeoisie of the towns wanting
to make sacrifices for this,

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.640 align:middle line:90%
the idea had become impractical.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.380 align:middle line:90%


00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think it would
be quite fair to say

00:27:58.270 --> 00:28:01.640 align:middle line:84%
that the Templars and the
other crusading orders

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:03.745 align:middle line:90%
were left high and dry.

00:28:03.745 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:90%


00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>>The Knights Templar
were now more vulnerable

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.030 align:middle line:84%
than they could
possibly imagine.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:16.160 align:middle line:84%
Their entire reason for being
was the defense Holy Land,

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.000 align:middle line:90%
and they had failed.

00:28:21.025 --> 00:28:24.260 align:middle line:84%
But the Templars were still an
order of the Catholic Church--

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.230 align:middle line:84%
any move against
the Templars would

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
be a direct assault
on the papacy itself.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.780 align:middle line:90%


00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.830 align:middle line:84%
While the Order of the Temple
mustered its forces once more

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:38.170 align:middle line:84%
for yet another Crusade
against the Muslims,

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:40.830 align:middle line:84%
storm clouds were
gathering back in Europe.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.790 align:middle line:90%


00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.520 align:middle line:84%
The Order of the
Temple of Solomon

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.760 align:middle line:84%
was about to find itself
caught in the middle

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.875 align:middle line:84%
of a cataclysmic
power struggle that

00:28:48.875 --> 00:28:53.240 align:middle line:84%
would shake Western
Europe to the very core.
