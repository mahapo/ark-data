>>The Order of the
Temple of Solomon

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.160 align:middle line:84%
had been founded in the
aftermath of the First Crusade,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.970 align:middle line:84%
a Christian military
expedition which

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.212 align:middle line:84%
had captured Jerusalem
from the Muslims.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.239 align:middle line:84%
The first Templars had
dedicated their lives to God

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.480 align:middle line:84%
by protecting
pilgrims, but the Order

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.800 align:middle line:84%
had soon proved itself to be
the most effective military unit

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.850 align:middle line:90%
in the crusading army.

At the Horns of Hattin,
the Templar knights

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.615 align:middle line:84%
had been singled out by
Saladin and almost eliminated

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:90%
from the Holy Land.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.700 align:middle line:84%
But in their short
60-year existence,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.850 align:middle line:84%
the Templars had constructed
an enormous support network

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.795 align:middle line:84%
throughout Western Europe
that provided the front line

00:01:42.795 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:90%
with men and supplies.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this
elite military unit

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:84%
had created for
itself the world's

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.105 align:middle line:90%

Since the Order of
the Temple had first

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.310 align:middle line:84%
been established early
in the 12th century,

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.590 align:middle line:84%
it had set out to attract
recruits and raise funds.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:84%
Although an individual
knight could own nothing,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.305 align:middle line:84%
he still needed horses,
weaponry, and servants

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:25.770 align:middle line:84%
if he was to carry out
God's work effectively.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.020 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.920 align:middle line:84%
The king of Jerusalem had
initially aided the Templars.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Among the many
reasons for doing so

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.140 align:middle line:84%
was the knowledge that visiting
pilgrims brought much needed

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:84%
income to the fledgling
Crusader states.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.772 align:middle line:84%
Pilgrims required food and
lodging, they paid road tolls,

00:02:47.772 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:90%
and they brought gifts.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
From the very
beginning, the Templars

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.570 align:middle line:84%
were entirely comfortable
with the economic realities

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.074 align:middle line:90%
of serving God in the Holy Land.

The Templar
corporation, or network,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.530 align:middle line:84%
began in Western
Europe, built up

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
from gifts of land donated
by men and women who

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
wanted to protect their
immortal souls by supporting

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.683 align:middle line:90%
the Crusaders in the Holy Land.

00:03:32.683 --> 00:03:37.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Many of the earliest donations
received by the Templars

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
were from men who wanted to
join the Order themselves.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.410 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
substantial donors

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.613 align:middle line:84%
came from Champagne
in Northern France.

00:03:51.613 --> 00:03:57.390 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:84%
>>Hugh Count of Champagne
joined the Order in the 1120s.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.730 align:middle line:10%
And he was one of its
earliest important patrons.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.760 align:middle line:84%
But once he joined the
Order, he lost the status

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.800 align:middle line:84%
that came with being an
important territorial ruler.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.490 align:middle line:84%
He had to abrogate his own
will to that of the Master.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:19.790 align:middle line:84%
And he had to live the
life of an ordinary knight.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.630 align:middle line:84%
So one gave up a considerable
amount, in terms of status

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
and in material comfort, in
order to become a Templar.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you sincerely believe
that what really matters

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:84%
is your immortal soul, and not
your short and transitory life

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.150 align:middle line:84%
on earth, then it would
be seen as worth it.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.900 align:middle line:84%
>>The Templars gratefully
accepted many such gifts

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.790 align:middle line:84%
of land, which were channelled
into productive communities

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
where the brothers in the
West lived and worked.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.540 align:middle line:84%
It was these communities,
called preceptories,

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
that became the bedrock
of the Templar network.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.440 align:middle line:84%
>>I think that the Templars
gave a good deal of thought

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.330 align:middle line:84%
to the best way of exploiting
their Western preceptories

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.850 align:middle line:84%
for the purposes of supporting
their military front line.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's not entirely easy
to do this consistently,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.586 align:middle line:84%
since by their very nature,
donations tend to be random.

00:05:23.586 --> 00:05:25.810 align:middle line:84%
As time went on,
they tried quite

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.910 align:middle line:84%
hard to rationalize
their holdings

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.300 align:middle line:84%
in a way which would
make them more effective.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And even, in some
areas, to provide

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.426 align:middle line:84%
preceptories which were rather
specialist-- perhaps specialist

00:05:39.426 --> 00:05:43.990 align:middle line:84%
in banking or in stud
farms or in providing

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.995 align:middle line:90%
shipping and so on.

00:05:45.995 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.030 align:middle line:84%
>>A typical rural preceptory of
the Templars usually comprised

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.850 align:middle line:84%
of farmland centered
around to manor house,

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.960 align:middle line:84%
with any numbers of barns,
stables, and outhouses

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.080 align:middle line:84%
depending on the size
and location of the farm.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.080 align:middle line:84%
No entire preceptories
remain today,

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
but many individual
buildings do.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.790 align:middle line:84%
These enormous barns were
constructed by the Knights

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Templar more than 800 years ago.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.950 align:middle line:84%
The aim of all Templar
preceptories was to make money.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:84%
A third of all income went to
the knights on the frontier.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.030 align:middle line:84%
Every donation, large
or small, was fully

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.920 align:middle line:90%
exploited for maximum revenue.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.100 align:middle line:90%


00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:84%
If they were given
unused land, they

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.170 align:middle line:90%
had it settled and cultivated.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:41.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:43.580 align:middle line:84%
New mills, wine
presses, and ovens

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.185 align:middle line:84%
were constructed to soak up
the extra agricultural produce.

00:06:47.185 --> 00:06:49.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.585 align:middle line:84%
And new village and town
markets were created.

00:06:51.585 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:90%


00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.990 align:middle line:84%
In this way, the economy
of an entire region

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.295 align:middle line:90%
could steadily be boosted.

00:06:58.295 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:90%


00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.750 align:middle line:84%
But it also meant
that the Templars

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
could take economic
control of whole areas

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.158 align:middle line:84%
as they bought up
businesses and land.

00:07:08.158 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.910 align:middle line:84%
In the Champagne town of
Prova, the Knights Templar

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.340 align:middle line:84%
would eventually own
more than 70 properties.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.730 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were always
improving their market

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.870 align:middle line:84%
position, and their
dominance always

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:84%
caused considerable resentment
among both peasants and land

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:90%
holders.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.800 align:middle line:84%
To their rivals, the Templars
had one particularly unfair

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
advantage: their holdings
were exempt taxes or tithes.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.570 align:middle line:84%
>>It was normal
for the population,

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.700 align:middle line:84%
in one form or
another, to pay tithes.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.020 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were granted
an exemption from tithe

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:59.540 align:middle line:84%
on the land they acquired, which
enabled them to grow, perhaps,

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:02.080 align:middle line:84%
more rapidly than they
would have done before.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:06.975 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, they are
not paying the proportion

00:08:06.975 --> 00:08:13.160 align:middle line:84%
of their income into the
church, which you might normally

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:84%
have expected them
to have to do.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:84%
Again, the justification
here is that the money

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.530 align:middle line:84%
is being contributed
towards the church.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.930 align:middle line:84%
It's been contributed
towards the Holy War.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:84%
I think, inevitably, however,
when somebody gets a privilege,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.880 align:middle line:84%
somebody else
objects to the fact

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:90%
that they have a privilege.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:35.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:84%
>>Within 30 years
of its foundation,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.780 align:middle line:84%
the Temple was managing
farms and urban properties

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:43.095 align:middle line:84%
throughout France, England,
and much of Europe.

00:08:43.095 --> 00:08:44.169 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
They had a European headquarters
in Paris and London.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Many of the Templar properties
on the Iberian Peninsula

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:56.226 align:middle line:84%
were fortified, as the Muslims
retained a strong presence

00:08:56.226 --> 00:08:57.225 align:middle line:90%
on the Spanish mainland.

00:08:57.225 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.570 align:middle line:84%
The Templar network provided
security and lodgings

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.100 align:middle line:84%
all along the main
trade routes of Europe,

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.858 align:middle line:90%
as well as to the Holy Land.

00:09:08.858 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Some of their most
important offices

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:84%
were at the main
Mediterranean ports.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:25.280 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:84%
The Temple was involved in
shipping from its earliest

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.040 align:middle line:90%
days.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.290 align:middle line:84%
It had soon extended
its role from protecting

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
the pilgrims in the
East to protecting

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:90%
pilgrims traveling to the East.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.500 align:middle line:84%
The Order constructed
an early travel agency,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.950 align:middle line:84%
providing pilgrims with not
just security, but transport

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:43.700 align:middle line:90%
and accommodation.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.620 align:middle line:84%
At first, the Order
had chartered vessels

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:84%
from the great seafaring
cities of Italy.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But once again,
the Temple decided

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:90%
to improve its market position.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:00.530 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.100 align:middle line:10%
It built its own
ships and consolidated

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:10%
its long-distance
travel business,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:10%
an industry it had helped to
create in the first place.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.840 align:middle line:84%
One of the Temple's most
important income generating

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.850 align:middle line:84%
regions was on the main access
linking the great Mediterranean

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:29.807 align:middle line:84%
and northern European
trading zones.

00:10:29.807 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.420 align:middle line:84%
The Champagne region of France,
one of the Temple heartlands,

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
was a bridge between
north and south Europe.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:46.920 align:middle line:84%
It was here that enormous
trade fairs developed,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%
which ushered in the dawn
of international business.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:11:00.592 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.592 --> 00:11:02.930 align:middle line:84%
The great trade
fairs of Champagne

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.310 align:middle line:84%
saw the exchange of goods
from all over Europe,

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
which the Templars could
not fail to benefit from.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:84%
The economic boom also triggered
a financial revolution,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.570 align:middle line:84%
which saw the birth
of modern banking.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.780 align:middle line:84%
The Templars were well-placed
to enter the world of banking.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:84%
They had offices
all over Europe.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.150 align:middle line:84%
And their continuous
state of warfare

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.720 align:middle line:84%
had given the Templars
the experience

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.780 align:middle line:90%
of handling large sums of money.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:33.761 align:middle line:90%


00:11:33.761 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:84%
>>One of the reasons why the
Templars were effective bankers

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.460 align:middle line:90%
was that people trusted them.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And they trusted them not only
because of their integrity,

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.810 align:middle line:84%
but also because they
had the physical means

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.310 align:middle line:84%
to defend the money
which they held.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.680 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:84%
They had castles, and
they had armed men

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.530 align:middle line:84%
who could accompany any
movement of actual specie

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.595 align:middle line:90%
if that was required.

00:11:57.595 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And they maintained
their reputation

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:09.200 align:middle line:84%
for paying when required
and for honest dealing.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.026 align:middle line:84%
And in that sense,
therefore, the Templars

00:12:12.026 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:90%
were successful as bankers.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.530 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:18.560 align:middle line:84%
The Templar Bank in Paris
performed most of the functions

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that one would associate with
a modern bank, it made loans.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.450 align:middle line:90%
You could deposit money there.

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%
It actually had
an open cash desk,

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.465 align:middle line:84%
which was open many
days of the year,

00:12:30.465 --> 00:12:35.840 align:middle line:84%
particularly when it was most
needed at times when payments

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.580 align:middle line:84%
were being made at the end
of the harvest and so on.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.120 align:middle line:90%


00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.470 align:middle line:84%
It kept separate
accounts for people.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.805 align:middle line:84%
It was involved in the
transfer of currencies.

00:12:45.805 --> 00:12:47.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.640 align:middle line:90%
It was involved in investment.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:52.950 align:middle line:84%
So most of the functions
you would associate

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.840 align:middle line:84%
with a modern bank can be
seen, at least in the Templar

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.010 align:middle line:84%
banks in Paris and
in London, and also

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:84%
in a number of other
places, as well.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:84%
They also, perhaps,
went beyond some

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:84%
of the functions
of a modern bank.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.500 align:middle line:84%
You could say that they
were performing functions

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:84%
you would associate with
a modern accountancy

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.235 align:middle line:84%
firm, in that they would
audit the account of the King

00:13:15.235 --> 00:13:16.235 align:middle line:90%
of France, for instance.

00:13:16.235 --> 00:13:20.702 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.702 --> 00:13:22.580 align:middle line:90%
[CHURCH BELLS RINGING]

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>>The Templars'
unparalleled financial

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.410 align:middle line:84%
acumen and entrepreneurial drive
had brought the warrior monks

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.270 align:middle line:90%
untold wealth.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.310 align:middle line:84%
The Order had risen to the
very pinnacle of society.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't just work
for the French crown.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:40.170 align:middle line:84%
The Templars provided
security and financial advice

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:84%
to most of Europe's
great rulers,

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.615 align:middle line:84%
including the King of
England and the Pope.

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.420 align:middle line:84%
But for many observers,
there was a difference

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.060 align:middle line:84%
between what the Templars
were supposed to be,

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
poor knights of Christ
battling with the infidel,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and what they appeared
to be, hugely wealthy

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
aristocrats with
royal connections.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:09.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Although a third of all revenue
provided by the Templar network

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:84%
was sent to the East,
few ordinary people

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.830 align:middle line:84%
ever saw their Holy
Land activities.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:21.510 align:middle line:84%
All most people ever
heard about the Crusades

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.320 align:middle line:84%
was a growing catalog of
defeat and humiliation.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:28.040 align:middle line:90%


00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
The Crusaders had lost
the Christian holy sites,

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.375 align:middle line:84%
which was the primary aim
of the Knights Templar.

00:14:33.375 --> 00:14:36.170 align:middle line:90%


00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.535 align:middle line:84%
Their frequent setbacks in the
Holy Land made many suspicious.

00:14:39.535 --> 00:14:40.540 align:middle line:90%


00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:84%
How could they
justify such riches

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:45.010 align:middle line:84%
when they were supposed to
be poor knights battling

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.810 align:middle line:90%
Islam for the love of God alone?

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:50.760 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.690 align:middle line:84%
For years, medieval
chroniclers had

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.660 align:middle line:84%
suspected that financial motives
affected all Templar behavior

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.180 align:middle line:90%
in the Holy Land.

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.720 align:middle line:84%
A castle siege
might be interpreted

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.020 align:middle line:90%
as a bid for gold and plunder.

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:08.150 align:middle line:84%
Or a refusal to join an assault
could be seen as saving costs.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.225 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.225 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:84%
There were many such
controversial incidents.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.770 align:middle line:90%


00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.370 align:middle line:84%
>>One of these is the
capture of a man called

00:15:18.370 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Nasir el Din, who was
fleeing from a failed

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
political coup in Egypt
in 1154, was captured

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:31.891 align:middle line:84%
by the Latin
Christians, and was put

00:15:31.891 --> 00:15:33.265 align:middle line:84%
into the custody
of the Templars.

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:34.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:84%
The Templars then sold him
back to his political enemies

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:44.200 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt for a large sum,
and he was killed by the mob.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:45.840 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.160 align:middle line:84%
The story that is told
by some chroniclers

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.100 align:middle line:84%
is that this man, however, was
interested in being converted

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.325 align:middle line:90%
to Christianity.

00:15:55.325 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And this doesn't go down
very well on the Templars.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:01.580 align:middle line:84%
It looks as if they're
more interested in gaining

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.775 align:middle line:84%
the ransom money
than in conversion.

00:16:04.775 --> 00:16:09.350 align:middle line:90%


00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>>But the Templars did
not always take the money.

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Soon after their construction
of a new castle on the Jordan

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:18.160 align:middle line:84%
frontier, they
received a visitor.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:28.250 align:middle line:10%
>>The Muslim leader
Saladin came and tried

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:32.885 align:middle line:10%
to purchase the
castle from France.

00:16:32.885 --> 00:16:38.020 align:middle line:84%
He offered them a huge sum
of money, 60,000 gold coins.

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And the Knights Templar
refused to sell the castle.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.620 align:middle line:90%


00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:84%
He granted his offer
to 100,000 gold coins.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And the Knights
Templar, as usual,

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.730 align:middle line:90%
boldly refused the offer.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:58.910 align:middle line:84%
They didn't know that
within a few months

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:03.850 align:middle line:84%
not only that they will
lose the 100,000 gold coins,

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.504 align:middle line:84%
they'll lose the castle
and their lives, as well.

00:17:07.504 --> 00:17:19.099 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>The Templars obsession with
raising money was well-founded.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.660 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And their cautious
policy in the East

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.970 align:middle line:90%
was based on a simple formula.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:27.060 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Before the Battle of
Hattin, it took the income

00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:84%
from 30 manor farms
to equip and maintain

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.772 align:middle line:84%
one single knight
in the Holy Land.

00:17:35.772 --> 00:17:38.620 align:middle line:84%
More than 200 had
died at Hattin.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.055 align:middle line:84%
Within a few decades, the cost
would have risen five-fold.

00:17:42.055 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>>The Templars needed to
translate their economic empire

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:59.060 align:middle line:84%
into a military machine
of some kind, which

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.920 align:middle line:90%
was very, very expensive.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:09.470 align:middle line:84%
The numbers of knights
probably amounted to 600.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Each of those knights
needed to have four horses.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:17.050 align:middle line:84%
In addition, there were
probably another 2,000,

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:84%
2,500 sergeants, or serving
brothers, some of whom fought,

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and many more people who acted
as part of the general support

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.810 align:middle line:84%
system, like squires,
servants, cooks.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.885 align:middle line:84%
And also a limited
number of clerics.

00:18:34.885 --> 00:18:39.290 align:middle line:84%
So there's a large amount of--
a large number of men and horses

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and other animals that
you needed to pay for.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So the costs of
this are immense.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.139 align:middle line:84%
Which is why, in
the 13th century,

00:18:48.139 --> 00:18:50.680 align:middle line:84%
the Templars have got to exploit
their lands to their fullest

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.180 align:middle line:90%
extent.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.190 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:56.310 align:middle line:84%
This in turn, of course, can
sometimes lead to unpopularity,

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.660 align:middle line:84%
particularly if there's
no military success

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.520 align:middle line:84%
to show for all this
vast expenditure.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But like most
merchant machines, it

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.900 align:middle line:84%
seems as if money is being
thrown down a bottomless pit,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.722 align:middle line:84%
to those people who are
being forced to pay for it.

00:19:09.722 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.640 align:middle line:84%
>>A Crusader knight's
single most expensive item

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.950 align:middle line:90%
was his horse.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:25.030 align:middle line:84%
The Templar force
in the Holy Land

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.592 align:middle line:84%
would have required about
4,000 horses, most of which

00:19:28.592 --> 00:19:30.300 align:middle line:84%
would have come from
the Western network.

00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.300 align:middle line:84%
The Muslims understood
the economy of war

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.850 align:middle line:90%
as well as the Templars.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And in battle, targeted
to Crusaders' horses.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.100 align:middle line:10%
>>In some of the sources,
even the contemporary sources,

00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.111 align:middle line:10%
the Turkish and Saracen
habit of attacking the horses

00:19:57.111 --> 00:19:58.610 align:middle line:10%
was regarded, almost,
as unsporting.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Now this has being picked up
in the 19th century and even

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:07.796 align:middle line:84%
today, as somehow,
they-- the Turks

00:20:07.796 --> 00:20:09.605 align:middle line:84%
and the Saracens--
are being devious.

00:20:09.605 --> 00:20:11.480 align:middle line:90%


00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I have to say, this
is somewhat unfair,

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.670 align:middle line:84%
because they're entering
battle to win the battle.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you can defeat
your enemy by injuring

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:84%
his horse or his horses,
or frightening his horses,

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:26.030 align:middle line:90%
you don't have to kill the man.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:30.240 align:middle line:84%
You're not there, as far as a
Saracenic warrior is concerned,

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.890 align:middle line:90%
to achieve personal glory.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:84%
You're there as a
professional soldier

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.000 align:middle line:84%
with a rather modern attitude
towards the job in hand,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.740 align:middle line:90%
and that is to succeed.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:90%


00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:51.210 align:middle line:84%
>>Saladin's capture
of Jerusalem had

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.870 align:middle line:84%
triggered a wave of crusading
enthusiasm throughout Europe.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.850 align:middle line:90%


00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:59.080 align:middle line:84%
The Holy City would
once again be the target

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.683 align:middle line:90%
of a major Christian expedition.

00:21:00.683 --> 00:21:01.980 align:middle line:90%


00:21:01.980 --> 00:21:04.410 align:middle line:84%
For the Templars,
the new Crusade

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:84%
was the first
opportunity since Hattin

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
to translate its massive
economic resources

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:11.705 align:middle line:90%
into a military machine.

00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:24.730 align:middle line:90%


00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:29.214 align:middle line:84%
The Order of the Temple was
integral to the Third Crusade,

00:21:29.214 --> 00:21:31.380 align:middle line:84%
led by the King of England
Richard of the Lionheart,

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:33.410 align:middle line:90%
and Philip II of France.

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:43.040 align:middle line:90%


00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:10%
The remnants of the crusade
estate in the Holy Land,

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:10%
on the arrival of
the Third Crusade,

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.280 align:middle line:10%
existed around the
three remaining cities:

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:10%
Antioch, Tripoli, and Tyre-- all
supported by sea from Sicily.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.810 align:middle line:84%
Richard joined Philip II
and the resident crusaders

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.160 align:middle line:84%
already besieging
the port of Acre,

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:10.150 align:middle line:84%
which they captured
in July 1191.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:12.880 align:middle line:10%
The Crusaders then began
the march on Jerusalem

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.476 align:middle line:10%
and set off down the coast.

00:22:14.476 --> 00:22:17.200 align:middle line:10%
A fleet shadowed
their every move,

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.816 align:middle line:10%
providing supplies
and reinforcements.

00:22:18.816 --> 00:22:20.350 align:middle line:10%


00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:24.190 align:middle line:10%
The army was constantly
harried by Saladin's forces,

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:28.471 align:middle line:10%
but the Crusaders made progress,
clawing back Haifa and then

00:22:28.471 --> 00:22:28.970 align:middle line:10%
Caesarea.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:34.830 align:middle line:90%


00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:10%
On the road to Arsur,
Saladin attacked in strength.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.580 align:middle line:10%
The Crusaders lined up with
the discipline military orders

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.620 align:middle line:10%
in the vital stations.

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.562 align:middle line:10%
The Muslim attack was driven
off by a powerful crusader

00:22:47.562 --> 00:22:48.145 align:middle line:10%
counterattack.

00:22:48.145 --> 00:22:49.870 align:middle line:10%


00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:52.260 align:middle line:10%
Richard's victory
over Saladin meant

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.640 align:middle line:10%
the crusade estate was once
more firmly established

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.420 align:middle line:10%
in the Holy Land.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:10%
Richard took Jaffa,
but Jerusalem itself

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.000 align:middle line:10%
was just too vulnerable
to Muslim attacks.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.800 align:middle line:90%


00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:84%
The Templars had played
an essential role

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:11.040 align:middle line:84%
in the Third Crusade,
providing logistical support,

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.290 align:middle line:84%
but, mainly, as a coherent
discipline military outfit

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:17.880 align:middle line:84%
Richard I could rely
on at all times.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:90%


00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>>Whatever his many faults,
Richard did commit resources

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and, indeed, risked his own
life and health many times

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.360 align:middle line:90%
for the cause of the Crusades.

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think he discerned the
Templars were equally prepared

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.580 align:middle line:90%
to make that commitment.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:37.270 align:middle line:84%
The Master of the Templar,
Gerard de Ridefort, died.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.010 align:middle line:84%
There was a vacancy
in the Mastership.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:40.210 align:middle line:90%


00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And Richard wished to extend
his influence in that direction,

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.264 align:middle line:84%
and managed to secure
the election of one

00:23:47.264 --> 00:23:51.020 align:middle line:84%
of his own vassals, a man called
Robert of Sable, as Master.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And from then on,
there was a kind

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:56.529 align:middle line:84%
of close link between
the Temple and Richard.

00:23:56.529 --> 00:23:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And they became a
very important part

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:03.320 align:middle line:84%
of his army after the taking
of Acre and the march south

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.702 align:middle line:84%
towards, supposedly,
towards Jerusalem,

00:24:05.702 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:84%
but which never, in
fact, took Jerusalem.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:15.100 align:middle line:90%


00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.380 align:middle line:84%
>>Richard the Lionhearted
travelled to withing sight

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.643 align:middle line:90%
of the Holy City.

00:24:18.643 --> 00:24:21.890 align:middle line:84%
But taking advice from
his military advisers,

00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:24.385 align:middle line:84%
including the
cautious Templars, he

00:24:24.385 --> 00:24:26.890 align:middle line:84%
had decided not to risk
an attack on the city.

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:90%


00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:33.820 align:middle line:84%
One year later, Richard
negotiated a treaty

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:36.970 align:middle line:84%
with Saladin, which
allowed Christian pilgrims

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:84%
to visit the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:25:01.010 align:middle line:90%


00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Although the Third
Crusade had failed

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.650 align:middle line:84%
to gain control of Jerusalem,
the victories of Richard I

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.100 align:middle line:84%
had rejuvenated
the Crusader states

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and given the Christians
a firm foundation

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.690 align:middle line:90%
from which to begin expansion.

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:16.970 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:21.180 align:middle line:84%
The Templars immediately began
an enormous building program

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:22.555 align:middle line:90%
that would continue for decades.

00:25:22.555 --> 00:25:24.880 align:middle line:90%


00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.460 align:middle line:84%
The Templars created
their new headquarters

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.490 align:middle line:84%
in the Port of
Acre, which became

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:middle line:84%
the new capital of the
Christian Holy Land

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.615 align:middle line:84%
for the military orders and
the Italian trading cities.

00:25:34.615 --> 00:25:38.560 align:middle line:90%


00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
Much of the Hospitallers'
compound exists today.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.100 align:middle line:84%
But little remains of
Acre's Templar quarter.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:48.700 align:middle line:90%


00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:52.130 align:middle line:84%
This enormous tunnel,
constructed beneath the city,

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
is just one testament to
the effort and resources

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.310 align:middle line:84%
the Knights Templar must
have invested in the East.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:01.740 align:middle line:90%


00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.360 align:middle line:84%
When Saladin died in
1193, the Islamic world

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.930 align:middle line:84%
once more crumbled
into disunity.

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.170 align:middle line:84%
Islam's failure to unite
against the Christians

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.940 align:middle line:84%
would buy the Crusaders
much needed breathing space.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.700 align:middle line:90%


00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:84%
But the Christians
could never entirely

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:19.535 align:middle line:90%
rely on Muslim divisions.

00:26:19.535 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:26.420 align:middle line:84%
For the Templars, recent
success came with a price.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.380 align:middle line:84%
The massive investment needed
to man and fortify the newly

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.137 align:middle line:84%
recovered lands meant expanding
the network, a corporation that

00:26:33.137 --> 00:26:34.848 align:middle line:90%
was growing evermore unpopular.

00:26:34.848 --> 00:26:40.590 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:45.220 align:middle line:84%
>>The Templars' reputation
tended to take a bit of a knock

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.750 align:middle line:84%
back in Europe, rather
than in the Middle East.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Because back in
Europe is where they

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:55.670 align:middle line:84%
are coming to be seen as
rich, almost money-grubbing.

00:26:55.670 --> 00:26:59.070 align:middle line:84%
They became bankers, and
nobody likes bankers.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.390 align:middle line:84%
So there was a
jealousy, a resentment.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.570 align:middle line:84%
But this is not
immediately transferred

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:06.910 align:middle line:84%
through those who are stationed
out there on the frontier,

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.440 align:middle line:84%
manning the castle
walls, and so on.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:12.435 align:middle line:90%


00:27:12.435 --> 00:27:15.390 align:middle line:84%
>>One place where the
Templars unpopularity actually

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:84%
deteriorated into violence
was on the island of Cyprus.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:19.780 align:middle line:90%


00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.850 align:middle line:84%
In an awesome display of
their wealth and resources,

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.360 align:middle line:84%
the Templars had purchased
this entire country

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.965 align:middle line:84%
from King Richard, who had
conquered the island en route

00:27:27.965 --> 00:27:28.770 align:middle line:90%
to Palestine.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.200 align:middle line:90%


00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:34.430 align:middle line:84%
>>However, Richard realized that
he couldn't govern it himself,

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.630 align:middle line:90%
and he couldn't hold it himself.

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, he
turned to the Templars

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:41.435 align:middle line:84%
as possible rulers
of this island.

00:27:41.435 --> 00:27:42.780 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And he sold the
island to the Templars

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.275 align:middle line:90%
for a large sum of money.

00:27:46.275 --> 00:27:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
the Templars never

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:52.190 align:middle line:84%
committed sufficient troops
and resources to governing it.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:84%
And after quite a
short time, there

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.910 align:middle line:84%
was a revolt, which
the Templars survived,

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.160 align:middle line:84%
but which they--
which was enough

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.370 align:middle line:84%
to deter them from wanting
to hold it any longer.

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.790 align:middle line:90%


00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.460 align:middle line:84%
The Cyprus is a very
interesting case,

00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:10.770 align:middle line:84%
because had the Templars
taken it more seriously

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:15.725 align:middle line:84%
as a resource, it could have
been the first semi-sovereign

00:28:15.725 --> 00:28:19.380 align:middle line:84%
or sovereign state ruled
by a military order.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.830 align:middle line:84%
It never came out like
that, but it could've been.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:26.450 align:middle line:90%


00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>>However hard the
knights struggled

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:31.540 align:middle line:84%
to justify the vast funds
needed to reconstruct and man

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:34.190 align:middle line:84%
the defenses of the
Holy Land, the Templars

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:36.650 align:middle line:84%
would never fully
shake off the suspicion

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:39.959 align:middle line:84%
that they cared more for the
acquisition of gold and riches

00:28:39.959 --> 00:28:41.500 align:middle line:84%
than they did for
the land of Christ.

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.560 align:middle line:90%


00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.790 align:middle line:84%
In reality, whether the
Templars believed it or not,

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:90%
the equation was simple.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.310 align:middle line:84%
If they could not maintain
the Crusader states,

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.170 align:middle line:84%
there was no reason
for their existence.

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.000 align:middle line:90%


00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.250 align:middle line:84%
The Templars' credibility
depended entirely

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.210 align:middle line:84%
on the survival of a
Christian Holy Land.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:04.210 align:middle line:90%
