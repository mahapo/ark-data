00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
TO TRANSCEND
THE CURRENT PARADIGM?

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.050 align:middle line:84%
THE PEOPLE HERE
HAVE THE COHERENCE

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.050 align:middle line:90%
TO RECEIVE THE MESSAGE

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:18.860 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE THE MESSAGE IS SO SIMPLE

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.930 align:middle line:90%
THAT IT REQUIRES US TO BELIEVE

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE GREATEST SOLUTIONS
TO OUR GREATEST QUESTIONS

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:31.900 align:middle line:90%
ARE STARING AT US IN THE FACE.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.980 align:middle line:84%
-WHAT MICHAEL WAS TALKING ABOUT
WAS QUITE SIMPLE,

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.650 align:middle line:84%
BUT IT WAS FAR
FROM A SMALL IDEA.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:42.750 align:middle line:84%
THE ONLY THING
HE WOULD CONCERN HIMSELF WITH

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:90%
WAS POINTING OUT THE ELEPHANT.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:84%
AND I BARELY HEARD HIM
SPEAK ABOUT SPECIFICS.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:51.060 align:middle line:84%
HE KNEW THAT SPECIFICS
ARE PART OF THE EFFECT,

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:52.990 align:middle line:84%
AND HE SIMPLY AIMS
TO PRODUCE THE CAUSE

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
THAT ALLOWS FOR THE SPECIFICS
TO BE SEEN.

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:59.670 align:middle line:84%
IT BECAME CLEAR
THAT WHAT HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.970 align:middle line:90%
WAS NOT SOMETHING LIMITED

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.000 align:middle line:84%
TO WHAT WE WERE SEEING
AT BURNING MAN,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.170 align:middle line:84%
BUT RATHER BURNING MAN
AS A SYMPTOM

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:84%
OF A SPONTANEOUS GLOBAL SHIFT
IN ATTENTION.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:90%
WHEREAS 50 YEARS AGO,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:84%
THE THOUGHT
OF WORLD TRANSFORMATION

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:84%
WAS ONLY CONCEIVABLE
THROUGH WARS,

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:90%
WORLD LEADERS, AND CATACLYSMS.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:90%
AND THEN, 10 YEARS LATER,

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.790 align:middle line:84%
THE CONFLICT BETWEEN
THE UNITED STATES

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.060 align:middle line:84%
AND NORTH VIETNAM
BECAME THE CATALYST

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:84%
FOR PEOPLE TO HOLD
LARGE GATHERINGS

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.660 align:middle line:90%
OF RADICAL SELF-EXPRESSION.

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:84%
THIS SAME PHENOMENA EMERGED
IN ANCIENT GREECE,

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:34.100 align:middle line:84%
WHICH WAS CALLED
THE DIONYSIAN MYSTERIES.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.840 align:middle line:84%
PEOPLE FLED TO REMOTE LOCATIONS
AND EXPLORED FREE LOVE,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:90%
SEXUALITY WITHOUT GUILT,

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:42.210 align:middle line:90%
MIND-ALTERING SUBSTANCES,

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.040 align:middle line:90%
SINGING, DANCING, AND THE ARTS.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.280 align:middle line:84%
IN THOSE MOMENTS
WHERE MORALS ARE STRETCHED,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.820 align:middle line:84%
CIVIL EXPECTATIONS
ARE ABANDONED,

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:53.690 align:middle line:84%
AND ALL LIMITS TO THE MIND
ARE OBLITERATED,

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:55.590 align:middle line:90%
IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.620 align:middle line:84%
HOW NARROW OUR APPROACH
TO REALITY TRULY IS.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.860 align:middle line:84%
HOWEVER, PSYCHEDELICS
AND OPPRESSIVE GOVERNMENTS

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.660 align:middle line:90%
ARE ONLY CATALYSTS.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.470 align:middle line:84%
NONE OF THEM ARE THE CAUSE
OF LARGE-SCALE TRANSFORMATION.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.740 align:middle line:90%
THE CAUSE IS THE FLOW OF LIFE,

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.710 align:middle line:84%
THAT EVER-CHANGING AND RAPIDLY
MOVING SOURCE OF "IT"...

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.640 align:middle line:84%
THAT UNNAMEABLE INTUITION
THAT GUIDES YOUR ATTENTION

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:84%
TOWARDS THE THING
THAT INSPIRES YOU

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:84%
RATHER THAN THE ONE
THAT BORES YOU.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.550 align:middle line:90%
WE DON'T LISTEN TO IT OFTEN

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.750 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE WE HAVE TOO MANY AGENDAS
FIXED INTO OUR DAY.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.260 align:middle line:90%
NO ROOM FOR EXPLORATION.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.060 align:middle line:84%
WE LEAVE NO TIME
FOR EXPERIMENTATION.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:36.260 align:middle line:90%
NO MORE PLAY.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:84%
WE DISMISS IT
BECAUSE THE ROUTINE WE'RE IN.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.000 align:middle line:84%
SOMETHING LIKE, "NO,
I CAN'T TAKE THIS PHONE CALL.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.710 align:middle line:84%
"IT'S 9:00, AND THAT'S WHEN
I BRUSH MY TEETH, GO TO BED,

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:84%
WAKE UP, AND DO THE EXACT SAME
THING I DO EVERY DAY."

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:53.850 align:middle line:84%
DRAMATIC EXAMPLE,
BUT I KNOW YOU'RE FAMILIAR.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:57.120 align:middle line:90%
THIS FLOW OF LIFE, IT'S A RIVER.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:01.390 align:middle line:84%
THE FLOW IS ALWAYS CHANGING,
ALWAYS MOVING,

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.760 align:middle line:84%
ALWAYS CARRYING THE STORY
FORWARD.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:07.060 align:middle line:84%
IT'S HARD TO PUT INTO WORDS
EXACTLY

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.700 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE THE RIVER IS NOT
SOMETHING YOU CAN MEASURE,

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.200 align:middle line:90%
NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN TOUCH.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:90%
IT'S NOT TANGIBLE.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.870 align:middle line:84%
THINGS ARE ALWAYS HAPPENING
ON THIS PLANET.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
THE ONLY THING YOU CAN RELY ON
IS THAT ALL THINGS WILL CHANGE.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.280 align:middle line:90%
THE RIVERBED MAY CHANGE,

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.580 align:middle line:84%
BUT THE WATER WILL NEVER BE
THE SAME AGAIN.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:32.380 align:middle line:84%
THE SPONTANEOUS EMERGENCE
OF PEOPLE EVERYWHERE,

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:35.990 align:middle line:84%
SINGING, DANCING,
PRODUCING REVOLUTIONARY ART,

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:40.030 align:middle line:84%
EXPLORING THE BOUNDARIES
OF LOVE, SEX, AND RELATIONSHIPS,

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.830 align:middle line:90%
AND JUST CELEBRATING BEING ALIVE

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:84%
IS ONLY AS PREDICTABLE
AS THE TIDES OF THE OCEAN.

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.270 align:middle line:90%
NONE OF THE WATER IS THE SAME,

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.500 align:middle line:84%
AND EACH WAVE IS AS UNIQUE
AS A FINGERPRINT.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:54.970 align:middle line:84%
BUT THE TIDE IS PART
OF SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:04.250 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S AN OVERLYING THING
THAT GOES ON HERE AT BURNING MAN

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.720 align:middle line:90%
WHICH EVERYBODY SEES.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.590 align:middle line:84%
IT'S ALL THE LIGHTS,
IT'S ALL THE CHAOS,

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.720 align:middle line:84%
ALL THE MUSIC,
EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:90%
THE THING THAT I DISCOVERED --

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.590 align:middle line:84%
AND IT TOOK ME TWO, THREE DAYS
TO DISCOVER HERE --

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:middle line:84%
IS THE UNDERLYING TONE OF IT,
WHICH IS SYNCHRONICITY.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.070 align:middle line:84%
THINGS JUST SEEM
TO MAGICALLY HAPPEN HERE.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:90%
IT'S AS IF MAGIC IS BRED HERE.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:24.940 align:middle line:84%
EVERYWHERE YOU GO, PEOPLE ARE
PUTTING ON THEIR FAVORITE MUSIC,

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:84%
SETTING UP
THEIR FAVORITE ENVIRONMENT,

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:84%
AND INVITING PEOPLE IN, SAYING,
"COME AND ENJOY YOURSELVES HERE.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
"LET ME SHOW YOU
HOW I ENJOY MYSELF,"

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:35.310 align:middle line:84%
AND, "I'LL CREATE
THAT WORLD FOR YOU."

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:90%
AND THEN YOU STEP ONE CAMP DOWN

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:84%
AND IT'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT THING.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.690 align:middle line:84%
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"HERE, COME IN AND JOIN.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.150 align:middle line:90%
"FOOD, FREE. DRINKS, FREE.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:middle line:84%
"JUST ENJOY THIS SPACE
THAT WE SET UP FOR YOU."

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.530 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS A FESTIVAL
WHERE THE ORGANIZERS

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
SET UP SOMETHING
WHERE 70,000 PEOPLE COME,

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:51.400 align:middle line:90%
AND INSTEAD OF SAYING,

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.870 align:middle line:84%
"HERE, WATCH ALL THE BANDS
THAT WE SET UP FOR YOU,

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:84%
WATCH ALL THE THINGS
THAT WE SET UP FOR YOU,"

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.470 align:middle line:90%
THEY SET THIS UP AND SAY,

00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:59.810 align:middle line:84%
"YOU GUYS DO WHAT YOU WANT TO
DO, AND WE'RE GONNA WATCH."

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.040 align:middle line:84%
I THINK THAT'S THE MOST
BRILLIANT THING IN THE WORLD.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE, YEAH, 70,000 PEOPLE
WANT TO COME OUT HERE

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.610 align:middle line:84%
AND BE THEMSELVES,
NOT JUST NECESSARILY BE WITNESS

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:84%
TO SOMETHING
THAT'S SEPARATE FROM THEM.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.720 align:middle line:84%
EVERYBODY IS ABOUT A GIFT
MENTALITY, NOT A MENTALITY

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:84%
OF "WHAT AM I GONNA GET
OUT OF DOING THIS FOR YOU?"

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:15.590 align:middle line:90%
TYPE OF DEAL.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:84%
EVERYBODY HERE,
THEY WANT TO SHARE

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.190 align:middle line:84%
HOW GOOD THEY FEEL
ON A DAILY BASIS,

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.660 align:middle line:90%
AND HOW GOOD YOU CAN FEEL

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:84%
WHEN YOU JUST REALLY LET GO
AND BE YOURSELF.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.340 align:middle line:90%
THIS IS A SHOW ABOUT ART

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.270 align:middle line:84%
AND ITS UNIQUE ABILITY
TO INSPIRE THE WORLD

00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:84%
AWAY FROM COMPLACENCY,
OUT OF APATHY,

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.140 align:middle line:84%
AND INTO A CONTINUAL FLOW
OF NEW EXPERIENCES.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:41.950 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S NOT MUCH
SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:84%
FOR WHAT INSPIRATION IS
OR WHAT IT IS CAPABLE OF,

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.350 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE CAPABLE
OF ANYTHING,

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:51.660 align:middle line:84%
A FUEL THAT HAS NO LIMIT
TO WHAT IT CAN PRODUCE,

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.260 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT ALWAYS TENDS
TO UNITE PEOPLE

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.600 align:middle line:84%
AND LEAD TOWARDS THE EVOLUTION
OF IDEAS

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:84%
THAT SHAPE THE WORLD
AND SHAPE THE FUTURE.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.940 align:middle line:84%
-THE PURPOSE
OF AN EVOLUTIONARY LEADER

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:84%
IS TO MAKE EVOLUTION
IRRESISTIBLE, EFFORTLESS,

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:14.410 align:middle line:84%
OBVIOUS, IRREFUTABLE,
AND THEREFORE INEVITABLE.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
-PEOPLE ONLY DO
WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.890 align:middle line:90%
IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.560 align:middle line:84%
FOR 7 BILLION PEOPLE TO MAKE
THE SAME DECISION AT ONCE.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.760 align:middle line:84%
HOW LIKELY THAT SCENARIO IS
DEPENDS ON WHAT WE BELIEVE

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:84%
AND HOW MUCH WE ACCEPT OR RESIST
WHAT WE BELIEVE IN.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.270 align:middle line:90%
PRIOR TO 1954,

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.300 align:middle line:90%
PEOPLE OVERWHELMINGLY AGREED

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.570 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE HUMAN BODY
WAS NOT CAPABLE

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.640 align:middle line:90%
OF RUNNING A 4-MINUTE MILE.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.940 align:middle line:84%
"OUR BONE STRUCTURE IS
NOT BUILT FOR IT," THEY SAID.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:46.350 align:middle line:84%
"OUR LUNGS CANNOT HANDLE IT,"
THEY CLAIMED.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:90%
"OUR HEART WOULD NOT ALLOW IT."

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.980 align:middle line:84%
HOWEVER, ON MAY 6th
OF THAT YEAR,

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.690 align:middle line:84%
ROGER BANNISTER RAN A MILE
IN .6 SECONDS UNDER 4 MINUTES

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.760 align:middle line:90%
AND SURVIVED JUST FINE.

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:84%
THAT SIMPLE SHIFT IN WHAT
PEOPLE BELIEVED TO BE REAL

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:84%
OPENED THE FLOOD GATES THAT
TRIED TO HOLD THE RIVER BACK.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.330 align:middle line:84%
-...BETWEEN JOHN LANDY
OF AUSTRALIA, NOW LEADING,

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.340 align:middle line:90%
AND ROGER BANNISTER OF ENGLAND,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.170 align:middle line:84%
BOTH OF WHOM HAVE PREVIOUSLY
BROKEN 4 MINUTES.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.940 align:middle line:84%
-JOHN LANDY'S BEST ATTEMPT
PRIOR TO 1954

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.640 align:middle line:90%
WAS A 4:02 MILE.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.450 align:middle line:84%
HE MADE A STATEMENT
THAT THE 4-MINUTE MILE

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:84%
WAS A BRICK WALL
THAT CANNOT BE PENETRATED.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.390 align:middle line:84%
HE CLAIMED HE WOULD NEVER
ATTEMPT TO BEAT IT AGAIN.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:31.360 align:middle line:84%
BUT ONLY 56 DAYS AFTER BANNISTER
BROKE THROUGH THAT WALL,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:90%
LANDY WAS INSPIRED TO TRY AGAIN.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.200 align:middle line:90%
HIS VERY NEXT ATTEMPT

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.230 align:middle line:84%
BROKE BANNISTER'S RECORD
BY 1.5 SECONDS.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:43.870 align:middle line:84%
THE FOLLOWING YEAR, 37 RUNNERS
BROKE THE 4-MINUTE MILE.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:48.940 align:middle line:84%
THE YEAR AFTER THAT, 300 RUNNERS
BROKE THROUGH THAT WALL.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.680 align:middle line:84%
THE WALL WAS NOT MADE OF BRICK,
AS LANDY SAID.

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS MADE OF BELIEF.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.420 align:middle line:84%
NOTHING STOPS THE RIVER
FROM FLOWING.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:90%
WE MAY BUILD A DAM TO BLOCK IT,

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.860 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT WALL
WILL TAKE LOTS OF ENERGY,

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.690 align:middle line:90%
LOTS OF EFFORT TO MAINTAIN,

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT STILL DOESN'T
MAKE IT SECURE.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.030 align:middle line:84%
AND WHEN ALL OF THAT ENERGY
TO KEEP THE WATER STILL,

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.200 align:middle line:84%
TO KEEP IT PREDICTABLE,
IS SPENT AND GONE,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:84%
THE RIVER WILL WIN
AND WASH AWAY EVERYTHING

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.380 align:middle line:84%
THAT ONCE TRIED TO IGNORE
THE INEVITABILITY OF CHANGE.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.480 align:middle line:84%
AND ALL THE KING'S HORSES
AND ALL THE KING'S MEN

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.150 align:middle line:84%
COULDN'T PUT THE OLD STORY
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:33.820 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE NOBODY BELIEVED IT.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:84%
NO KING, NO LEADER,
AND NO MILITARY FORCE

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.060 align:middle line:84%
CAN PREVENT THE TIDES
FROM ROLLING IN.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.690 align:middle line:90%
CHANGE IS HAPPENING.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.130 align:middle line:84%
THE ONLY WAY
TO ALLEVIATE THE FEAR,

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:49.670 align:middle line:84%
TO CALM THE NERVES,
AND TO AVOID UNNECESSARY PAIN

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.740 align:middle line:90%
IS TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH,

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.510 align:middle line:84%
COUNT DOWN FROM THREE TO ONE,
AND LET GO.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:18:00.510 align:middle line:90%
THREE...TWO...

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.620 align:middle line:84%
AH, I FORGOT
ABOUT THE COMMERCIAL BREAK.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.520 align:middle line:84%
LIFE'S LITTLE INTERRUPTIONS
KEEPING US ON OUR TOES.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.830 align:middle line:84%
INTERRUPTIONS ARE GREAT,
ACTUALLY.

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:14.730 align:middle line:84%
THEY SHOW US HOW MUCH FOCUS
WE GIVE

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:84%
TO THE ESOTERIC AGENDAS
IN OUR MIND,

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.830 align:middle line:84%
AND HOW LITTLE WE ARE PAYING
ATTENTION TO THE MOMENT.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:90%
TAKE, FOR INSTANCE, THIS JOKE.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:84%
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN FIGURE OUT
THE PUNCH LINE BEFORE I SAY IT.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.110 align:middle line:90%
KNOCK, KNOCK.

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:29.680 align:middle line:90%
WHO'S THERE?

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:90%
INTERRUPTION MAN.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:32.710 align:middle line:90%
INTERRUPTION --

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:90%
-ACTION.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:35.780 align:middle line:90%
-LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WELCOME.

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.820 align:middle line:90%
WE'RE HERE AT BURNING MAN 2013,

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:39.920 align:middle line:90%
AND THE TOPIC OF THE DAY IS ART

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
AND HOW ART INSPIRES
CULTURE ALONG.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:45.660 align:middle line:84%
NOW, WE HAVE LEGISLATION,
WE HAVE PICKET SIGNS, PETITIONS.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:84%
WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS
THAT TRY TO INFLUENCE

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:84%
THROUGH MEANS
OF COERCION AND FEAR

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.160 align:middle line:90%
OR MANIPULATION IN SOME MANNER

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
TO BRING ABOUT LIFE CHANGES,
TO BRING ABOUT WORLD CHANGES.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.600 align:middle line:84%
HOWEVER, ART IS THE ONE THING
THAT INSPIRES CULTURE ALONG,

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.210 align:middle line:84%
AND IT HAPPENS
WITHOUT YOU EVER HAVING TO ASK

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:02.540 align:middle line:90%
FOR CHANGE TO HAPPEN.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:05.340 align:middle line:84%
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS ASK A QUESTION

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.950 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE ART IS A QUESTION MARK.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.310 align:middle line:84%
IT DOESN'T ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS,
IT PROVOKES THEM.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
-IN THIS MOMENT,
WE ARE INSIDE OF A HOLOGRAM.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.290 align:middle line:90%
SO, WHEN YOU RECOGNIZE

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:24.400 align:middle line:84%
THAT YOU ARE IN THE CENTER
OF YOUR UNIVERSE,

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.230 align:middle line:84%
WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
QUESTION TO ASK?

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.410 align:middle line:90%
-OVER THE COURSE OF SEVEN DAYS

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:38.110 align:middle line:84%
AND IN THE PRESENCE
OF 70,000 ARTISTS,

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I DISCOVERED A NEW DIET --
A DAILY DOSE OF QUESTION MARKS.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.980 align:middle line:90%
I RECOGNIZED THE PATTERN.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:48.720 align:middle line:84%
EVERY TIME THE MOMENT
SEEMS PREDICTABLE,

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.160 align:middle line:84%
NO MATTER WHAT THE MOMENT
MIGHT BE,

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:84%
NO MATTER HOW FAMILIAR
IT MIGHT SEEM,

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:84%
THERE IS ALWAYS
SOMETHING NEW ABOUT IT.

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:84%
AND EVERY TIME
I CHOSE TO APPROACH

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.970 align:middle line:90%
SEEMINGLY PREDICTABLE MOMENTS

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
WITH COMPLETELY OPEN EYES
TO SEE THE NEW,

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:90%
AND OPEN MIND TO CLEAR THE OLD,

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:09.310 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN OPEN HEART TO EMBRACE
THE SHIFT BETWEEN THE TWO,

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:11.840 align:middle line:90%
A KEY WAS PRESENTED TO ME.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.080 align:middle line:90%
THOSE KEYS UNLOCKED THE DOORS

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:84%
THAT SEPARATED ME
FROM THE RIVER,

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
AND THOSE DOORS WERE MADE UP
STRICTLY

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:23.160 align:middle line:84%
FROM ALL THE QUESTIONS
THAT I THOUGHT I HAD ANSWERS TO.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:25.460 align:middle line:90%
WHO AM I?

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.230 align:middle line:90%
WHY AM I HERE?

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.030 align:middle line:90%
WHAT IS MY PURPOSE HERE?

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:35.270 align:middle line:84%
-THAT QUESTION IN ITSELF
IS THE ANSWER.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:41.410 align:middle line:84%
QUESTIONS AS ANSWERS
ARE DIVINE UNION.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:47.250 align:middle line:90%
QUESTIONS -- WHO AM I? --

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.650 align:middle line:90%
CREATE THE HUMBLING OF THE EGO

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:54.190 align:middle line:84%
AND THE ALLOWANCE OF INFINITY
TO BE ANSWERED.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:02.430 align:middle line:84%
-I HAD NEVER BEEN EXPOSED
TO SO MANY PEOPLE AT ONCE

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:05.100 align:middle line:84%
WHO CHOOSE TO BELIEVE
IN ONLY WHAT INSPIRES THEM,

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
NOT JUST PERIODICALLY,
BUT PERPETUALLY.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.470 align:middle line:84%
JUST BEING IN THE SUSTAINED
PRESENCE OF ORDINARY PEOPLE

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:15.470 align:middle line:84%
WHO ABSOLUTELY KNOW
THAT THEY ARE CAPABLE OF MAGIC

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:90%
INSPIRED ME TO TRY IT OUT.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.010 align:middle line:84%
THE EXPECTATIONS
I HELD MYSELF TO

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:24.480 align:middle line:84%
WOULD LOCK ME INTO A FRAMEWORK
LIKE AN OLD COMPUTER PROGRAM

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.890 align:middle line:84%
IN DESPERATE NEED
FOR AN UPGRADE.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:32.090 align:middle line:84%
ALL UPGRADES, WHETHER TECHNICAL,
PSYCHOLOGICAL, OR BEYOND,

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.490 align:middle line:84%
HAVE TO BE DOWNLOADED
FROM SOMEWHERE.

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:84%
-WHAT A DOWNLOAD IS,
IS THE RECOGNITION

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:84%
OF WHERE THOUGHTS AND IDEAS
COME FROM IN ESSENCE.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
WE ARE SHARING
A COLLECTIVE MIND,

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.540 align:middle line:90%
THE COLLECTIVE CONSCIOUSNESS,

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:52.580 align:middle line:84%
AND GOD ANSWERS US
THROUGH OUR IDEAS.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.510 align:middle line:90%
SO ANY TIME WE HAVE AN IDEA,

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.480 align:middle line:84%
WE ARE STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS
OF GIANTS

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.790 align:middle line:84%
WHO HAVE COME BEFORE US
TO BRING US INTO THE PERSPECTIVE

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.360 align:middle line:84%
THAT LEVERAGES
WHAT THEY CAME TO UNDERSTAND.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.320 align:middle line:90%
AND NOW WE'RE INTEGRATING IT

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:84%
WITH WHAT THEY HAD NOT FATHOMED
IS AVAILABLE AS A RESOURCE TO US

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.700 align:middle line:84%
IN TERMS
OF INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES,

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:15.900 align:middle line:84%
IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION
TECHNOLOGIES,

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.770 align:middle line:90%
THE OPEN-SOURCE PARADIGM.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:84%
SO, NOW WE HAVE THAT
TO LEVERAGE.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.680 align:middle line:84%
AND WE HAVE THESE TOOLS
FOR SPONTANEOUS COLLABORATION

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:90%
THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN AVAILABLE.

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:32.520 align:middle line:84%
THE NEW STANDARD
FOR SOCIAL CHANGE

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.350 align:middle line:84%
IS SPONTANEOUS PLANETARY
METAMORPHOSIS.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:42.760 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT IS THE EFFORTLESSNESS
AND IRREFUTABILITY,

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:84%
IN TERMS OF CHRONOLOGY,
HOW FAST THINGS CAN OCCUR.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:52.040 align:middle line:84%
WE'RE NO LONGER ASKING
OURSELVES, "HOW?"

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.070 align:middle line:84%
WE'RE ASKING OURSELVES,
"HOW LONG?"

00:22:55.070 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:84%
WHICH SIMPLY ALLOWS
FOR A CHOICE POINT

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:84%
FOR ALL OF HUMANITY TO SAY,
"DO I LIKE THIS IDEA?

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.090 align:middle line:90%
IF I DO, HOW DO I SUPPORT IT?"

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.160 align:middle line:90%
-HOW DO I SUPPORT IT?

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:16.500 align:middle line:84%
HOW DO I SUPPORT AN IDEA
THAT FEELS RIGHT

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:19.830 align:middle line:84%
AND IS AN OBVIOUS WAY
OUT OF THE MUD AND THE MIRE?

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:23.770 align:middle line:84%
WELL, HOW DO YOU LET THE RIVER
CARRY YOU?

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:27.210 align:middle line:90%
YOU SIMPLY LET GO OF THE ROCKS.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:30.080 align:middle line:84%
ALL OF THE ROCKS
THAT SYMBOLIZE THE RIGID MIND,

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.940 align:middle line:84%
THE FIRM BELIEFS
THAT LIMIT OUR FREEDOM.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS A SCARY THING TO DO,
FOR SURE,

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:40.490 align:middle line:84%
LETTING GO OF ALL THOSE ANSWERS
I WORKED SO HARD TO ARRIVE AT.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:43.520 align:middle line:84%
AND THE RIVER PROPELS ME DEEPER
INTO A FORCE OF ART

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.960 align:middle line:84%
THAT IS INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM MAGIC

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.090 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE IT IS THE RESULT
OF A REALITY

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:50.500 align:middle line:84%
THAT I WAS NOT CAPABLE
OF EXPERIENCING

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.800 align:middle line:90%
UNTIL I LET GO OF THE ROCKS.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.200 align:middle line:84%
ART EXPANDS THE LIMITATIONS
OF THE MIND.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.670 align:middle line:84%
IT LOOSENS OUR GRIP
ON THE BELIEFS

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:01.510 align:middle line:90%
THAT CHAIN US TO THE PAST.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:05.610 align:middle line:84%
IT GIVES US A GLIMPSE OF LIFE
BEYOND OUR EXPECTATIONS.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.980 align:middle line:90%
ART IS THE THEME.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:90%
AND WE ARE HERE EXPLORING

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.920 align:middle line:84%
HOW 60,000 TO 70,000 PEOPLE
COME TOGETHER IN A COMMUNITY

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.690 align:middle line:90%
TO SIMPLY DO ONE THING --

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.820 align:middle line:84%
BE THEMSELVES,
AND BE THEMSELVES A LOT.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.930 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT IS ONE THING
YOU WILL NOT FIND

00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:21.530 align:middle line:90%
MANY OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD.

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.500 align:middle line:84%
PEOPLE RUN TO SPIRITUAL
COMMUNITIES

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:84%
OR DIFFERENT TYPES
OF COMMUNITIES FOR SALVATION.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:28.930 align:middle line:84%
"FIX ME, I'M BROKEN.
PLEASE, DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:30.470 align:middle line:90%
GIVE ME, DELIVER ME FROM."

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.510 align:middle line:84%
HOWEVER, WHEN YOU SEE
A TRUE ARTISTIC COMMUNITY,

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:84%
ART COMMUNITIES
ARE THE ONES THAT SAY,

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:38.180 align:middle line:84%
"NO. YOU ARE SAVED.
BE YOURSELF."

00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:42.350 align:middle line:90%
IMAGINE A MIDLIFE CRISIS,

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:46.020 align:middle line:84%
WHERE A MAN BELIEVES
IN ONE THING HIS ENTIRE LIFE,

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.590 align:middle line:84%
AND IN AN INSTANT,
THAT BELIEF IS SHATTERED.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:90%
THAT KIND OF CHANGE

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.060 align:middle line:84%
IS BEYOND THE COMPREHENSION
OF THE ORIGINAL BELIEF.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:55.830 align:middle line:90%
THEREFORE, THE ROOTS OF ART

00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:84%
HAD TO GROW PAST THE BOUNDARIES
OF THE ROCK TO REACH THE WATER.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:84%
THE SHEER MAGNITUDE OF ONE
SINGLE TRANSFORMATION LIKE THIS

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:84%
IS ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR SOMEONE
TO HANDLE ALL AT ONCE.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.180 align:middle line:90%
NOW IMAGINE THAT KIND OF CHANGE

00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.210 align:middle line:84%
HAPPENING EVERY SECOND
OF YOUR LIFE.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:16.980 align:middle line:84%
FURTHERMORE, IMAGINE THAT YOU
NOT ONLY ALLOW THESE CHANGES,

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.290 align:middle line:84%
BUT EVERY TIME YOU EMBRACE THEM
WITH AN OPEN HEART,

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.450 align:middle line:90%
A SENSE OF INSPIRATION EMERGES,

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:25.660 align:middle line:84%
AND YOUR CAPACITY
FOR MAGIC EXPANDS.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.030 align:middle line:90%
BUT MAYBE MAGIC DOESN'T EXIST.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.700 align:middle line:90%
MAYBE THE SCIENTISTS WERE WRONG,

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.630 align:middle line:84%
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY A 3-MINUTE
MILE THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.670 align:middle line:84%
MAYBE THIS IS ALL
A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING,

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.570 align:middle line:90%
AND EVERYONE AT BURNING MAN,

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.970 align:middle line:84%
AND ALL THE ARTISTS
AROUND THE WORLD, ARE MISTAKEN,

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.010 align:middle line:84%
AND THE RIVER
IS JUST A METAPHOR,

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.780 align:middle line:90%
A FANCY IDEA, NOTHING ELSE.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.180 align:middle line:90%
MAYBE.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:52.650 align:middle line:84%
BUT LET'S TRY SOMETHING
REVOLUTIONARY

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.050 align:middle line:90%
AND ASSUME THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:90%
LET'S SEE IF THE RIVER IS REAL.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:01.930 align:middle line:84%
ON THE COUNT OF THREE,
LET'S ALL LET GO.

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:06.230 align:middle line:90%
THREE...

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:08.200 align:middle line:90%
TWO...

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.270 align:middle line:90%
...ONE.

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.820 align:middle line:90%
DID YOU CATCH THE PUNCH LINE?
