WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.640 align:middle line:84%
-AND KIMBERLY AND I
WERE REALLY ALIGNED ON,

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.480 align:middle line:84%
"NO, THERE ISN'T TIME FOR THAT.
WE NEED TO USE THE MEDIA.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.450 align:middle line:84%
"WE NEED TO GET THESE MESSAGES
OUT AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.720 align:middle line:84%
TO THE ENTIRE WORLD
AND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.150 align:middle line:90%
-YEAH.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle line:84%
-AND THEN WE STARTED
WORKING TOGETHER

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.320 align:middle line:90%
AS ASSOCIATES ON THE FILM,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.690 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN JUST FELL IN LOVE
AS WE WORKED TOGETHER.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.230 align:middle line:84%
SO WE REALLY STARTED AS FRIENDS
AND COLLEAGUES,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.230 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN IT DEVELOPED INTO A
WONDERFUL, LOVING RELATIONSHIP.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.670 align:middle line:90%
-THE FILM YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.040 align:middle line:84%
IS THE "THRIVE" FILM.
-YEAH.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
-SO YOU CAME TOGETHER
FOR THE SAKE OF THE FILM,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:84%
AND THE RELATIONSHIP
BLOSSOMED OUT OF THAT.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:90%
-EXACTLY.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.680 align:middle line:84%
-OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS IT TOOK,
YEAH.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.050 align:middle line:84%
-SO YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN WORKING
ON IT FOR 10 YEARS,

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:90%
HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FILM.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:90%
-YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:84%
WE KNEW WE HAD THIS SHARED
VISION, AND WE LIKED EACH OTHER,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN IT
JUST SORT OF EVOLVED.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.390 align:middle line:84%
WE ALWAYS KNEW
IT WOULD BE A FILM

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT WE SHARED

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
WAS THAT WE KNEW WE WANTED TO
USE THE MEDIA IN THAT WAY,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.970 align:middle line:84%
BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT THE MOTIF WOULD BE.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
-I KNEW FROM COLLEGE
THAT I WANTED TO MAKE A FILM

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.340 align:middle line:84%
ABOUT WHAT'S IN THE WAY
OF OUR THRIVING

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:90%
AND WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT.

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
BUT WHEN I GRADUATED AND WAS
EXPECTED TO GO TO HOLLYWOOD

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.810 align:middle line:90%
AND MAKE FILMS AND SO FORTH,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.250 align:middle line:84%
I REALIZED I'VE GOT NOTHING
IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO SAY

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.480 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S WORTH ALL THAT MONEY
AND TIME AND HASSLE

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:84%
AND TECHNOLOGY
AND EVERYTHING TO DO THAT.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
BUT I SAID, "INSTEAD, I'M GOING
TO DEDICATE MY ENERGIES

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
"TO FIGURING OUT THE ANSWER
TO THAT QUESTION,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.660 align:middle line:84%
"AND IF I FIND ANSWERS THAT ARE
COMMENSURATE WITH THE PROBLEM --

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.500 align:middle line:84%
"WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON AND WHAT
CAN WE REALLY DO ABOUT IT? --

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.630 align:middle line:90%
THEN I'LL MAKE A MOVIE."

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I FIGURED MAYBE
IT'D TAKE 10 YEARS

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.340 align:middle line:90%
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:84%
OVER 40 YEARS LATER,
HERE WE ARE.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.570 align:middle line:84%
-WE CO-WROTE IT,
AND I DIRECTED IT,

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:90%
AND SO, AS A COUPLE,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.479 align:middle line:84%
WE DECIDED THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP
WOULD BE PRIMARY.

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.520 align:middle line:84%
-AND I'VE JUST COME TO REALIZE
THAT I AM WAY MORE ELOQUENT,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.750 align:middle line:84%
MORE EFFECTIVE
IN MY ARTISTIC EXPRESSION,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.320 align:middle line:84%
WHEN I'M IN CO-CREATIVE
PARTNERSHIP WITH KIMBERLY

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.090 align:middle line:84%
THAN I WOULD BE ON MY OWN,
AND SHE'S SAID THE SAME,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.890 align:middle line:84%
AND I THINK THAT REALLY SPEAKS
TO THE DYNAMIC OF SYNERGY,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
WHERE THE WHOLE IS WAY MORE
THAN THE SUM OF THE PARTS.

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:90%
AND I THINK THAT'S A LOT

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:84%
OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING GOING ON
IN THE WORLD NOW.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
AS PEOPLE ARE MORE AND MORE
WORKING ON THEMSELVES

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:84%
AND FULFILLING
THEIR OWN POTENTIAL

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.170 align:middle line:90%
MORE AND MORE AS AN INDIVIDUAL,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.380 align:middle line:84%
THEY'RE NATURALLY FINDING OTHER
PARTNERS WHO ARE DOING THE SAME,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.350 align:middle line:84%
AND THE NEXT LEVEL
OF FULFILLMENT

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:90%
IS IN CO-CREATIVE PARTNERSHIP

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.720 align:middle line:84%
SO THAT THE COMMUNICATION
IS TOROIDAL PROCESS.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
IT ACTUALLY
IS WHOLE AND COMPLETE,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT WAS
ABSOLUTELY INVALUABLE

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.160 align:middle line:84%
AND I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS
WHY "THRIVE" HAS GONE SO VIRAL.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:84%
-THE GREATEST ART FORM
I'VE EVER BEEN EXPOSED TO

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:90%
IS THE ART OF LIFE.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.110 align:middle line:84%
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO
KNOW AND LOVE YOURSELF

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:90%
BEFORE YOU CAN LOVE ANOTHER.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.480 align:middle line:90%
THAT OTHER PERSON SAYS,

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.850 align:middle line:84%
"YOU'RE NOT DOING A GOOD JOB
ON YOUR OWN."

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.920 align:middle line:90%
CATCH-22, HUH?

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.490 align:middle line:84%
YOU NEED TO LOVE YOURSELF
BEFORE YOU CAN LOVE ANYONE ELSE,

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.590 align:middle line:84%
YET THE EASIEST WAY TO GET THERE
IS TO TRAVEL THAT ROAD TOGETHER.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:84%
TO MASTER AN ART FORM,
YOU PRACTICE, YOU EXPERIMENT,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.700 align:middle line:84%
EXPLORE, YOU FALL,
YOU GET BACK UP.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
YOUR PARTNER FALLS,
YOU HELP THEM BACK UP.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.910 align:middle line:84%
MISTAKES ARE RECOGNIZED,
BUT NOT CRITICIZED.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:84%
ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE CELEBRATED,
NOT BOASTED.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.750 align:middle line:84%
YOU ALLOW YOUR PARTNER TO BE
YOUR MIRROR, NOT YOUR BURDEN.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
EVERY MOVE EMPOWERS
THE NEXT ONE,

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.160 align:middle line:84%
NEVER DISMISSES
OR DIMINISHES IT,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.660 align:middle line:84%
TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT EVERY MOVE
YOU MAKE IN LIFE

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.990 align:middle line:84%
IS BUT A SINGLE FRAME
IN A MOVIE.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.460 align:middle line:84%
YOU DON'T STOP ON A SINGLE FRAME
BECAUSE IT FEELS GOOD,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:90%
NOR DO YOU SKIP OVER IT.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:84%
THE OLD FRAMES
NATURALLY PASS YOU BY,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:84%
WHETHER GOOD, BAD,
OR INDIFFERENT,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:84%
AND YOU REALIZE THAT THIS MOVIE
IS A NEVER-ENDING PROCESS,

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:90%
AN ART FORM.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.810 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN GROW WITH IT
OR DECAY IN SPITE OF IT.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.990 align:middle line:84%
-YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY --
I REMEMBER ALICE WALKER SAID,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.990 align:middle line:84%
"IF ART DOESN'T MAKE YOU BETTER,
THEN WHAT ON EARTH IS IT FOR?"

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.160 align:middle line:90%
AND I THINK, REALLY,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
IF A RELATIONSHIP
DOESN'T MAKE YOU BETTER,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:90%
WHAT ON EARTH IS IT FOR?

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN,
WE'RE ALL HERE TO EVOLVE.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.870 align:middle line:84%
-I MET FOSTER AND KIMBERLY
IN CHICHEN ITZA

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:90%
ON DECEMBER 21, 2012...

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.409 align:middle line:84%
FLOODED WITH NEW-AGERS
AND OLD HEADS,

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.010 align:middle line:90%
SPEAKING ABOUT THE MOST COHERENT

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.210 align:middle line:84%
ALL THE WAY TO THE MOST
NONSENSICAL THINGS

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.680 align:middle line:90%
REGARDING THE MAYAN CALENDAR,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.750 align:middle line:90%
SPIRITUAL TRANSFORMATION,

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:84%
AND THE IMMINENT
ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:84%
BOTH KIMBERLY AND FOSTER
WERE DOWN-TO-EARTH, ELOQUENT,

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.390 align:middle line:84%
AND SIMPLY TWO LOVERS
LIVING LIFE

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
AND SHOWING THE SIMPLICITY
OF LIVING FROM THE HEART.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle line:90%
IT DIDN'T TAKE MUCH TO RECOGNIZE

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.870 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE POWER OF THEIR IDEAS
FOR THE WORLD

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.200 align:middle line:84%
IS ROOTED IN THE SAME LOVE
THEY FEEL FOR ONE ANOTHER.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.470 align:middle line:84%
HOW DO YOU THINK THE FILM
WOULD HAVE DIFFERED

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:84%
HAD IT NOT BEEN BOOSTED OR
IMPROVED BY YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.210 align:middle line:90%
-WELL, I'D LOVE TO ANSWER THAT,

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.320 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE I HAVE RECEIVED
SUCH A POWERFUL TEACHING

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.950 align:middle line:84%
OF, FIRST OF ALL, THE GENTLE
POWER OF FEMININE ENERGY --

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:28.260 align:middle line:84%
THAT WILD, CHAOTIC ENERGY WHICH,
IF BROUGHT INTO ART,

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.800 align:middle line:90%
BROUGHT INTO RATIONAL DISCOURSE,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.930 align:middle line:90%
HAS A WAY OF GOING TO THE HEART

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:84%
BEYOND JUST THE INTELLECT,
BEYOND AN ANGRY, RANTING MALE

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.940 align:middle line:84%
ABOUT THE SKY IS FALLING
AND SO FORTH.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.740 align:middle line:84%
SO, KIMBERLY WAS THE DIRECTOR
ON THE FILM,

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.210 align:middle line:84%
AND SHE REALLY HELPED ME
ON THE SET,

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.080 align:middle line:84%
PARTICULARLY WHEN I WAS
NARRATING

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:84%
THE GLOBAL-DOMINATION
AGENDA SECTION,

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.750 align:middle line:84%
TO NOT GET CAUGHT UP
IN MY OWN INTENSE EMOTION

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:84%
ABOUT THE DESTRUCTION
OF BILLIONS OF LIVES

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.159 align:middle line:90%
AT THE HANDS OF A FEW PEOPLE.

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:84%
BUT SHE KEPT SAYING,
"COME FROM YOUR CONFIDENCE

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.360 align:middle line:84%
"ABOUT THE WAY OUT, AND THEN
JUST DELIVER THE INFORMATION

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
"SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE ROOM
FOR THEIR OWN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.100 align:middle line:84%
RATHER THAN HAVING
TO FIGHT OFF YOURS."

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.940 align:middle line:84%
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE MEANT AT FIRST,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.110 align:middle line:90%
BUT SHE KEPT COACHING ME

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.170 align:middle line:84%
UNTIL, FINALLY, THERE WAS A TAKE
THAT SHE SAID,

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.010 align:middle line:84%
"YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
I WAS LOOKING FOR,"

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.310 align:middle line:90%
AND I STEPPED OFF THE SET

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.250 align:middle line:84%
AND MOST OF THE CREW
WAS IN TEARS.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.280 align:middle line:84%
THEY'D ACTUALLY BEEN REALLY
MOVED BY THIS NASTY INFORMATION,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.890 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT'S THE POWER
OF THAT FEMININE ENERGY

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.220 align:middle line:84%
THAT I THINK REALLY NEEDS TO
EMERGE BACK INTO THE WORLD NOW

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.690 align:middle line:90%
IF WE'RE REALLY GOING TO,

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:84%
NOT ONLY UNDERSTAND
AND INTEGRATE WHAT'S GOING ON,

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:84%
BUT FIND HARMONIOUS WAYS
OUT OF IT.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.930 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S A GUY
NAMED JOHN DAVID GARCIA.

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.440 align:middle line:90%
HE SAID THAT, TO HIM,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.040 align:middle line:84%
"BEAUTY IS THE CONSCIOUS
PERCEPTION OF OBJECTIVE TRUTH

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.880 align:middle line:84%
"BEING COMMUNICATED
TO OUR UNCONSCIOUS,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:84%
AND THE GREATER THE OBJECTIVE
TRUTH, THE GREATER THE BEAUTY."

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.650 align:middle line:84%
AND THE REASON I'M SAYING THAT
IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.720 align:middle line:84%
THAT I'M REALLY VALUING
FROM IN OUR RELATIONSHIP

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.460 align:middle line:90%
IS MICROSCOPIC HONESTY.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:84%
AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, THAT
WOULD BE A VERY SCARY NOTION,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.800 align:middle line:90%
BUT KIMBERLY HAS SHOWN ME

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.370 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE MORE MICROSCOPICALLY
HONEST WE ARE

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.270 align:middle line:84%
ABOUT SHARING WHAT MATTERS
WITH EACH OTHER,

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:20.410 align:middle line:90%
THE GREATER THE SPACE FOR LOVE.

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.110 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT TAKES A LOT OF TRUST

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:84%
TO REALLY MICROSCOPICALLY
SHARE YOURSELF --

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:84%
WHAT YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT,
WHAT YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT,

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.350 align:middle line:90%
WHAT YOU'RE AFRAID ABOUT,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.320 align:middle line:84%
WHAT YOU ENJOY ABOUT,
AND SO FORTH.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:36.990 align:middle line:84%
BUT SHE HAS SHOWN ME THAT SHE
WANTS TO KNOW WHO I REALLY AM

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.060 align:middle line:90%
AND IS CAPABLE OF HOLDING THAT

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.930 align:middle line:84%
AND EVEN FEEDING BACK
USEFUL THINGS

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:90%
WITHOUT ANY SHAMING AT ALL.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.540 align:middle line:84%
SO FOR ME, IT'S LIKE,
"OKAY, I GET TO EXHALE HERE

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.670 align:middle line:84%
"AND ACTUALLY BE MYSELF AND
IMPROVE MYSELF FROM DAY-TO-DAY

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:84%
"BECAUSE I'M IN THE ENVIRONMENT
OF SOMEONE

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.010 align:middle line:84%
"WHO'S LOVING ME
FOR MY WHOLE SELF,

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.680 align:middle line:84%
"NOT EXPECTING ME TO ALWAYS HAVE
IT ALL TOGETHER,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.420 align:middle line:84%
BUT STILL SEEING ME AS WHOLE
IN THAT GROWTH PROCESS."

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.820 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT REALLY CAME OUT
IN THE FILM

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.620 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO EXPLORE
SUCH DEPTHS OF FEAR AND SADNESS

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.760 align:middle line:84%
AND JOY AND UNKNOWING
WITH EACH OTHER AS PARTNERS

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:90%
AND THEN HAVE THE FRUITS OF THAT

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.400 align:middle line:84%
GO OUT IN THE COMMUNICATION
OF THE FILM.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:24.970 align:middle line:84%
SO I THINK CO-CREATIVE ART AND
CO-CREATIVE EXPRESSION OF TRUTH,

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
OR COMMUNICATION OF TRUTH, IS
WHAT I'M SEEING EMERGING FOR US,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.810 align:middle line:84%
BUT REALLY I'M SEEING IT
EMERGING ALL OVER THE WORLD.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:44.360 align:middle line:84%
-I FEEL LIKE WHAT WE'VE BEEN
ABLE TO OFFER IS MORE CLARITY

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.060 align:middle line:84%
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
FOR PEOPLE TO DO THEIR PART,

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:90%
NOT ALL OF IT.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:53.470 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE AN ACTIVIST
FROM THE '60s AT U.C. BERKELEY

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,
AND THE OLD PARADIGM ACTIVISM

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.400 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED
ABOUT AN ISSUE

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
AND YOU JUST GOT TO GIVE
YOUR LIFE TO IT,

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:84%
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
BURN OUT THAT WAY.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.040 align:middle line:90%
AND I THINK THE WHOLE NOTION

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.810 align:middle line:84%
OF BEING ABLE TO IDENTIFY
YOUR OWN PURPOSE --

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.120 align:middle line:90%
AND WE HAVE LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.990 align:middle line:84%
AND JUST KIND DISTINGUISH
FOR PEOPLE,

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:90%
"WHAT'S YOUR PART AT THIS TIME?"

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.820 align:middle line:84%
AND IF YOU DO THAT
AND ACTUALLY COME FROM THERE,

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.490 align:middle line:90%
THEN YOU'RE IN JOY,

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:84%
WHAT YOU'RE OFFERING
IS SUSTAINABLE,

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.830 align:middle line:84%
AND WE GOT A LONG HAUL
IN FRONT OF US.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.800 align:middle line:84%
AND SO THIS IS OUR PART --
YOU KNOW, THIS IS MY PART,

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS FOSTER'S, THIS IS OURS,
THIS IS YOURS, THIS IS --

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.940 align:middle line:84%
AND TO REALLY SHOW THAT
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE BEST WAY.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.080 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S JUST NOT LIKE,
"OH, WELL. WE CAN'T DO IT ALL."

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.950 align:middle line:84%
IT'S LIKE, "WE'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO IT ALL."

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:90%
-IT TOOK ME MANY TIMES OVER

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:43.480 align:middle line:84%
LISTENING TO THESE WORDS
KIMBERLY OFFERED

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.820 align:middle line:84%
TO UNDERSTAND WHY SHE FELT IT
SO IMPORTANT

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.690 align:middle line:90%
TO STRESS DOING YOUR OWN PART

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.160 align:middle line:84%
AND LETTING OTHERS
TAKE CARE OF THEIRS.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.690 align:middle line:90%
LIFE LIVED IN THIS WAY

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.960 align:middle line:84%
IS LESS ABOUT EFFICIENCY
AND MORE ABOUT QUALITY.

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
IT'S AS IF WE'RE PLACED ON EARTH
IN THIS BODY

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.530 align:middle line:90%
NOT TO ACCOMPLISH TASKS

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.900 align:middle line:84%
LIKE SPARKING REVOLUTIONS
AND BUILDING BIGGER BUSINESSES

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:84%
AND NOT TO GET BETTER AND FASTER
AT OUTPUT AND PRODUCTION,

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.470 align:middle line:90%
BUT TO SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.440 align:middle line:84%
IN SEARCH OF AND TRULY SUCCEED
AT ONE THING --

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:84%
ACCEPTING SOMEBODY
FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY ARE.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.520 align:middle line:84%
IT SOUNDS SIMPLE --
TOO SIMPLE --

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.020 align:middle line:90%
SO SIMPLE, IN FACT,

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:84%
THAT HARDLY ANYONE
KNOWS HOW TO DO IT ANYMORE.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.690 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN, WE CAN BUILD SKYSCRAPERS
AND PUT PEOPLE ON THE MOON...

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:90%
-...OF LANDING A MAN ON THE MOON

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
AND RETURNING HIM
SAFELY TO THE EARTH.

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:34.270 align:middle line:84%
NO SINGLE SPACE PROJECT
IN THIS PERIOD

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.640 align:middle line:84%
WILL BE MORE IMPRESSIVE
TO MANKIND.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
-...OR, ACCORDING TO
6% TO 20% OF AMERICANS,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.740 align:middle line:84%
WE CAN AT LEAST STAGE IT
AND SUCCESSFULLY FOOL BILLIONS.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:84%
EITHER WAY, IT TAKES
A LOT OF PLANNING, TIME, ENERGY,

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.780 align:middle line:90%
TRIAL AND ERROR TO ACCOMPLISH

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.790 align:middle line:84%
ALL THE SCIENTIFIC
AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:84%
WE'VE SEEN IN SUCH A SHORT
PERIOD OF GLOBAL HISTORY,

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:84%
BUT WE GIVE HALF-ASSED ATTEMPTS
AT APOLOGIES

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
AND LITTLE TO NO COMPASSION
TO OURSELVES.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.630 align:middle line:84%
WE'VE BEEN SO HYPNOTIZED
BY OUR BRILLIANCE

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:08.200 align:middle line:84%
THAT WE FEEL THE NEED
TO CONTINUALLY PROVE IT

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:90%
MORE AND MORE IN A MATERIAL WAY,

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:84%
AND YET WE FORGET ABOUT
THE BRILLIANCE THAT IT TAKES

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.140 align:middle line:90%
TO LET YOURSELF FALL IN LOVE,

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.210 align:middle line:84%
TO SUPPORT A FAMILY
WITH YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:90%
RATHER THAN VACATIONS AND TOYS.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.880 align:middle line:84%
THAT REQUIRES TRUST,
A CERTAIN FORM OF BRILLIANCE

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.580 align:middle line:84%
NEARLY EXTINCT
IN OUR CULTURE TODAY.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.950 align:middle line:84%
BUT TRUST IS SIMPLY
A COMBINATION

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:84%
OF YOU HAVING A SOLID GRASP
ON REALITY AND OWNING IT,

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:35.430 align:middle line:84%
UNDERSTANDING LIFE
AT THIS MOMENT AND ACCEPTING IT.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:36.100 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S TRUST.

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU HAVE AN AGENDA IN MIND
FOR YOUR RELATIONSHIP

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.070 align:middle line:84%
AND YOU EXPECT THE OTHER
TO PROVIDE YOU

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.270 align:middle line:84%
WITH HAPPINESS,
SECURITY, LOVE, SEX,

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.640 align:middle line:84%
THEN YOU'RE BASING YOUR TRUST
ON THE POSSIBLE FUTURE ACTIONS

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:84%
OF SOMEONE ELSE WHOM YOU
OBVIOUSLY CLAIM YOU DON'T KNOW

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.080 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE YOUR PICK-UP LINE
WAS PROBABLY SOMETHING LIKE,

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.710 align:middle line:84%
"I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU
BETTER."

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.320 align:middle line:84%
WHY NOT PLACE YOUR TRUST IN
YOUR ABILITY TO LOVE SOMEONE?

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.820 align:middle line:84%
THEN THE TRUST IS BASED
ON AN ABILITY

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.220 align:middle line:84%
THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE --
TO TRUST SOMEONE COMPLETELY,

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:84%
KNOWING THAT THEY WILL TRIP UP,
THEY WILL LASH OUT,

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
THEY WILL HURT YOU,
AND THEY WILL LIE TO YOU,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.600 align:middle line:84%
AND DESPITE THESE ACTIONS,
DESPITE THE THINGS THAT THEY DO,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.040 align:middle line:84%
YOU STILL LOVE THEM
BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE.

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.070 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU CAN LEARN TO DO THAT
WITH JUST ONE PERSON,

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.010 align:middle line:90%
THEN THE CHANGE IS IRREVERSIBLE.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.910 align:middle line:90%
YOU CAN DO IT WITH ANYONE.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.050 align:middle line:90%
YOU FOUND THE FORMULA TO LIFE.

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:90%
YOU'VE SOLVED THE MYSTERY.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:middle line:90%
YOU GET THE COSMIC JOKE,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.820 align:middle line:84%
AND YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT DRUG
JOHN LENNON WAS REALLY HIGH ON.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
-THE CONNECTION BETWEEN
MINDFULNESS AND ACTIVISM,

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.130 align:middle line:90%
I FEEL LIKE IT'S A NATURAL THING

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:46.370 align:middle line:84%
TO ENGAGE IN WANTING TO USE
WHO WE ARE ON BEHALF OF HELPING.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:50.340 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN, THERE'S SO MUCH PAIN
AND SUFFERING OUT THERE

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:84%
THAT I THINK ANYBODY
IN A HEALTHY STATE

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.340 align:middle line:90%
IS NATURALLY MOVED,

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.750 align:middle line:84%
THAT IT'S BUILT IN US TO BE
EMPATHETIC WITH ONE ANOTHER.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.810 align:middle line:84%
AND THE ONLY THING
THAT PREVENTS THAT

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.650 align:middle line:90%
IS A DISTRACTION OF OUR OWN.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.650 align:middle line:84%
AND SO, AS WE PRACTICE
OUR MINDFULNESS

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.460 align:middle line:84%
AND HELP RESOLVE
THOSE DISTRACTIONS,

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.860 align:middle line:84%
IT IS NATURAL THEN TO EXPRESS
OURSELVES IN THE WORLD

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.130 align:middle line:90%
IN WHATEVER WAY IS RIGHT.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.400 align:middle line:90%
AND LIKE FOSTER SAID,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT MUSICALLY
OR THROUGH FILM

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.400 align:middle line:84%
OR THROUGH NURSING
OR THROUGH MOTHERING

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.200 align:middle line:90%
OR THROUGH WHATEVER IT IS?

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:84%
THERE ISN'T A RIGHT USE OF YOU
THAT ANYONE CAN KNOW BUT YOU.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:34.050 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, WE DID A FUN INTERVIEW
RECENTLY WITH A GUY --

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:37.120 align:middle line:84%
RICK ARCHER
AT BUDDHA AT THE GAS PUMP.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.250 align:middle line:84%
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW
HE WAS REALLY INTO MEDITATING

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.090 align:middle line:84%
IN THE '60s,
AND I WAS TALKING ABOUT

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:47.230 align:middle line:84%
HOW I WAS REALLY AN ACTIVIST
IN THE '60s,

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:48.760 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT HE KIND OF THOUGHT,

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:84%
"OH, THE ACTIVISTS SHOULD
JUST SIT DOWN AND MEDITATE,"

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:54.500 align:middle line:84%
AND I KIND OF THOUGHT, "THESE
MEDITATORS OUGHT TO GET UP

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.440 align:middle line:84%
AND DO SOMETHING
AND STOP THIS WAR,"

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.640 align:middle line:90%
AND WE REALIZED HERE WE ARE NOW.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:02.470 align:middle line:84%
WE'RE ALL IN IT TOGETHER
DOING WHATEVER'S OUR PART,

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:04.540 align:middle line:90%
AND LUCKILY NOW I MEDITATE,

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:84%
AND NOW HE HAS A SHOW
BRINGING VOICES OUT OF PEOPLE

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.350 align:middle line:84%
WHO ARE DOING ALL KINDS
OF THINGS

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.580 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN
THAT IT'S REALLY --

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:84%
THERE DOESN'T NEED TO BE
A DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE THINGS.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.860 align:middle line:90%
-MEDITATION AND ACTION.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:22.090 align:middle line:84%
MOST OF US ARE HABITUAL
ON THE ACTION SIDE.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.900 align:middle line:84%
LESS OF US FALL ON THE SIDE
OF MEDITATION,

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.500 align:middle line:84%
AND EVEN FEWER
FOUND THE BRIDGE LESS TRAVELED

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.270 align:middle line:90%
THAT CONNECTS THE TWO.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:84%
WE MOSTLY LIKE THINGS
TO BE COMPLICATED,

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.370 align:middle line:84%
LIKE A TEENAGER GETTING BORED
OF OLD VIDEO GAMES

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.710 align:middle line:90%
WHEN THEY GET TOO EASY.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.080 align:middle line:84%
THE PASSAGE THROUGH EACH LEVEL
OF THE GAME

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.710 align:middle line:90%
GETS INCREASINGLY MORE COMPLEX

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.780 align:middle line:84%
TO MAKE IT A CHALLENGE EQUAL
TO THE ONE BEING CHALLENGED,

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:45.990 align:middle line:84%
SIMILAR TO THE LADDER
THAT A BUSINESSMAN CLIMBS.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.990 align:middle line:84%
EACH RUNG MEANS
ADDED RESPONSIBILITY.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.890 align:middle line:84%
WE LIKE THIS
BECAUSE WE FEEL PRODUCTIVE.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.260 align:middle line:84%
THOSE OF US AFFLICTED WITH
A NEED FOR PRODUCING RESULTS

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.660 align:middle line:84%
AND BEING ACTIVE MAY FAIL TO SEE
THE VALUE IN MEDITATION

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.370 align:middle line:84%
DUE TO NEVER HAVING EXPERIENCED
THE EFFECTS OF IT.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:05.000 align:middle line:84%
MEDITATION IS AS IMPORTANT
TO ACTION

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:90%
AS THE EXHALE IS TO THE INHALE.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.740 align:middle line:90%
EVERYTHING YOU ACT UPON

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
CAUSES NOISE
TO NAVIGATE YOUR CIRCUITRY,

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.080 align:middle line:90%
ECHOING THROUGH YOUR MIND.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:90%
EVERY NEW THING YOU EXPERIENCE

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
BRINGS THE NOISE BACK TO LIFE
LIKE WIND THROUGH THE CHIMES.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.450 align:middle line:90%
WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH NOISE,

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN'T EVEN HEAR THE WHISPER
OF YOUR CONSCIENCE.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.490 align:middle line:90%
YOU NEED TO EXHALE.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.790 align:middle line:84%
TOO MUCH NOISE GOES IN,
LITTLE COMES OUT.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:middle line:90%
SOME NOISES ARE ANCIENT --

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:84%
CHILDHOOD NOISE THAT NEVER GOT
A QUIET MOMENT FROM YOU

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.870 align:middle line:84%
TO CONSIDER WHAT MESSAGE
IT HOLDS,

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:38.800 align:middle line:84%
SO IT HIDES DOWN
IN THE BASEMENT OF YOUR MIND,

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:84%
TO BE BROUGHT UP
AT AN UNEXPECTED MOMENT

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.510 align:middle line:84%
AND REMIND YOU THAT YOU HAVEN'T
FORGOT A THING IN YOUR LIFE.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.510 align:middle line:90%
YOU CHOSE TO IGNORE IT.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:84%
MEDITATION WHITTLES DOWN
THE NOISE

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:84%
AND LEAVES YOU WITH A SIMPLE
AND BEAUTIFUL MESSAGE.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:56.620 align:middle line:84%
THAT MESSAGE, ONCE HEARD,
WILL CHANGE THE WORLD.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:84%
-I WOULD SAY THE ESSENCE
OF THE THRIVE MOVEMENT

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.960 align:middle line:84%
IS EMPOWERING
SELF-CREATING MOVEMENTS.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
WE NEVER LOOKED TO CREATE
SOME GIANT ORGANIZATION

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.270 align:middle line:84%
THAT WE WERE GOING TO CENTRALIZE
CONTROL OVER.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.010 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S NOT THE WAY NATURES WORK.

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.040 align:middle line:84%
IT WOULDN'T WORK
FOR THIS PURPOSE.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.540 align:middle line:90%
AND THE CORE OF THAT,

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.880 align:middle line:84%
THE CORE OF THE SOLUTIONS
TO ALL OF THE PROBLEMS,

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:22.510 align:middle line:84%
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
IS ETHICS --

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:27.250 align:middle line:84%
IS FUNDAMENTALLY THAT NO ONE HAS
THE RIGHT TO VIOLATE ANYONE ELSE

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:84%
EXCEPT IN TRUE SELF-DEFENSE,
IF THEY'RE BEING VIOLATED.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:84%
SO IN THE THRIVE MOVEMENT,
WHEN --

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.430 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S OVER 800
SOLUTIONS GROUPS

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:84%
HAVE ALREADY JOINED THE THRIVE
MOVEMENT FROM OVER 90 COUNTRIES,

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.900 align:middle line:84%
AND THE ONLY TWO THINGS
THAT WE ASK OF THEM,

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:84%
IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE PART
OF THAT NETWORK,

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:84%
IS, ONE, THAT THEY USE
THE SECTOR MODEL,

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.710 align:middle line:90%
THAT THEY USE THE SAME SECTORS

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:50.810 align:middle line:84%
SO THAT WE CAN COLLABORATE
IN A SYNERGETIC WAY

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:53.410 align:middle line:84%
WITHOUT DILUTING THE ENERGY
ON A GLOBAL SCALE.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:55.850 align:middle line:84%
BUT THE MAIN ONE
IS THAT THEIR SOLUTIONS

00:16:55.850 --> 00:17:00.950 align:middle line:84%
NEED TO INVOLVE NOT CREATING
ANY NEW VIOLATIONS OF ANYONE.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.290 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT HAS ACTUALLY FILTERED
OUT A NUMBER OF GROUPS

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.560 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.089 align:middle line:84%
THAT THEY HAVE
THE RIGHT ANSWERS,

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:09.730 align:middle line:84%
AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO
IMPOSE IT ON OTHER PEOPLE.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:13.530 align:middle line:84%
SO, FOR ME, ONE OF MY TEACHERS
IN ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY,

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:16.240 align:middle line:84%
STEFAN MOLYNEUX,
SAID IT VERY BEAUTIFULLY.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.640 align:middle line:84%
HE SAID THAT,
"REASON LEADS TO VIRTUE,

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.270 align:middle line:90%
AND VIRTUE LEADS TO HAPPINESS."

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.780 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT'S KIND OF AN EQUATION

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:27.849 align:middle line:84%
FOR THE CORE ETHIC
THAT WE'RE SEEING

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:30.720 align:middle line:84%
THAT IS, FIRST OF ALL, NECESSARY
IF WE'RE GOING TO SURVIVE,

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:90%
MUCH LESS THRIVE AS A SPECIES.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.790 align:middle line:84%
WE HAVE TO FIND THIS CORE ETHIC
OF NON-VIOLATION.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:38.790 align:middle line:84%
AND SECONDLY,
THE MORE WE ALIGN WITH THAT

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.890 align:middle line:84%
AND THE MORE EFFECTIVELY
WE COMMUNICATE IT,

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.160 align:middle line:84%
THE MORE WE'RE DOING IT
ARTISTICALLY,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:84%
WHETHER THAT BE THROUGH
COMPASSIONATE SPEAKING

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.870 align:middle line:84%
OR SINGING OR DANCING
OR FILMMAKING

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:84%
OR MUSIC OR WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S THAT CORE ALIGNMENT

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.680 align:middle line:84%
WITH THE OBJECTIVE TRUTH
OF MORALITY --

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.010 align:middle line:90%
OF CORE MORALITY --

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:84%
THAT I THINK IS THE ESSENCE
OF THE THRIVE MOVEMENT

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.080 align:middle line:84%
THAT WILL HAVE IT GO WAY BEYOND
ANYTHING WE ENVISION,

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
WAY BEYOND OUR LIFETIME,
BECAUSE IT'S REAL,

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:10.590 align:middle line:84%
AND PEOPLE ARE CLAIMING IT AS
THEIR OWN IF IT FITS FOR THEM.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:14.830 align:middle line:84%
-AT THIS POINT IN THE INTERVIEW,
THE THRIVE MOVEMENT

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
BEGAN SOUNDING MORE AND MORE
LIKE A STAGE

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.930 align:middle line:84%
UPON WHICH THE PROPS AND SET
ARE THERE

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.000 align:middle line:84%
TO MAKE EVOLUTION EFFORTLESS
AND IRRESISTIBLE.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:84%
UPON A STAGE,
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.140 align:middle line:90%
ANY SCENARIO CAN PLAY OUT.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.880 align:middle line:84%
HOWEVER, THIS STAGE
TENDS TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:90%
TO WHAT REALLY MATTERS.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.680 align:middle line:84%
ON THIS STAGE,
YOU PAY ATTENTION TO THE PEOPLE,

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:37.450 align:middle line:90%
NOT THE ADVERTISEMENTS.

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:84%
FOSTER AND KIMBERLY ARE ALIGNED
ON THE AIM OF WAKING PEOPLE UP

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.420 align:middle line:84%
FROM THE HYPNOSIS OF PLACING
THE PRIORITY OF POSSESSIONS

00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.360 align:middle line:90%
HIGHER THAN RELATIONSHIPS,

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:84%
A STRANGE HYPNOSIS THAT LEADS TO
A LOSS OF PURPOSE AND MEANING.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.570 align:middle line:84%
IT ALWAYS SEEMS THAT THE PEOPLE
WHO FELT LOVE FOR ANOTHER HUMAN

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.940 align:middle line:84%
ARE THE ONES WHO UNDERSTAND
THE SIMPLICITY

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.170 align:middle line:90%
AND THE IMPORTANCE

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.810 align:middle line:84%
OF APPROACHING ANY EVOLUTIONARY
MODEL OR MOVEMENT

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:84%
FROM THE HEART
RATHER THAN THE HEAD.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.640 align:middle line:90%
THE HEAD ONLY TAKES CHARGE

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:84%
WHEN THE HEART KNOWS NOT
WHAT IT WANTS.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.580 align:middle line:84%
BUT ANY HEART THAT HAS TASTED
THE REAL THING

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
SETS FIRE TO THE MIND
AND REORGANIZES ITS PRIORITIES.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.020 align:middle line:84%
ROB, IN THE PAGE FAMILY,
SAYS IT BEST.

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:26.500 align:middle line:84%
IF ANY PLATFORM
FOR LARGE-SCALE PLANETARY CHANGE

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:90%
IS OFFERED TO HUMANITY,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:84%
ITS ONLY CHANCE AT SURVIVING
PEOPLE'S SHORT ATTENTION SPAN

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.540 align:middle line:90%
IS BY KEEPING IT ADAPTABLE,

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:84%
FUELING IT DAILY
WITH NEW INSPIRATION,

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:84%
THE SAME WAY A COUPLE TRIMS
ANY UNNECESSARY DRAMA

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:84%
OUT OF THE RELATIONSHIP
OVER TIME.

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:84%
ANY MOVEMENT THAT THE PEOPLE
ARE GOING TO STICK WITH

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.290 align:middle line:90%
MUST BE INSPIRING TO EVERYONE.

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:49.920 align:middle line:84%
AND AS WE MENTIONED
IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODES,

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:84%
INSPIRATION CHANGES
WITH EVERY PASSING MOMENT,

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.030 align:middle line:84%
WHICH MEANS THAT THE MODEL
WE WOULD HAVE TO BUILD

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:84%
IN ORDER TO REPRESENT
WHAT WE WANT TO WORK TOWARDS

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.800 align:middle line:84%
WOULD HAVE TO BE
INSTANTANEOUSLY ADAPTABLE.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:05.440 align:middle line:84%
WHEN YOU TAKE SOMETHING IN ITS
RAW FORM, CHANGING IT IS EASY,

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.340 align:middle line:84%
BUT FIRST, YOU HAVE TO ENVISION
THE DIRECTION YOU MUST TAKE

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:84%
TO MAKE IT REPRESENT
WHAT YOU SEEK FROM IT.

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:15.310 align:middle line:84%
WHITTLING IT DOWN,
LITTLE BY LITTLE,

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:84%
EVERY LITTLE CHANGE YOU MAKE
TO IT

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.550 align:middle line:84%
UNCOVERS SOMETHING ELSE YOU
WEREN'T EVEN ABLE TO CONSIDER

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.290 align:middle line:90%
UNTIL YOU MADE THAT ADJUSTMENT.

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:24.490 align:middle line:90%
EACH LAYER YOU PEEL BACK

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.990 align:middle line:84%
REVEALS UNSEEN OBSTACLES
AND UNEXPECTED BEAUTY.

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:30.730 align:middle line:90%
IT HAS TO HAPPEN IN A PROCESS.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.460 align:middle line:90%
EACH EVENT LEADS TO THE NEXT,

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:35.300 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN,
GRADUALLY AND CONSISTENTLY,

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:90%
THE VISION STARTS TO DIAL IN.

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.170 align:middle line:90%
WHAT WAS ONCE A RAW IDEA

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.340 align:middle line:84%
HAS NOW BEEN PUT THROUGH
A PROCESS OF ART.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:84%
THE IDEA EMERGES
FROM THAT PROCESS REBORN,

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.250 align:middle line:84%
COMPLETELY NEW,
YET MADE UP OF ALL THAT IS OLD,

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
SHOWING US THAT THE BEAUTY
OF ANY IDEA

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.920 align:middle line:84%
IS HIDDEN WITHIN IT
UNTIL THE ARTIST REVEALS IT.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.320 align:middle line:84%
AND NOW THE WRINKLES OF AGE
SET IN

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.590 align:middle line:84%
TO TELL THE STORY
THAT IS BEING WRITTEN

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.030 align:middle line:90%
RIGHT NOW IN FRONT OF US.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:84%
EVERY MOMENT OF YOUR LIFE
IS AN ALTERATION

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
OF THE RAW THING
YOU WERE GIVEN AT BIRTH.

00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
WHATEVER YOU CONSIDER
YOUR LIFE TO BE,

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.670 align:middle line:90%
HOWEVER YOU CHOOSE TO VIEW IT,

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:13.710 align:middle line:84%
IT IS A RESULT OF CARVING AWAY
AND WHITTLING DOWN THE STORY

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.910 align:middle line:90%
OF THE ROAD YOU TOOK,

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.440 align:middle line:90%
AND AT EVERY SECOND,

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.250 align:middle line:84%
YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO MAKE A NEW ROAD

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:21.750 align:middle line:90%
AND CHANGE THAT STORY.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I LIKE KNOWING THAT PEOPLE THIS
PASSIONATE FOR ONE ANOTHER EXIST

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.750 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE I SEE WHERE THEIR VISION
COMES FROM,

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:84%
LIKE A MOTHER WHO LOVES
HER CHILD UNCONDITIONALLY.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:84%
THAT SAME UNCONDITIONAL PATIENCE
AND ADAPTABLE ATTENTION

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:39.770 align:middle line:84%
IS THE ONLY PLACE TO APPROACH
CHANGE ON A PLANETARY SCALE.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.430 align:middle line:84%
FOSTER AND KIMBERLY
ARE JUST TWO PEOPLE

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:44.800 align:middle line:84%
THAT CAN SEE THE ELEPHANT
IN THE ROOM

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:48.170 align:middle line:84%
THAT NO ONE IS ADDRESSING,
AND THEY INTEND TO ADDRESS IT

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:52.010 align:middle line:84%
TO EVERYONE WHO CAN'T SEE IT,
AND THAT'S MOST OF US.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.980 align:middle line:84%
THEY SEEM TO APPROACH THE ETHICS
OF THE THRIVE MOVEMENT

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.380 align:middle line:84%
BASED UPON THE DEEPEST LESSONS
THEIR LIVES HAVE TAUGHT THEM.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.420 align:middle line:90%
HUMBLE AND HONEST,

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.220 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS REFRESHING TO HEAR WHAT
INSPIRES KIMBERLY EVERY DAY.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:84%
-I'M WATCHING MY WRINKLY ARMS
AND HANDS AND STUFF,

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.760 align:middle line:90%
AND I JUST LOVE IT.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
I FEEL SO GRATEFUL
THAT I LOVE IT,

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
'CAUSE I KNOW THE WHOLE
AGING THING IN THIS CULTURE

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:90%
IS JUST HORRIBLE FOR WOMEN.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:23.140 align:middle line:84%
IT'S LIKE IF YOU'RE NOT YOUNG,
THERE'S NO USE FOR YOU.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:26.380 align:middle line:84%
AND THANKFULLY,
I'M NOT EXPERIENCING THAT,

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:90%
AND INSTEAD, I'M FEELING IT

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:84%
LIKE MY BODY'S THIS CONSTANT
SPIRITUAL TEACHER

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:35.750 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE IT'S SO TRANSIENT,
LIKE EVERYTHING,

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:40.930 align:middle line:84%
AND I'M WATCHING MYSELF KIND OF
WRINKLE OUT OF IT IN SOME WAY.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:90%
-OKAY.

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.260 align:middle line:84%
AGAIN, IT TOOK ME
A COUPLE LISTENS

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.300 align:middle line:84%
TO GET HOW MANY LAYERS
YOU CAN FIND IN HER ANALOGY.

00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:52.870 align:middle line:84%
THE BODY IS A TEACHER
BECAUSE IT NEVER STOPS CHANGING.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.770 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN'T PRESS "PAUSE"
AND ASK FOR A NEW ONE.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:58.980 align:middle line:84%
YOU SIMPLY FIND A WAY TO ACCEPT
THE ONE THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.150 align:middle line:84%
AND EMBRACE THE FACT THAT,
EVENTUALLY, YOU'LL GIVE IT BACK.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:84%
SO THE VERY FACT
THAT YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.390 align:middle line:84%
THROUGH THIS THING
YOU CALL YOUR BODY --

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:09.990 align:middle line:84%
MEAT AND BONES,
BLOOD AND ELECTRICITY --

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:90%
FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE,

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.030 align:middle line:84%
YOU ARE STILL GETTING TO KNOW
THIS THING, YOUR BODY.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
EVERY TIME YOU THINK YOU HAVE IT
FIGURED OUT, IT CHANGES.

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:22.930 align:middle line:84%
THINGS YOUR BODY COULDN'T HANDLE
BEFORE ARE NOW PRIMED AND READY.

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:26.170 align:middle line:84%
THINGS IT LOVED TO DO BEFORE
ARE NOW PAINFUL.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.740 align:middle line:90%
AND THEN, IT SLOWLY SLIPS AWAY,

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:84%
AND YOU CAN NO LONGER
CALL IT YOURS.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.350 align:middle line:84%
UNDERSTANDING
THAT THERE'S ONLY A SHORT TIME

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:90%
TO FIGURE YOURSELF OUT HERE,

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:84%
IT CAN AT LEAST BE A STORY
YOU ENJOY HEARING.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:84%
IF LEGENDARY CHANGE
IS AT THE DOOR,

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:43.220 align:middle line:84%
THERE'S NO POINT
IN KEEPING IT WAITING.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.860 align:middle line:90%
AND CHANGE IS A FAMILY AFFAIR.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.230 align:middle line:90%
WHEN YOU CHANGE,

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:50.330 align:middle line:84%
THE WHOLE DYNAMIC OF THE PEOPLE
AROUND YOU WILL SHIFT.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.730 align:middle line:84%
SOME PEOPLE HAVE LET
CONSPIRACY THEORIES

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.270 align:middle line:90%
AND PSYCHEDELIC RABBIT HOLES

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:90%
BECOME MORE IMPORTANT

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.040 align:middle line:84%
THAN EXPLORING THE MIND-ALTERING
AND PARADIGM-SHATTERING FORCE

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.370 align:middle line:90%
OF THE HEART.

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:03.140 align:middle line:84%
GETTING CARRIED AWAY
IN DIMENSIONS OF MORALITY,

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.340 align:middle line:84%
IDEAS OF SPIRITUALITY,
AND THEORIES OF THE OCCULT

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:09.650 align:middle line:84%
ARE ALL MEANINGLESS
WITHOUT EXPERIENCING THEM.

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.120 align:middle line:84%
REMEMBER, YOU ARE WHITTLING DOWN
THE EXCESS OF YOUR LIFE

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.950 align:middle line:90%
TO REVEAL WHO YOU REALLY ARE,

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:middle line:84%
AND SOMETIMES THE ONLY ONES
WHO CAN SEE WHO WE TRULY ARE

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.190 align:middle line:84%
HAPPEN TO BE THE ONES
WE CHOOSE TO LOVE, TRUST,

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.700 align:middle line:90%
AND EXPLORE THIS NEW ROAD WITH.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:84%
-THAT IS THE ART
OF THE STRUGGLE.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:33.000 align:middle line:84%
IT'S HOW TO BE BOTH DISTINCT
AND TRUE TO OURSELVES

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.840 align:middle line:90%
AND TRULY UNITED WITH ANOTHER.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.480 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S THE DANCE
THAT WAS A CHALLENGE FOR ME.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.510 align:middle line:84%
I THINK IT'S A CHALLENGE
IN GENERAL IN RELATIONSHIPS

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:42.810 align:middle line:90%
AND IN COMMUNITIES

00:24:42.810 --> 00:24:45.820 align:middle line:84%
AND COUNTRY TO COUNTRY
AND PLANET TO PLANET.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.090 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE,
"HOW DO YOU STAY SOVEREIGN

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.220 align:middle line:90%
AND STILL IN UNION?"

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:84%
I'M REALLY GRATEFUL, BECAUSE
I WAS SO FIERCELY INDEPENDENT

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.760 align:middle line:90%
THAT, FOR ME, IT WAS MUCH HARDER

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.500 align:middle line:84%
TO JUST KIND OF MELT
INTO A RELATIONSHIP,

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:84%
AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO DO THAT WITH YOU,

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.500 align:middle line:90%
AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:11.410 align:middle line:84%
-TO HAVE THE JUST KIND
OF HONORING AND COMPASSION

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:13.210 align:middle line:90%
THAT A TRUE LOVER IS

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.380 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT I AM GETTING
TO EXPERIENCE WITH KIMBERLY

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:18.720 align:middle line:90%
GIVES ME STRENGTH

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.790 align:middle line:84%
BEYOND ANYTHING THAT I KNEW
WAS POSSIBLE,

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT TURNS AROUND
AND HAS ME TAKE LIMITS OFF

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:84%
WHAT I THINK IS POSSIBLE FOR ME
TO ACCOMPLISH DURING MY LIFETIME

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH AND
VALIDATION OF THIS PARTNERSHIP,

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.470 align:middle line:90%
SO I'M TRULY GRATEFUL.
