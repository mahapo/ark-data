00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.430 align:middle line:84%
-THE FIRST EDITION
OF "LOOSE CHANGE"

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.900 align:middle line:90%
WAS VERY UNDERGROUND.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:84%
THERE WAS NO GOOGLE VIDEO,
THERE WAS NO YouTube.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:90%
THE FILM WAS DISTRIBUTED

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.340 align:middle line:84%
PRIMARILY THROUGH TORRENT SITES
AND FILE-SHARING.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.580 align:middle line:84%
AND IT DIDN'T REALLY HIT
THAT SWELL

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.780 align:middle line:84%
UNTIL THE SECOND EDITION
CAME OUT LATER THAT YEAR.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.650 align:middle line:84%
-CHARLIE SHEEN CONTACTED ME
THIS WEEK,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.880 align:middle line:84%
AND HE WANTS TO BE
THE VOICEOVER FOR FINAL CUT.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.450 align:middle line:90%
-YEAH, HE WAS TELLING ME THAT.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW,
CHARLIE KNEW ABOUT 9/11.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.020 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN HE SAW "LOOSE CHANGE"
AND HE FINALLY CLICKED AND SAID,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:90%
"I JUST GOT TO SAY SOMETHING."

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.390 align:middle line:84%
-YOU KNOW, WHEN I GOT
THAT DELIVERY

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:84%
OF THE FIRST 1,000 DVDs
OF "LOOSE CHANGE,"

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:90%
I THOUGHT THAT WAS GONNA BE IT.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:84%
I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD
EVENTUALLY SELL THOSE

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:84%
OVER THE COURSE
OF A COUPLE MONTHS,

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.640 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN PEOPLE WOULD STOP
CARING AND THAT WOULD BE THAT.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.110 align:middle line:84%
BUT THEY WENT PRETTY QUICKLY,
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT,

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.470 align:middle line:84%
I WAS PUTTING IN ANOTHER ORDER
FOR ANOTHER 1,000,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.780 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN ANOTHER 1,000,
AND THEN ANOTHER 1,000.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.250 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN KPFK CONTACTED US,
AND THEY WANTED 10,000.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:84%
AND I WAS ON MY WAY
OUT THE FRONT DOOR,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
AND CHESTER KIND OF STOPPED ME
AND WAS LIKE,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:90%
"I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE, LIKE,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:84%
"FINISHING UP THIS NEW EDITION
OF THE FILM.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.289 align:middle line:84%
"GOOGLE IS STARTING
THIS NEW VIDEO-SHARING SERVICE

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.729 align:middle line:84%
"WHERE YOU CAN UPLOAD,
YOU KNOW, VIDEOS,

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:84%
"AND YOU CAN UPLOAD
FULL FILMS IF YOU WANT.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.259 align:middle line:90%
PEOPLE CAN CHECK THEM OUT."

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:84%
AND I KIND OF BLEW IT OFF AT THE
TIME, KIND OF SHRUGGED IT OFF.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.100 align:middle line:84%
I WAS JUST LIKE,
"WELL, I DON'T KNOW

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
"IF ANYONE'S GONNA WANT TO WATCH
A FULL FILM ONLINE.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.810 align:middle line:84%
"I DON'T KNOW
IF ANYONE'S GONNA WANT TO SIT

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.140 align:middle line:84%
IN FRONT OF THEIR COMPUTER FOR
AN HOUR AND A HALF, TWO HOURS."

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:84%
AND I TURNED OUT TO BE
VERY, VERY WRONG ABOUT THAT

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.580 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE GOOGLE VIDEO WAS THE
WHOLE REASON WE BECAME POPULAR.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:84%
AND THE FUNNY THING IS,
WE WEREN'T THE ONES

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:84%
THAT PUT "LOOSE CHANGE"
ON GOOGLE VIDEO.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:84%
NOT THAT WE DIDN'T WANT IT
ON THERE.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.290 align:middle line:84%
IT'S JUST IT NEVER REALLY
OCCURRED TO US TO DO IT.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.230 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS ONLY UNTIL OTHER PEOPLE
STARTED UPLOADING IT,

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.430 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN PEOPLE IN OTHER
COUNTRIES STARTED TRANSLATING IT

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:84%
AND RE-UPLOADING IT
IN THEIR LANGUAGES...

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
I THINK, YOU KNOW, GOOGLE VIDEO
AND "LOOSE CHANGE"

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
BOTH KIND OF HIT THEIR SWELL
AT THE SAME TIME.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:84%
BEFORE WE KNEW IT, THE STORY
ESSENTIALLY WENT VIRAL.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.060 align:middle line:84%
-IN 1958,
AT THE PEAK OF THE COLD WAR,

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.829 align:middle line:84%
ARPA WAS CREATED BY PRESIDENT
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER.

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.870 align:middle line:84%
-WE MUST TAKE IMMEDIATE
AND RESOLUTE ACTION.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
-ARPA BROUGHT IN BBN TO ASSIST
IN CREATING A WAY

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:90%
TO NETWORK COMPUTERS TOGETHER.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS CALLED ARPANET.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.079 align:middle line:90%
JUST 15 YEARS LATER,

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
LEADING ENGINEERS BEGAN
CONNECTING ARPANET WITH PRNET,

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.490 align:middle line:84%
USING RADIO SIGNALS TO CONNECT
COMPUTER NETWORKS.

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:84%
BY 1976,
THE PROJECT WAS COMPLETE.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
THE FOLLOWING YEAR,
A CONNECTION WAS CONSTRUCTED

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.430 align:middle line:84%
TO LINK ARPANET AND PRNET
TO SATNET.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.300 align:middle line:84%
THIS SOON BECAME TERMED
"INTERNETWORKING,"

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:84%
OR THE INTERNET, IF YOU'RE INTO
THE WHOLE BREVITY THING.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:84%
THEN, BY 1990, A GENTLEMAN
NAMED TIM BERNERS-LEE

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.410 align:middle line:84%
ENGINEERED AN INTERFACE
FOR THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:90%
TO USE THE INTERNET.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.150 align:middle line:84%
THIS WAS THE BIRTH OF THE WORLD
WIDE WEB AS WE KNOW IT TODAY.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:90%
IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.120 align:middle line:84%
AT LEAST THE PARTS
WE'RE TOLD ABOUT,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.790 align:middle line:84%
THIS MAY BE
THE MOST PIVOTAL MOMENT YET.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.790 align:middle line:90%
PRIOR TO THE 1990s,

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:90%
IDEAS WERE SHARED BY TELEVISION,

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:90%
PRINT...

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:90%
RADIO...

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.900 align:middle line:90%
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANIES...

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
AND VERY SLOWLY
BY MERGING CULTURES.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.240 align:middle line:84%
THEN COMES THE INTERNET,
LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.409 align:middle line:84%
IDEAS ARE NOW SPREAD ACROSS
BORDERS AND OCEANS INSTANTLY,

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.020 align:middle line:84%
UNFILTERED BY MARKETING
ENGINEERS AND INVESTORS.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:84%
INSTANTANEOUS SHARING OF
AUTHENTIC AND RAW INSPIRATION.

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS THE RISE
OF A NEW ARTISTIC RENAISSANCE,

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.230 align:middle line:90%
A REVOLUTION OF CREATIVITY.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.830 align:middle line:84%
HISTORICALLY IN THESE MOMENTS,
IDEAS BECOME VIRAL,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
AND EVERYONE WHO SIMPLY LISTENS
IS INFECTED.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.640 align:middle line:84%
NOT A SINGLE PERSON
IS IMMUNE TO NEW IDEAS,

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.040 align:middle line:84%
ESPECIALLY WHEN RIDDLED
WITH TRUTH.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:90%
NOW THESE IDEAS CAN BE SHARED

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:84%
ALL ACROSS THE GLOBE
IN REAL TIME.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.350 align:middle line:84%
11 YEARS AFTER THE INTERNET
WAS BORN,

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:84%
THREE WORLD TRADE CENTER
BUILDINGS FELL.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
IN ANY NATION, A LARGE TRAGEDY
IS A DEFINING MOMENT.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.990 align:middle line:84%
PEOPLE RALLY TOGETHER.
PEOPLE RALLY APART.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.490 align:middle line:84%
RELATIONSHIPS ARE REPAIRED,
AND OTHERS ARE DESTROYED.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:90%
TALK OF CONSPIRACY SOON CAME UP.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:84%
"DID OUR GOVERNMENT
JUST ATTACK US?

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.870 align:middle line:84%
"OR IS THE OFFICIAL STORY
CORRECT?"

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.570 align:middle line:84%
THIS ISSUE BECAME
QUITE SENSITIVE.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.870 align:middle line:84%
AND WHEN YOU FIND SENSITIVITY
IN A PATIENT OF MEDICINE,

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.640 align:middle line:84%
PSYCHOLOGY,
AND EVEN SPIRITUALITY,

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.680 align:middle line:90%
THAT IS ALWAYS A BIG RED ARROW

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.650 align:middle line:84%
POINTING DIRECTLY
AT THE TAPROOT OF CHANGE.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.890 align:middle line:90%
MANY PEOPLE CONCERN THEMSELVES

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.659 align:middle line:84%
WITH PROVING OR DISPROVING
THE SPECIFICS OF 9/11.

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.190 align:middle line:84%
THIS, HOWEVER,
IS A SHOW ABOUT ART

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:84%
AND ITS ABILITY TO BLAZE A TRAIL
THROUGH THE NONSENSE

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:84%
IN ORDER TO DISCOVER
A LIVING PURPOSE.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.870 align:middle line:84%
SO, INSTEAD, LET'S EXPLORE HOW
THIS DEFINING MOMENT IN HISTORY,

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:90%
COUPLED WITH THE WORLD WIDE WEB,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.240 align:middle line:84%
GAVE BIRTH TO A GENERATION
OF QUESTIONS.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.780 align:middle line:84%
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT HOW CONSPIRACY CULTURE

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.880 align:middle line:84%
BECAME A PART
OF MAINSTREAM POP CULTURE,

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.750 align:middle line:90%
AND HOW THAT WAS INSTRUMENTAL

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.220 align:middle line:84%
IN THE AWAKENING OF INFINITY
IN THE MINDS OF MILLIONS.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.590 align:middle line:84%
ART CAN MAKE
YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.560 align:middle line:84%
ABOUT THE WORLD
THAT YOU LIVE IN,

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.860 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT'S WHAT
I'M TRULY INTERESTED IN.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:84%
I WANT TO GET PEOPLE THINKING
ABOUT THE WORLD.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.200 align:middle line:84%
I KNOW THAT I DON'T HAVE IT
ALL FIGURED OUT.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.540 align:middle line:84%
I ALSO KNOW
THAT NOBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:45.540 align:middle line:84%
REALLY HAS EVERYBODY ELSE'S LIFE
FIGURED OUT FOR THEM,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.909 align:middle line:84%
SO NOBODY SHOULD REALLY BE
PUSHING THEIR AGENDA

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.409 align:middle line:90%
OR THEIR OPINIONS ON OTHERS.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.080 align:middle line:84%
HOWEVER, I BELIEVE IT
TO BE VERY IMPORTANT

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:90%
TO BRING UP SORE SUBJECTS.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.890 align:middle line:84%
-"LOOSE CHANGE"
WAS ONE BIG ACCIDENT.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.150 align:middle line:90%
AND IT WAS ONLY UNTIL I STARTED

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.050 align:middle line:84%
TO ACTUALLY LOOK INTO THE EVENTS
OF THE DAY,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:84%
ACTUALLY STARTED
TO DO THE RESEARCH...

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.160 align:middle line:84%
ESSENTIALLY, "LOOSE CHANGE"
CAME ABOUT BECAUSE I WAS --

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:84%
I GOT TIRED OF HAVING
THE SAME CONVERSATIONS

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.400 align:middle line:84%
AND TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE
AND GOING OVER THE SAME THINGS.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.030 align:middle line:84%
AND, LIKE, I FELT LIKE I WAS
ALWAYS REPEATING MYSELF.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I REALIZED THERE WAS A BETTER
WAY TO DO IT.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.840 align:middle line:84%
LIKE, "THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER
WAY TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%
THAN TO JUST
TELL PEOPLE MY OPINION,

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.780 align:middle line:84%
AND JUST START TO TELL PEOPLE
ABOUT THE FACTS."

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.140 align:middle line:90%
AND TRUTH FILMS ALLOW PEOPLE

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.480 align:middle line:84%
TO KIND OF DIGEST
THE INFORMATION ON THEIR OWN,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:90%
AND KIND OF WATCH IT

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:84%
WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE
THEY'RE READY TO WATCH IT.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:84%
THERE WERE A LOT OF UPS AND
DOWNS IN THE MAKING OF THE FILM,

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.159 align:middle line:84%
AND THERE WERE CERTAINLY TIMES
WHERE I WAS WONDERING

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:84%
IF, "A," I WAS EVER GONNA
FINISH THE FILM,

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.890 align:middle line:84%
AND "B," IF I DID FINISH IT,
IF ANYONE WAS GONNA CARE.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IT'S 2004, 2005.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:84%
SO, IN MY MIND, THE SHIP
HAD ALREADY STARTED TO SAIL,

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:84%
AND, YOU KNOW, I HAD ALREADY
STARTED TO MISS THE BOAT.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.140 align:middle line:84%
I FELT THAT, YOU KNOW,
I MISSED THAT OPPORTUNITY

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.940 align:middle line:84%
TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.710 align:middle line:84%
BUT I HAD STILL DONE
ALL THIS WORK

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.750 align:middle line:84%
AND I HAD SPENT TWO, THREE YEARS
OR SO WORKING ON IT,

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.620 align:middle line:84%
SO I COULDN'T JUST THROW IT
ALL AWAY AND JUST GIVE UP.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:84%
SO, YOU KNOW, I TOLD MYSELF
THAT NO MATTER WHAT IT TOOK,

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.120 align:middle line:90%
I WAS GONNA FINISH THAT FILM.

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:11.590 align:middle line:90%
AFTER CINDY SHEEHAN'S SON DIED,

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.160 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, SHE BECAME
SORT OF A PUBLIC FIGURE,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.560 align:middle line:84%
AND BEFORE SHE KNEW IT, SHE WAS
BEING OFFERED SPEAKING TOURS

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.330 align:middle line:84%
AND ENGAGEMENTS
AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
SO SHE EVENTUALLY MADE HER WAY
TO OUR LOCAL COLLEGE, S.U.C.O.

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
WE WERE FINISHING UP
THE SECOND EDITION AT THE TIME.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.570 align:middle line:90%
WE HADN'T SENT IT OFF TO PRINT,

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.570 align:middle line:84%
BUT WE HAD THREE DVDs
THAT WE BURNED

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:84%
OF WHAT WAS ESSENTIALLY
THE FINAL CUT OF THE FILM.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
AND WE HAD JUST PRINTED UP
THESE SHIRTS

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.809 align:middle line:84%
THAT SAID "INVESTIGATE 9/11"
ON THEM,

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.350 align:middle line:90%
SO WE WERE FEELING PRETTY COCKY.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.950 align:middle line:84%
SO, LIKE, WE PUT ON OUR
"INVESTIGATE 9/11" SHIRTS,

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
WE HAD OUR BURNED COPIES
OF THE FILM.

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.950 align:middle line:84%
WE WERE LIKE, "LET'S GO
TO CINDY SHEEHAN'S EVENT

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.460 align:middle line:90%
AND, LET'S GIVE CINDY A COPY."

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.860 align:middle line:84%
RIGHT WHEN WE WALKED IN,
TO OUR LEFT,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.630 align:middle line:84%
WE RECOGNIZED
ONE OF THE LOCAL NEWS ANCHORS.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.830 align:middle line:84%
"THAT'S DOUG COLE.
WE SEE HIM EVERY EVENING.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.930 align:middle line:84%
OH, MY GOD,
HE'S HERE TO COVER THE EVENT."

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.330 align:middle line:90%
SO WE KIND OF WALKED PAST HIM,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.340 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN WE WENT OVER
AND GRABBED OUR SEATS.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.270 align:middle line:84%
AND WE WERE LIKE,
"LET'S GO TALK TO DOUG."

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.240 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW?
LIKE, "LET'S GO GIVE HIM A DVD."

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.310 align:middle line:84%
BEFORE WE COULD SAY ANYTHING
TO DOUG, DOUG POINTS AT US,

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.850 align:middle line:84%
HE'S LIKE, "CAN I INTERVIEW
YOU GUYS ABOUT YOUR SHIRTS?

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:08.950 align:middle line:84%
WHAT'S THIS WHOLE
'INVESTIGATE 9/11' THING?"

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.720 align:middle line:84%
SO BEFORE WE KNEW IT, WE WERE
BEING INTERVIEWED FOR WICZ FOX.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.190 align:middle line:90%
HE WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, WELL,

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.820 align:middle line:84%
LET'S GET AWAY FROM THE
CONSPIRACY THEORY FOR A BIT."

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.590 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, LIKE, WE PRETTY MUCH
LAID IT ALL OUT, YOU KNOW?

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:21.590 align:middle line:84%
WE TALKED ABOUT
THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
THAT WE HAD AT THE TIME,
WHICH WAS BUILDING SEVEN,

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:90%
THINGS OF THAT NATURE.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.230 align:middle line:84%
SO, WE WRAPPED UP THE INTERVIEW,
WE GAVE HIM THE DVD,

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.140 align:middle line:84%
AND HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I'LL
CHECK IT OUT WHEN I GET HOME.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.540 align:middle line:84%
I'LL TRY TO GET YOU GUYS
ON THE AIR IF I CAN."

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
SO, WE TUNED INTO THE NEWS
THE NEXT NIGHT.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, WE SAW THE PIECE
ON CINDY SHEEHAN,

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:90%
AND WE WEREN'T IN IT.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.780 align:middle line:84%
SO WE WERE LIKE, "OH.
OF COURSE WE'RE NOT IN IT.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
"I MEAN, DID WE ACTUALLY THINK
WE WERE GONNA BE ON FOX?

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.450 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS SILLY OF US."

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.760 align:middle line:84%
SO, THE CINDY SHEEHAN STORY
AIRS,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.230 align:middle line:84%
AND LIKE 5, 10 MINUTES LATER,
MY PHONE STARTS RINGING.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:84%
AND I PICKED IT UP
AND IT WAS DOUG.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.930 align:middle line:84%
AND HE'S LIKE, "YO, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU GUYS JUST WATCHED.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.700 align:middle line:84%
"I'M SORRY. I TRIED TO FIT YOU
IN TO THE CINDY SHEEHAN PIECE,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.130 align:middle line:90%
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK."

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.340 align:middle line:84%
AND I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, WELL,
IT'S COOL. I UNDERSTAND, MAN.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:84%
IT'S LIKE TWO COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT STORIES."

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:90%
HE'S LIKE, "YEAH, I KNOW,

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:08.740 align:middle line:84%
BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU
YOUR OWN STORY."

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.710 align:middle line:84%
SO I WAS LIKE, "REALLY?"
HE'S LIKE, "YEAH.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:90%
"THE ONLY THING IS, LIKE --

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:84%
"I WATCHED YOUR FILM
AND IT'S INCREDIBLE.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.380 align:middle line:84%
"THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF IN THERE
I JUST NEVER HEARD ABOUT.

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.950 align:middle line:90%
"WHAT SHOULD I TALK ABOUT?

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:84%
WHAT SHOULD I COVER
IN THE PIECE?"

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:24.690 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS CRAZY 'CAUSE THIS
REPORTER WAS, LIKE, ASKING ME,

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:90%
"WHAT DO I PUT ON THE AIR?"

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.100 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT, "A,"
WE FELT THAT A REPORTER

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.130 align:middle line:84%
WAS EVEN TAKING
THE INFORMATION SERIOUSLY,

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.630 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT "B," THAT IT WAS
ACTUALLY GONNA BE ON THE AIR

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.870 align:middle line:84%
AND BE TREATED
SOMEWHAT SERIOUSLY.

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.800 align:middle line:90%
WE'RE SITTING IN THE BEDROOM.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.610 align:middle line:84%
WE WERE, LIKE,
GLUED TO THE TELEVISION,

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.640 align:middle line:84%
LIKE, JUST WAITING
FOR THE PIECE TO COME UP.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
THE PROMO CAME UP AND SAID,

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.140 align:middle line:90%
"THREE COLLEGE STUDENTS" --

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:47.310 align:middle line:84%
NONE OF US WERE COLLEGE STUDENTS
AT THE TIME.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.250 align:middle line:84%
"THREE COLLEGE STUDENTS
HAVE MADE A FILM

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.120 align:middle line:84%
"ABOUT A POSSIBLE
GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:90%
ABOUT SEPTEMBER 11th."

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.860 align:middle line:84%
AND WE'RE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT TO HAPPEN."

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:90%
AND THEY STARTED PLAYING A CLIP

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.030 align:middle line:84%
OF THE OPENING CREDITS
WITH THE BEAT GOING

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.600 align:middle line:84%
AND "LOOSE CHANGE
2nd EDITION" ON THE SCREEN.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.230 align:middle line:84%
AND KOREY AND I JUST STARTED,
LIKE, SCREAMING, YOU KNOW?

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.300 align:middle line:84%
JUST LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,
THIS IS HAPPENING!

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.870 align:middle line:84%
"LIKE, THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING.
WE'RE ON TV RIGHT NOW.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.140 align:middle line:90%
THIS INFORMATION IS ON TV."

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:14.940 align:middle line:84%
THE STORY ACTUALLY GOT
SO POPULAR

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.280 align:middle line:84%
THAT IT CRASHED
THREE OF THEIR SERVERS.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:84%
SO, LIKE, THE STORY KEPT GOING
DOWN AND POPPING BACK UP.

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.520 align:middle line:84%
AND OF COURSE EVERYONE'S LIKE,
"OH, THEY'RE GETTING PRESSURE

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:84%
"FROM THE CORPORATE BIGWIGS
AT FOX.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.690 align:middle line:84%
THE GOVERNMENT'S TELLING THEM
TO TAKE DOWN THE STORY."

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:28.420 align:middle line:90%
WICZ DID NOT ONE, NOT TWO,

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.360 align:middle line:84%
BUT THREE DIFFERENT STORIES
ON US IN TOTAL.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:84%
THE FIRST TWO
WAS ALL ABOUT THE EVIDENCE

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.960 align:middle line:90%
AND ALL ABOUT THE FILM ITSELF.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.560 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN THE THIRD STORY WAS ALL
ABOUT THE RESPONSE TO THE STORY,

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.430 align:middle line:84%
AND HOW WE HAD CRASHED
THEIR SERVERS, ESSENTIALLY.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.780 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS THE END OF 2005,

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:55.550 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN 2006
WAS JUST THIS GIANT SNOWBALL

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE IT GOT COVERED ON WICZ,
SO THAT WENT VIRAL,

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.590 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT KIND OF MADE THE ROUNDS
FOR A MONTH OR TWO.

00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:04.090 align:middle line:84%
WE GOT COVERED BY MIKE MALLOY
ON "AIR AMERICA,"

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.590 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT WAS ANOTHER PUSH.

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:07.560 align:middle line:90%
AND THEN, BEFORE WE KNEW IT,

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:84%
WE WERE BEING INTERVIEWED
BY CNN, FOX.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.530 align:middle line:84%
IN JULY 2006, WE WERE
INTERVIEWED BY VANITY FAIR,

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:90%
AND THEY DESCRIBED THE FILM

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:16.540 align:middle line:84%
AS "THE FIRST INTERNET
BLOCKBUSTER,"

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:84%
WHICH IS A QUOTE
THAT I'LL TAKE TO THE GRAVE

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
'CAUSE IT'S PROBABLY
THE MOST GLOWING REVIEW

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:25.040 align:middle line:84%
THAT THE FILM EVER GOT
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.450 align:middle line:90%
I MEAN, AS FAR AS I KNOW,

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:84%
WE WERE THE FIRST FULL-LENGTH
FEATURE FILM TO GO VIRAL,

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:31.250 align:middle line:84%
WHERE PEOPLE WERE, LIKE, SENDING
THE LINK TO ALL THEIR FRIENDS

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.390 align:middle line:84%
AND ALL THEIR FAMILY,
AND POSTING IT ON SITES, LIKE,

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.390 align:middle line:84%
"YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS THING
ON GOOGLE VIDEO."

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.820 align:middle line:90%
GOOGLE VIDEO AND "LOOSE CHANGE"

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.960 align:middle line:84%
BOTH KIND OF HIT THEIR SWELL
AT THE SAME TIME,

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.430 align:middle line:84%
AND IT WAS A REALLY INTERESTING
SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:45.130 align:middle line:90%
THAT WE HAD.

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:47.900 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN, WE WERE NUMBER ONE
ON GOOGLE VIDEO

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.240 align:middle line:84%
FOR AT LEAST
TWO OR THREE MONTHS STRAIGHT.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:53.370 align:middle line:84%
WE WERE SO POPULAR THAT WHEN
STEPHEN COLBERT GAVE HIS SPEECH

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.640 align:middle line:84%
AT THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENCE DINNER,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:90%
WE BEAT THAT.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.310 align:middle line:84%
FOR A LONG TIME, I THOUGHT
THAT I HAD MISSED THE BOAT,

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.850 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT I HAD MISSED
MY OPPORTUNITY

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:02.620 align:middle line:84%
TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE
AT THE RIGHT TIME.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN IT TURNED OUT
THAT THE SECOND EDITION CAME OUT

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.150 align:middle line:84%
AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT PLACE
AND EXACTLY THE RIGHT TIME.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.160 align:middle line:90%
-THE ATTENTION DYLAN HAD SPARKED

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.290 align:middle line:84%
SIMPLY BY CREATING A PIECE
OF AUDIOVISUAL ART

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.660 align:middle line:84%
WAS FAR BEYOND
WHAT HE HAD EXPECTED,

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.200 align:middle line:90%
AS IS ALL REVOLUTIONARY ART.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.800 align:middle line:84%
AND I DON'T USE THE TERM
"REVOLUTIONARY" LIGHTLY.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:84%
"LOOSE CHANGE,"
IN A MATTER OF ONE YEAR,

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.140 align:middle line:84%
CHANGED MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE'S PERCEPTIONS

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.340 align:middle line:84%
OF THE GOVERNMENT,
THE NATION, AND THE WORLD.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS A FILM
CALLED "ZEITGEIST"

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.980 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS RELEASED IN 2007.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.550 align:middle line:90%
THIS FILM SPOKE OF 9/11

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
IN CONTEXT WITH RELIGION
AND CENTRAL BANKING,

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.230 align:middle line:84%
CALLING INTO QUESTION
THEIR VALIDITY.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:49.200 align:middle line:84%
"ZEITGEIST" WENT VIRAL
AND CAUGHT THE ATTENTION

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.760 align:middle line:84%
OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE WOKEN OUT
OF THEIR DAILY SLUMBER

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.830 align:middle line:90%
BY "LOOSE CHANGE."

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.100 align:middle line:84%
AND "LOOSE CHANGE"
WAS ONLY POSSIBLE

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE OF THE SEVERITY
OF WHAT OCCURRED

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.210 align:middle line:90%
ON U.S. SOIL SEPTEMBER 11th.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:84%
AND DYLAN SIMPLY SAID YES
TO AN INSPIRATION

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.180 align:middle line:90%
THAT BEGAN AS A MISTAKE

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.410 align:middle line:84%
AND BECAME
A GENERATIONAL ALARM CLOCK.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:84%
I'VE FOUND THAT THERE'S
AN ACCIDENT FACTOR

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.220 align:middle line:84%
WITH MOST ARTISTS, TO WHERE,
WHEN YOU'RE DOING YOUR THING,

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:84%
YOUR CRAFT,
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.460 align:middle line:84%
IT'S TO THE POINT
TO WHERE IT BECOMES ROUTINE.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:90%
AND ONCE, IT WORKED.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:26.070 align:middle line:84%
AT ONE POINT, IT WAS
THE VERY THING YOU WERE DOING

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:84%
WHEN AN INSPIRING REVELATION
CAME TO YOU,

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.140 align:middle line:84%
AND IT TURNED
INTO VERY BEAUTIFUL ART.

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN YOU KEEP DOING
THAT SAME THING,

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.910 align:middle line:84%
HOPING TO GET THE SAME RESULT
OUT OF IT.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
AND WHAT MOST ARTISTS, I THINK,
REALIZE EVENTUALLY

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.820 align:middle line:84%
IS THAT DOING THE SAME THING
OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.920 align:middle line:84%
DOES NOT ALLOW
FOR A NEW EXPERIENCE.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:84%
AND I THINK THAT INSPIRATION,
OBVIOUSLY,

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:53.390 align:middle line:84%
IS WHAT COMMANDS OUR ATTENTION
AT ANY GIVEN TIME.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.130 align:middle line:84%
AND IF YOUR MIND WANDERS, IT'S
BECAUSE THE INSPIRATION IS LOST.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.470 align:middle line:84%
SO, WHEN AN ARTIST HAS
THAT ACCIDENT MOMENT,

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.400 align:middle line:84%
USUALLY IT'S BECAUSE
THE INSPIRATION HAS BEEN LOST,

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.640 align:middle line:84%
AND THE ONLY WAY
THAT THE INSPIRATION

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:08.370 align:middle line:84%
KNOWS HOW TO MAKE ITSELF PRESENT
WITH YOU AGAIN

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.180 align:middle line:90%
IS TO ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.380 align:middle line:84%
FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE
TO BE AN ACCIDENT TO OCCUR,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.580 align:middle line:90%
WHEN REALLY IT'S A DIVINE MOMENT

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.550 align:middle line:84%
THAT SNAPS YOU BACK
INTO WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.690 align:middle line:90%
"WHY DID THIS HAPPEN?

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.550 align:middle line:90%
"HOW CAN I USE THIS ACCIDENT

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.220 align:middle line:84%
"AND TURN IT
INTO SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL?

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.230 align:middle line:84%
"HOW CAN I USE THE MOMENTUM
OF THIS ACCIDENT

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:32.260 align:middle line:84%
TO PROPEL ME INTO A DIRECTION
THAT I'VE NEVER GONE IN BEFORE?"

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:90%
AND USUALLY THOSE ACCIDENTS

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:38.500 align:middle line:84%
TURN INTO THE VERY MOMENT
THAT RE-INVIGORATES AN ARTIST,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.140 align:middle line:84%
THAT BRINGS THEM BACK INTO
THE PROCESS OF PURE INSPIRATION,

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.810 align:middle line:90%
AND DOING SOMETHING SPECIFICALLY

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.710 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE YOU FEEL
COMPELLED TO DO IT,

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.880 align:middle line:84%
NOT BECAUSE IT'S BECOME
THE ROUTINE

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.150 align:middle line:84%
AND YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S TIME
TO PUT OUT ANOTHER PIECE OF ART,

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:90%
AND YOU JUST DO IT AGAIN.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.390 align:middle line:84%
THAT'LL ALWAYS PRODUCE
SOMETHING.

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO
CONVINCE YOURSELF

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:00.130 align:middle line:90%
AND FOOL OTHER PEOPLE

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.660 align:middle line:84%
INTO BELIEVING THAT THIS IS
MORE REVOLUTIONARY ART

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.930 align:middle line:84%
WHEN, TRULY,
IT'S JUST THE NOSTALGIA

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:11.640 align:middle line:84%
OF THE PREVIOUS REVOLUTIONARY
ART BEING BROUGHT BACK UP AGAIN.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
AND I THINK THAT ACCIDENT FACTOR
IS WHAT DYLAN EXPERIENCED.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.810 align:middle line:90%
I KNOW I'VE EXPERIENCED IT.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:22.250 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT USUALLY TURNS OUT
TO BE THE EXACT RIGHT THING

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:90%
AT THE EXACT RIGHT TIME.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:30.260 align:middle line:84%
THOSE ACCIDENTS ALWAYS SEEM
TO BE THE EXACT RIGHT THING

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:32.790 align:middle line:84%
FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR
AT THAT MOMENT.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:37.660 align:middle line:84%
AND USUALLY COMPLETELY
UNBEKNOWNST TO THE ARTIST,

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
IT'S THE THING THAT WILL CREATE
A REVOLUTION

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
IN THE MINDS OF MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE.

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:48.910 align:middle line:84%
-WE WERE NUMBER ONE
ON GOOGLE VIDEO

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:51.440 align:middle line:84%
FOR AT LEAST
TWO OR THREE MONTHS STRAIGHT.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:54.310 align:middle line:84%
WE WERE SO POPULAR THAT WHEN
STEPHEN COLBERT GAVE HIS SPEECH

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:84%
AT THE WHITE HOUSE
CORRESPONDENCE DINNER,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.480 align:middle line:90%
WE BEAT THAT.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:90%
AND IT'S FUNNY 'CAUSE, LIKE,

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:00.220 align:middle line:84%
NUMBER ONE WOULD BE
"LOOSE CHANGE,"

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN NUMBER SIX WOULD BE,
LIKE, "LOOSE CHANGE" IN SPANISH,

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.990 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN NUMBER 13 WOULD BE
"LOOSE CHANGE" IN FRENCH.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN, WE DOMINATED
GOOGLE VIDEO IN ITS HEYDAY.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T CLICK
ANYWHERE ON THAT SITE

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:10.460 align:middle line:90%
WITHOUT SEEING OUR FILM.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:90%
-THE COUPLING OF THE INTERNET

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:17.400 align:middle line:84%
AND AMAZING NEW CONCEPTS THAT
PEOPLE HAVEN'T PONDERED BEFORE

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.369 align:middle line:84%
CAME TOGETHER,
AND THE ONE "X" FACTOR TO IT

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.640 align:middle line:90%
IS THE DELIVERY OF THAT CONTENT.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:32.320 align:middle line:90%
da VINCI, RAPHAEL, MASACCIO,

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.020 align:middle line:90%
MICHELANGELO, SALVADOR DALí,

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.520 align:middle line:84%
GREAT ARTISTS THAT CHANGED
PEOPLE'S PERSPECTIVE

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:90%
ON THE WORLD --

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.800 align:middle line:84%
THEY DID IT BY DOING SOMETHING
SO REVOLUTIONARY

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
THAT PEOPLE COULD NOT GO BACK TO
THEIR PREVIOUS WAY OF THINKING

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.370 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE ALL THEY SAW
WAS THE NEW PATTERN

00:17:48.370 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:84%
THAT THAT ARTIST
HAD BROUGHT TO LIGHT.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.210 align:middle line:84%
AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT "LOOSE CHANGE" WAS.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.110 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
"ZEITGEIST" WAS.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:57.910 align:middle line:84%
IT BROUGHT PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T
THINKING ABOUT THESE THINGS,

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.140 align:middle line:90%
AND IT OPENED THEIR EYES.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:01.550 align:middle line:84%
AND NOW THEY'RE LOOKING AROUND
ASKING QUESTIONS.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:84%
-WE MANAGED TO GET 3,000 PEOPLE
TO COME TO NEW YORK CITY

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:07.890 align:middle line:84%
ON THE 5-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
OF SEPTEMBER 11th.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.290 align:middle line:90%
WE HAD THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:11.590 align:middle line:84%
WEARING OUR SHIRTS
AND HANDING OUT DVDs.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.890 align:middle line:84%
WE PRINTED UP 10,000 DVDs
AND 600 SHIRTS

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:15.130 align:middle line:90%
AND GAVE THEM ALL AWAY.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.200 align:middle line:84%
YOU COULDN'T WALK ANYWHERE
IN LOWER MANHATTAN

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:19.200 align:middle line:84%
WITHOUT SEEING
AN "INVESTIGATE 9/11" SHIRT,

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.970 align:middle line:84%
AND WITHOUT SOMEONE
HANDING YOU A DVD

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.470 align:middle line:90%
OR OVERHEARING A CONVERSATION.

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.300 align:middle line:84%
WE COMPLETELY TOOK OVER
LOWER MANHATTAN

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:84%
ON THE 5-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
OF SEPTEMBER 11th.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:84%
EVERY ANNIVERSARY
AFTER 9/11/2006

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.050 align:middle line:90%
WAS DIMINISHING RETURNS.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.110 align:middle line:84%
THERE WERE LESS AND LESS PEOPLE
SHOWING UP.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.180 align:middle line:84%
SO WE WENT FROM COMPLETELY
TAKING OVER LOWER MANHATTAN

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.820 align:middle line:90%
AND BEING IN EVERYONE'S FACE

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.350 align:middle line:84%
TO JUST THIS KIND OF
LITTLE BLOCK OVER HERE

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.560 align:middle line:90%
THAT NOBODY WANTED TO GO NEAR.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:46.930 align:middle line:90%
THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:48.830 align:middle line:84%
THAT PUSHED ME AWAY
FROM THE MOVEMENT.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:52.930 align:middle line:84%
BETWEEN JUST ALL THE NEGATIVE
ENERGY THAT I GOT FROM IT,

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:84%
ALL THE DEATH THREATS
AND ALL THE --

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.740 align:middle line:84%
SEEING MY FACE AND MY NAME
EVERYWHERE ON THE INTERNET.

00:18:57.740 --> 00:18:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET
INFORMATION OUT,

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.110 align:middle line:84%
AND I WAS DOING IT
THE ONLY WAY I KNEW HOW,

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:90%
WHICH WAS TO MAKE A FILM.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.110 align:middle line:84%
IT JUST SO HAPPENED THAT
THE FILM GOT INSANELY POPULAR,

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:84%
AND I HAD TO DEAL
WITH THE REPERCUSSIONS

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:08.180 align:middle line:90%
OF THAT POPULARITY.

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.520 align:middle line:84%
MY HEART JUST WASN'T IN IT,
YOU KNOW?

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.620 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS SO TIRING TO JUST SIT
THERE AND JUST, LIKE...

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN ONLY WATCH THAT FOOTAGE
FOR SO LONG

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.920 align:middle line:84%
BEFORE IT REALLY JUST STARTS TO,
LIKE, EAT AWAY AT YOU.

00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN, LIKE, EVERY TIME
THOSE TOWERS COME DOWN,

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.830 align:middle line:84%
YOU'RE WATCHING THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE DIE.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.930 align:middle line:84%
THERE NEEDS TO BE
A MASSIVE CHANGE

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:26.530 align:middle line:90%
IN THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.830 align:middle line:84%
AND THE CULTURE
IN WHICH WE LIVE.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:29.770 align:middle line:84%
SOMEONE NEEDS TO HIT
THE "RESET" BUTTON.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.470 align:middle line:84%
PEOPLE TELL PEOPLE TO WAKE UP
AND SEE THE TRUTH ABOUT 9/11,

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.510 align:middle line:84%
BUT I THINK THAT THEY JUST NEED
TO WAKE UP

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.810 align:middle line:84%
AND SEE THE TRUTH
ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ALIVE

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:38.710 align:middle line:90%
AND THE GIFT THAT WE'RE GIVEN

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.150 align:middle line:84%
WHEN WE'RE PLACED
ONTO THIS PLANET.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.750 align:middle line:90%
-THE FIRST MISCONCEPTION I HAD

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:84%
OF THESE FREE, INDEPENDENT,
AND ANONYMOUS DOCUMENTARIES

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.290 align:middle line:84%
WAS, "WOW, THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING REALLY GOING ON

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:90%
"UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:84%
"THAT I'M JUST NOW
COMING TO FIND OUT ABOUT.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.630 align:middle line:84%
"MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
MUST KNOW ABOUT THIS,

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.470 align:middle line:84%
AND ARE ALREADY WORKING TOGETHER
TO CHANGE THIS."

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:06.370 align:middle line:84%
AND COME TO FIND OUT THAT
IT'S USUALLY JUST ONE INDIVIDUAL

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.380 align:middle line:84%
WORKING ON THEIR LAPTOP
WITH STOCK FOOTAGE

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:13.710 align:middle line:84%
AND SOME CRACKED SOFTWARE
THAT THEY GOT FROM SOMEONE,

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:17.020 align:middle line:84%
WHEREAS BEFORE YOU WOULD NEED
A MILLION-DOLLAR STUDIO

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.050 align:middle line:84%
AND $100,000 WORTH
OF WORK AND PAYROLL

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.850 align:middle line:90%
AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU MIGHT NEED

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:23.360 align:middle line:84%
TO GET A FILM LIKE THIS
TOGETHER.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.830 align:middle line:84%
YOU DON'T NEED ALL THE RESOURCES
AND ALL THE MONEY

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:29.800 align:middle line:84%
AND ALL THE TIME AND ENERGY
IN THE WORLD.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.430 align:middle line:90%
ALL YOU NEED IS AN IDEA

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.300 align:middle line:84%
AND A BEAUTIFUL WAY
TO DELIVER IT.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.930 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S AN ARTIST RIGHT THERE.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.990 align:middle line:84%
-ORDINARY PEOPLE
WITH EXTRAORDINARY IDEAS.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.500 align:middle line:90%
INTERNETWORKING.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.530 align:middle line:90%
SOCIAL NETWORKING.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.240 align:middle line:84%
A SOURCE OF EVER-CHANGING
AND BOUNDLESS IDEAS

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:20.710 align:middle line:84%
LIMITED ONLY BY YOUR CAPACITY
TO IMAGINE BIG AND DREAM FAR.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY
TO MOVE FORWARD IS TO MOVE ON,

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.490 align:middle line:84%
TAKING WITH YOU NOT THE VEHICLE,
BUT THE MOMENTUM IT PROVIDED.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:90%
MANY DREAMS FALL SHORT

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:84%
WHEN THE DREAMER
THINKS THE DREAM TO BE OVER

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:37.760 align:middle line:90%
SIMPLY BECAUSE HE WOKE UP.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:90%
DREAMERS FOLLOW THEIR PASSION

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:43.170 align:middle line:84%
AND USE THEIR BELIEFS
TO PROPEL THEM TOWARDS IT.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:46.670 align:middle line:84%
BELIEF IS NOT A ROAD
NOR A VEHICLE.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.140 align:middle line:90%
IT IS A FUEL.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:50.380 align:middle line:90%
YOU ARE THE VEHICLE,

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.710 align:middle line:84%
AND YOUR BELIEFS
MOVE YOU DOWN THE ROAD

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.310 align:middle line:84%
INTO THE PARTS OF YOUR PASSION
YOU NEVER KNEW EXISTED.

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:58.480 align:middle line:90%
IN THE PREVIOUS EPISODE,

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.150 align:middle line:90%
WE INVITED YOU TO IMAGINE

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:84%
WHY A BLUES PROGRESSION
ON THE PIANO MAKES SENSE

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.560 align:middle line:84%
WHEN A MADMAN HITTING THE KEYS
IS SENSELESS.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.430 align:middle line:90%
IT SIMPLY FEELS RIGHT.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.300 align:middle line:90%
THERE'S A CENTER TO IT,

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.730 align:middle line:84%
A POINT AROUND
WHICH ALL THE NOTES REVOLVE.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.070 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU CAN KEEP
SOMEONE'S ATTENTION

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:20.970 align:middle line:84%
LONG ENOUGH TO TELL A STORY
AND MAKE A POINT,

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.840 align:middle line:90%
PEOPLE JUST MIGHT BELIEVE YOU.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.340 align:middle line:84%
JUST THE FACT THAT THEY ARE
IMAGINING YOUR STORY

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.110 align:middle line:84%
MEANS THEY ARE CREATING A SPACE
IN THEIR MIND

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.350 align:middle line:84%
TO MOVE YOUR IDEA
INTO THEIR BELIEF,

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.190 align:middle line:84%
MEANING THEY ARE WILLING
TO LET YOUR VERSION OF TRUTH

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:90%
BE THE FUEL THAT COMPELS THEM

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:41.060 align:middle line:84%
TO DO SOMETHING
OR EMBODY SOMETHING.

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:84%
WHO CARES IF NO ONE ELSE
BELIEVES WHAT YOU BELIEVE?

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:90%
ITS ONLY PURPOSE IS TO MOVE YOU.

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:51.970 align:middle line:84%
HAND, FOOT, FREIGHT TRAIN --
ANYTHING CAN PUSH YOU.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:54.940 align:middle line:90%
THE MOTION IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.880 align:middle line:90%
SO, WHO IS STEERING?

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.280 align:middle line:84%
IT'S EASY TO SEE
THAT ANYTHING CAN BE VIRAL.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.650 align:middle line:84%
SOME THINGS GO VIRAL
JUST TO MAKE YOU LAUGH.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:90%
[ CRASHING ]

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:90%
SOME MAKE YOU CHEER.

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.090 align:middle line:90%
OTHERS MAKE YOU CRY.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:15.890 align:middle line:84%
BUT SOME OF THEM,
JUST A FEW OF THEM,

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:18.430 align:middle line:84%
CAN SHATTER SUCH AN ILLUSION
OF YOURS

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.330 align:middle line:90%
THAT YOU HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:23.470 align:middle line:84%
BUT TO CHANGE THE ENTIRE
DIRECTION OF YOUR LIFE.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:84%
IN TRUTH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT REALITY IS.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.540 align:middle line:84%
IT'S WHATEVER
MAKES MOST SENSE TO YOU.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.580 align:middle line:84%
IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT IT'S A FACT.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.510 align:middle line:84%
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
IT'S GOING TO BE TRUE TOMORROW.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:37.550 align:middle line:84%
IT JUST MEANS RIGHT NOW, TODAY,
IT MAKES SENSE TO YOU,

00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:40.090 align:middle line:84%
AS IF TODAY YOU'RE IN THE MOOD
FOR ONE KIND OF A SONG,

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.850 align:middle line:84%
AND TOMORROW YOU'RE IN THE MOOD
FOR ANOTHER KIND OF A SONG.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:44.420 align:middle line:90%
TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:47.630 align:middle line:84%
THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU AT TWO
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TIMES.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:48.990 align:middle line:90%
TRUTH IS ELUSIVE.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:90%
TRUTH ISN'T A FIXED THING.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.500 align:middle line:90%
IT'S LIKE THE CLOUDS.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:56.400 align:middle line:84%
THE CLOUDS ARE ALWAYS THERE,
BUT THEY ALWAYS LOOK DIFFERENT.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.440 align:middle line:84%
YOU COULD SAY,
"LOOK UP IN THE CLOUDS.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.970 align:middle line:90%
"THAT ONE LOOKS LIKE A SHEEP."

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
AND EVERYBODY THINKS,
"YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:03.780 align:middle line:84%
"THAT'S WHAT
THE CLOUDS LOOK LIKE."

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.180 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN TWO MINUTES LATER,
THE CLOUDS CHANGE.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:08.810 align:middle line:90%
EVERYTHING AROUND THEM CHANGES.

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:11.820 align:middle line:84%
THE PATTERNS WITHIN THEM CHANGE,
AND SOMEBODY POINTS OUT,

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.550 align:middle line:84%
"YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT LOOKS
MORE LIKE A WOLF TO ME."

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.560 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN EVERYBODY STARTS
FREAKING OUT.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.190 align:middle line:84%
"OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THERE'S WOLVES IN THE SKY."

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.460 align:middle line:84%
IT'S DANGEROUS.
NOW WE HAVE A LAND OF WOLVES.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.570 align:middle line:90%
AND THEN A FEW MINUTES LATER,

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.940 align:middle line:84%
THAT PATTERN CHANGES
AND IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.200 align:middle line:90%
SO, WHICH ONE OF THEM IS TRUE?

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.640 align:middle line:90%
THE CLOUD.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.470 align:middle line:84%
THE CLOUD IS TRUE.
IT'S THE ESSENCE.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:84%
IT'S WHAT THE TRUTH
IS MADE UP OF.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.280 align:middle line:84%
IT'S NOT WHAT
YOU CAN SAY ABOUT IT.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.680 align:middle line:90%
IT'S NOT ANY DETAILS,

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.180 align:middle line:84%
AND IT'S NOT EVEN A SPECIFIC
PATTERN YOU CAN BRING OUT OF IT,

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.220 align:middle line:84%
'CAUSE YOU CAN LOOK AT ANY CLOUD
AND SAY IT LOOKS LIKE ANYTHING.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.790 align:middle line:84%
AND TO YOU, IF IT MAKES SENSE,
THEN THAT'S YOUR TRUTH.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.330 align:middle line:90%
IF YOU'RE CYNICAL OR SKEPTICAL,

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:02.500 align:middle line:84%
OR IF YOU'RE COMPLETELY
GULLIBLE,

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:90%
BOTH OF THOSE ARE AN IMBALANCE

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.610 align:middle line:84%
OF YOU HAVING A PURE VIEW
OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE TO BE TRUE.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:84%
WHATEVER MAKES
MOST SENSE TO YOU.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.720 align:middle line:84%
WHATEVER INSPIRES YOU
RIGHT NOW AT THIS MOMENT,

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.950 align:middle line:90%
THAT IS YOURS.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.460 align:middle line:84%
LET YOUR TRUTH
DO ALL THE STEERING.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.730 align:middle line:90%
LET YOUR INSPIRATION LEAD YOU,

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:34.470 align:middle line:84%
NOT THE FACTS,
NOT THE WOLF, NOT THE SHEEP.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.240 align:middle line:84%
FOR OUR LIVES ARE BUILT UPON
MOMENTS THAT MOVE US,

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.810 align:middle line:84%
NOSTALGIC SYMBOLS THAT REPRESENT
THE LOVE WE HAVE,

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:43.680 align:middle line:90%
THE HISTORY,

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.480 align:middle line:90%
THE DARES WE TOOK,

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.880 align:middle line:84%
THE CHANGES IN PERCEPTION
WE MADE,

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:53.490 align:middle line:90%
THE FAMILY THAT SUPPORTED US,

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:58.220 align:middle line:84%
ALL RESTING UPON A FOUNDATION
OF OUR DREAMS,

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:03.630 align:middle line:84%
THE SOIL FROM WHICH WHAT YOU
REAP, YOU WILL ONE DAY SOW.
