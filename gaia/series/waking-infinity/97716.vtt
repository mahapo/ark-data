00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.350 align:middle line:90%
-"WAKING INFINITY."

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.220 align:middle line:84%
A SHOW ABOUT CONSCIOUS ART BEING
A VEHICLE FOR MORPHING REALITY

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.650 align:middle line:84%
AND BECOMING THE AUTHOR
OF YOUR LIFE.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.990 align:middle line:90%
IN APRIL OF 2008,

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.990 align:middle line:84%
JUST A FEW MONTHS AFTER
RELEASING "ESOTERIC AGENDA,"

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.360 align:middle line:84%
I WAS CALLED
INTO THE AMAZON RAINFOREST

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.430 align:middle line:84%
TO MEET A SHAMAN
NAMED DON ROBERT

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:90%
TO EXPERIENCE AYAHUASCA.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
THIS BEGAN AN ENTRY
INTO THE DEEPEST HEALING PERIOD

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.140 align:middle line:90%
I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.310 align:middle line:84%
AFTERWARDS, I WAS OFFERED
TO TRAVEL

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:84%
TO EXPERIENCE A SACRED CACTUS
CALLED HUACHUMA.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.580 align:middle line:84%
I HAD TO DECLINE THIS OFFER
AT THE TIME,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.310 align:middle line:84%
AND NOW FIVE YEARS LATER,
RETURNING TO PERU,

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.650 align:middle line:84%
I FINALLY HAD THE CHANCE TO
EXPERIENCE A HUACHUMA CEREMONY,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:90%
LED BY SERGEY BARANOV.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:90%
SYNCHRONICITY WINS,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.720 align:middle line:84%
AS I FIND THAT SERGEY WAS CALLED
TO THE RAINFOREST, AS WELL,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.790 align:middle line:84%
TO MEET THE VERY SAME
AYAHUASQUERO, DON ROBERT.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.100 align:middle line:90%
THIS IS THE STORY

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.830 align:middle line:84%
OF HOW SERGEY WAS LED
INTO THE USE OF THESE PLANTS

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.770 align:middle line:84%
AND THE ENSUING PATH
THAT HE HAS CHOSEN.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.500 align:middle line:90%
ENJOY.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.980 align:middle line:90%
-FIND A WAY TO TRANSCEND DEATH.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:90%
MY SEARCH FOR SPIRITUALITY --

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.520 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS OUT OF FEAR OF DEATH.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:90%
TO ME, IT'S A DELUSION.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.789 align:middle line:84%
I DON'T...BELIEVE
WITH THAT THINKING

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.060 align:middle line:84%
THAT THERE IS SOMETHING
AFTER DEATH,

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THAT THERE WAS
JUST NOTHING AFTER DEATH.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.440 align:middle line:90%
EVERYTHING WAS ACTUALLY HERE.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.940 align:middle line:84%
SO, FOR ME, IT'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.210 align:middle line:90%
FOR ME IN MY LIFE NOW.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS,
YOUR SELF-AWARENESS,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:90%
YOUR INDIVIDUALITY IS UNIQUE.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.750 align:middle line:90%
THERE IS NO OTHER LIKE YOU.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:90%
AND THERE WILL NEVER BE ONE.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.960 align:middle line:84%
SO THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT
FOR ME TO REALIZE THAT.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.560 align:middle line:90%
AND I THOUGHT, "IF I COME BACK,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.470 align:middle line:84%
"I GO THROUGH THAT
AND ACTUALLY WILL BE ALIVE,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
"THEN THAT REALLY WOULD BE
MY LIFE IN THAT WAY --

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.980 align:middle line:84%
IN A DIFFERENT WAY,
WITH SO MUCH MORE AWARENESS."

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.380 align:middle line:90%
APPRECIATION, YOU KNOW?

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.280 align:middle line:84%
I'M JUST LOOKING BACK NOW,
AND I'M THINKING, LIKE,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.790 align:middle line:90%
"YOU KNOW, THAT WAS REALLY --

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.520 align:middle line:84%
THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE BEST TO
HAPPEN TO ME," YOU KNOW?

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:84%
THE BEST, BECAUSE IF THAT
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:90%
I STILL WOULD LIVE IN ILLUSION.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.860 align:middle line:84%
NOW I HAVE NOT,
NOR DO I HAVE ANY FEAR.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.800 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF IT.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.900 align:middle line:84%
YOU UNDERSTAND HOW
THAT IS FINAL,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:84%
AND YOU'RE NOT AFRAID
OF THAT ANYMORE.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.110 align:middle line:90%
YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE IN PEACE.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.880 align:middle line:90%
[ Echoing ] ...PEACE.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.110 align:middle line:90%
MY NAME IS SERGEY BARANOV.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.880 align:middle line:84%
I AM AN AUTHOR OF A BOOK,
"PATH."

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.579 align:middle line:90%
AND I'M ALSO A HUACHUMERA,

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.750 align:middle line:84%
WHICH MEANS
THAT I WORK WITH HUACHUMA.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.090 align:middle line:84%
AND HUACHUMA
IS THE ORIGINAL NAME

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:90%
OF THE SACRED CACTUS, SAN PEDRO.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:84%
WHEN THE SPANISH CAME HERE,
THEY FOUND THAT,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.940 align:middle line:84%
AND THEY TRIED THE MEDICINE,
AND THEY REALIZED HEAVEN.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.480 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S WHY THEY CALLED
THE MEDICINE "SAN PEDRO"

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE SAINT PETER --

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.080 align:middle line:84%
SAINT PETER WAS THE ONE WHO WAS
HAVING THE KEY TO HEAVEN.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
HE WAS GIVEN THE KEY
FROM HEAVEN.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.890 align:middle line:84%
SO THIS MEDICINE, THEY SAW IT
AS THE KEY TO HEAVEN.

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT
SAN PEDRO.

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:21.390 align:middle line:84%
BUT THE REAL, AUTHENTIC,
ORIGINAL, ANCIENT NAME

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.300 align:middle line:90%
OF THIS CACTUS -- HUACHUMA,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.600 align:middle line:84%
WHICH MEANS "VISION" IN ONE
OF THE QUECHUA DIALECTS.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.909 align:middle line:84%
AND WHEN YOU DRINK
THIS MEDICINE, YOU UNDERSTAND

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.380 align:middle line:84%
WHY THEY CALL IT THAT --
BECAUSE IT OPENS YOUR VISION.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.409 align:middle line:90%
YOU BECOME, YOU KNOW --

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.080 align:middle line:84%
IT'S THE VISION
OF YOUR THIRD EYE

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
AS, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE
FAMILIAR WITH IT SAY.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.690 align:middle line:90%
BUT IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.420 align:middle line:90%
IT'S VISION THROUGH THE LIES.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:90%
IT'S VISION OF YOUR LIFE.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.430 align:middle line:84%
IT'S VISION OF THE WORLD
AS THE WORLD REALLY IS.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.800 align:middle line:84%
IT'S LIKE A PROJECTOR
THAT YOU TURN ON,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.730 align:middle line:84%
AND IT CAN SEE
ANYWHERE YOU LOOK.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
WELL, I WAS LOOKING FOR SHAMANS,
YOU KNOW?

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:84%
I WAS LOOKING FOR REAL SHAMANS.
I KNEW THAT THIS IS MY PATH.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I KNEW THAT THIS IS WHERE
THE KEY TO SELF-KNOWLEDGE IS.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.350 align:middle line:84%
I KNEW INTUITIVELY THAT THIS IS
THE REAL SPIRITUAL PATH

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:90%
THAT I WANT TO WALK.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.390 align:middle line:90%
I JUST NEED TO FIND REAL PEOPLE.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:90%
REAL PEOPLE.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:90%
AND I STARTED TO LOOK FOR THEM,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:84%
AND I FOUND THEM QUICKLY,
YOU KNOW.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.260 align:middle line:90%
AND RIGHT AWAY, I FOUND ONE GUY

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
THAT WAS MY FIRST TEACHER,
REALLY.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:90%
HE LIVES IN IQUITOS.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.340 align:middle line:90%
GREAT GUY.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.970 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, HE'S CERTAINLY LAID
A NEW FOUNDATION

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
FOR MY SPIRITUAL HOUSE,
YOU KNOW?

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.350 align:middle line:84%
AND I MET HIM,
AND I JUST KNEW RIGHT AWAY,

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.220 align:middle line:90%
"THAT THE REAL GUY, YOU KNOW?"

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.920 align:middle line:84%
AND HE WAS KNOWLEDGEABLE.
I SAW HIS EYES.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
WAS A REAL GUY, YOU KNOW?
I FELT IT.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I CALLED HIM RIGHT AWAY,
WE TALKED,

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.730 align:middle line:84%
WE HAD A VERY GOOD
PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSION.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.730 align:middle line:84%
I KNEW THAT I NEEDED TO COME SEE
HIM, SO I FLEW RIGHT AWAY.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.530 align:middle line:84%
FOR FIVE WEEKS, STARTED
IN THE RAINFOREST IN IQUITOS.

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.470 align:middle line:84%
FOR TWO WEEKS,
I WAS GOING THROUGH THAT

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:90%
AND THEN COMING TO ANDES.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:84%
THAT WAS HIM COMING HERE,
ACTUALLY, WHERE I LIVE NOW,

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:90%
DOING HUACHUMA RIGHT HERE.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.180 align:middle line:90%
DIFFERENT PLACES.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:84%
BUT FIRST TIME I DRANK HUACHUMA
IN THE JUNGLE.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS A TRANSITION TIME

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.190 align:middle line:84%
BEFORE AYAHUASCA
AND COMING HERE.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
AND I KNEW RIGHT AWAY
THIS IS MY MEDICINE, YOU KNOW?

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:90%
KNEW RIGHT AWAY.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.760 align:middle line:90%
20 MINUTES PASSED,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.659 align:middle line:90%
I BEGIN TO FEEL THAT I KNEW

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:38.159 align:middle line:84%
THIS WHAT WAS I LOOKING FOR
ALL MY LIFE, INTUITIVELY.

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:42.370 align:middle line:84%
THIS IS MY MEDICINE.
THIS IS MY HEART RIGHT HERE.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.909 align:middle line:90%
AND TO BE HONEST, I GOT SCARED.

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:49.180 align:middle line:90%
I GOT SCARED OF THAT...

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:84%
...ENORMOUS, ENORMOUS SCALE
OF THIS MEDICINE AND DEPTH

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
WE SHALL INTUITIVELY BEGIN
TO FEEL RIGHT AWAY.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:90%
AND I THINK ALSO WHAT WAS SCARY,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS JUST SCARY
TO WAKE UP TO MYSELF.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.670 align:middle line:84%
I WAS WORKING
WITH MEXICAN SHAMANS,

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.170 align:middle line:90%
WITH RITUAL SHAMANS,

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.470 align:middle line:84%
RITUAL PEYOTEROS
WORKING WITH PEYOTE,

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:84%
IN MEXICO
THE WHOLE YEAR OF 2008.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:84%
AND DURING MY LAST VISIT,
THAT WAS NOVEMBER 15, 2008,

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:84%
I CAME, AND WE HAD
A VERY STRANGE CEREMONY.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.920 align:middle line:84%
AND, UH...THAT CEREMONY
WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.460 align:middle line:84%
I FELT SOMETHING WAS
A LITTLE TIGHT IN THE AIR.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.760 align:middle line:84%
SOME TENSION WAS AROUND, AND IT
DIDN'T FEEL VERY FRIENDLY.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.690 align:middle line:90%
I EVEN REMEMBER THINKING, LIKE,

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:43.900 align:middle line:84%
"MAN, MAYBE I SHOULD GO
THIS TIME.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.800 align:middle line:90%
"MAYBE I'LL JUST STAY A FEW DAYS

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.200 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN JUST FLY BACK
TO CALIFORNIA."

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.870 align:middle line:90%
I JUST STAYED. SO WHATEVER.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.000 align:middle line:84%
I'LL JUST GO THROUGH THAT,
YOU KNOW?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.740 align:middle line:90%
SO, WE HAD A CEREMONY.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I MAKE THE FIRE,
AS I WAS USUALLY DOING.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.150 align:middle line:84%
WE STARTED, ALL WAS GOOD,
NORMAL.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.550 align:middle line:84%
FOUR HOURS IN IT --
LIKE, EXACTLY, ABOUT MIDNIGHT --

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:08.250 align:middle line:84%
I WAS ASKED TO BLESS THE WATER
AND SHARE THE WATER,

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
GIVE THE WATER, MOTHER OF EARTH,
GRANDFATHER FIRE.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.530 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT WAS JUST THE RITUAL.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:19.200 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS A FULL-MOON CEREMONY,
AND IT WAS VERY SPECIAL.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.870 align:middle line:84%
AND I BLESSED THE WATER,
AND BEFORE THAT,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:24.500 align:middle line:90%
THE SHAMAN I WAS WITH,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
HE ASKED ME TO LOOK AT MY FACE
IN THE WATER

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.180 align:middle line:90%
AND TRY TO REMEMBER MYSELF.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:90%
ALL RIGHT. I SAID, "OKAY."

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:84%
SO I LOOK INTO THE BUCKET
OF THE WATER,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle line:84%
AND I LOOK AT MY FACE,
WHICH WAS KIND OF BLURRED,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, IN THE DARK, AND ALL
THERE IS IS THE FIRE THERE.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.890 align:middle line:84%
BUT LOOKING AT THAT, TRYING TO
ACTUALLY SEE MY FACE,

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:46.330 align:middle line:90%
I FELT THAT SOMEBODY

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING
THROUGH THAT IMAGE AT ME,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.700 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT WASN'T ME.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.370 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS CREEPY.

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:90%
I GO, "OKAY. YOU KNOW..."

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.970 align:middle line:84%
SIT DOWN,
I ADDED SOME MORE WOOD,

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.810 align:middle line:90%
AND I WAS SITTING AND SAYING,

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
I REMEMBER THAT THOSE WERE
MY LAST WORDS.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.250 align:middle line:84%
I WAS SAYING, "PEYOTE IS REAL."
"PEYOTE IS REAL."

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:84%
"PEYOTE IS REAL."
"PEYOTE IS REAL."

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.220 align:middle line:84%
AND AS I SAID THAT,
I JUMPED OUT OF MY MAT,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.060 align:middle line:84%
FEELING THAT SOMETHING STUNG ME
RIGHT IN MY THIGHS --

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
BOTH THIGHS, JUST 2 INCHES
BELOW MY GENITALS.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:90%
REALIZING THAT YOU ARE DYING --

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.670 align:middle line:84%
AND, REALLY, YOU ARE DYING --
THAT'S IT.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.940 align:middle line:90%
IT'S NOT THE IMAGINATION.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.800 align:middle line:84%
YOU'RE NOT THINKING
YOU'RE DYING.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE
JUST GET SICK A LITTLE.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.080 align:middle line:84%
NO, YOU ARE DYING.
YOU ARE --

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.880 align:middle line:84%
YOU'VE BEEN STUNG
BY DEADLY SCORPIONS,

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
YOU'RE FULL OF VENOM,
AND YOUR BODY'S SHUTTING DOWN.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.580 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S IT.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.480 align:middle line:90%
SHAMAN SAID, "DON'T PANIC.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.290 align:middle line:84%
YOU'LL MAKE IT ONLY WORSE.
JUST RELAX AND GO WITH IT."

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.960 align:middle line:84%
SO, ABOUT 20 MINUTES,
I WAS PANICKING.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.660 align:middle line:84%
OF COURSE,
HOW WOULD YOU NOT PANIC

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.600 align:middle line:84%
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERES,

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:84%
SIERRA MADRE, MEXICO,
WITH INDIANS,

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.570 align:middle line:84%
AND THERE IS NO HOSPITAL,
NOTHING?

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:90%
THERE IS NO HELP.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.440 align:middle line:90%
I MEAN, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.010 align:middle line:84%
AND HE SAID,
"I CAN'T DO NOTHING ABOUT THAT.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.380 align:middle line:84%
I CAN'T GET THE VENOM OUT.
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT."

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:84%
AND WITH EVERY HOUR, IT JUST
BECOME ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:84%
I WAS FEELING LIKE I'M DYING.
THAT'S IT.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:84%
MY BODY BECOMES
JUST COMPLETELY PARALYZED.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.020 align:middle line:84%
NOTHING.
YOU JUST LAY DOWN,

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.490 align:middle line:84%
AND YOU CAN BREATHE
THROUGH YOUR NOSE, NOTHING ELSE.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.430 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN'T OPEN YOUR EYES,
NOTHING.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS JUST AGONY.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:90%
18 HOURS OF AGONY.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:90%
JUST HELL.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW,
I FELT THE PRESENCE OF DEATH.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS THERE WITH ME.

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:90%
IT WASN'T REALLY AN ENTITY

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:48.110 align:middle line:84%
LIKE YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES
AND THE CARTOONS,

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:90%
BUT IT'S A PRESENCE OF DEATH.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.350 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE DEAD,
YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS IT.

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.290 align:middle line:84%
SO IT REALLY MADE ME THINK
ABOUT MY LIFE --

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.090 align:middle line:84%
EVERYTHING I WANTED TO DO,
THE WAY I WAS LIVING MY LIFE.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.590 align:middle line:90%
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.100 align:middle line:84%
THERE WAS DARKNESS.
THERE WAS A VOID.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.400 align:middle line:90%
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.770 align:middle line:84%
AND EVERYTHING HERE,
AND THAT WAS VERY FAR.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.700 align:middle line:84%
BUT THAT CHANGED MY LIFE
AFTER THAT.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.200 align:middle line:90%
YOU KNOW, IT WAS INTERESTING,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.410 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID OF DEATH
ALL MY LIFE,

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT WAS THE BASE, PROBABLY,

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:20.080 align:middle line:84%
FOR MY SPIRITUAL SEARCH
LATER ON IN MY LIFE,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.550 align:middle line:84%
PROBABLY BASED
ON THAT FEAR OF DEATH.

00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:84%
MY DEATH WAS KIND OF
MY COMPANION ALL MY LIFE,

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.390 align:middle line:90%
BUT IT WASN'T MY FRIEND.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS KIND OF MORE OF AN ENEMY.
I WAS AFRAID TO DIE.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:84%
THIS EXPERIENCE
CHANGED EVERYTHING

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.800 align:middle line:90%
BECAUSE IT TOOK THAT FEAR AWAY.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.870 align:middle line:84%
I UNDERSTOOD
HOW MUCH I LOVE LIFE.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.100 align:middle line:84%
HOW MUCH I JUST LOVE LIFE,
YOU KNOW?

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.610 align:middle line:84%
FEEL THE SUN, LOOK AROUND,
JUST FEEL LOVE IN MY HEART.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.440 align:middle line:84%
AND I REALLY STARTED TO FIGHT
FOR MY LIFE.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.180 align:middle line:84%
AND I SAID, "I'M NOT DYING.
I'M JUST NOT DYING."

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS JUST THE POWER OF MY WILL
AND LOVE TO MY LIFE

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
AND OF COURSE THE HELP
OF THE GREAT PEYOTE.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:04.260 align:middle line:84%
HE ABSOLUTELY GAVE ME
THE STRENGTH TO FIGHT.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
OTHERWISE, I PROBABLY
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THAT

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE THE VENOM
PROBABLY WOULD KILL MY LIVER.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.570 align:middle line:90%
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:15.730 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS WAY OVER
WHAT YOU CAN HANDLE.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.570 align:middle line:84%
SO THE PEYOTE
REALLY GAVE ME STRENGTH,

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.070 align:middle line:84%
AND I WAS VERY GLAD THAT I DRANK
A LOT THIS NIGHT --

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.340 align:middle line:84%
MORE THAN I'VE EVER DRUNK
BEFORE.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.240 align:middle line:90%
SO I WAS DEEP IN THE MEDICINE.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS VERY, VERY STRANGE

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
TO FEEL BOTH
POWERFUL MEDICINE -- PEYOTE --

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:36.790 align:middle line:84%
IN YOUR BLOOD AT THE SAME TIME
AS POWERFUL VENOM --

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.390 align:middle line:90%
POWERFUL SCORPION VENOM.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:84%
SO, 18 HOURS OF AGONY
AND THEN THREE DAYS OF HELL.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.330 align:middle line:90%
THOUGHTS OF DEATH.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.040 align:middle line:84%
DEATH BECAME MY ALLY.
IT BECOMES MY FRIEND.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.840 align:middle line:90%
IT BECOMES MY FRIEND IN A WAY

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:84%
THAT IT JUST REMINDS ME
ALL THE TIME

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:02.110 align:middle line:84%
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE
OF LIVING IN THE MOMENT.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:84%
WHAT MATTERS, REALLY,
I UNDERSTOOD,

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.290 align:middle line:84%
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
TO LIVE THIS LIFE

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.320 align:middle line:84%
AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS
TO CHERISH EVERY MOMENT

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:90%
AND LIVING IN THE MOMENT.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S, LIKE, A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.470 align:middle line:84%
WHAT MATTERS IS RIGHT NOW,
RIGHT IN THIS MOMENT,

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.670 align:middle line:84%
AND EVERY MOMENT FROM THAT POINT
UNTIL I DIE MY NATURAL DEATH.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.710 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT WAS
MY SHAMANIC INITIATION.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.440 align:middle line:84%
THAT WAS MY RITE OF PASSAGE,
AS THEY CALL IT.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.350 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S WHAT GIVES ME RITES TO
WORK WITH MEDICINE THE WAY I DO.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.460 align:middle line:84%
I JUST FELT THAT I HAD
TO SHARE MY STORY,

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:84%
AND IT HAS BECOME
A SORT OF URGENCY.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.600 align:middle line:90%
IT HAS TO HAPPEN.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.540 align:middle line:84%
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW?

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
THE ART OF WRITING OR WHATEVER.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN...NOR DO YOU HAVE ANY
CONNECTIONS IN THAT BUSINESS.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.310 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYBODY

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:84%
WHO COULD EVEN HELP ME
TO PUT IT TOGETHER.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.150 align:middle line:84%
IN THE MEDICINE, THE MESSAGE
WAS COMING THAT, "DON'T WORRY.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.490 align:middle line:84%
"JUST GO WITH IT AND WRITE,
AND THE HELP WILL COME.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:16.860 align:middle line:84%
JUST TRUST.
JUST TRUST IT."

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:84%
I SAID, "OKAY. THEN WHAT DO
YOU WANT ME TO WRITE ABOUT?"

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.430 align:middle line:90%
YOU KNOW?

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:25.160 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN THE MESSAGE CAME BACK
THAT IF I WRITE ANYTHING,

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.500 align:middle line:90%
IT SHOULD BE ABOUT MY LIFE,

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.170 align:middle line:84%
'CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY THING
I KNOW.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:32.470 align:middle line:84%
I SAID, "OKAY.
BUT I NEED HELP, YOU KNOW?

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
SEND PEOPLE MY WAY TO HELP ME
OUT, PUT IT TOGETHER."

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:84%
AND AT THAT TIME,
PRETTY MUCH SOON AFTER THAT,

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:90%
I GOT A CALL FROM LIMA,

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.850 align:middle line:84%
FROM A PERSON
WHO HEARD ABOUT ME.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.690 align:middle line:84%
SHE KNEW THAT THERE
WAS A RUSSIAN GUY

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.960 align:middle line:90%
DOING CEREMONIES WITH SAN PEDRO.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.130 align:middle line:84%
AND SHE SAID, "I HAVE A PERSON
WHO COME IN FROM MOSCOW,

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.530 align:middle line:84%
AND HE'S LOOKING
FOR SAN PEDRO MEDICINE.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:84%
WOULD YOU LIKE TO WORK
WITH HIM?"

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.830 align:middle line:90%
I SAID, "SURE. SURE."

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:02.270 align:middle line:90%
SO HE CAME.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:05.940 align:middle line:84%
HE ONLY HAD ONE DAY FREE,
'CAUSE EVERYTHING WAS PLANNED.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.670 align:middle line:90%
BUT ONE DAY WAS TO SEE ME.

00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:09.110 align:middle line:90%
SO WE DRANK.

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.380 align:middle line:90%
IT WAS A VERY GOOD CEREMONY,

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.110 align:middle line:84%
AND HE CERTAINLY FELT
THAT THIS WAS REAL,

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.650 align:middle line:84%
AND HE SAID
THAT HE WOULD BE BACK.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:90%
DURING THE CEREMONY,

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:20.050 align:middle line:84%
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT
THINGS, YOU KNOW?

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:84%
AND I SAID, "WHAT ARE
YOU DOING IN MOSCOW?"

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:84%
HE SAID,
"WELL, I'M A PUBLISHER."

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:84%
I SAID,
"WOW. THAT'S INTERESTING,

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.560 align:middle line:84%
"BECAUSE I'M JUST
ABOUT TO WRITE A BOOK,

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.760 align:middle line:84%
"AND I WAS THINKING
ABOUT SOMEBODY

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:90%
WHO COULD HELP ME WITH THAT."

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
SO, HE SAID, "YEAH,
AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE CONTENT,

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.970 align:middle line:90%
WE CAN PUT IT TOGETHER."

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.340 align:middle line:90%
SO I START WRITING.

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.210 align:middle line:90%
FELT VERY INSPIRED, YOU KNOW.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
SOMEBODY IS WILLING TO READ
MY BOOK, YOU KNOW?

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.380 align:middle line:90%
MY MANUSCRIPT.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:90%
I SIT DOWN, AND I START WRITING.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.920 align:middle line:84%
SIX WEEKS, JUST DAYS AND NIGHTS,
JUST ALL THE THOUGHTS.

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.020 align:middle line:90%
HE READ IT, AND HE LIKED THAT.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.760 align:middle line:84%
HE SAID,
"THAT'S DEFINITELY A BOOK.

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.760 align:middle line:90%
WE'RE GOING ALONG WITH IT."

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.260 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS GOOD NEWS.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, SOMEDAY,
OUT OF NOWHERE,

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.530 align:middle line:84%
JUST A MONTH AGO,
I THOUGHT ABOUT WRITING,

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.370 align:middle line:84%
AND NOW I HAVE ALREADY SOMEBODY
WHO'S WILLING TO PUT IT OUT,

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.970 align:middle line:84%
WHO IS REALLY INVESTING IN IT
AND ADVERTISE

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:16.310 align:middle line:84%
AND PUT IT EVERYWHERE
IN WHOLE RUSSIA.

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.750 align:middle line:84%
WHOLE RUSSIA.
I APPRECIATED THE HELP.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.950 align:middle line:84%
HE APPARENTLY LIKED IT SO MUCH
THAT HE WANTED TO IMPROVE IT.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.850 align:middle line:84%
[ CHUCKLES ] HE WANTED TO MAKE
A HIT OUT OF IT, YOU KNOW?

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:30.860 align:middle line:84%
SO HE GAVE IT TO HIS BEST EDITOR
IN HIS COMPANY,

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:33.090 align:middle line:90%
AND I SAID, "OKAY. WHATEVER.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.330 align:middle line:84%
"I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO TELL
YOU WHAT TO DO, YOU KNOW?

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:39.030 align:middle line:84%
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP,"
YOU KNOW?

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:43.400 align:middle line:84%
BUT THE ONLY THING I SAID IS,
LIKE, "WELL, IT WOULD BE GOOD

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.770 align:middle line:84%
IF I COULD READ AS SHE GOES
SO I CAN SEE WHAT SHE'S DOING."

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.940 align:middle line:84%
HE SAID, "DON'T WORRY.
SHE'S SUPER-PROFESSIONAL.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.910 align:middle line:84%
"SHE WILL DO IT THE WAY
IT HAS TO BE.

00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:56.250 align:middle line:90%
"JUST RELAX AND LIVE YOUR LIFE.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.080 align:middle line:84%
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN IT'S DONE."

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:02.250 align:middle line:84%
ONE MONTH, TWO MONTH,
THREE MONTH PASSED, AND NOTHING.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I STILL DON'T SEE
MY MANUSCRIPT BACK.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.390 align:middle line:84%
AND WRITING BACK TO HIM
AND SAYING,

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.099 align:middle line:84%
"WHAT'S THE STATUS?
"WHAT'S GOING ON?"

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:14.069 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE DURING THAT TIME, I WAS
DRINKING MEDICINE BY MYSELF,

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:17.040 align:middle line:84%
AND I WAS SEEING THAT --
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG THERE.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.609 align:middle line:84%
I WAS SEEING THAT
SHE IS MESSING WITH MY TEXT.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I WAS SEEING THAT
EVERY CEREMONY.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:24.609 align:middle line:90%
"I NEED TO TALK, YOU KNOW?"

00:17:24.609 --> 00:17:29.450 align:middle line:84%
SO I SAID, "MY FEELING
IS THAT THE EDITOR

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:34.390 align:middle line:84%
KIND OF TAKING TOO MUCH TIME
FOR HER TO WORK ON THAT."

00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, TRYING TO BE
KIND OF POLITE AND NICE.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.790 align:middle line:90%
AND "MAYBE I CAN LOOK

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:43.130 align:middle line:84%
AND KIND OF GO ALONG WITH HER
AND JOIN THE PROCESS."

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.360 align:middle line:84%
HE SAID, "DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:90%
DON'T WORRY. JUST RELAX."

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:47.970 align:middle line:90%
"OKAY."

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:84%
KEPT WAITING ANOTHER MONTH,
AND THEN I JUST SAID,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.410 align:middle line:84%
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANT TO SEE MY MANUSCRIPT.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.710 align:middle line:84%
I WANT TO SEE WHAT YOU DID.
THIS IS JUST TOO MUCH TIME."

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.840 align:middle line:90%
I MEAN, CORRECTING THE LANGUAGE,

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:00.010 align:middle line:84%
JUST CORRECTING SPELLING
AND GRAMMAR --

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.380 align:middle line:84%
THAT SHOULDN'T TAKE THREE MONTHS
FOR A SUPER-PROFESSIONAL PERSON.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I'M SORRY,
BUT THIS IS JUST WRONG.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:08.220 align:middle line:84%
HE SAID, "OKAY."
SO I GOT MY MANUSCRIPT.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:14.160 align:middle line:90%
I READ 30 PAGES, AND I FELT...

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.400 align:middle line:84%
LIKE A KNIFE
THREW INTO MY HEART.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:25.070 align:middle line:90%
SO I GOT MY MANUSCRIPT.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:30.810 align:middle line:90%
I READ 30 PAGES, AND I FELT...

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.080 align:middle line:84%
LIKE A KNIFE
THREW INTO MY HEART.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.910 align:middle line:90%
IT HURT. IT HURT.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:38.820 align:middle line:90%
AND SHE JUST STOLE MY STORY

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.990 align:middle line:84%
SHE JUST CHANGED EVERYTHING,
SHE PUT LIES IN IT,

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:45.220 align:middle line:84%
AND SHE JUST IMAGINED THINGS
THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.830 align:middle line:84%
IT WAS JUST SO AWFUL.
I SAID, "NO. WE'RE DONE."

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.330 align:middle line:90%
I WENT TO HIM RIGHT AWAY.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.530 align:middle line:84%
I SAID, "HEY. WHAT HAPPENED?
WHERE'S MY BOOK?

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.100 align:middle line:90%
THIS IS NOT MY BOOK ANYMORE."

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.600 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, I'M LOSING MY PATIENCE
AT THAT POINT.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:90%
FOUR MONTHS WAITING,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN I READ SOMETHING
WHICH IS NOT EVEN ME.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.710 align:middle line:90%
THE BOOK IS ABOUT TRUTH.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
IT'S ABOUT SEEKING THE TRUTH,
AND IT'S MY TRUTH.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:84%
AND I CAN'T HAVE THE BOOK
FULL OF LIES BEING ABOUT TRUTH.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.880 align:middle line:90%
AND I SAID, "WOW."

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:84%
AT THAT POINT, I KIND OF LOST
MYSELF AND MY PATIENCE,

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.050 align:middle line:84%
AND I JUST TOLD HIM EVERYTHING
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT WASN'T GOOD.

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:17.660 align:middle line:90%
I WAS VERY DIRECT,

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:84%
AND, MAN, THAT JUST EXPLODED
THE WHOLE THING.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
AND AT THAT TIME, HE ALREADY
INVESTED $15,000 IN THE BOOK.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.640 align:middle line:90%
HERE I AM, NOBODY.

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.840 align:middle line:90%
SO WE HAD A BIG FIGHT.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.910 align:middle line:90%
AND, UH...

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.010 align:middle line:90%
I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I TOLD MY WIFE,
AND SHE WAS ALSO VERY UPSET

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:42.180 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF HOPE
IN THAT,

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.020 align:middle line:84%
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF HEART
IN THAT.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:90%
AND NOW...IT HURTS.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:84%
WE HAD NO MONEY.
YOU KNOW?

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:84%
IT JUST WAS A TIME
WHEN I DIDN'T HAVE ANY PEOPLE.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.640 align:middle line:84%
AND MY WIFE,
SHE WAS WITH THE BABY.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.870 align:middle line:90%
SHE WAS FEEDING THE BABY.

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:84%
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO WAS WORKING,

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.270 align:middle line:90%
AND MY ONLY WORK IS CEREMONIES.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.710 align:middle line:84%
AND AT THAT TIME,
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY PEOPLE.

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.110 align:middle line:90%
IT JUST HAPPENED THAT WAY.

00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:84%
THAT WAS JUST
FOR QUITE A FEW MONTHS.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:17.550 align:middle line:90%
SO WE WERE LIVING OFF NOTHING.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:19.350 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN, WE'RE TALKING
OFF NOTHING.

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.090 align:middle line:84%
SO IN THAT SITUATION
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:25.660 align:middle line:84%
THAT, YOU KNOW, BY SAYING,
"YES, JUST LET THE BOOK OUT,"

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.600 align:middle line:84%
AND MAKE MAYBE
$50,000 THE FIRST MONTH --

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.600 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S CONSERVATIVE
BECAUSE HIS CONNECTIONS --

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:84%
I MEAN, HIS FRIENDS HAD A CHAIN
OVER HUNDREDS OF STORES --

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.940 align:middle line:84%
HUNDREDS OF BOOKSTORES --
IN MOSCOW ALONE,

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.240 align:middle line:90%
PLUS OTHER BIG CITIES.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.110 align:middle line:84%
AND HE WAS WILLING TO PUT MONEY
INTO ADVERTISING.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.310 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS LIKE A HIT RIGHT THERE.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:49.550 align:middle line:84%
IT'S JUST THE FIRST MONTH,
IT SHOULD SELL.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:90%
THAT WAS THE PLAN.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.820 align:middle line:84%
THAT'S WHY
HE EVEN WENT AS FAR --

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.360 align:middle line:84%
HE KNEW HE WILL RECOUP HIS MONEY
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.290 align:middle line:84%
FINANCIALLY,
IT WOULD HELP US A LOT.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:01.560 align:middle line:90%
THAT WOULD BE FROM BEING POOR,

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:06.130 align:middle line:84%
BEING SOMETHING COMPLETELY ELSE
WITHIN A MONTH AND JUST RELAX.

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.640 align:middle line:84%
BUT I HAD TO COMPROMISE
MY STORY FOR THAT.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.070 align:middle line:90%
I HAD TO SELL IT OUT.

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:15.670 align:middle line:84%
I HAD TO SAY YES AND LET --
AND BECOME A LIAR, YOU KNOW?

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:90%
JUST BECOME A WRITER.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.880 align:middle line:84%
JUST LIKE,
IT'S NOT TRUE ANYMORE.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.780 align:middle line:84%
IT'S WHATEVER.
AND I COULDN'T DO THAT.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:84%
I JUST FELT IN MY HEART,
I JUST COULDN'T DO THAT.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:26.950 align:middle line:90%
AND I TOLD MY WIFE RIGHT AWAY.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.860 align:middle line:84%
SHE KNEW THAT I RECEIVED
THE MONEY, BUT I WAS HAPPY.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.590 align:middle line:90%
I TOLD HER, "I'M GOING TO READ."

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.660 align:middle line:84%
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, A FEW YEARS
LATER, I'M COMING DOWN.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:37.900 align:middle line:84%
SHE SEES ME, LIKE,
"WHAT HAPPENED?"

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.870 align:middle line:84%
AND I SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:84%
THE EDITOR JUST STOLE MY STORY.
SHE TOOK MY PEN."

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.640 align:middle line:84%
AND, UH...SHE FELL OVER
RIGHT AWAY.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:52.410 align:middle line:84%
SHE, YOU KNOW --
ALL OUR HOPES JUST COLLAPSED.

00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.950 align:middle line:90%
AND IT WASN'T JUST MINE.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:55.810 align:middle line:90%
OF COURSE, PART OF IT WAS MONEY

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.080 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE I HAVE A BABY TO FEED,
YOU KNOW?

00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.620 align:middle line:90%
WE HAVE NO MONEY.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I HAVE A FAMILY TO FEED, SO OF
COURSE, OBVIOUSLY, IT WAS THERE.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:06.220 align:middle line:84%
BUT NOT ONLY BECAUSE WE REALLY
PUT A LOT OF HEART IN THAT.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:07.530 align:middle line:90%
JUST SHE UNDERSTOOD

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.860 align:middle line:84%
HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR ME
TO WRITE IT,

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.030 align:middle line:84%
JUST TO SPEAK UP
AND JUST LET IT OUT.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.030 align:middle line:84%
SO, SHE FELT IT,
AND SHE STARTED CRYING, AND...

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:21.240 align:middle line:84%
BUT SOON AFTER THAT,
SHE UNDERSTOOD.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.140 align:middle line:90%
SHE UNDERSTOOD AND SUPPORTED ME,

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:90%
AND THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT...

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:26.610 align:middle line:90%
FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:31.750 align:middle line:84%
AND IMPORTANT FOR ME
TO SEE HER TRUE SELF,

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.950 align:middle line:84%
BECAUSE THIS IS WHEN YOU
ACTUALLY SEE A PERSON, YOU KNOW?

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.390 align:middle line:90%
DEEP AND IN THAT TIME OF STRESS.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.360 align:middle line:90%
SO, I MET A FRIEND LIVING HERE.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.930 align:middle line:84%
I TOLD HIM THE STORY.
HE SAID, "DON'T WORRY, YOU KNOW?

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.930 align:middle line:84%
"NOW YOU CAN TRANSFER THAT
INTO ENGLISH

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.330 align:middle line:84%
"AND CRAFT IT THE WAY YOU WANT
IT AND PUBLISH IT

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:52.370 align:middle line:84%
SO NOBODY CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU
CAN SAY OR WHAT YOU CAN'T SAY."

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:53.810 align:middle line:90%
I SAID, "NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.710 align:middle line:84%
"I DON'T THINK
I CAN EVEN TRUST THAT.

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.540 align:middle line:84%
I FEEL EXHAUSTED.
I FEEL DEPLETED."

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:84%
I COULDN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT THAT.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.580 align:middle line:84%
I DON'T EVEN THINK MY LANGUAGE
IS AS GOOD.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:84%
SO HE SAID, "NO, IT'S OKAY.
JUST -- JUST DO IT."

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.190 align:middle line:84%
SO I DID A FEW CEREMONIES
TO KIND OF ASK FOR HELP.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:13.860 align:middle line:90%
I ASKED FOR INSPIRATION,

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.730 align:middle line:84%
AND I SAT, AND I TRANSFERRED
MY BOOK INTO ENGLISH.

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.400 align:middle line:84%
THE WHOLE BOOK
IS SOAKED IN THE MEDICINE.

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.100 align:middle line:84%
YOU KNOW, I WROTE IT
IN THE MEDICINE.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:90%
SO, THE BOOK IS THE MEDICINE.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
FIRST, OF COURSE,
THE TRUTH IN THE BOOK.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:33.110 align:middle line:84%
AND THAT TRUTH WAS INSPIRED
AND SOAKED IN THE MEDICINE.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.150 align:middle line:90%
THAT'S HOW I SEE IT.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:37.720 align:middle line:84%
AND SO FAR,
THOSE PEOPLE WHO READ IT,

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:42.350 align:middle line:84%
THEY FELT, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS EVERYTHING.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.860 align:middle line:84%
SO I JUST WANT TO REACH
MORE PEOPLE

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.430 align:middle line:84%
AND INSPIRE THEM TO DO
THEIR OWN THING, THEIR OWN ART,

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:52.360 align:middle line:90%
WHATEVER IT IS FOR THEM TO DO.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.870 align:middle line:90%
YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOMETHING --

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:56.500 align:middle line:84%
YOU CAN BE AN ARTIST
IN YOUR POTENTIAL,
