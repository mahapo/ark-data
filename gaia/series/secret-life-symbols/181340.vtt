00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> This is "Secret
Life of Symbols."

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:21.700 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:28.680 align:middle line:84%
>> This dollar bill has
value, because it is based

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.500 align:middle line:90%
on your physical body.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.930 align:middle line:10%
Your flesh and blood body backs
up the authority of this money.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.270 align:middle line:84%
If you're an
American, this money

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.130 align:middle line:90%
is backed up by your body.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Now, let me show you how.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:84%
When you look at the
front of the dollar bill,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:84%
you will see on each
side are serial numbers.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:84%
For this particular dollar
bill are serial numbers.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.240 align:middle line:84%
If you look on the back of
your Social Security card,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:84%
you will see the
numbers on the bottom.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.510 align:middle line:84%
The numbers on the bottom
are usually in red--

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
represents your blood on
the New York Stock Exchange.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.300 align:middle line:84%
It represents your
physical body.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:84%
That's why the numbers are in
red, representing your blood.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.890 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you take the numbers
on this Social Security card

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:10%
and put it next to the serial
numbers on the dollar bill,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.750 align:middle line:10%
you will see it's the
same sequence of numbers

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.160 align:middle line:10%
and letters.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And so what it's
actually telling you

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
is that just like whatever
the amount is-- $24 million,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.910 align:middle line:84%
or $4 million, or $6
million, whatever it is,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.100 align:middle line:84%
that your body is worth on
the New York Stock Exchange.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
There's that much
money out there all

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.300 align:middle line:84%
over the world in
5s, and 10s, and 100s

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.030 align:middle line:84%
with your Social
Security number on it.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So these numbers line up
exactly correct the same way.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
The numbers can be in
blue, black, or red.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.092 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why
years ago, we used

00:02:04.092 --> 00:02:05.550 align:middle line:84%
to say the government
is just going

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.030 align:middle line:84%
to beat you black and blue,
because black and blue

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
are colors that are
used in banking.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to sign with
a blue or black pen.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Or you can sign
with your red pen,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.180 align:middle line:90%
which represents your blood.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Your physical body
is really very

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
important to the corporation
called the United States

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.160 align:middle line:90%
corporation.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.760 align:middle line:84%
That, again, is why they want
you to wear your seat belt

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.610 align:middle line:90%
and have insurance.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.290 align:middle line:84%
Or in case something
does happen to you,

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.530 align:middle line:90%
you need to have insurance.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.330 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.788 align:middle line:84%
Because the government
doesn't want

00:02:40.788 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:84%
to pay for you to
be in a hospital.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.252 align:middle line:84%
They want you out
making money for them.

00:02:45.252 --> 00:02:46.710 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to
put the money in

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.450 align:middle line:90%
to protect you in a hospital.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Go get your own insurance.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.650 align:middle line:90%
Let them pay for it.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.300 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.420 align:middle line:84%
The real powers behind
banking today in America

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:90%
is insurance companies.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.630 align:middle line:84%
Insurance companies are
the most powerful hand

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
behind the world of
money, because it

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.040 align:middle line:84%
has something to do
with the 14th Amendment

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and how we were changed over
from sovereignty-- man, woman,

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.410 align:middle line:90%
and child into a US citizen.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.770 align:middle line:84%
During the 1870s,
when the corporation

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.410 align:middle line:84%
was being born in the minds
of the politicians here,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
when they realized the
United States of America

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
was no longer a viable entity,
because we are a lot of things,

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.170 align:middle line:90%
but united isn't one of them.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're no longer
a United States,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.795 align:middle line:90%
but we're a corporation.

00:03:44.795 --> 00:03:47.920 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore,
your body now becomes

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.980 align:middle line:84%
a security for that
cooperation, and it needs money.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a big corporation, and
it needs money coming in.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's why they want you
to stay safe and drive safe,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.190 align:middle line:90%
so that you can make money.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
pump money out on you.

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.106 align:middle line:84%
They need you to go out and
make money for themself.

00:04:02.106 --> 00:04:05.160 align:middle line:90%


00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.615 align:middle line:84%
This changeover from being
sovereign man, woman,

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:12.610 align:middle line:84%
and child sovereigns, which
means you are your own law.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:84%
But when we changed over from
the United States of America

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.450 align:middle line:84%
into a corporation
in 1870 and we

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.530 align:middle line:84%
became known to the world as
the United States corporation,

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.700 align:middle line:84%
not the United
States of America.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.040 align:middle line:84%
From 1870 to the First World
War and in the Second World War,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.300 align:middle line:84%
the United States
corporation went broke.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Financing all these escapades
around the world with wars,

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and revolutions, and
paying other countries

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.970 align:middle line:90%
to be our friends and all that.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So the corporation called
United States went broke.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.170 align:middle line:10%
So they had to go
back to the old days,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.560 align:middle line:10%
go back to the British banking
cartels who can print money out

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.380 align:middle line:10%
of nothing and had
the ability to finance

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.125 align:middle line:10%
anything they wanted to do.

00:05:01.125 --> 00:05:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And so the corporation
had to borrow money

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%
from the British bankers to
keep this corporation going,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
because the
corporation is broke.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.110 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to go broke
when you got millions of people

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:90%
who want to eat tonight.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.830 align:middle line:10%
And the company of
the United States

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.270 align:middle line:10%
no longer is operable,
because it is broke.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So the United States went to
the European banking system

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.100 align:middle line:84%
and asked for loans
to give us some money.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Loan us some money, so we can
keep our corporation going.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, the bankers there said,
well, why would we do that?

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.784 align:middle line:90%
You are already broke.

00:05:37.784 --> 00:05:39.700 align:middle line:84%
So why would we turn
around and give you money

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.842 align:middle line:90%
when we know you're broke?

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:43.300 align:middle line:84%
So how are you
going to pay us back

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:90%
if we did give you the money?

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And so the British bankers
and the international bankers

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.380 align:middle line:84%
in Europe came up
with a brilliant idea.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:84%
We'll loan you the money,
whatever it is you need.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
We'll give you a blank
check, and you can

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.040 align:middle line:90%
do whatever you want with it.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And we'll loan you the money.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.290 align:middle line:84%
But what we want is, we want
your citizens as collateral.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea was we'll
give you lots of money,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:90%
but we want your daughter, OK?

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.110 align:middle line:90%
We want your son.

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.615 align:middle line:90%
We want your wife.

00:06:14.615 --> 00:06:18.060 align:middle line:10%
And so today we are
collateral for the money that

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.370 align:middle line:10%
was borrowed to keep the
corporation going, back

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.240 align:middle line:10%
in the 1870s to the
First World War.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And so today, we
still talk about how

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.070 align:middle line:90%
we have a national debt.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.980 align:middle line:84%
We have to pay off
this national debt.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.510 align:middle line:84%
No one's ever asked
the question--

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:34.830 align:middle line:90%
who are we paying off?

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Who we are in debt to?

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.120 align:middle line:10%
My God, I thought we were
the most powerful country

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:10%
in the world.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.180 align:middle line:10%
And we're the envy
of the whole world.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.430 align:middle line:10%
And yet, we have
a national debt.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.420 align:middle line:10%
And so the politicians
tell, no, no, what it is,

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.180 align:middle line:10%
is that we owe ourselves.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.290 align:middle line:90%
We do a lot for you.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
And so we've spent
a lot of money

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.850 align:middle line:84%
on you, building you bridges and
all that kind of stuff we do.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.440 align:middle line:10%
And so we just want to
keep it in the House,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.520 align:middle line:10%
so you need to pay us--

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.960 align:middle line:10%
your government.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but it's not
your government.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:84%
It represents the bankers
of Europe and England.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:90%
And there is a debt.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.890 align:middle line:10%
And you will pay it, because
the British bankers loaned us

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.920 align:middle line:10%
a lot of money to build our
railroads, and our airports,

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:10%
and our highways, and
all kinds of things

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.335 align:middle line:10%
that we've been
building America.

00:07:26.335 --> 00:07:28.060 align:middle line:90%
And it is very impressive.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but you don't
have any money.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:84%
You went broke during
the First World War.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:40.470 align:middle line:10%
And so that's why we today
are a collateral for the debt.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.150 align:middle line:10%
We do have a national debt and
ultimately at the bottom line

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:10%
is the Vatican.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.930 align:middle line:10%
The Vatican is the
ultimate bottom line

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:53.250 align:middle line:10%
on all of this dark dealings
behind the scenes with bankers

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:10%
in Europe, wars, and violence.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.140 align:middle line:84%
The whole banking
establishment is

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:90%
based on the Vatican canon law.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle line:84%
That's a very big story about
the history of the world.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And the 33rd President of the
United States was Harry Truman.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:84%
And Truman made an
interesting statement.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Somebody asked him, is there
anything going on in history

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.960 align:middle line:90%
that we haven't been told?

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.200 align:middle line:84%
And he said the only thing
that's hidden in history

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.520 align:middle line:84%
are the facts of life
that you don't know--

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.950 align:middle line:84%
how this country
really was founded,

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:36.299 align:middle line:84%
and where the money really came
from, and who you really are.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:90%
That-- you don't know.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's the real hidden
history of this country.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle line:84%
All of this stuff that
you think you understand--

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.450 align:middle line:84%
nobody really understands
how this system works.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:90%
It's based on your blood.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:90%
It's based on your body.

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.030 align:middle line:84%
It's based on putting
your children up

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:90%
as collateral for later bills.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a remarkable story.

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:01.950 align:middle line:84%
And it brings into
play the pirates

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
of the Caribbean, the Federal
Reserve, and the national wars.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Like you used to
many years ago--

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.060 align:middle line:84%
they used to say war
is good business.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:90%
You should invest your son.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.830 align:middle line:10%
It's just a business.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Today, we even have people
called fight promoters.

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.850 align:middle line:84%
They put up the money, and
they organize the fight.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:84%
And they pick out who's
going to fight who.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.500 align:middle line:90%
And they pay both sides.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.330 align:middle line:90%
And the whole thing is a show.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.750 align:middle line:10%
This is why during wartime,
you'll hear the generals

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.560 align:middle line:10%
talking about the wars in the
Pacific theatre or the wars

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.020 align:middle line:10%
in the Atlantic theatre.

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, theatre is a word
used in relation to a show.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:51.402 align:middle line:84%
And that's why,
because it is a show.

00:09:51.402 --> 00:09:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And then you get into the
esoteric symbols on the dollar

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.290 align:middle line:90%
bill side with the pyramid.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:10%
The pyramid has 13 layers.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.920 align:middle line:84%
There are 13 layers
in the pyramid.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:08.690 align:middle line:84%
There are 72 stones
in the pyramid.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:11.780 align:middle line:84%
The pyramid has an
all-seeing eye that's

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:90%
not touching the pyramid.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:21.650 align:middle line:10%
Above it, it has the letters
in Latin-- says Annuit coeptis.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.250 align:middle line:10%
Basically, Annuit coeptis
simply means our enterprise

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.120 align:middle line:10%
or our project.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:90%
Now, is the success.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.845 align:middle line:90%
What project?

00:10:31.845 --> 00:10:35.270 align:middle line:10%
What is it that's a project,
that's now a success?

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.920 align:middle line:10%
On the bottom, it says
Novus ordo seclorum.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Novus is a novice, meaning
new, ordo as order,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.700 align:middle line:84%
and seclorum is secular, which
means of the world as secular.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.200 align:middle line:84%
It's a secular project,
and it seems to be working.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.720 align:middle line:10%
So it's our project
is now a success.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.520 align:middle line:10%
What?

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:10%
The new order of the world.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.220 align:middle line:84%
When you hear people talking
about the new world order,

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.260 align:middle line:84%
it's on the American
dollar bill--

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.630 align:middle line:90%
new world order.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:05.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's based on what?

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.910 align:middle line:84%
It's based on the
ancient Egyptian concepts

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
of government, finance,
law, and the way

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.001 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Egyptians
understood the world at large.

00:11:16.001 --> 00:11:17.250 align:middle line:90%
That's why you have a pyramid.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, interesting
the word pyramid

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.810 align:middle line:84%
comes from-- it's
actually two words.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.630 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't know this.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Pyramid is two words put
together-- prya and mid.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.200 align:middle line:90%
Pyra is fire.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.710 align:middle line:84%
Like pyromaniacs,
pyro- text is fire.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:90%
And mid simply means middle.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So you put the two together,
because pyra, mid or the fire

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.790 align:middle line:90%
in the middle.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:84%
This is why today when you
go into a public building

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.600 align:middle line:84%
like restaurants and hotels,
you will see the restrooms

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:90%
for male and female, right?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And on the male restrooms
all over in the public--

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.520 align:middle line:90%
will always be a pyramid.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:10.610 align:middle line:84%
It's always a triangle or a
pyramid on a male restroom.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Women's is always a
circle on the women's.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.510 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.180 align:middle line:84%
Because the pyramid
is fire in the middle.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:21.350 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea was
that the fire of sex

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
is in the middle
of the human body.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the women are
also involved with this.

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:30.100 align:middle line:84%
They're called the
circle of life.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:84%
They keep the circle
of life going.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.260 align:middle line:84%
Without the women,
there's no children.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.089 align:middle line:10%
You'll see around the pyramid.

00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:38.005 align:middle line:10%
You will see a circle.

00:12:38.005 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:90%
And that symbolizes the sun.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:46.730 align:middle line:84%
And that symbolizing the sun
has to do with Stonehenge.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:84%
Stonehenge seems to be connected
to the Great Pyramid of Egypt,

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:54.730 align:middle line:84%
because they've used the
same identical measuring

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.110 align:middle line:84%
inside Stonehenge as
they used in the pyramid.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.570 align:middle line:84%
The connection
between Stonehenge

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and the Great Pyramid of
Egypt-- not all the pyramids.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Only that one pyramid
called the Great Pyramid.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.000 align:middle line:84%
That's not the big
one in the middle.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:84%
That's the one just
before it, is actually

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:14.350 align:middle line:90%
called the Great Pyramid.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:19.810 align:middle line:10%
And that Great Pyramid uses
what is called the Pyramid inch.

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.030 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with what
the Egyptians called

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.350 align:middle line:90%
the sacred cubit.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:24.510 align:middle line:90%
But that's another story.

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:30.790 align:middle line:10%
But the pyramid inch is used in
the pyramid and in Stonehenge.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.450 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:84%
This eye in the pyramid is
representing the Egyptian sun

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.790 align:middle line:90%
god.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.820 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
The eagle, of course,
represents the sun.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:48.420 align:middle line:84%
And of course, on
one side, we see

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:52.840 align:middle line:84%
that there's 32 feathers
in one wing of the eagle

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.730 align:middle line:90%
and 33 on the other wing.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:14:00.120 align:middle line:90%
32 and 33 are Masonic numbers--

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:05.187 align:middle line:84%
the 32nd degree and
then the 33rd degree.

00:14:05.187 --> 00:14:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when
you're going into court,

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.780 align:middle line:84%
they're going to give
you the third degree,

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and so showing that the courts
are all Masonic construction

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:14.816 align:middle line:90%
to start with.

00:14:14.816 --> 00:14:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not a Mason, you
need to stay out of court.

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Or you better find out what to
do when you go in the court,

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
because they're going to
give you the third degree.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:27.780 align:middle line:84%
You will see 13 stars
above the eagle's head.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.190 align:middle line:84%
But the 13 stars are in
the configuration of what

00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:34.672 align:middle line:90%
we call the Star of David.

00:14:34.672 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's actually a six-pointed
star, which is a hexagram.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:43.350 align:middle line:84%
We call it the Star of David,
but that is not correct.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Actually, in point of fact,
it's called the star of Saturn.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.560 align:middle line:84%
And look it up in
the encyclopedias.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And you will see a
six-pointed star--

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.855 align:middle line:84%
has always been referred
to as a star of Saturn.

00:14:54.855 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
But Saturn plays a very big part
today in the world religions.

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.130 align:middle line:90%
There are 13 stars.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:90%
There are 13 arrows.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.560 align:middle line:90%
There are 13 berries and leaves.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:10.740 align:middle line:84%
There are 13 strips
on the eagle's chest

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:15.600 align:middle line:84%
for the original
American flight.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:84%
The tail of the eagle
has nine feathers.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.330 align:middle line:90%
There's a reason why.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:84%
Nine is very important to the
secret societies of Freemasonry

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:28.140 align:middle line:90%
coming out of the Vatican.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:32.280 align:middle line:84%
The Vatican Freemasonry, York
and Scottish Rite Freemasonry--

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:35.430 align:middle line:84%
they all realize that there's
something very important

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:90%
about the nine feathers.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:42.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the tail feathers of a
bird help it direct its flight.

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:44.550 align:middle line:84%
They can decide
where it wants to go,

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.620 align:middle line:90%
according to the tail feathers.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:10%
The reason why
this is important--

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:10%
because if you look up the
history of the Knights Templar,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.050 align:middle line:10%
they were referred
to as the Knights

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:58.290 align:middle line:10%
of the Temple of Solomon.

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.300 align:middle line:84%
Today it's in the
Wailing Wall, is

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:84%
the Knights of the
Temple of Solomon,

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.990 align:middle line:90%
is at the Wailing Wall.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:06.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you look up in the
dictionaries or encyclopedias,

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:09.360 align:middle line:84%
the history of the
Knights Templars.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:11.940 align:middle line:10%
Today, what is called
Knights Templars--

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:17.280 align:middle line:10%
we in America today call them
the international bankers--

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.770 align:middle line:10%
the banking elite
like the Rothschilds,

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:23.490 align:middle line:10%
and the Rockefellers, and all
of these international elites.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:27.240 align:middle line:10%
All are referred to in
law as Knights Templars.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.730 align:middle line:84%
But the bottom line on
this is that if you look up

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:35.540 align:middle line:84%
the history of the Knights
Templars in encyclopedias,

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:84%
it will tell you that
these Knights Templars were

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:90%
founded by nine men.

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Nine men founded the
Knights Templars.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
give you some story

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:52.560 align:middle line:84%
about how these nine men got
together after the Crusades,

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:84%
once the Holy Land was protected
under the pope's dominion,

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.940 align:middle line:84%
and that there was so
many people-- wanted

00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.040 align:middle line:90%
to go to the Holy Land.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.880 align:middle line:84%
It was very dangerous traveling
in those days in the deserts

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:90%
to go to see the Holy Land.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:12.720 align:middle line:84%
Those nine men got together,
the reference works say.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And they formed a
protection for the pilgrims

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:84%
going from Rome and from
Europe over to the Middle East.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:84%
Well, logic alone would
tell you nine men are not

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:26.119 align:middle line:90%
going to protect anybody.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to go and protect
all the millions of pilgrims

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:34.830 align:middle line:84%
going to the Middle
East with nine men?

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:36.790 align:middle line:90%
That was a cover story.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.650 align:middle line:84%
Well, the actual story was--
is that the Knights Templars

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:84%
were nine Catholic Masonic
Order Freemasons who

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:84%
were putting together
for the Vatican

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.810 align:middle line:84%
a whole new
superstructure of money,

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.210 align:middle line:90%
and banking, and government.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And an entire operation was
under the Vatican control.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:00.210 align:middle line:84%
And there were nine
men who were in charge

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:05.190 align:middle line:84%
of that project of rebuilding
a new order in Europe.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why the eagle
has the nine tail feathers.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.195 align:middle line:84%
And most of the members of
secret societies know that.

00:18:14.195 --> 00:18:16.320 align:middle line:84%
If you bring this up,
they'll tell you, yeah, well,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.350 align:middle line:84%
there was no nine men who
protected the pilgrims.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:90%
No nine men could do that.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.520 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.570 align:middle line:84%
The eagle has always been
the symbol for the sun.

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:29.370 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:31.090 align:middle line:90%
Because it has an eagle eye.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And it can see everything,
and it's high up.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:90%
And the ancient peoples looked.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:84%
They saw their eyes
were perfectly round.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And then they looked
at the sky and see

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:90%
the sun is perfectly round.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And then in their mind,
the sun represented

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.370 align:middle line:84%
light, which light
means intellectuals,

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:51.210 align:middle line:90%
spiritual intelligence.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:53.910 align:middle line:84%
You're enlightened instead
of being ignorant, and ill

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.860 align:middle line:90%
informed, and in the dark.

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And so they figured that
God must be very bright.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.480 align:middle line:90%
He's very brilliant.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And so if you follow god,
the sun, you are his pupil.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why today we
have a pupil in the eye,

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:90%
because the sun is round.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:90%
And we are his people.

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:11.250 align:middle line:90%
We're following him.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading
back in the '60s

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:19.230 align:middle line:84%
that the dimensions
of the dollar bill

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
were based on the old Arabic
dimensions of a magic carpet.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
They said that this was
like a magic carpet.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.480 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:84%
If you got up on it,
you could go anywhere.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Lots of interesting things
about the American dollar bill

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:40.620 align:middle line:84%
and our actual, real history
of where we've come from.

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.030 align:middle line:84%
