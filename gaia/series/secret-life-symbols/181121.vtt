00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.790 align:middle line:10%
>> The Lost Ark of the
Hebrews is today referred

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.550 align:middle line:10%
to as the Lost Ark
of the Covenant.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:84%
Here's a very nice
picture of what

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:84%
the Lost Ark of the Covenant
of the Hebrews looked like.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.180 align:middle line:10%
But here, we have a picture of
the Ark of the Covenant carried

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.350 align:middle line:10%
by the priest of Israel.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.330 align:middle line:10%
It's a large chest
with two angels sitting

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.070 align:middle line:10%
on the top of the chest.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally,
the chest was said

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.760 align:middle line:84%
to be so important and so holy
that one could not actually

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.690 align:middle line:90%
touch it.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.460 align:middle line:84%
You would not want to
touch it, for you will die.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And so God said to put ring
eyes on the side of the chest

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and put poles through
it so you could carry it

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.700 align:middle line:90%
without touching it.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.489 align:middle line:84%
So that's interesting,
that this is

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.550 align:middle line:84%
a general idea about what
the Ark of the Covenant

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.660 align:middle line:90%
of the Hebrews looked like.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.670 align:middle line:84%
The Ark of the Covenant was a
symbolic connection between God

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.370 align:middle line:84%
and the Hebrew people,
the things which

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.500 align:middle line:84%
both God and the
Hebrew people held

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.590 align:middle line:84%
to be so sacred to
their relationship.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.070 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was that both God
and the Hebrew people agreed

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:84%
on certain things
were so important

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:84%
that they would put
them into this chest,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and protect it and
keep it together.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
And so it represented
God's connections

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.450 align:middle line:84%
with the ancient Hebrew people,
the most important symbols.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.530 align:middle line:84%
We're told in the Book of
Revelation what the items were.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.410 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get into that
later, because it's actually

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:84%
written in the Bible what was
in the Ark of the Covenant.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't used as
a weapon as such,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
but we're told that it
was able to kill you.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:84%
It was able to strike you
dead if you touched it.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know if it was
actually used as a weapon.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But it was a
protection, supposedly,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.470 align:middle line:84%
that God put on that,
that if you touched it

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:84%
without permission,
you could die.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.720 align:middle line:84%
Today, we have
pictures like this

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:84%
showing the Israeli priests,
the ancient priests of Israel,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
showing how much they adore
this magic and important Ark

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.730 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.360 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Here's a picture of King
David bringing the Lost Ark

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.120 align:middle line:90%
of the Covenant into Jerusalem.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And everyone not in the
procession is on their knees,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.220 align:middle line:84%
realizing that the Ark was
representing the very presence

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.780 align:middle line:90%
of their God in their presence.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.954 align:middle line:84%
And these were very holy
symbols to the Jewish people.

00:02:49.954 --> 00:02:51.370 align:middle line:84%
There have been
many books written

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.410 align:middle line:84%
about the Lost Ark
of the Covenant,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.820 align:middle line:84%
of course, and two books
in particular that deal

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.250 align:middle line:90%
with the point I wish to make.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:10%
One is called "Lost
Secrets of the Sacred Ark."

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:10%
And of course, there have been
a lot of lost secrets relating

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:10%
to the Sacred Ark.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.720 align:middle line:10%
Sir Laurence Gardner in England,
which was Sir Laurence Gardner,

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.190 align:middle line:10%
he had been knighted
by the Queen,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:10%
and he was an expert on
these arcane subjects

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.680 align:middle line:10%
like the Ark of the Covenant.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.980 align:middle line:84%
And then there's another one
called "Secrets and Mysteries

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:90%
of the Lost Ark."

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why these two are
important to my conversation

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.970 align:middle line:84%
is because I want to
emphasize that there

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
were a lot of secrets
and mysteries in relation

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:84%
to the Ark that maybe people
still don't know today.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.700 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
secret of all concerning

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.180 align:middle line:84%
the Lost Ark of the
Hebrews is it was not

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Hebrew at all to start with.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
There was no Hebrew
Ark in history.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.910 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of an Ark
of the Covenant, covenant

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.270 align:middle line:84%
simply means contract,
and so the whole idea

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.780 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Contract or
Covenant was not Hebrew at all,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:90%
it was Egyptian.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And so let me show you
what I'm talking about.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:10%
If you go to Bible dictionaries
and look up the word ark,

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.900 align:middle line:10%
you will see that even the
Bible dictionaries tell you

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.000 align:middle line:10%
that the very word ark
comes from the Egyptian.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:10%
And then it shows you
a typical Egyptian ark.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:10%
And then if you go to
another Bible dictionary,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:10%
it talks about the Egyptian
ark, or the sacred chest.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.210 align:middle line:10%
And so now you
begin to see, when

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.930 align:middle line:10%
you start doing the research on
the Lost Ark of the Covenant,

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.020 align:middle line:10%
you begin to see that
a lot of pictures

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.570 align:middle line:10%
have come out of the
ancient world showing you

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.470 align:middle line:10%
that the Egyptians had
an ark, not the Hebrews.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And here is an Egyptian
ark and an Egyptian priest

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:90%
in an Egyptian museum.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So my point in showing
you this is the fact

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.730 align:middle line:84%
that the Lost Ark of the
Covenant was borrowed,

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.950 align:middle line:84%
the idea was borrowed
from the Egyptians.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.580 align:middle line:10%
Here's an ancient
Egyptian priest

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:10%
with a golden ark on an
ancient Egyptian wall

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.340 align:middle line:10%
painting showing the priest
carrying the golden ark.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:10%
And this particular one
picture is on the Temple Ramses

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.030 align:middle line:10%
at Abydos in Egypt.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.980 align:middle line:10%
And you will see there is the
Ark, the Ark of the Contract,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.570 align:middle line:10%
the Ark of the
Covenant, but you don't

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.140 align:middle line:10%
see Hebrews priests carrying
it, you see Egyptians,

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.400 align:middle line:10%
because it was an Egyptian
ark to start with.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
That's an Egyptian god
Anubis on the left,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.270 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the right
on his holy ark.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian Ark Anubis
was pictured as a dog

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.060 align:middle line:84%
because it represents the star
system of Sirius, the dog star.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.240 align:middle line:10%
And so Sirius the
dog star, in order

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:10%
to honor the god in Sirius,
they made it into a dog,

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:10%
so because Sirius is
referred to as the dog star.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But the point is, on
the right-hand side,

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.800 align:middle line:84%
you will see the dog
star sitting on the Holy

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:90%
Ark of the Covenant in Egypt.

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.280 align:middle line:10%
And here's that same Ark
when it was originally

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:10%
found by Lord Carnarvon in
Egypt many, many years ago.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.000 align:middle line:90%


00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:84%
If you'll remember,
in the movie,

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:30.110 align:middle line:84%
Indiana Jones has to find the
Lost Ark in a tomb in Egypt.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:10%
The very word, the
lower paragraph

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.350 align:middle line:10%
says the very idea of
the Ark of the Covenant

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.630 align:middle line:10%
was copied from the Egyptians.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:10%
So this is what you'll find
in most all reference works.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.810 align:middle line:84%
It will tell you, even in
Bible dictionaries will

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.740 align:middle line:84%
tell you there was no Ark
of the Covenant in Israel,

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
but there was an original
Ark of the Contract in Egypt.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.960 align:middle line:10%
So here we see on
the left-hand side

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:10%
the Egyptians carrying their
holy Ark, and on the right side

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:03.930 align:middle line:10%
the Hebrews carrying the Ark
which was the borrowed story.

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.040 align:middle line:10%
And so the original Ark
and the mythical Ark.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.830 align:middle line:10%
This is very important
to keep in mind,

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.260 align:middle line:10%
because when you look at the
Lost Ark of the Covenant,

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:10%
it supposedly is a very
important symbol to the Hebrew

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.680 align:middle line:10%
religion, but now
we're finding out

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:10%
that it's actually an
Egyptian symbol, had nothing

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:10%
to do with the ancient Hebrews.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.560 align:middle line:84%
Even National Geographics
did a piece on,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:84%
a video show on the
Ark of the Covenant,

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and which they entitled it
"Many Legends But No Evidence."

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.590 align:middle line:10%
The idea of having a
holy chest or a holy ark

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:42.770 align:middle line:10%
is an Egyptian idea.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:10%
It's an Egyptian concept.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:10%
The point being is
that it would have

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.790 align:middle line:10%
been a copy of an Egyptian ark.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And so today, incidentally, in
the Ethiopian Orthodox Church

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.120 align:middle line:84%
in Ethiopia, they
claim to actually

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.450 align:middle line:84%
have the original Ark of
the Covenant of the Hebrews

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:90%
at that church.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.190 align:middle line:84%
But they go on to say that
the object is currently

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.900 align:middle line:84%
kept under strict guard in
the treasury of the church.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.790 align:middle line:10%
And so you can't
come in to see it.

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.200 align:middle line:84%
But they've got
it, but you can't

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.310 align:middle line:84%
see it, which is, of course,
convenient because you don't

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:90%
know if they have it or not.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.140 align:middle line:84%
If they have it, you
can't see it anyway.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.840 align:middle line:84%
There are many mysteries
surrounding the Ark,

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.980 align:middle line:84%
many questions about what
is it and where is it

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.980 align:middle line:90%
and who actually owns it.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:39.260 align:middle line:84%
But I don't believe that the Ark
of the Covenant ever existed.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.200 align:middle line:84%
From my understanding,
it never existed.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:84%
It was borrowed from day one,
the idea, from the Egyptians.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.940 align:middle line:10%
However, there are many other
mysteries and strange things

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.840 align:middle line:10%
in relation to the Ark,
and the Holy Bible,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.410 align:middle line:10%
in the New Testament, the
last book of the Bible

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:10%
is called the Book
of Revelation.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:10%
And in the Book
of Revelation, it

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:10%
tells you why no one
has and no one ever

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.930 align:middle line:10%
will find the Lost Ark.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.820 align:middle line:84%
And it says, "the temple of
God was opened in heaven,

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and there was seen the
Ark of the Covenant,

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.275 align:middle line:90%
the Ark of the Testament."

00:09:18.275 --> 00:09:24.460 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.620 align:middle line:84%
Right, now the next
subject I would

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.000 align:middle line:84%
like to share with you is about
the King Solomon in the Bible.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.050 align:middle line:84%
A very important name in the
biblical history of the Hebrews

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:36.970 align:middle line:90%
was King Solomon.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally, the Temple
Institute in Jerusalem today

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.290 align:middle line:84%
is preparing-- they've
already spent $27 million,

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:48.190 align:middle line:84%
we're told, on
preparing a building

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.520 align:middle line:84%
for the rebuilding of the
Jewish temple, the old temple

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.740 align:middle line:90%
of Solomon.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we need to
know about the ancient temple

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:59.440 align:middle line:84%
of King Solomon is that
there was no ancient King

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.180 align:middle line:84%
Solomon to start with, and he
didn't have a temple, either.

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:10%
There are some reference
works out there

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.640 align:middle line:10%
about the temple showing
that it was just a story,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:10%
and that there was no temple.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And today, there are a lot of
academic books being written

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.400 align:middle line:84%
about the whole
idea of King Solomon

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.290 align:middle line:84%
as a king is a myth, a
king that never existed.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And so here's one article
called "The Myth of Solomon."

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:84%
This is written by the
Department of Classical

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and Near Eastern Studies
in Melbourne, Australia.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:36.160 align:middle line:10%
Another book, called
"The Templars,

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.990 align:middle line:10%
or the History of the Myth
from Solomon's Temple."

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, Solomon became
king because his father

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.840 align:middle line:90%
was King David.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:84%
So when his father
left the kingship,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.230 align:middle line:84%
it was given to King
Solomon, his son.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.040 align:middle line:84%
So King Solomon was
very famous in history

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:84%
for being a very
wise man, and very,

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.770 align:middle line:84%
very highly intelligent
and very interesting.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:09.970 align:middle line:84%
He was a very wise
man, wise King Solomon.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well we're
told that he built

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.020 align:middle line:84%
a whole nation,
and great temples

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of
marvelous things

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.480 align:middle line:84%
that this King Solomon
did for the Jewish people.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.100 align:middle line:10%
But in point of fact, today,
reference works coming out

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:30.670 align:middle line:10%
of Israel say that there is no
evidence that King Solomon ever

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:33.140 align:middle line:10%
lived, and for sure
there's no evidence

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:37.630 align:middle line:10%
a great civilisation or
temples or anything at all

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.580 align:middle line:10%
was ever erected
to King Solomon.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.680 align:middle line:10%
They've never heard of it.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.110 align:middle line:84%
Donald Redford, an author and
leading authority on the era,

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:84%
writes in frustration about
the absence of anything

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:54.310 align:middle line:84%
to verify or to prove
the Bible stories.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:84%
He writes, "such topics as the
foreign policy of King David

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:02.950 align:middle line:84%
or his son, Solomon,
Solomon's trade in horses

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:05.800 align:middle line:84%
and in his marriage
with Pharaoh's daughter

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.550 align:middle line:84%
must remain themes of
the midrash and fictional

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:14.230 align:middle line:84%
treatment," because it
was a fictional story.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:19.000 align:middle line:84%
Midrash is the commentaries
of the ancient rabbis,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.030 align:middle line:84%
commentaries written
about stories that we read

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.740 align:middle line:90%
in the Old Testament Bible.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Here's Philip Davies, "In
Search of Ancient Israel."

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:90%
He discounts in any possibility.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.520 align:middle line:84%
He says, quote, "a Davidic
empire administered

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.330 align:middle line:84%
from Jerusalem, the range
of indices considered

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.750 align:middle line:84%
by Jamieson-Drake
make it necessary

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:46.490 align:middle line:84%
for us to exclude the Davidic
and the Solomonic monarchies,

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.450 align:middle line:84%
let alone their empire
and a non-biblical history

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:52.220 align:middle line:90%
of Palestine."

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.550 align:middle line:84%
So what the article is saying
is that it's very difficult

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:84%
to prove there ever was a King
Solomon or a King Solomon's

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:90%
reign in Jerusalem.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.910 align:middle line:90%
There's just no proof of it.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Nothing can be unequivocally
attributed to Solomon,

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.400 align:middle line:84%
nor is there any trace
of a great culture

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:90%
that he developed.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Hazor, Megiddo, Gezer, they
have been widely excavated,

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and palaces, temples, and
fortifications have been found,

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.450 align:middle line:90%
but none mentioned Solomon.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:33.590 align:middle line:84%
People believe such myth and
they succeed in their purpose

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:38.300 align:middle line:84%
because they are attractive
stories, and convincing.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.010 align:middle line:84%
If they were not,
they would be useless.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:48.430 align:middle line:84%
The popularity of myths cannot
be any evidence of their truth.

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Another article
says, "the absence

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.780 align:middle line:84%
of any historical
confirmation of a Solomon

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.980 align:middle line:84%
simply does not deter
biblical scholars.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.400 align:middle line:84%
God has told them that
there was a Solomon,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.670 align:middle line:84%
and so what scholarship
can contradict that?"

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:10.130 align:middle line:10%
One of the most popular
and very well-known

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:13.970 align:middle line:10%
scientists and historians
in Israel, his name

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:10%
is Israel Finkelstein.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:84%
And he has written quite a
few very important books here

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:23.030 align:middle line:84%
lately concerning
Israel's history.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.900 align:middle line:10%
And in this one,
"the antiquities scam

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:10%
exposed the gullibility
of believers.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.180 align:middle line:10%
Israel Finkelstein, the
noted Israeli archaeologist,

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:10%
observed that inscribed objects
are extremely rare and proper

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:10%
archaeological
digs in Palestine,

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:48.080 align:middle line:10%
and yet the antiquities
market kept producing them

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.910 align:middle line:10%
by the cartloads."

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Now quoting
Finkelstein directly,

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
he said, "there is an eagerness
all over the world in museums

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.970 align:middle line:84%
to display antiquities
of great value,

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.850 align:middle line:84%
and there is no question
that some of them

00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:08.300 align:middle line:84%
were not careful enough
in their methods.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.740 align:middle line:84%
It was some sort of
a naivete, something

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:16.760 align:middle line:90%
about wanting to believe."

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you go on the web yourself
and look up Solomon's temple

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.850 align:middle line:84%
myth, you will see that
both Solomon and the idea

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:84%
of his temple is
actually considered

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.440 align:middle line:90%
a myth around the world.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.030 align:middle line:90%
Solomon did not exist.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.770 align:middle line:84%
This article is
"Solomon Did Not Exist."

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
The archaeological
evidence in Jerusalem

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:84%
for the famous building projects
of Solomon is non-existence.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.530 align:middle line:84%
19th and early 20th
century excavations

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:84%
around the Temple
Mount in Jerusalem

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:57.740 align:middle line:84%
failed to identify even a trace
of Solomon's fabled temple

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:90%
or palace complex.

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:05.300 align:middle line:90%
This is from Israel Finkelstein.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So we see that there are
many articles been written

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:14.810 align:middle line:84%
about the idea that the temple
and King Solomon are both myth.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.920 align:middle line:84%
If there was no King
David or a King Solomon,

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.100 align:middle line:84%
then where do we get
the name Solomon?

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.070 align:middle line:84%
The origin of Solomon
is simply the name

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:29.160 align:middle line:84%
of the sun in three
ancient languages--

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:34.260 align:middle line:84%
Latin, Hindi, and
Egyptian, as you will see.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.550 align:middle line:84%
If you do some homework
on the subject,

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:40.500 align:middle line:84%
you will see that Solomon
comes from "sol," "om,"

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.730 align:middle line:84%
and "on," three
names of the sun.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.880 align:middle line:10%
At the top, you will see
"sol" is an ancient Roman god

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:53.460 align:middle line:10%
personification of the sun,
a sun god in Rome named Sol.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.120 align:middle line:10%
Sol is Latin for the sun.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.460 align:middle line:10%
And then O-M, "om," we all
remember the priest of Om.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:10%
And it's a holy meditation
symbol in the Hindi.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.050 align:middle line:10%
And so that's where we
get O-M, as in "om."

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:12.240 align:middle line:10%
And then, of course,
the city of the sun,

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:10%
today we refer to
it as Heliopolis.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:20.700 align:middle line:10%
It is actually, in the ancient
world, called "on," O-N.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So when you take the
three names of the sun,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.190 align:middle line:84%
"sol," "om," and "on,"
it becomes Solomon.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But there was no
man named Solomon,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:34.050 align:middle line:84%
it's the name of the sun in
three separate languages.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:38.630 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the original
name of Solomon was Shlomo.

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:43.700 align:middle line:10%
But the Masonic Orders
during the early Middle Ages

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:10%
seized upon that name
and changed it a bit

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.510 align:middle line:10%
to be Sol-Om-On.

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:84%
It was actually a purposely
mistranslated word

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.980 align:middle line:84%
because Solomon was not the
original name of the king.

00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:02.960 align:middle line:10%
Now we see that Sol-Om-On,
according to the Masonic Order,

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:10%
puts Solomon into the
position of being a sun god.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And so the temple of
Solomon was actually,

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:84%
according to the Masonic Orders,
the Great Pyramid of Egypt.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Solomon's temple was the
Great Pyramid of Egypt,

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.250 align:middle line:90%
according to World Freemasonry.

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:25.630 align:middle line:84%
And because the pyramid was
called the Pyramid of the Sun,

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:30.530 align:middle line:84%
and so it was the
sun was Sol-Om-On,

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:37.520 align:middle line:84%
because they had tried to make
Solomon represent a sun god,

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:42.200 align:middle line:84%
because the sun is very
important in World Freemasonry.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And so the sun represents
light, intellectual, spiritual

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.230 align:middle line:90%
enlightenment.

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So the Masonic Order, it
wants to take the Shlomo

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and make it into
Sol-Om-On, as we

00:18:55.370 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:84%
see in the Masonic literature,
and present King Solomon

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.240 align:middle line:90%
as a king of wisdom.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:90%
He's is a very wise king.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom, or an intellectual,
spiritual knowledge.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:16.520 align:middle line:84%
Freemasonry quite often
will change names and change

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.290 align:middle line:84%
histories to fit
their concept of where

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.415 align:middle line:90%
they're going with symbols.

00:19:22.415 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the idea
of Solomon's temple

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:32.720 align:middle line:84%
as it's presented to us
today by the Masonic Order,

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:84%
because it's a very important
symbol in Freemasonry,

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Solomon's temple.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:84%
So how are we to understand
the symbolism that the Masonic

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.400 align:middle line:90%
Order designs Solomon's temple?

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.530 align:middle line:10%
Well, let's look at the layout.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:51.980 align:middle line:10%
According to the Masonic Order,
the old ancient Solomon's

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.640 align:middle line:10%
temple, as it is even
today, reproduced

00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:10%
as if it were being built today,
is obviously a phallic symbol.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:05.390 align:middle line:10%
The Masonic Order has used the
same phallic symbol many times.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:84%
The architectural
symbolism is very obvious.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:12.920 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea of
Solomon's temple

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
begins to take on because
of the World Masonic Order,

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and incidentally the
World Masonic Order

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.570 align:middle line:84%
is talking today about
rebuilding Solomon's temple.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.240 align:middle line:10%
But here, in
Freemasonry today, we

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.880 align:middle line:10%
see Solomon's temple
as a Masonic symbolism.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.190 align:middle line:84%
But it's based on
sexual symbolism.

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people don't realize,
unless you see it from above,

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.590 align:middle line:10%
and see the Masonic
architecture.

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
The Old Testament Bible is
filled with sexual symbols.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.090 align:middle line:84%
One example is the story of
Jacob and his pillar god,

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.740 align:middle line:84%
found in the book of
Genesis, 35:9 through 15,

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.540 align:middle line:84%
where Jacob is said to have
fallen asleep on a rock,

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and when he woke up the next
morning he had a vision by God

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:07.600 align:middle line:84%
so he felt that that rock
itself was very, very important,

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:90%
a very spiritual symbol.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:14.770 align:middle line:84%
So he said that this
rock that I have slept on

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.650 align:middle line:84%
is a symbol for
God's house, and this

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:19.510 align:middle line:84%
is where God is,
he's in this rock,

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:84%
because I had a dream
that God gave me.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.940 align:middle line:10%
After Jacob dreamed that
Yahweh stood on a ladder that

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:31.990 align:middle line:10%
reached into heaven and
promised him great fertility,

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.300 align:middle line:10%
he awakened out of his
sleep, the scripture

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.920 align:middle line:10%
says, and took the stone that
he had put up for his pillow

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.710 align:middle line:10%
and set it up as a pillar, and
poured oil on the top of it.

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:47.470 align:middle line:10%
That's from Genesis
28:10 through 22.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.700 align:middle line:10%
On another occasion, we read
that God appeared to Jacob

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.990 align:middle line:10%
and promised that nations would
be coming out of his loins.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.950 align:middle line:10%
And Jacob would set up a pillar
in the place where he talked

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.010 align:middle line:10%
with God, and the
pillar of stone,

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.060 align:middle line:10%
and he poured a drink
offering thereon,

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:09.150 align:middle line:10%
and he poured oil there upon it.

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Here is a typical picture of
Jacob pouring the sacred oil

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:90%
on the pillar that he slept on.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.465 align:middle line:10%
This was obviously
a phallic symbol.

00:22:20.465 --> 00:22:23.530 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So many people attribute
things to be sacred

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.290 align:middle line:84%
when, in point of
fact, they may mean

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:30.901 align:middle line:90%
something totally different.

00:22:30.901 --> 00:22:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:36.940 align:middle line:84%
The whole world knows what
happened to the Twin Towers

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:39.910 align:middle line:90%
in New York in 2001.

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:84%
The twin towers has
become a very big subject

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.770 align:middle line:84%
around the world, but
I want to show you

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:50.420 align:middle line:84%
where the idea, the concept,
of twin towers came from.

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.370 align:middle line:10%
We all know about the twin
towers and the World Trade

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:59.050 align:middle line:10%
Center in New York, and just
about everybody on Earth

00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:01.460 align:middle line:10%
has seen it all many times.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:04.480 align:middle line:10%
But there's more to the
story about the twin towers,

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:06.640 align:middle line:10%
as you will see.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.550 align:middle line:84%
Most folks are not
aware that, when

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:84%
you see two tall highrises
standing together,

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:18.190 align:middle line:84%
that this is a very
ancient symbol coming out

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:22.700 align:middle line:84%
of the ancient world, looking
back to thousands of years ago.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the
idea of two twin towers,

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and what they symbolically
actually represent.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.390 align:middle line:10%
We see these twin
towers quite literally

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:42.400 align:middle line:10%
around the world, in
India, in hotels, in Italy,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.840 align:middle line:10%
in the Middle East.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:48.700 align:middle line:10%
In Egypt they have twin
obelisks, or twin towers.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:52.510 align:middle line:84%
In Islam, all over
the Islamic world you

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:56.050 align:middle line:84%
have twin towers
before the mosques.

00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:59.440 align:middle line:10%
In Nazi Germany,
they had twin towers,

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.760 align:middle line:10%
twin towers in churches.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:10%
And these are in
synagogues, for instance.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.250 align:middle line:84%
These synagogues
have twin towers.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.550 align:middle line:84%
In the Masonic Order there
is the two twin towers which

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.490 align:middle line:90%
are called Jachin and Boaz.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:17.040 align:middle line:10%
Twin towers are everywhere.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.980 align:middle line:84%
And there is a reason
why there is something

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.410 align:middle line:90%
called the twin towers.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:25.440 align:middle line:10%
And that's what I want to get
into and explain to you where

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:29.430 align:middle line:10%
this idea comes from
and what it represents.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.940 align:middle line:10%
You will begin to see the
idea, the very concept

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:37.600 align:middle line:10%
of two identical towers is
used in Christianity, Judaism,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.500 align:middle line:10%
Islam, and of course
in the secular world.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:45.150 align:middle line:10%
And most people do not
realize the actual reason

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.610 align:middle line:10%
why and what the twin
towers symbolizes.

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:52.000 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at the origins
of the idea of building

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
twin towers and twin
pillars, and it all

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.980 align:middle line:84%
started in India
thousands of years ago,

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and then to Egypt,
and finally to today.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:06.070 align:middle line:10%
In the book, "Symbols, Sex, and
the Stars in Popular Beliefs"

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.120 align:middle line:10%
which is a book discussing
all the ancient symbols

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.000 align:middle line:10%
of religions, by Ernest
Busenbark dedicated

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:10%
to understanding the
symbolism in the ancient world

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.420 align:middle line:10%
and how it impacts us today.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:10%
According to the Egyptians, you
had two phallic symbols holding

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:26.820 align:middle line:10%
up the canopy of heaven.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.800 align:middle line:10%
The two phallic symbols are
the two phallic pillars.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.640 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
symbolism in ancient Egypt,

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's found
quite a few places.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:41.440 align:middle line:10%
The twin towers
idea, worldwide, in

00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.990 align:middle line:10%
the old ancient
Babylonian system,

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.150 align:middle line:10%
the kings that would
rise in the morning

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:10%
between twin towers,
two towers, this

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:10%
is the old Babylonian system.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.190 align:middle line:84%
In India, you have
the gods standing

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.080 align:middle line:90%
between the two towers.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.490 align:middle line:90%
It was an idea of twin columns.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:02.470 align:middle line:10%
It goes back into
the ancient world.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The twin towers are
connected to the concept

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.490 align:middle line:84%
in the ancient world of
twin phallic pillars.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the
twin, the pillars

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.940 align:middle line:84%
on each side of the opening
and then the large twin pillars

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.690 align:middle line:90%
on both sides.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.830 align:middle line:84%
The idea comes from
a biblical story

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:27.330 align:middle line:84%
about a symbol which today has
been taken up by Freemasonry.

00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:10%
The Masonic Order has
taken from the Bible

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.770 align:middle line:10%
the story about Jachin and Boaz.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:38.580 align:middle line:10%
They were twin towers, or
they were twin pillars.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:43.010 align:middle line:84%
And they represented
two phallic pillars.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:46.221 align:middle line:84%
And so we're talking
about phallic worship now.

00:26:46.221 --> 00:26:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that a lot of people

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.880 align:middle line:84%
don't connect to the
idea of twin towers.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:55.110 align:middle line:84%
But it goes back into an
ancient time where the idea was

00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:90%
two phallic pillars.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:00.435 align:middle line:10%
And they were called Jachin
and Boaz in the Bible.

00:27:00.435 --> 00:27:03.225 align:middle line:10%
And this is a
Masonic symbol today.

00:27:03.225 --> 00:27:05.790 align:middle line:10%
It has been picked up
and used in Freemasonry

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.470 align:middle line:10%
around the world.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.590 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is
because you need

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.540 align:middle line:90%
the two to hold up the heavens.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it with one.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:10%
And so the ancient
Egyptians always

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.935 align:middle line:10%
showed two towers,
or two pillars.

00:27:19.935 --> 00:27:23.380 align:middle line:90%


00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:27.670 align:middle line:10%
There is obviously more yet,
to the story of twin towers,

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:29.980 align:middle line:10%
but I'm just giving you
a brief introduction

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:35.320 align:middle line:10%
to the idea that there is
a symbolism involved here

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.260 align:middle line:10%
that most people are
not aware of until you

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:42.910 align:middle line:10%
begin to see how many times
that idea keeps popping up.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:47.310 align:middle line:90%


00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:51.000 align:middle line:10%
A lot of people, when you
mention the word New Age,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.980 align:middle line:10%
it causes visions of people
who are into metaphysics,

00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.360 align:middle line:10%
spiritual retreats,
hallucinogenics,

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:05.460 align:middle line:10%
all sorts of ideas are
generated by the term New Age.

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And it has become a very
important subject, especially

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.620 align:middle line:90%
in the religious world.

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:15.990 align:middle line:84%
Are we humans on this Earth
approaching a New Age which

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:18.440 align:middle line:84%
is filled with darkness
and evil because this

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.530 align:middle line:84%
is what Christianity is
portraying the New Age as?

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you
that that is incorrect.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.590 align:middle line:84%
That the New Age is in
the Bible all the way

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:84%
through the scriptures it
talks about the New Age.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:36.940 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has heard the stories
of the end of the world.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
talk about the New

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Age as the end of the world.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:46.770 align:middle line:84%
But very few people realize that
both subjects about the New Age

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.380 align:middle line:84%
and the end of the world
are the same thing.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:53.160 align:middle line:90%


00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with the
end of the world.

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:59.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go to the
origins of the New Age,

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.480 align:middle line:84%
and then the Christian
church's view.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:06.290 align:middle line:10%
First of all, we've been
hearing about this idea

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.080 align:middle line:10%
of the end of the
world for hundreds

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.840 align:middle line:10%
if not thousands of years.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.100 align:middle line:84%
There have been religions
around the world talking

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:16.910 align:middle line:84%
about the end of the
world, and especially

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:90%
nowadays with the world today.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:24.320 align:middle line:84%
The end of the world which
implies a world conflagration

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.960 align:middle line:84%
of wars and violence,
atomic destruction,

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.260 align:middle line:84%
chaotic destruction
of the human race,

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:38.050 align:middle line:84%
famines, disease, wars,
violence, revolutions.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:41.110 align:middle line:10%
The entire idea of
the end of the world

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:46.420 align:middle line:10%
is apocalyptic in proportions
implying the end of humanity

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.860 align:middle line:10%
itself.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's see what the actual
term end of the world

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:55.750 align:middle line:84%
really means from the
Bible's viewpoint.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.920 align:middle line:10%
We have books called "The
End of the World," "How Will

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.880 align:middle line:10%
the World End," "The Atomic
Bomb and the End of the World."

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.070 align:middle line:10%
The New Testament
King James version

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:10.050 align:middle line:10%
talks about in the
book of Matthew, 13,

00:30:10.050 --> 00:30:12.850 align:middle line:10%
it says that Jesus
said the enemy that

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.490 align:middle line:10%
sows them is the
devil, and the harvest

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.140 align:middle line:10%
is the end of the world.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Here's Jesus talking about
the end of the world.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:24.070 align:middle line:84%
End of the world,
but important is

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:84%
what does the word world mean
and where does it come from?

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.750 align:middle line:84%
Interesting also is
another scripture

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.880 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, Jesus
talks about something

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:37.510 align:middle line:90%
he called the regeneration.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:40.600 align:middle line:10%
The footnote says it
will mean a renewal

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.950 align:middle line:10%
or a recreation of the
whole social order on Earth.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:48.250 align:middle line:10%
Jesus talked about
this regeneration.

00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:51.010 align:middle line:10%
And then adds that
that regeneration

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.410 align:middle line:10%
will be God's kingdom.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.870 align:middle line:84%
Here we have in the
scriptures talking

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:58.360 align:middle line:84%
about what Jesus said,
"Verily I say unto

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:02.870 align:middle line:84%
you, you who follow me in the
regeneration of the world."

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.920 align:middle line:84%
We've seen regeneration
means making it new,

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:90%
recreating the whole world.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And we find other
Bible translations

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.590 align:middle line:84%
when speaking about this
recreation of the social order

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:20.790 align:middle line:84%
of the world refers to it as the
New World Order, the new world.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.200 align:middle line:84%
In "The Interpreter's
Bible Dictionary,"

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:84%
we see it talking
about the regeneration.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.840 align:middle line:84%
And it says that this
regeneration, there

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.640 align:middle line:84%
is a reward in the world to
come, which is a regeneration,

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.740 align:middle line:90%
or a new world.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.880 align:middle line:84%
So that does not
imply that there's

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.080 align:middle line:84%
a destruction of the whole
humanity in the world when

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:45.430 align:middle line:84%
there's going to be a reward
and a time of regeneration,

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:46.990 align:middle line:90%
or the new world.

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:51.250 align:middle line:84%
"The Commentary Bible"
says, the promise

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:55.930 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the new world,
a regeneration or a rebirth

00:31:55.930 --> 00:32:00.700 align:middle line:84%
in an age to come, there will be
a new heavens and a new earth.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.820 align:middle line:84%
Here in the "Bible
Encyclopedia" it says,

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.270 align:middle line:84%
in the new world or
the regeneration.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.580 align:middle line:84%
Again, that word
keeps coming up.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
Josephus used it
as the restoration

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:13.720 align:middle line:90%
of the land of Israel.

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Jewish hopes await a
renewal both of the land

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.640 align:middle line:90%
and the entire world.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And so the Son of Man,
Jesus, his domination

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:27.700 align:middle line:84%
will be in the time, which
is called the new age.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So in the New
Testament word, world,

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:33.850 align:middle line:90%
is actually a Greek word, aion.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:36.010 align:middle line:90%
Aion does not mean world.

00:32:36.010 --> 00:32:39.490 align:middle line:84%
It was a mistranslation
and a misunderstanding

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:43.930 align:middle line:84%
by the church fathers who
translated the Latin Vulgate.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:46.900 align:middle line:84%
They took the word
from the Greek, aion,

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.390 align:middle line:90%
and thought it meant world.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, now we understand,
no, it was a mistake.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.810 align:middle line:90%
World is age.

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:59.320 align:middle line:90%
The word age is actually aion.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear people talking
about the end of the world,

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:08.110 align:middle line:84%
no, it's the end of
an age which implies

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:10.590 align:middle line:90%
that there's a new age coming.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And there has been
other ages in the past,

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.790 align:middle line:84%
and we're living in
a particular age now.

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:19.150 align:middle line:10%
And there will be
a new age coming.

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:10%
For instance, here's a
quote from a reference

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:23.620 align:middle line:10%
work on the Bible.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.610 align:middle line:10%
It says, "The world,
or age to come,

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:31.060 align:middle line:10%
was a familiar expression among
the Jews for the Messiah's

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.940 align:middle line:10%
Kingdom.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:36.550 align:middle line:10%
And in the New Testament it's
employed partly in regard

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.920 align:middle line:10%
to the kingdom as
now established

00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.220 align:middle line:10%
and partly in regard to
the future development,

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.020 align:middle line:10%
the age of glory.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.160 align:middle line:84%
It is used in this
later sense by our Lord.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And the ages of the
world are therefore

00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:55.000 align:middle line:84%
the great cycles of
time, they are great ages

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.020 align:middle line:84%
where the degeneracy and
corruption are the progression

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:01.480 align:middle line:84%
and development through
which it has always

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:05.560 align:middle line:84%
been destined to pass, and
in part has passed already."

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:09.159 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking
about in a New Age

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:12.550 align:middle line:84%
is the ages of time
which have come and gone.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.710 align:middle line:84%
Civilizations are
founded and grow,

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and then they die and
new civilizations come.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:23.889 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole idea of aion
is a continual progression

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:27.100 align:middle line:90%
of the ages of the world.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:32.010 align:middle line:10%
Here in John 9:32
it says sometimes

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:35.040 align:middle line:10%
the world, and
especially this world,

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:39.179 align:middle line:10%
seems to denote where
else in the New Testament

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:43.620 align:middle line:10%
is called the present
age, or world.

00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:46.480 align:middle line:84%
The "New Oxford Dictionary
with the Apocrypha,"

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.610 align:middle line:84%
it says at the top,
Jesus said, "I say to you

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:53.350 align:middle line:84%
that in the new
world--" so here Jesus

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.139 align:middle line:90%
is talking about the new world.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:57.390 align:middle line:90%
No, new age.

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.880 align:middle line:84%
"The Interpreters
Bible Dictionary,"

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:03.000 align:middle line:84%
it says consummation
is fittingly

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.190 align:middle line:90%
celebrated by a new song.

00:35:05.190 --> 00:35:09.240 align:middle line:84%
When the return from
exile heralds a new age.

00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.250 align:middle line:90%
Now we're getting it right.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:15.300 align:middle line:10%
So that it goes on to say,
the New Testament ideas

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.260 align:middle line:10%
are taken up and applied to
the Kingdom of God introduced

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.430 align:middle line:10%
by Christ, his hearers
recognized in his ministry

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:29.700 align:middle line:10%
a new teaching, a new age
which draws with his ministry,

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:36.930 align:middle line:10%
is a regeneration, or a
new world, but is new age.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:40.380 align:middle line:10%
Here in Matthew we see
the "Harper Study Bible

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:45.330 align:middle line:10%
Dictionary," it says where
Jesus said to his apostles,

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:10%
"Truly I say to you
in the new world."

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Again, a misunderstanding
of the word aion.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.500 align:middle line:90%
It's the new age.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.390 align:middle line:84%
"Expository Dictionary
of the Bible"

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:00.990 align:middle line:84%
says, the Greek words,
various Greek words

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:06.570 align:middle line:84%
are translated world
in the Bible, age, aion

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:11.470 align:middle line:84%
which means age and
translated world.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.890 align:middle line:84%
So here is a classic
example, just showing

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:17.600 align:middle line:84%
you very simply that the
translators of the Bible

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.820 align:middle line:90%
misunderstood the Greek word.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Now we will see that many
modern Bible translations are

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:28.620 align:middle line:84%
correct when they are
translating the word aion, not

00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:32.910 align:middle line:90%
as world but as an age.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Here we have, for instance,
Jesus said, I will be with you.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:39.130 align:middle line:84%
He's talking about
his apostles, and he

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:45.210 align:middle line:84%
said, I will be with you even to
the end of the age, not world,

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:47.400 align:middle line:90%
end of the age.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.650 align:middle line:10%
The Holy Bible, new
and old translations,

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:53.850 align:middle line:10%
we see marks clear
distinction between the reward

00:36:53.850 --> 00:37:00.060 align:middle line:10%
already in this age and the
reward in the age to come,

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.380 align:middle line:10%
showing those two ages, the
old age and the new age.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:08.460 align:middle line:84%
And it says in the Bible,
in the age to come.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:14.070 align:middle line:84%
The New Testament says,
and this is Ephesians 2,

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:16.590 align:middle line:90%
it says, in the ages to come.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:18.610 align:middle line:90%
This is a new translation.

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:19.980 align:middle line:90%
And now they're doing it right.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Now they're saying
that aion means age.

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Ephesians says, in
the ages to come.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:31.530 align:middle line:10%
We even have Jesus himself
promising that his kingdom will

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:34.930 align:middle line:10%
be coming in the new age.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:38.590 align:middle line:10%
Jesus replied, it
says in the scripture,

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:44.700 align:middle line:10%
Jesus replied, truly I tell
you in the world that is to be,

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.750 align:middle line:10%
again, the new concise
Bible translation says,

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.720 align:middle line:10%
Jesus said to them, I
give you my solemn word,

00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:54.960 align:middle line:10%
in the new age
which the Son of Man

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.020 align:middle line:10%
takes his seat upon
the seat of glory.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:02.250 align:middle line:10%
So here is Jesus saying, in
the new age which is to come.

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.680 align:middle line:84%
The American Bible
translation says,

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:10.660 align:middle line:84%
Jesus said, I give you my solemn
word in the new age to come.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.150 align:middle line:90%
So now we're getting it right.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:15.540 align:middle line:10%
Each time we see the
scripture talking about Jesus

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.150 align:middle line:10%
talking to his
apostles, he tells them

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.970 align:middle line:10%
he will be with them
to the end of the age.

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:23.850 align:middle line:10%
And he will see
them in the new age.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:26.490 align:middle line:84%
These ages we're
talking about are

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:31.740 align:middle line:84%
part of the zodialogical system
of what we call the zodiac.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Because the zodiac has
12 signs which represent

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.980 align:middle line:90%
12 different ages.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:40.290 align:middle line:90%
And so we are now in one age.

00:38:40.290 --> 00:38:42.180 align:middle line:84%
And now we're told
that we're getting

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.240 align:middle line:84%
ready to go into
a new age, which

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.300 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the Kingdom
of God in the future,

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:51.670 align:middle line:90%
into a new age of the zodiac.

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:55.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why the
word age is very important

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.290 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:38:56.290 --> 00:39:01.890 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the 2,150
year ages of the zodiac.

00:39:01.890 --> 00:39:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Each one of the signs of the
zodiac is 2,150 years long.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And each one is called
a zodialogical age.

00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.470 align:middle line:84%
And so now we're
leaving, we're getting

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:17.220 align:middle line:84%
ready to leave an
old age of Pisces.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting
ready to come in soon

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:23.430 align:middle line:90%
to the new age of Aquarius.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.980 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we're
talking about in the Bible

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.080 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about the
end of the world, notice,

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.490 align:middle line:84%
the end of the
old age of Pisces.

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:34.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why when you hear
Christians talking about

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:38.750 align:middle line:84%
that these are the last
days and the end times.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's the last days and
end times of the age of Pisces.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting ready to go
into the new age of Aquarius,

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.960 align:middle line:90%
the man with the water pitcher.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.660 align:middle line:90%
That's all we're talking about.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Today, Protestant Christianity
and Catholic Church, both,

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:04.160 align:middle line:84%
are everywhere talking
about the obvious New

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Age and the new world
to come as evil.

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And that this world
is coming to an end

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and is frightening
the whole world

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:13.640 align:middle line:84%
because nobody
seems to understand

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.010 align:middle line:90%
what the words really mean.

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's probably
true that the church purposely

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:25.610 align:middle line:84%
misled the people into
thinking that aion meant world

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:28.610 align:middle line:84%
so it would frighten kings
and rulers and princes

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:31.565 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of powerful people
in the earth to know that there

00:40:31.565 --> 00:40:33.230 align:middle line:90%
is coming an end of the world.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:37.130 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to save you
is if you submit yourself

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:39.920 align:middle line:84%
to the Holy Father
and to the Church.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.810 align:middle line:84%
I think this was
a political move

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:45.920 align:middle line:84%
to frighten the world into
submission to the Holy Father

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:49.250 align:middle line:90%
and to Christianity.

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:53.540 align:middle line:10%
What else has the church known
that they didn't tell us?

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:56.310 align:middle line:84%
What's the real
story in the Bible?

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:58.520 align:middle line:84%
So this is why
the church figures

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.600 align:middle line:84%
it's better like a
president during wartime,

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.670 align:middle line:90%
don't go into why we're at war.

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:06.020 align:middle line:90%
Just leave it alone.

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, let people
think whatever they want

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:09.590 align:middle line:90%
and just leave it alone.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Because all you're
going to do is

00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:14.150 align:middle line:84%
cause yourself a lot of
trouble if you start digging

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:17.950 align:middle line:84%
into the real facts
behind world events.

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:18.800 align:middle line:90%
So leave it alone.

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:90%
People believe this.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:22.170 align:middle line:90%
Let them believe it.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom line is that
there is no end of the world.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.800 align:middle line:84%
It's an end of the
aion, a Greek word which

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:37.910 align:middle line:84%
is translated correctly, an age,
one of the ages of the zodiac.

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.470 align:middle line:84%
