00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.970 align:middle line:84%
>> This is "Secret
Life of Symbols."

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:19.800 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, we're gonna
talk about corporations.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.030 align:middle line:84%
The United States of
America no longer exists.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.350 align:middle line:10%
And the reason why
it doesn't exist,

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:10%
we are now a corporation.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:90%
We're not a country.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is
because many years ago, there

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.760 align:middle line:84%
was something happened
here called the Civil War.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And the Civil War,
we're told, was

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.190 align:middle line:84%
one of the bloodiest wars humans
have ever fought on the earth.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.890 align:middle line:90%
It was a very bloody war.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And so after it was
over, it was understood

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.750 align:middle line:84%
that we are now, after
the war, many things,

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.620 align:middle line:84%
but "united" was
not one of them.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.440 align:middle line:10%
One half of the country
was killing the other half,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:10%
and there's a lot of bad
feeling among Americans,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.890 align:middle line:10%
back and forth, between
North and South.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.930 align:middle line:10%
Well, it was decided, all
right, now let's do this.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:10%
Let's have a United
States Corporation.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.120 align:middle line:10%
We'll start a company.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.770 align:middle line:10%
We'll call it the United
States Corporation.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.450 align:middle line:84%
It will be a privately
run municipal corporation.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And we'll call it the
United States Corporation.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So therefore,
everyone who is here

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:84%
will become a employee
of the corporation.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.830 align:middle line:10%
And if you're working
for this corporation,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.370 align:middle line:10%
when you're on duty,
you always usually

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.890 align:middle line:10%
have some sort of an
identification tag,

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:10%
showing that you're an
employee of the company.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.120 align:middle line:84%
As long as you are working
and you're making money,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.290 align:middle line:84%
then you are contributing to
the company, the corporation.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.820 align:middle line:84%
You're on the company
time, so to speak.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And so you are making
money, and therefore you're

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:84%
paying out bills, and paying
out taxes and fines and fees

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:90%
and all that.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.395 align:middle line:84%
And so you are securing
the corporation.

00:02:19.395 --> 00:02:21.770 align:middle line:84%
They need the money, and so
you're giving them the money.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.930 align:middle line:84%
You're making money,
giving it to them.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.190 align:middle line:90%
So you are a security.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Water is the basis for
our economics, period,

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:90%
on the earth.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.805 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
ancient world, this

00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:41.810 align:middle line:84%
is going as far back as the
earliest times in the Roman

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Empire, the powers that
be in the world then

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
realized that they started to
build their economic system

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:84%
in the Roman Empire based
on the Phoenician Canaanite

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.840 align:middle line:84%
system of commerce
in the Middle East,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:84%
because they knew
how to make money.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.010 align:middle line:90%
They knew how to control money.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.970 align:middle line:84%
So the ancient Romans understood
and finally figured out

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.520 align:middle line:84%
that there should be
two laws on the earth.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.500 align:middle line:90%
The earth is two things.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.410 align:middle line:90%
The earth is water and land.

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So there should be a law for the
water and a law for the land.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.090 align:middle line:84%
So today, we even have
terms that say, well,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:90%
that's the law of the land.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:84%
Why do you distinguish
it, law of the land?

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.510 align:middle line:84%
Because there's another law
called the law of the sea

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:90%
or the law of water.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.570 align:middle line:84%
So the law of the
land is the laws

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that govern the
culture of people

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.970 align:middle line:90%
on a particular spot of land.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And so when you go
to another country,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.220 align:middle line:84%
you should be aware that
there's a law of the land, which

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.420 align:middle line:90%
means there's a custom.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
You have to get used
to the way people live

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:90%
and the way they do things.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.620 align:middle line:90%


00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.720 align:middle line:84%
There's another law that
supersedes that law, which

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:90%
is far more important.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.700 align:middle line:90%
It's called the law of the sea.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And the law of the sea
is the law of water.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And the law of water is
simply banking, banks.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Banks are all over the world.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:90%
All banks operate the same.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.290 align:middle line:90%
They operate on water.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the bottom line
is, is that your commerce

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:16.560 align:middle line:90%
is based on water.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.190 align:middle line:84%
All ships, airships, rocket
ships, sailing ships,

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't care what it is.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.680 align:middle line:84%
If it's a ship, it's always
referred to as a female.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.200 align:middle line:90%
It's always "she."

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.420 align:middle line:84%
The captains of any ship
will tell you, "Oh, she's

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.836 align:middle line:84%
a good ship, and
she's seaworthy."

00:04:36.836 --> 00:04:38.600 align:middle line:84%
And oh, she's this
and she's that.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.550 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean "she"?

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.730 align:middle line:84%
The reason why captains
call their ships "she"

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.260 align:middle line:84%
is because "she"
delivers the product.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
And the product is
usually based on water.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And when her water
breaks, there's a product.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And the product was
caused by the male--

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.970 align:middle line:90%
man-ufacturing.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.920 align:middle line:84%
So He has manufactured,
and she is in labor,

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.420 align:middle line:90%
building the product.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And so the product
is based on water,

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:84%
because when her water
broke, the product comes out.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.210 align:middle line:84%
If you're gonna get married,
you have to have a license,

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
because getting married,
according to our laws today

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:84%
under the corporation,
if you are

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.640 align:middle line:84%
getting married you are an
employee whose first duty is

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:90%
to the corporation.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, you need
to work and pay your bills

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
and pay your taxes
and everything,

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:84%
because you're a security
for the body social.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
The body social, it
means the whole company.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.852 align:middle line:84%
When you retire, which
means you're going to bed,

00:05:43.852 --> 00:05:45.810 align:middle line:84%
you're going to sleep,
or you're going to quit,

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.170 align:middle line:84%
you're going to retire,
you get social security.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:84%
You are the security
for the body social.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they're going to give
you a few dollars to live on,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.680 align:middle line:90%
keep you alive.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if they don't, you're
going to get all very upset

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
you don't have any
money to live on,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.490 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to
cause more trouble.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.031 align:middle line:84%
Give him something to live on,
and get him outta here, right?

00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:10.700 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:84%
When a ship pulls
into port, because I

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
said all of our commerce
is done by water,

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.460 align:middle line:84%
our biggest business
is shipping.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:90%
All over the world, shipping.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.980 align:middle line:84%
When a ship pulls
into harbor and parks

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
at what we call its
berth, it's a berth, where

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.840 align:middle line:90%
they're berthing the ship.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
B-E-R-T-H. And so any item that
was on that ship represents

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.930 align:middle line:90%
money.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, every
time a television

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.450 align:middle line:84%
or a car or anything,
whatever that item is

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:45.880 align:middle line:84%
that's being brought here
from another country,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.790 align:middle line:84%
it's coming in on a ship, and
she is bringing in the product,

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.590 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:52.610 align:middle line:90%
She.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.790 align:middle line:84%
When the ship parks, it's
sitting in its berth.

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And therefore every single
item coming off of that ship

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
has to have its own
certificate of manifest.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.410 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Because yesterday,
the ship wasn't here.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.580 align:middle line:84%
But this morning,
you come to work

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:11.270 align:middle line:84%
and there's a ship here with
$800 million worth of Toyotas.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:12.570 align:middle line:90%
So it's manifested.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.420 align:middle line:90%
So you have to have a manifest.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's called a
"certificate of manifest,"

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:19.700 align:middle line:84%
which goes with each
one of those products.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:10%
And on that manifest, it
tells you, is it a four door?

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.460 align:middle line:10%
Is it two doors?

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:10%
Does it have air conditioning?

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.080 align:middle line:90%
What nationality is it?

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.700 align:middle line:90%
How much did the baby weigh?

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:90%
What color eyes does he have?

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.870 align:middle line:90%
And does he have five fingers?

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.970 align:middle line:90%
And is he African or what?

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.750 align:middle line:90%
Does he have air conditioning?

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.710 align:middle line:84%
So you are simply a
product, because you

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
are a product that has to have
its own certificate of birth.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:84%
So therefore you
have today something

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:90%
called a birth certificate.

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And it has to be
signed by the doc.

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where that
ship is setting, at the dock.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you happen by chance
to have one of the cars

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:84%
or one of the TVs drop off
in the ocean, that's OK.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.260 align:middle line:84%
There are insurances
that cover that.

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:84%
But you have to have
a death certificate.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:84%
Because you're not just going
to lose a car, and the bank

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:84%
is not going to
make money on that.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:13.780 align:middle line:90%
You lost a car?

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, you
better go find it.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't
find it, then you

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
need to go through
the regulations

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:90%
and sign a death certificate.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why,
as I said, that's

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.570 align:middle line:90%
why you have to have a license.

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:29.940 align:middle line:90%
Because this is a corporation.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:33.929 align:middle line:84%
And you still, you know,
when we were a republic,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:84%
you could wear a gun
anytime you wanted.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.370 align:middle line:84%
And you could go into
town, and go into the bar.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And if you have a falling
out with a guy in the bar,

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.100 align:middle line:84%
you can either settle
it like gentlemen,

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:46.340 align:middle line:84%
or you can go out in
the street and duel.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And one of you is not
going home tonight, see.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.880 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a free country,
and individuals, men and women

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.680 align:middle line:84%
and children, when this country
was founded, was said to be,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and it was understood,
that you are

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.560 align:middle line:90%
a sovereign in this country.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why you could wear
a gun anytime you wanted.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:90%
Cowboys wear guns.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And then people, even
in the eastern states,

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:11.830 align:middle line:90%
would wear guns.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.410 align:middle line:90%
Because you are as sovereign.

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.370 align:middle line:10%
Under international
law, anyone born

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:10%
in the United States
of America was

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:10%
a sovereign, which means
you are a king or a queen.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And so the man was king of
his realm, king of his home.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:90%
And women were the queens.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.110 align:middle line:84%
A king and a queen to have
the privilege of declaring war

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:36.180 align:middle line:84%
on anytime they please on
anyone one they please.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:38.850 align:middle line:84%
That's one of the nice
things about being a king.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.710 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to ask
anybody permission.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.126 align:middle line:84%
You wanna go out
and pick a fight?

00:09:42.126 --> 00:09:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, you better
have a gun with you.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.840 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
you're going to win.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.890 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean you're
smart for doing that.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:52.420 align:middle line:84%
It just means you're armed, and
you're gonna face another guy,

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:90%
and he's armed.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:84%
So you better figure out if
you can do this or not, right?

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.840 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:04.090 align:middle line:84%
Now we understand that your
body is like 78% water.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And when you come out of
your mother, her water broke.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, everything we do
in commerce is based on water.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And that being the case,
it's based on shipping.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
The idea is, don't rock the
boat when you're at work.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.320 align:middle line:90%
Don't rock the boat.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.800 align:middle line:90%
We run a tight ship here.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.650 align:middle line:90%
We don't wanna rock the boat.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:90%
And so are you with us, mate?

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, come aboard
on the citizen-ship.

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And so now you've got the
dealership, and sportsmanship,

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.090 align:middle line:84%
and citizenship, and all of
the different kind of words

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:40.020 align:middle line:90%
that end in "ship."

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Why do you have banks?

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:90%
Where do you find banks?

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:84%
Banks are on both
sides of a river.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.490 align:middle line:90%
They're called river banks.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.470 align:middle line:90%
What does a river bank do?

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.660 align:middle line:84%
It directs the flow
of the current-sea.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.060 align:middle line:84%
Money runs through
your hands like water.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:90%
No, money is water.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.820 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you put it into
a bank it's called current-sea.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:03.870 align:middle line:90%
Because it's a current.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.160 align:middle line:90%
It's an ebb and flow.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.660 align:middle line:90%
It comes in and goes out.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.370 align:middle line:90%
It comes in and goes out.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a flow of money.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.540 align:middle line:90%
And money is water.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:15.605 align:middle line:84%
Money is a cash
flow, a liquid asset.

00:11:15.605 --> 00:11:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.810 align:middle line:84%
There's a reason why everything
works the way it does.

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:84%
In a corporation, let's say
you work for General Electric

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:90%
or Ford Motor Company.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:33.100 align:middle line:84%
General Electric cannot make
a law like stamped in stone.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:84%
Whatever General
Electric does, they

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:39.100 align:middle line:84%
don't have the
power to create law.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.830 align:middle line:10%
But they do have the
power, as a corporation,

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.050 align:middle line:10%
to make their policy.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.750 align:middle line:84%
And so they will tell you,
look it, it's just our policy.

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.710 align:middle line:90%
There's no damn law.

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:51.320 align:middle line:84%
There's no law that
says it, but our policy

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.690 align:middle line:84%
is for you to show up
at 7:00 in the morning.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.400 align:middle line:90%
That's just our policy.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:84%
And our policy says that you
take off at 11:30 for lunch.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.380 align:middle line:90%
And you go home at 4:00.

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.550 align:middle line:90%
That's just our policy.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:04.790 align:middle line:84%
It's not written in
stone And God's law.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.550 align:middle line:90%
It's just our policy.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:11.690 align:middle line:84%
So today, you ask any
politician "what kind of law

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:14.100 align:middle line:84%
do we have in this
country today,"

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and they would tell you
it's called public policy.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a policy.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not law.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Who came up with that policy?

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Well, we have policymakers.

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.780 align:middle line:10%
Policymakers?

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:28.020 align:middle line:10%
Oh, OK.

00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.344 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, they're lawmakers.

00:12:29.344 --> 00:12:30.260 align:middle line:90%
They're the lawmakers.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.730 align:middle line:90%
They make the policy.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.500 align:middle line:90%
They don't make law.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.280 align:middle line:90%
They make a policy.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's just our policy that
you do this and you do that.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.260 align:middle line:84%
You go 65 on the
highway, and you do this.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.710 align:middle line:90%
You park there.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And these are all
just our policy.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And the police will see
to it you abide by it.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
the police come in.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Because back in the
John Wayne days,

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.240 align:middle line:84%
in the cowboy and Indians,
there wasn't a police.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.040 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.820 align:middle line:90%
Because you have a Constitution.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
You are a free man, and you can
do whatever you please to do.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.940 align:middle line:90%
But you take care of yourself.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.730 align:middle line:90%
There's no government checks.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.360 align:middle line:90%
There's no government anything.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.270 align:middle line:90%
You just take care of yourself.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to buy
a gun, buy 10 of 'em.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.200 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.040 align:middle line:90%
Nobody cares.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.220 align:middle line:90%
You're free as an American.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.530 align:middle line:84%
But today, you're no
longer an American.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.370 align:middle line:90%
You are a US citizen.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:25.550 align:middle line:84%
US is a privately owned
company of corporations

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.340 align:middle line:90%
called a municipal corporation.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.270 align:middle line:90%
It's a company.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, according to corporate
law, you have to have--

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:84%
and this is in all
corporate law--

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:84%
you've got to have a
president of the corporation.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.900 align:middle line:90%
That's just corporate law.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.450 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have a vice
president of the corporation,

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.850 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to have
a secretary treasurer.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Because those three
guys are the main ones

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle line:90%
that handle the money.

00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:84%
And since we are
giving you permission,

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm giving you
permission, because I'm

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:57.330 align:middle line:84%
playing the part of God, I
am the corporation, 1870.

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.130 align:middle line:84%
But if I'm going to
give you the privilege,

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.530 align:middle line:84%
then you can be a
corporation too.

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:03.450 align:middle line:90%
But I gave you permission.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.250 align:middle line:84%
So I want 20% off the
top, you understand?

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.050 align:middle line:90%
It's just business.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:14.760 align:middle line:10%
When we're talking about
the Federal Reserve,

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.470 align:middle line:10%
first thing you
need to understand

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:18.600 align:middle line:10%
is where is the
Federal Reserve's

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.760 align:middle line:10%
corporate headquarters?

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Because it's going to tell you
something when you find out.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Corporate headquarters
for the Internal Revenue

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and the Federal Reserve
is in Puerto Rico, not

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.390 align:middle line:90%
the United States Corporation.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.190 align:middle line:90%
And why is it in Puerto Rico?

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Because Puerto Rico was
picked a long time ago,

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:90%
over 1,000 years ago.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:50.010 align:middle line:84%
It was picked by the
pirates of the Caribbean.

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:54.420 align:middle line:84%
That's why today Puerto Rico
houses the Federal Reserve

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:90%
and the Internal Revenue.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:01.190 align:middle line:84%
It's because the
Federal Reserve is today

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:90%
the pirates of the Caribbean.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.100 align:middle line:84%
When you begin to
see that this is

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:11.750 align:middle line:84%
the whole setup and the Federal
Reserve and the Internal

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.340 align:middle line:90%
Revenue, it's just piracy.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.380 align:middle line:84%
It's just the pirates
of the Caribbean.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:90%
And that's where they started.

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:84%
So what was the symbol for
the pirates of the Caribbean?

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, their flag
was a black flag

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:90%
with a skull and crossbones.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And it was referred
to as the Jolly Roger.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, today the
skull and crossbones

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:36.620 align:middle line:84%
are a very important symbol
used in world Freemasonry.

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:41.810 align:middle line:84%
It's used on toxic and
poisonous medicines and things.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:84%
Skull and crossbones
basically meant death.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what piracy
in the Caribbean was like.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.780 align:middle line:84%
It was a very dangerous
and deadly game,

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:54.470 align:middle line:84%
where they were stealing
on the high seas.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:57.200 align:middle line:10%
And so when you're stealing
something on the high seas,

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.470 align:middle line:10%
then you have to deal with
an admiral, Which gives us

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:03.050 align:middle line:10%
our word "admiralty law."

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:07.480 align:middle line:84%
Admiralty law is the
law of the high seas.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
England, in order
to travel the world

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and do what they did to
build their great empire,

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:16.610 align:middle line:90%
were great seafaring peoples.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.260 align:middle line:10%
Their navies were next to none.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And so this is where the idea
that, even in England today,

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.330 align:middle line:84%
they have such a
thing as an admiralty.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And so it gives birth
to an admiralty law,

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:33.120 align:middle line:84%
which means giving birth
to a law based on water.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Because England were the masters
of the seas after the Spanish.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.920 align:middle line:84%
And so today it's
just interesting

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:84%
that the Federal Reserve
and the Internal Revenue

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:52.660 align:middle line:84%
are corporate headquarters
in the Caribbean.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Still today, ships will
carry their own flags

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:84%
so that anyone else
on the sea will

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.120 align:middle line:84%
see that ship with that flag
and understand who owns it,

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.130 align:middle line:90%
and who's controlling that ship.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, there developed an idea a
long time ago among the pirates

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.020 align:middle line:90%
to fool their victims.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
And they would put up a flag
of a country that was friendly

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.050 align:middle line:84%
with, I guess, the
other ships coming.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.650 align:middle line:84%
And so the other ships would
not think anything about it

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:84%
until they got close
enough to attack them.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Then they would send
up their Jolly Roger,

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.870 align:middle line:84%
the flag that
represents the pirates.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And then the people on the other
ship know they're so close now,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:35.420 align:middle line:84%
they thought it was
a friendly ship.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Now they find out it
was a pirate ship.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where we get the
concept today of a false flag.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And my goodness, there are false
flags everywhere in the world

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:90%
that we live today.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:52.580 align:middle line:84%
So many people think that
if you trust them, country,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.370 align:middle line:84%
or trust somebody to
do something for you,

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:56.600 align:middle line:90%
and he's got a friend.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And then one day you find
out they're not your friend.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:90%
They've never been your friend.

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Then we see the idea
of a false flag.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.870 align:middle line:84%
They were putting
up the false colors.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:09.490 align:middle line:84%
We even say that
kind of thing today.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I didn't-- I was
with so-and-so last night,

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:14.180 align:middle line:90%
and he showed his true colors.

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:90%
True colors?

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.920 align:middle line:10%
What do you mean, a false flag?

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.280 align:middle line:90%
Because he's always been nice.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.230 align:middle line:84%
He's always been courteous,
and last night he was horrible.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So now he's showing
his true colors.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So that tells me he's been
putting up a false flag

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:28.970 align:middle line:90%
all this time.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Now we know who he really
is, or how he really thinks.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.420 align:middle line:84%
I would say first of
all, it's not federal,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:90%
and it's not a reserve.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:38.750 align:middle line:90%
Because it isn't.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:40.130 align:middle line:90%
It has no reserves.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.250 align:middle line:90%
They just print money.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
really print money.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:47.510 align:middle line:84%
They print what they call
a Federal Reserve note.

00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And it says on the
Federal Reserve note,

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.650 align:middle line:84%
it says "This note is
legal tender for privates,

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.270 align:middle line:90%
public and private."

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.420 align:middle line:10%
And then it used to
also say that you

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:04.890 align:middle line:10%
could take this to the bank
and turn it in for real money.

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:07.355 align:middle line:84%
That's what it
said on the bills.

00:19:07.355 --> 00:19:10.280 align:middle line:90%


00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.520 align:middle line:84%
50 to 100 years ago, it
would say on the bill,

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:17.342 align:middle line:84%
you can take this to the bank
and turn it in for real money.

00:19:17.342 --> 00:19:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So right off the bat,
they're telling you

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:20.390 align:middle line:90%
that this is not money.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:90%
It represents money.

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.290 align:middle line:90%
But it's not money.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't have to
go around with gold coins

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:27.890 align:middle line:90%
buying everything.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:31.490 align:middle line:84%
Just take the dollar bills
that represents the gold coin.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.550 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is, the government

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
in the founding of this
country, the Constitution

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.570 align:middle line:84%
doesn't say that it's
all right to have

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:40.190 align:middle line:90%
paper that represents money.

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:41.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.490 align:middle line:84%
Money is gold and
silver, period.

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:45.620 align:middle line:90%
End of the day, that's it.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.630 align:middle line:84%
It's either silver or
gold, or it's not money.

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:52.470 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're gonna print
paper and incidentally,

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:57.847 align:middle line:84%
in California, the 1848
California Constitution,

00:19:57.847 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:90%
there's two of them.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.400 align:middle line:84%
1848 and I think
the other was 1869.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:06.210 align:middle line:84%
But the 1848 original
Constitution of California

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.960 align:middle line:84%
expressly says,
"no banking can be

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
done within the
state of California."

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:84%
California will not
allow any banks to exist

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:17.970 align:middle line:90%
in the state of California.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.400 align:middle line:84%
You can have private
corporations who

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:27.960 align:middle line:84%
will deal within
themselves, but no bank

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
can operate within the
state of California.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Then later on, they
had a civil war.

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And after the Civil War, well,
things changed a little bit.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.110 align:middle line:84%
So now you can have
a bank in California.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:45.230 align:middle line:10%
So of many of our wars
are actually economic.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:50.250 align:middle line:84%
The Federal Reserve, I think it
was established back in 1913.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:55.110 align:middle line:10%
The way it was established was
that the bankers in America,

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.200 align:middle line:10%
who were not actually American.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:59.730 align:middle line:84%
They were living in America,
but they were actually

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:05.400 align:middle line:84%
British-backed bankers, JP
Morgan, bankers like that,

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:84%
who actually came from
Europe and from England.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:13.030 align:middle line:84%
They got together and they
decided to put together a trick

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.910 align:middle line:90%
and to see if it would work.

00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And so they got together
on a private island

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:90%
off of the coast of Georgia.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not an
authority on this,

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
but it's well known that these
men met on this island called

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.160 align:middle line:90%
Jekyll Island.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.600 align:middle line:84%
Why would it be called Jekyll,
like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde?

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:36.090 align:middle line:84%
It's because these
bankers were not

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:84%
interested in
protecting America.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.940 align:middle line:84%
They were interested in
buying off everything

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.910 align:middle line:84%
in America for their
British masters.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they came up
with an idea that we

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:53.580 align:middle line:84%
will produce paper money,
which represents money.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:84%
And if we can get that
across through the Congress

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and the Senate
agrees to that, then

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.650 align:middle line:84%
we will also add
a little something

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:02.860 align:middle line:90%
we forgot to tell you.

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:90%
It is called fractional banking.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:08.790 align:middle line:10%
Fractional banking
means every dollar

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:15.690 align:middle line:10%
we publish, that we give
to you, that dollar,

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:20.760 align:middle line:10%
you can multiply it
by 10, by 9 or 10.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.800 align:middle line:10%
So when somebody puts $1
into the bank on deposit,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.790 align:middle line:10%
the bank can then say
that that deposit was $10.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you put it in 100, the
bank can say on their records

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.260 align:middle line:90%
that you put 1,000 in.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:38.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you put $1
million in, the bank

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.190 align:middle line:84%
now says that you
put $10 million in.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's how America
has become so powerful

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:51.300 align:middle line:84%
around the world, because
no matter how much money we

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.390 align:middle line:84%
actually-- no matter how
many Federal Reserve notes we

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:58.170 align:middle line:84%
how, there may be
millions in the bank,

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:01.440 align:middle line:90%
but you can multiply it by 10.

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, my
goodness, then you

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:07.200 align:middle line:90%
can multiply that later by 10.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.570 align:middle line:10%
And now you've
got a country that

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.480 align:middle line:10%
has a massive amount of money.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.890 align:middle line:10%
If you put, say $10
in the bank, the bank

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:21.720 align:middle line:10%
is allowed to loan out
to other people 100.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.700 align:middle line:10%
Because if you multiply anything
that comes into the bank,

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.500 align:middle line:10%
they can multiply it by 10.

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:10%
It's called
"fractional banking."

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:30.640 align:middle line:90%


00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:33.330 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty well
known that there

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:37.990 align:middle line:84%
is an organization in the world
today called the Roundtable

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Group.

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of this
Roundtable Group

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:45.400 align:middle line:84%
is a roundtable of the big
bankers, the big shots that

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.800 align:middle line:90%
run the British Empire.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.770 align:middle line:84%
And they come together together,
and they sit at a round table.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:56.380 align:middle line:84%
The why, why they are required
to sit at a round table?

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.340 align:middle line:84%
Because the idea is, not one
of them is the boss of bosses.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a group, and they're
all equal around the table.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.190 align:middle line:90%
But they are all bankers.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And they are all working
for the same cause.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And so ultimately, people
don't realize that all

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.240 align:middle line:84%
around the world,
especially in America,

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:20.130 align:middle line:84%
you're buying things
and purchasing things.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And so in 1902, these
bankers, these London bankers,

00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:28.050 align:middle line:90%
they met in 1902.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.360 align:middle line:10%
And the idea was
that they were going

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:34.950 align:middle line:10%
to, slowly but surely,
infiltrate into the United

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:40.110 align:middle line:10%
States's business and
ultimately get the United

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:44.310 align:middle line:10%
States of America into debt,
and so that they will ultimately

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:48.165 align:middle line:10%
be able to own the United
States of America for England.

00:24:48.165 --> 00:24:50.990 align:middle line:10%


00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:55.330 align:middle line:10%
We have our documented evidence
that the Federal Reserve

00:24:55.330 --> 00:25:00.070 align:middle line:10%
is a part of that plan to
actually take over America,

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:04.360 align:middle line:10%
and do it in such a way
as to get America involved

00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.290 align:middle line:10%
in business, so that
eventually the British banking

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:11.710 align:middle line:10%
cartels around the
world will ultimately

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.880 align:middle line:10%
own the corporation
called the United States.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.660 align:middle line:10%
And so that's what
happened today.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:23.740 align:middle line:10%
We are now under the authority
of the British government,

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.260 align:middle line:10%
in point of fact.

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:28.870 align:middle line:10%
Under this system of
the Federal Reserve,

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:10%
we've had-- it was supposed
to be, what we were told

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:10%
is that the Federal Reserve was
being put together to protect

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.110 align:middle line:10%
the fluctuation in business.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, we make money.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.630 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes, we're broke.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:44.590 align:middle line:10%
But to make sure that we always
have a nice even flow of money,

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:47.330 align:middle line:10%
we need someone to control that.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And so once they
bought into that idea

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:84%
and accepted the
Federal Reserve,

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.350 align:middle line:84%
now you've had two
world wars, and God

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:58.720 align:middle line:84%
knows how many wars
are going on each day

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.690 align:middle line:84%
that the Federal
Reserve is financing?

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.390 align:middle line:84%
The military is
around the world.

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:06.520 align:middle line:10%
And the more you
finance the military,

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.070 align:middle line:10%
the bigger the wars get, and
now they're all over the world.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we see that, as any
normal big fight, any prize

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.490 align:middle line:84%
fight, you've got to
have a fight promoter.

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And this person who's
the fight promoter

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:23.290 align:middle line:84%
is going to put up the
money for the fight,

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and finance the event, and pay
all the bills for everybody.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.480 align:middle line:90%
But he is the fight promoter.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.150 align:middle line:84%
He's spending
millions of dollars.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:35.920 align:middle line:84%
But he is spending
millions because he's

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.520 align:middle line:84%
going to make multiple
millions on the fight.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So we have today the Federal
Reserve, and the Internal

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Revenue, and the
secret government

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.380 align:middle line:90%
that's operating out of London.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, they
are the fight promoters.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.290 align:middle line:84%
They're causing the wars
all around the world.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:57.010 align:middle line:84%
And the United States'
citizens and people

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:84%
are getting involved
in these wars,

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:03.220 align:middle line:84%
never realizing these
wars are being financed

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:04.950 align:middle line:90%
to have a fight, period.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.580 align:middle line:90%
They're called fight promoters.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:12.140 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jordan Maxwell, and
thank you for watching.
