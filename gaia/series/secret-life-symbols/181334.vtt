00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.080 align:middle line:84%
NARRATOR: This is
"Secret Life of Symbols."

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.340 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.090 align:middle line:10%
>> First of all, what we
are talking about when I say

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.950 align:middle line:10%
the dawn of a new day--

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:10%
it's a catch phrase that means
something too powerful people

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.940 align:middle line:10%
in the world that
we're not supposed

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.430 align:middle line:10%
to know anything about.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Like George Carlin said, it's
a big club and you ain't in it.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you were in
the big club you

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.030 align:middle line:84%
would already know what
that catch phrase, "dawn

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:90%
of a new day," really means.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.870 align:middle line:84%
So in order to explain
this the best way I can,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:84%
we need to go back to the
California legislature,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:90%
back in 1953.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.790 align:middle line:84%
It's called the
"Eleventh Report--

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:84%
Senate Investigating
Committee on Education,"

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.410 align:middle line:84%
published by the Senate of
the State of California.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And in it, the lead article
talks about the fact that since

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.220 align:middle line:84%
many intelligent people seem
to be unaware of the secrecy

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:84%
of governments and secrecy of
things going on that we're not

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.900 align:middle line:84%
being told, and so the State
of California Investigating

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.000 align:middle line:90%
Committee-- back in 1953--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.410 align:middle line:84%
said, we would like to make
a few things clear to you,

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.190 align:middle line:84%
that communism is
rampant around the world.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.590 align:middle line:84%
And so as the
California State Senate

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:84%
is saying, that we
would like for you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.440 align:middle line:84%
to understand that communism
is not synonymous with Russia.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Communism is all over the world.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.985 align:middle line:84%
Russia just happened
to be the first victim.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
It goes on to say that
communism is actually

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:84%
a self-perpetuating
group of people

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.500 align:middle line:84%
who want to control
power all over the world

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
and are using communism
to exploit the people.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.729 align:middle line:84%
It goes on to say
that so-called--

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.949 align:middle line:84%
this is in the California
Senator Report.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to read this,
because it's very important.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:10%
It says, "so-called modern
communism is apparently

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.690 align:middle line:10%
the same hypocritical and deadly
world conspiracy to destroy

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.610 align:middle line:10%
civilization that was
founded on the secret order

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:10%
of the Illuminati
in Bavaria in 1776,

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:10%
and that raised its hoary
head in our colonies here

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:10%
at the time of the Revolution."

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.940 align:middle line:84%
See "World Revolution"
by Nesta Webster--

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.940 align:middle line:90%
it's a book on that subject.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:10%
It says, the world
revolution conspiracy

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.270 align:middle line:10%
appears to have been
so well organized

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:10%
as to be ever continuing
and ever on the alert

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.860 align:middle line:10%
to take advantage of every
opportunity presenting itself

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:10%
or that the conspirators
could create.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.730 align:middle line:10%
It is significant
in this connection--

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.380 align:middle line:10%
that as early as 1783,
when unsettled conditions

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.190 align:middle line:10%
and dissatisfaction
in some quarters,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.210 align:middle line:10%
subversive anonymous
sermons were

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:10%
circulated among
the colonial army

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.170 align:middle line:10%
to incite dissatisfaction
and rebellion.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
George Washington immediately
called the army together.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.700 align:middle line:10%
And in addressing
them he said, my

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.540 align:middle line:10%
God, what can this
writer have in view

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.730 align:middle line:10%
by recommending such measures?

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.250 align:middle line:90%
Can he be a friend to the army?

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.040 align:middle line:84%
Can he be a friend
to our country?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.910 align:middle line:10%
Rather, is he not
an insidious foe,

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.480 align:middle line:10%
some emissary perhaps
from New York,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.820 align:middle line:10%
plotting the ruin of both
by sowing seeds of discord

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:10%
and separation between the
civil and military powers

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.450 align:middle line:10%
of the national and
of this continent?

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And what a compliment does
he pay to our understanding

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
when he recommends
such measures?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.899 align:middle line:84%
And either alternative is
impractical in their nature.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.580 align:middle line:84%
And this was taken
from Marshall's "Life

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:90%
of Washington."

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.300 align:middle line:84%
He goes on to say, it is plain
that George Washington believed

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.840 align:middle line:84%
that the center of the
secret conspiracy to be,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.290 align:middle line:84%
so far as this
country was concerned,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
to be located in New York City,
and felt it to be his duty

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.210 align:middle line:90%
to make such a charge.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And it goes on to talk about the
recognition of May 1st, 1776,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:84%
as the founding date of the
world revolution conspiracy

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.120 align:middle line:84%
is not difficult
to understand when

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.470 align:middle line:84%
it is realized that May Day
is still today frequently

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.680 align:middle line:84%
celebrated, even in the
recent times, by rioting

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.320 align:middle line:84%
and bloodshed on
a worldwide scale.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a very interesting story
about the beginnings of world

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.400 align:middle line:84%
communism, and how
it was financed

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and who actually put this
world movement together.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:10%
In the book "Conspiracy
Against God and Man,"

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:10%
says much of what the historians
had to say is enlightening.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.850 align:middle line:10%
He cited, for example, the
explicit testimony of one

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:10%
who was himself in close touch
with the inner circle that

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:10%
founded communism and may be
presumed to possess accurate

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:10%
knowledge of its activities.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.580 align:middle line:10%
And he was quoting this
doctor, who in April of 1914,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:10%
in an issue of a French
occult magazine called

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.770 align:middle line:10%
"Mysteria," under the
pseudonym of Papus, wrote--

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.830 align:middle line:10%
and this is what this
individual doctor

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.440 align:middle line:10%
who was a member of
the Illuminati said.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.150 align:middle line:10%
Side by side with international
politics of each state

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:10%
there exist certain
obscure organizations

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:10%
of international politics.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.620 align:middle line:10%
These men that take
part in these councils

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:10%
are not the professional
politicians or the brilliantly

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.650 align:middle line:10%
dressed ambassadors, but certain
unpretentious, unknown men,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:10%
high financiers who are superior
to those ephemeral politicians

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.270 align:middle line:10%
who imagine that they
govern the world.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.200 align:middle line:84%
So this person who was a
member of the Illuminati

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:84%
was basically saying
that people who

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.400 align:middle line:84%
think they run the
world, the politicians,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:84%
do not make the
decisions, period.

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.190 align:middle line:10%
"Secret Societies and
Subversive Movements"

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:51.320 align:middle line:10%
is a book that came
out many years ago,

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.940 align:middle line:10%
by Nesta Webster, in which
she really explains and goes

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.160 align:middle line:10%
into the background
of the Illuminati

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.480 align:middle line:10%
and the general secret societies
and fraternal orders that

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:10%
are operating around the
world to overthrow governments

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.450 align:middle line:10%
and to overthrow, especially,
America because America has

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.710 align:middle line:10%
been a leader around
the world in introducing

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.560 align:middle line:10%
the concepts of freedom
and liberty and justice.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And so these secret
societies are not

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.700 align:middle line:84%
interested in the people
being educated or being free.

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So there is a world of
conspiratorial apparatus

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.430 align:middle line:84%
operating around the world to
overthrow the United States

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
and overthrow the whole
idea of freedom and liberty

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.010 align:middle line:90%
and justice.

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.020 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
That brings us to the
symbolism of the Illuminati--

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:84%
the rising sun, because the sun
is very dynamic in its rising

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:52.190 align:middle line:84%
in the morning for
all of mankind.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.190 align:middle line:90%
It brings light into the world.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.390 align:middle line:90%
It brings life into the world.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about the sun
itself as a powerful symbol.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.210 align:middle line:84%
We see that the sun
lights the whole world.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is why
the secret societies

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.762 align:middle line:84%
are very big on promoting
what they call light.

00:08:10.762 --> 00:08:11.970 align:middle line:90%
You know, they are brilliant.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.200 align:middle line:90%
They're intellectually superior.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And so they have the right to
run the whole world for us.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.040 align:middle line:84%
They're called the Illuminati,
because they're illuminated

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.430 align:middle line:90%
symbolically by the sun.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have the sun as a
symbol for illumination.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And now, far back
in mankind's history

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:90%
we can see ancient sun worship.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.960 align:middle line:10%
The ancient military
used to wear sun helmets.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:90%
Romans wore sun helmets.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And even today, we have
cultures around the world

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.670 align:middle line:84%
that are celebrating with
headdresses, sun headdresses.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of man being
dominated by the sun

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:53.050 align:middle line:90%
is nothing new.

00:08:53.050 --> 00:08:54.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of the oldest
symbols of the sun

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:90%
was and still is an eagle.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Eagles have always
represented the sun.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And the eagle, incidentally,
has two wings--

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.790 align:middle line:90%
left wing and right wing.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.220 align:middle line:84%
This is why in America you
have something called left wing

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.000 align:middle line:84%
politics and right wing,
because of the American eagle,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.850 align:middle line:90%
represents the sun order.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.660 align:middle line:84%
All cultures have always
recognized the eagle

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.530 align:middle line:84%
as the best sun symbol
because it flies very high.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.820 align:middle line:90%
And it watches everything.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Its eyes are very sharp
to see everything.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And it dominates the skies.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.880 align:middle line:90%
That's all there is to it.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.760 align:middle line:10%
And so the sun does
dominate the sky.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.650 align:middle line:10%
And so the ancient Romans
and the ancient Greeks

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:46.030 align:middle line:10%
used the sun symbol and the
eagle to represent the sun.

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:47.680 align:middle line:90%
You'll see it in Rome.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.480 align:middle line:90%
You'll see it in Greece.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.730 align:middle line:10%
You'll see it on coins.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:54.760 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see this
coin is in Italy.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.970 align:middle line:10%
Here's the Roman signature.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And incidentally, the
Romans signature, SPQR,

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:06.280 align:middle line:84%
stands for the Senate
and the People of Rome.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Fascists around the world--
political fascists--

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.140 align:middle line:90%
have used the eagle.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.500 align:middle line:84%
We see it being used everywhere
in the fascist world.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.830 align:middle line:90%
You tie in Mussolini--

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
one of the brains of fascism
into the world was Mussolini.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:25.810 align:middle line:90%
His insignia was the eagle.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.930 align:middle line:10%
And here we have an
Italian fascist coin.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.290 align:middle line:10%
And on that coin you
will see the eagle

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:10%
perched upon the fasces.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.940 align:middle line:10%
It's a bundle of sticks
with a hatchet head.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.110 align:middle line:10%
That's another subject
for another time,

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.960 align:middle line:10%
but a very important symbol--

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:10%
an eagle perched upon a fasces.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:47.660 align:middle line:84%
And so here's another
picture of another coin.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.260 align:middle line:10%
And on the right, you
will see the eagle

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:10%
is perched on a fasces,
a bundle of sticks that

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.320 align:middle line:10%
is tied together.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:10%
That means something.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.590 align:middle line:10%
It's a very important symbol.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:10%
What I think is important
is that the American quarter

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.150 align:middle line:10%
is the same identical
as the Italian fasces,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:13.450 align:middle line:10%
because America is based on
the old ancient Italian Roman

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.260 align:middle line:10%
fascist system.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:10%
And so the Nazis used the eagle.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.790 align:middle line:10%
The eagle is replete
throughout the world,

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:10%
especially in national cults
of arms, political seals.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.725 align:middle line:10%
And there, we have
a classic example

00:11:28.725 --> 00:11:33.190 align:middle line:10%
of the eagle actually
representing the sun.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.960 align:middle line:10%
This is why you'll see the seal
of the President of the United

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:10%
States with the Eagle, the eagle
on the back of the dollar bill.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But this particular seal of the
President of the United States

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.450 align:middle line:84%
is just cram-filled with
fascinating implications.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:55.290 align:middle line:84%
When you do the research into
the whole seal on the back

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:84%
of the American dollar
bill-- $1 bill--

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.530 align:middle line:84%
it is a very important
group of symbols.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:10%
It's all based on
the number 13--

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.310 align:middle line:10%
the 13 arrows and 13
berries and 13 leaves.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:10%
Here, we have 13 stars
above the eagle's head.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:18.690 align:middle line:10%
And in the configuration of all
13 stars is the Star of David,

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:19.950 align:middle line:10%
as you will see.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:26.340 align:middle line:10%
And 13 lines-- the whole seal
is based on the number 13.

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:84%
The sun and its rising
brings light into the world.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And so it became a
very powerful symbol

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.580 align:middle line:84%
for secret societies,
especially Freemasonry,

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:41.550 align:middle line:84%
to give the idea that they're
bringing light into the world.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the sun
does when half of the Earth

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.890 align:middle line:84%
is in darkness and
sleeping, while the sun is

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:49.800 align:middle line:84%
moving across the earth
and waking people up.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a war going
on in heaven continually

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.710 align:middle line:90%
between light and darkness.

00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle line:84%
The sun has always symbolized
not only a light for mankind

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle line:84%
to see his way each day,
but more importantly,

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:08.370 align:middle line:84%
intellectual and spiritual
enlightenment of the inner soul

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.720 align:middle line:90%
and the mind of mankind.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, the
sun has always been

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.320 align:middle line:84%
used for newspapers and
magazines that are bringing

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.870 align:middle line:90%
new ideas and new concepts.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:23.070 align:middle line:84%
So we see so many
newspapers and magazines

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.170 align:middle line:90%
carry the word the sun--

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.720 align:middle line:84%
the "New York Sun," the "Sunday
Sun-Times," "Sun Sentinel."

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.340 align:middle line:84%
The heart of your
community is the sun.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.460 align:middle line:84%
So we see that the
idea of the sun

00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:84%
is in almost all newspapers
around the world.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Because the sun brings
light into the world.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Well, these magazines are
trailing on that idea,

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:49.080 align:middle line:84%
that they are bringing light
and intellectual enlightenment

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.100 align:middle line:90%
to the world.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Here, we have the
idea of the sun

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:55.520 align:middle line:90%
rising between two mountains.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very important
symbol, the sun rising

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.800 align:middle line:90%
between two mountains.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.730 align:middle line:84%
Here we see on a ring the sun
rising between the mountains

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.040 align:middle line:90%
of the east.

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a sensational
amount of material

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:15.690 align:middle line:84%
on the idea of the sun
rising between two mountains.

00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And many of the presidents
of the United States

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.720 align:middle line:84%
have said that,
and said publicly

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:26.250 align:middle line:84%
that they see themselves as
representing the sun rising

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.400 align:middle line:84%
between two mountains, between
the mountains of the east.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle line:10%
Well, here we have
British Columbia

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:10%
with the sun rising
behind the mountains.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Here is the Lady Liberty
walking toward the mountain,

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:90%
and you'll see the sun rising.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:10%
This particular coin in America
is called the Dawn of a New Day

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:10%
coin, where the sun is rising
on a new time, a new day.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, the Soviet communist
world movement--

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:10%
when it took over Russia there
were many different smaller

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.260 align:middle line:10%
countries in Russia.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And they all had to accept
the idea of the sun rising

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.360 align:middle line:90%
behind the mountains.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.750 align:middle line:10%
And here you will see
the idea is always

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.720 align:middle line:10%
the same thing-- the sun
rising behind the mountains

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.190 align:middle line:10%
of the east.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And we see it today in
all of our advertisements.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:19.170 align:middle line:10%
Here on a stamp, in
America, we have a stamp

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:23.220 align:middle line:10%
which is almost identical
to the eagle which

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:10%
is used by the Nazi party.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.010 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a
Nazi fascist symbol.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:32.640 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see the sun
rising between the two

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:10%
pyramids or the two mountains.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, in churches and
religions in general,

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:84%
you will see the sermon on
the mountain, the sun rising

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.720 align:middle line:84%
behind the mountain
in stained-glass

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.730 align:middle line:90%
windows in churches.

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Here's a church in England.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.570 align:middle line:84%
And the altar has a sun
rising between two mountains.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:56.610 align:middle line:84%
You will see it all
around the world,

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.760 align:middle line:84%
this general idea of the sun
rising behind the mountains.

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:04.110 align:middle line:10%
But what's important about this
is that this an Illuminati--

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:05.510 align:middle line:10%
secret society--

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:10%
symbol, which then
begins to show you

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:10%
how pervasive the Illuminati
and the secret societies

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:19.110 align:middle line:10%
are in world religions and
world government, world finance.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.480 align:middle line:10%
Even in the Islamic
world they still

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.000 align:middle line:10%
have the same symbol as we do.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.500 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it means
the two mountains--

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:33.820 align:middle line:84%
it goes back to the ancient
Egyptian with the two statues.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:84%
And that welcomes
the sun each morning.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.290 align:middle line:84%
And there were
two large statues,

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.150 align:middle line:84%
and when the sun came
up in front of them.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:45.360 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.470 align:middle line:84%
The rising sun of the
morning is called the dawn.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So when spirituality and
intellectual enlightenment

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.070 align:middle line:84%
comes into your heart and
your mind, we say things like,

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.850 align:middle line:84%
oh, it just dawned on
me, what you were saying.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that just dawned on me.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Dawn implies the sun has finally
brought light into your life.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.980 align:middle line:10%
And you see now something
you didn't see before.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.740 align:middle line:10%
If you can go back
to Christian new dawn

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.500 align:middle line:10%
and do some research
on that, you

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.940 align:middle line:10%
will see that Easter is
referred to as a new dawn when

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.560 align:middle line:10%
the sun is rising again.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
Even in the "Kabbalah,"
there's an article

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:30.570 align:middle line:84%
about the "Kabbalah" that talks
about the fragrance of Eden,

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
the one who is caught
between the suns

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:90%
of a dying and a dawning day.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.830 align:middle line:84%
Watch the way these terms, new
dawn and dawn of a new day,

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:44.260 align:middle line:84%
keeps playing itself into all
the political rhetoric going

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:84%
All the political
speeches, politicians

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.590 align:middle line:90%
are using this term.

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:84%
Bush sees a bright
dawn emerging.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.890 align:middle line:84%
Brown calls for a
new world order.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.060 align:middle line:10%
Here, the "America"
Catholic weekly magazine

00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:03.210 align:middle line:10%
calls it a new world coming.

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:10%
A "Congressional Record,"
the proceedings and debates

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:10%
of the '76 Congress.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:14.190 align:middle line:84%
And here it basically says,
let me call your attention

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.460 align:middle line:84%
to the fact that on the reverse
of the great seal of the United

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:84%
States which appears
on our dollar bills

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.540 align:middle line:84%
you will find the exact symbol
of the British Israel World

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.430 align:middle line:90%
Federation Movement.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:29.310 align:middle line:84%
This symbol is also
carried on literature

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:33.870 align:middle line:84%
of other organizations promoting
a world government and a world

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.230 align:middle line:90%
religion.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And at the bottom of the
circle surrounding the pyramid

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:41.940 align:middle line:84%
you will find the wording
"novus ordo seclorum," which

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.810 align:middle line:84%
is the new order
that was advocated

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle line:84%
by Clinton Roosevelt
several hundred years ago,

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and recently by the
book "Philip Dru,"

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and is now being followed in
this government, the United

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:90%
States, by the executive.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:03.480 align:middle line:84%
The book is called "Philip
Dru" that really explains what

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:90%
all of this symbolism means.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.570 align:middle line:84%
It was written by a Colonel
Edward Mandell House.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.660 align:middle line:10%
And he was a very
close confidant

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:15.210 align:middle line:10%
of President Woodrow Wilson.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Edward Mandell House wrote
a book about his ideas

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:90%
about world government.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:24.930 align:middle line:10%
And here is President
Woodrow Wilson.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.210 align:middle line:10%
And on the left-hand
side, you will

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:10%
see Woodrow Wilson's friend,
Colonel Edward Mandell House,

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.240 align:middle line:10%
who incidentally happened to
be a member of the Illuminati.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:10%
And here is Colonel
Mandell House.

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Here he is with his
wife in England.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Here in the table of
contents you will see,

00:19:45.790 --> 00:19:49.170 align:middle line:84%
one of the chapters is
"The Prophet of a New Day."

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Another chapter was "The
Exultant Conspirators."

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.650 align:middle line:10%
"The Administration
of the Republic,"

00:19:55.650 --> 00:19:59.010 align:middle line:10%
talking about a new
administration here in America,

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:10%
or the republic.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:10%
Dru outlines his intentions,
a new era in Washington.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.540 align:middle line:10%
And another chapter was called
"An International Crisis."

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.530 align:middle line:10%
And another one was "The Reform
of the Judiciary," "A New

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:10%
Code of Laws for America."

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:84%
We can see that
there was already--

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:20.910 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago at the time
of the First World War, there

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:84%
was already a conspiratorial
apparatus coming out of England

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:29.450 align:middle line:84%
to set a whole new
agenda for America.

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And in the book "The Masonic
Orders of Fraternity,"

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.270 align:middle line:84%
written by Manly
Palmer Hall, he's

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.350 align:middle line:84%
talking about the Illuminati
and the secret societies.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And he said, these were
the men of towardness,

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:49.740 align:middle line:84%
those sons of tomorrow whose
symbol was a blazing sun rising

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:90%
over the mountains of the east.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And while it is
difficult to trace

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.600 align:middle line:84%
the elements of a
pattern never intended

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:84%
to be obvious to start with,
the broad shape of a design

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:06.480 align:middle line:84%
is dimly apparent,
an invisible empire

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:11.340 align:middle line:84%
taking over the world,
an invisible empire which

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.690 align:middle line:84%
was not supposed to be
understood to start with.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:17.250 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
study it, you'll

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:20.730 align:middle line:84%
begin to see that there is
a conspiratorial apparatus

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.970 align:middle line:90%
to guide the destiny of America.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:10%
And they were the
men of towardness.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:10%
Here we have the
men of towardness,

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.640 align:middle line:10%
building a new world.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:35.100 align:middle line:10%
It's George Bush and
the communist leader.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Here we have a new
order of the nations.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.280 align:middle line:84%
This was published by the
United States military.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.550 align:middle line:10%
Here's another book called
"America and a New Order,"

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:10%
back in 1949.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Here's New York.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And New York is referred
to as the Empire

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:58.210 align:middle line:84%
State, which is a new British
Empire, or the new, actually,

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:00.570 align:middle line:90%
Roman Empire.

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the new empire
is here in New York.

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
So New York is a center
for incredible treason

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of secret
societies and money.

00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:16.470 align:middle line:84%
And all kinds of
political machinations

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.295 align:middle line:84%
are going on in New York
against the American republic.

00:22:20.295 --> 00:22:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:26.560 align:middle line:84%
We begin to see that all of this
is connected behind the scenes

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:34.000 align:middle line:84%
by secret societies that want to
be the directors of our destiny

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000 align:middle line:90%
as a country and as a people.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And we need to look at a book
by a man named James Billington.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.130 align:middle line:84%
He wrote a book called
"Fire in the Minds of Men."

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
James Billington is probably
one of the finest historians

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.300 align:middle line:84%
America has ever
been able to produce.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:56.740 align:middle line:84%
James Billington today
is the chief librarian

00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:59.470 align:middle line:90%
for the Library of Congress.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:04.210 align:middle line:84%
He is considered to
be a master historian.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:84%
He's taught history in
England and America,

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:08.960 align:middle line:90%
throughout the world.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.990 align:middle line:90%
He's an incredible writer--

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.320 align:middle line:84%
fascinating, his views
on the ancient history

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.150 align:middle line:84%
and the history of
the world today.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:19.900 align:middle line:10%
He wrote a book called
"Fire in the Minds of Men--

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:10%
the Origins of the
Revolutionary Faith."

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And in it he explains all
of the machinations going

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:29.870 align:middle line:84%
on in the minds of
the guys who were

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:84%
putting this conspiracy together
to overthrow the United States.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.480 align:middle line:10%
And in the introduction
he explains

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.560 align:middle line:10%
something very important.

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.010 align:middle line:10%
This is the introduction--
one of the introduction

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:45.070 align:middle line:10%
pages, where James
Billington says,

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:50.260 align:middle line:10%
quote, a recent mythic model
for revolutionaries-- early

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:54.070 align:middle line:10%
romantics, and young Karl
Marx, and the Russians

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:57.010 align:middle line:10%
of Lenin's time--
was Prometheus,

00:23:57.010 --> 00:24:01.810 align:middle line:10%
who stole fire from the
gods for the use of mankind.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:04.270 align:middle line:10%
The Promethean faith
of revolutionaries

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:08.470 align:middle line:10%
resembles, in many respects,
the general modern belief

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.880 align:middle line:10%
that science would lead men
out of darkness into light.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.040 align:middle line:10%
But there was also a more
pointed millennial assumption

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.880 align:middle line:10%
that on the new day
that was dawning the sun

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.740 align:middle line:10%
would never set.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:10%
Early during the
French upheaval,

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:10%
or the French
Revolution, was born

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.920 align:middle line:10%
the idea of a solar
myth of revolution,

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.650 align:middle line:10%
suggesting that
the sun was rising

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:39.490 align:middle line:10%
on a new era for the
world in which darkness

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.920 align:middle line:10%
would vanish forever.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.070 align:middle line:84%
The image was implanted at
a level of consciousness

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:48.460 align:middle line:84%
that simultaneously
interpreted something real

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:90%
and produced a new reality.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.520 align:middle line:84%
The new reality that
these secret societies

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.050 align:middle line:90%
and the French Revolution--

00:24:56.050 --> 00:25:00.160 align:middle line:84%
what they sought was a radically
secular and stringently simple

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.700 align:middle line:90%
idea.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:05.950 align:middle line:10%
The idea was not the balanced
complexity of a new American

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:09.040 align:middle line:10%
Federation, but the
occult simplicity

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:14.900 align:middle line:10%
of its great seal on the top
of the pyramid over the words

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:17.530 align:middle line:10%
"novus ordo seclorum."

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.540 align:middle line:84%
What he is saying
is that Prometheus

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:23.320 align:middle line:84%
was a favorite of the ancient
gods with the Illuminati

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.230 align:middle line:84%
because he brought
light into the world.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.960 align:middle line:10%
And so today, at
Rockefeller Center,

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.800 align:middle line:10%
the main picture and the main
thing in the Rockefeller Center

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.970 align:middle line:10%
is Prometheus, who
stole fire from God.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Here we have the footnotes
for the introduction, where

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:44.680 align:middle line:84%
you will see that the idea
for the revolution-- they

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.510 align:middle line:84%
talk about, back in the 1800s,
they talk about the year 2000

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:50.710 align:middle line:90%
in New York.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:52.300 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's interesting.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.360 align:middle line:10%
As far back as the
1880s they were

00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:10%
talking about the revolution
in New York in the year 2000.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:10%
Well, what happened in
about 2000 was 9/11.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.750 align:middle line:84%
This begins to
imply that there is

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:12.250 align:middle line:84%
a very powerful secret society
working behind the world

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.010 align:middle line:84%
governments to overthrow
the United States,

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.130 align:middle line:90%
and that 9/11 was part of it.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Here's another footnote
in the back of the book.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:25.300 align:middle line:84%
It says, even speculation
about the year 2000

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.770 align:middle line:84%
began not with the
futurologists in 1960,

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:30.460 align:middle line:84%
but the dynamic
work written back

00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:34.030 align:middle line:84%
in the 1780s, the
same figure who

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:38.890 align:middle line:84%
invented the word communist,
the very idea of communism back

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.720 align:middle line:90%
in the 1780s.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:84%
They talked about
New York and the year

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:47.500 align:middle line:84%
2000 would be a time when the
whole government of America

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.810 align:middle line:84%
would be overtaken
and overthrow.

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:51.280 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.250 align:middle line:84%
9/11 has destroyed
the whole concept

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:59.170 align:middle line:84%
of a freedom-loving,
constitutional republic.

00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But most people are not
aware of any of this.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.290 align:middle line:10%
Now, let's look at
some of the symbols

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:10.530 align:middle line:10%
of countries that
use this rising

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:14.160 align:middle line:10%
sun, for communist countries.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.220 align:middle line:10%
Here we have-- in Romania
you'll see the rising sun

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.780 align:middle line:10%
behind the mountains.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:28.060 align:middle line:10%
And this one is Mongolia,
Armenia, Arizona, Illinois,

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.750 align:middle line:10%
Montana.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.770 align:middle line:90%
This is Ohio, New York State.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.940 align:middle line:10%
So in the book "Flags Throughout
the Ages and Across the World"

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:39.005 align:middle line:10%
you'll see this entry.

00:27:39.005 --> 00:27:43.760 align:middle line:10%
It says, the Soviet coat
of arms, which is left,

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:10%
graphically presents the dawn of
a new day for the entire world.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:53.060 align:middle line:10%
Here we have another
state arms of a country.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:57.410 align:middle line:10%
The rising sun is a symbol of
a new dawn for the country.

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:03.580 align:middle line:84%
The sun for Liberia, the
sun which heralds a new day.

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:06.310 align:middle line:90%
And you have the red dawn.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.800 align:middle line:84%
This red flag
represents communism.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.460 align:middle line:90%
China has a rising sun.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So these are just
political symbols,

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:20.540 align:middle line:84%
but are all saying the same
thing about a secret societies

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.250 align:middle line:84%
idea about how to overthrow
the world of mankind.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:28.460 align:middle line:10%
And you get the
people to understand

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.240 align:middle line:10%
that they are going to be
living like kings in a new world

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:37.310 align:middle line:10%
order, when all of this
malarkey is all done away with--

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:39.920 align:middle line:10%
peace and freedom,
liberty and justice,

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.050 align:middle line:10%
and a constitutional
republic-- is all

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.360 align:middle line:10%
overthrown and done away with.

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And now we will have a
really wonderful world

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.510 align:middle line:84%
to live in, when we
will all be equal.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:55.700 align:middle line:84%
And we'll all live under
the dawn of a new day.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.490 align:middle line:84%
And the people buy
into it because they

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:00.440 align:middle line:90%
don't know what the words mean.

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.970 align:middle line:84%
They don't know
where it comes from.

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:05.320 align:middle line:90%


00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.890 align:middle line:10%
So the bottom line
is, quite simply,

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:14.100 align:middle line:10%
that the world that we live in
today is totally and completely

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.900 align:middle line:10%
dominated by and guiding
the destiny of America

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.890 align:middle line:10%
and the world, being
guided by a secret society,

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:27.840 align:middle line:10%
a most powerful,
well-organized, well-financed,

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.740 align:middle line:10%
highly intelligent secret
society that has America

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.710 align:middle line:10%
by the throat, and
has the world--

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.770 align:middle line:10%
through the United Nations
and all other international

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.800 align:middle line:10%
organizations,
banking fraternities--

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.460 align:middle line:10%
has the whole world in
its arms and guiding

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:46.780 align:middle line:10%
the destiny of the human race.

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:47.970 align:middle line:90%
And we don't know it.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.160 align:middle line:90%


00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.330 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jordan Maxwell.

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.540 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for watching.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:59.168 align:middle line:90%
