00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.900 align:middle line:84%
>> This is "Secret
Life of Symbols."

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.700 align:middle line:90%


00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Moses is one of the
most interesting characters

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.870 align:middle line:10%
in the Bible.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.310 align:middle line:10%
I hope to show you why.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.050 align:middle line:10%
So we all know that Moses was
the prophet that brought down

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.840 align:middle line:10%
the law to the Jewish people.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.540 align:middle line:10%
And he has become
the symbol for law

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.610 align:middle line:10%
pretty much around the world.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.770 align:middle line:84%
So in talking about Moses,
you think about law.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:84%
But there's a lot more to Moses
that you need to know about.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.330 align:middle line:84%
Moses was a prophet in the
Jewish system of things.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.765 align:middle line:84%
He was one of the oldest
names in the Bible, one

00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.960 align:middle line:84%
of the most revered
figures in the Bible,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:84%
because he was supposedly
so close to God.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.030 align:middle line:10%
And he has given to the
world the 10 Commandments.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.840 align:middle line:10%
The history of Moses takes
us back to ancient Egypt

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.420 align:middle line:10%
and to the Israelites
back in the time

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.160 align:middle line:10%
of Egypt in ancient Egypt.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.260 align:middle line:84%
He was a very fierce
man for the truth,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.930 align:middle line:84%
and for leading the
people, and supposedly

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:84%
the Jewish people,
the Hebrew people.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.985 align:middle line:84%
He was a major leader at the
time when they were in Egypt.

00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:29.660 align:middle line:90%


00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Because he went up
into the mountain

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and got the 10
Commandments from God,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.940 align:middle line:84%
he became known
as the law giver.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.420 align:middle line:84%
The point we need to remember is
that Moses was a very important

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:84%
man to the Hebrew people
and to the history

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.210 align:middle line:90%
of the Jewish people in Egypt.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.520 align:middle line:84%
He was supposedly born
in Egypt and was bred

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.480 align:middle line:90%
in the house of the princess.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:84%
And he was around
royalty continually.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And yet he had a love
for the Jewish God

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.080 align:middle line:84%
and so he protected
the Jewish people.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And he became so important
to the history of the Hebrew

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
people at the time
of Egypt that today

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:84%
he even is recognized as
a very important person

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.580 align:middle line:84%
to remember in
history about law.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:84%
He was the one who led them out
of Egypt according to the story

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that Egyptian life had become so
difficult for the Jewish people

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:90%
and they wanted out of Egypt.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And so Moses was the
one who had the strength

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.550 align:middle line:84%
to stand up before Pharaoh
and say let my people go

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.680 align:middle line:90%
and we will leave out of Egypt.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:10%
And so this is even today still
remembered a very heroic deed

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.780 align:middle line:10%
for Moses to step up and take
the leadership of the Hebrew

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.130 align:middle line:10%
people, and walk out of
Egypt, and leave Egypt.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
He took them up into
the north where we today

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.050 align:middle line:84%
refer to it as Lebanon
and Israel, et cetera.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.810 align:middle line:84%
The most important
point I wish to make

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
there is so much

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.400 align:middle line:84%
more to this ancient prophet
leader of the Hebrew people

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
than has been
discussed publicly.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And I want to talk about
some of those things.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:10%
Moses was called
by God to come up

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.570 align:middle line:10%
into the mountain
of Mount Sinai.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And God was going to
give Moses what we now

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:84%
refer to as the 10
Commandments, which was actually

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.560 align:middle line:84%
a new dispensation
for Jewish law,

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.400 align:middle line:84%
a brand new way to understand
the Jewish understanding

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.390 align:middle line:90%
of God.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.310 align:middle line:10%
And so he goes up
into the mountain.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:10%
And he encounters
the presence of God.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And God gives him
10 Commandments

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.120 align:middle line:84%
to bring back to the people
to begin a new dispensation,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.550 align:middle line:90%
a new understanding of God.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
And so Moses comes
down from the mountain.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.230 align:middle line:84%
He sees the Jewish people still
worshipping God the old way.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.420 align:middle line:84%
They were worshipping
a golden calf,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.730 align:middle line:84%
because it had to do with the
particular astrological times

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:90%
in which they were living.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.353 align:middle line:84%
And the times in which
they were living then

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:16.769 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
10 Commandments

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:90%
was Taurus the Bull.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And so they were worshipping
the golden calf in relation

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:90%
to Taurus the Bull.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.180 align:middle line:10%
Well, Moses comes down
and sees the Jewish people

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:10%
still worshipping in the old
way and becomes very frustrated.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.950 align:middle line:10%
Before he even talks to them,
he becomes very frustrated

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.210 align:middle line:10%
and then throws the law--

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.130 align:middle line:10%
it was referred to as the law.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And so Moses throws down
the law and breaks the law.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.950 align:middle line:84%
So Moses was the
first law breaker.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.160 align:middle line:84%
He was carrying two stones
on which the laws, the 10

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.870 align:middle line:90%
Commandments, were written.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:90%
And so he carries these down.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And then when he sees the
Jewish people still worshipping

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.630 align:middle line:84%
they old way, he throws
those down in frustration.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And so that's where we get the
term today breaking the law.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.670 align:middle line:84%
The Jews were
worshipping the calf

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.130 align:middle line:84%
because they realized
that they were

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.350 align:middle line:84%
worshipping the sun in the
astrological age of Taurus

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:90%
the Bull.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:84%
The next astrological
age of which

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Moses was going to lead his
people into the next age

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.500 align:middle line:90%
was going to be Aries the Ram.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And he was teaching
them that there

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.480 align:middle line:84%
was a new way they were
going to worship God.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:84%
And this time they would
blow the ram's horn

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:84%
to signify the age of
the Ram, the shofar.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.090 align:middle line:10%
Here we have pictures
showing that God

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.220 align:middle line:10%
is handing Moses the Ten
Commandments on these tablets.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.450 align:middle line:84%
The tablets themselves
are very interesting,

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:84%
the design and what
they were all about.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.180 align:middle line:10%
We find that there is a
very interesting connection

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:10%
between the Ten
Commandments of the Hebrews

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:10%
and the 12 Negative
Confessions of the Egyptians.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians already
had 12 laws, so to speak.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were called the
12 Negative Confession.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And so when you read the
Negative Confessions and then

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.540 align:middle line:84%
the Ten Commandments,
they are exactly the same.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:84%
The only difference
is one is in Egypt,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.430 align:middle line:84%
they said here are the
things we will not do.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.030 align:middle line:90%
It was a negative confession.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Here are the things
we will not do.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:90%
We will not lie.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:90%
We will not steal.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.420 align:middle line:84%
We will not do this
or that while the Ten

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Commandments of the Lord
said you should not do this.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.920 align:middle line:10%
You should not do that.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.030 align:middle line:10%
That is very similar.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.500 align:middle line:10%
So we know basically where the
Ten Commandments came from,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.690 align:middle line:10%
from the 12 negative
confessions of Egypt.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you remember
that religion

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:84%
itself is a development of human
creativity, and so many stories

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.570 align:middle line:84%
in different religious
books around the world, so

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:03.420 align:middle line:84%
many wonderful stories and
theological ideas and concepts

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.730 align:middle line:84%
which obviously
were just made up

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
by men to promote their
particular religious belief.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.760 align:middle line:10%
But back to Moses
giving up the law,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.970 align:middle line:10%
that particular scene of Moses
with the Ten Commandments,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.420 align:middle line:10%
the very steles
and the very stones

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:10%
themselves is very important.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.930 align:middle line:10%
Moses is always the law giver.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.560 align:middle line:10%
And the Jews today
still respect Moses

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:10%
as probably one of the
most important people

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.565 align:middle line:10%
in their history
besides Abraham.

00:07:35.565 --> 00:07:41.590 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
You will see Moses in
pictures, and paintings,

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and sculpturings,
Moses has horns.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.770 align:middle line:90%
And it's been a--

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:84%
all around the world, people
have wondered why is it Moses,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:90%
he has horns.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
to understand what

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.130 align:middle line:90%
the horns represent on Moses.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.600 align:middle line:90%
The horns of Moses--

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and you will see that there
was, in the ancient world,

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:12.580 align:middle line:84%
at Moses' time in that ancient
time, there was a moon god.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.980 align:middle line:90%
And the moon god's name was Sin.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.420 align:middle line:10%
And he was always represented by
the lower quarter of the moon.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.280 align:middle line:10%
And so the lower
quarter in the moon

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.690 align:middle line:10%
was used as a symbol
for moon worship.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:10%
And they had goddesses of
moon worship, which you have.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.810 align:middle line:10%
Also, in Rome,
you had moon gods.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.020 align:middle line:10%
You know, the American--

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.070 align:middle line:10%
Native Americans also have horns
because they counted their days

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.110 align:middle line:10%
by many moons.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.110 align:middle line:84%
Their days were like
the Hebrews today.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.240 align:middle line:90%
After 6 o'clock began a new day.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.360 align:middle line:84%
It was the same thing
with the Native Americans.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.270 align:middle line:84%
So all of these people
from the ancient Hebrews

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:54.550 align:middle line:84%
to the Native Americans were
using a lunar calendar--

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.260 align:middle line:90%
lunar, simply meaning the moon.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the symbol for
the lunar was a horns

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.710 align:middle line:90%
of the bull or the horns--

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:90%
that which the Vikings used.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.890 align:middle line:84%
This is a symbol for
the lunar symbol,

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.460 align:middle line:84%
which you'll find everywhere
in different religions.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:10%
These are the horns
that Moses wore.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:20.500 align:middle line:10%
Here in Israel,
you'll see carvings

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:26.100 align:middle line:10%
of the arms raised to raise
and to praise the moon.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And Egyptian paintings
show the moon.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.340 align:middle line:84%
The Blessed Mother
in Christianity

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.160 align:middle line:90%
stands on the moon.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:10%
You'll see the moon everywhere
in the ancient world

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:10%
of religion, which
was showing us

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.190 align:middle line:10%
that the moon was
very important, even

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:10%
at the time of Moses in Egypt.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.070 align:middle line:10%
Moon worship was very prominent.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course today, the Islamic
world still uses the moon also.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:58.180 align:middle line:10%
And in the Western world, the
moon is still used as a symbol.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:01.720 align:middle line:10%
We're talking about a moon
cult many thousands of years

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.400 align:middle line:10%
ago in Egypt, of which Moses
was the leader of the Hebrew

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.210 align:middle line:10%
people, which were worshippers
of the moon, at that time.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:14.500 align:middle line:84%
If you go on the web and just
put in-- just type in, moon god

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Sin, it will have all kinds
of information showing you

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.910 align:middle line:84%
about how the moon was a very
important part of worship

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:23.330 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient world.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:27.640 align:middle line:84%
And they will also tell you that
Moses was a leader of a lunar

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.280 align:middle line:84%
cult. There's a lot of
information about the moon cult

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and the moon god
Yahweh or Allah.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:40.470 align:middle line:84%
Here is a classic example in the
ancient world of the moon god

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.720 align:middle line:90%
Sin.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
The god himself was--
his name was called Sin.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.590 align:middle line:84%
And in the ancient
world, Ai was a mountain

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:90%
in the times of ancient Egypt.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:90%
Ai was a mountain.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this moon god
Sin, and the mountain Ai--

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.290 align:middle line:84%
put it together, and
it becomes Sinai.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.170 align:middle line:84%
So Mount Sinai is actually,
no, the moon god Sin

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.610 align:middle line:90%
and the mountain of Sinai.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mount Sinai
today is felt to be

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.430 align:middle line:84%
the center for and
the really foundation

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:17.850 align:middle line:84%
for the Jewish religion,
as it began to spread

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:90%
throughout the Middle East.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Mount Sinai was where
god met with Moses.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:27.030 align:middle line:84%
God met with his
people at Mount Sinai.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:31.010 align:middle line:10%
But Mount Sinai is
actually Sin Ai.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.970 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's interesting
that today,

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:37.400 align:middle line:10%
in most of the Western world,
the word synagogue is spelled

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:10%
S-Y-N-A. But in Israel, it's
S-I-N-A because Israel realizes

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:10%
that the original word was S-I-N
not S-Y-N because of the moon

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.260 align:middle line:10%
god Sin.

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Synagogue basically
means temple of the moon

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:00.170 align:middle line:90%
because Sin was the moon god.

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.210 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
important to realize

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.640 align:middle line:84%
that there's a difference
in the way it's spelled--

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:84%
one way in Israel, and a
different way in the rest

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:11.040 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Here is just one of
many reference works.

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:18.980 align:middle line:84%
This is by an Andrew Key
from the Southern Methodist

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.420 align:middle line:90%
University.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.250 align:middle line:84%
His article is, "Traces of the
Worship of the moon god Sin

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.950 align:middle line:90%
Among the Early Israelites."

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.400 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish tradition talks
about the combination

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.090 align:middle line:84%
of the heavenly moon as a part
of the-- most important part

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:37.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Jewish
worship at that time.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:42.500 align:middle line:10%
There are many symbols and
emblems and paintings showing

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.680 align:middle line:10%
Moses in relation to the moon.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.730 align:middle line:10%
And so here is pictures of
a priest lighting a fire

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:52.310 align:middle line:10%
to signal a new moon.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Here, you will see an
illustration of the Israelites

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.020 align:middle line:90%
and their worship of the moon--

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:90%
the prayer to the new moon.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And below, you will see
sanctification of the new moon.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:06.650 align:middle line:10%
This is from
Amsterdam as far back

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.170 align:middle line:10%
as 1723, showing the
important, still,

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:13.700 align:middle line:10%
in the worship of Israel,
for the new moon--

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.290 align:middle line:10%
for the moon.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:19.700 align:middle line:10%
Above, you will see the new
moon etching from a book

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:24.530 align:middle line:10%
back in 1748 showing the Jews
celebrating the new moon.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Today, the new moon is still
very important around the world

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.430 align:middle line:90%
to many cultures.

00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And here we have a picture
of Egypt and the Sinai.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And down toward the
bottom of the Sinai,

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:90%
there was a huge mountain range.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And so here, we see
a better picture,

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.880 align:middle line:84%
where Mount Sinai is
referred to in the area

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.350 align:middle line:90%
of the wilderness of Sin.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And Sin, of course,
is the moon god.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Sin is originally the moon
god of the Arabic world.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Allah, and Sin, and
Moses with Yahweh--

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
it all had to do with the
worship of the moon god Sin.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.850 align:middle line:84%
For some reason, the
ancient Arabic world

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:84%
placed a very high
respect on the moon.

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:18.050 align:middle line:10%
It's probably based
on some phenomena

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:10%
that the new moon caused
because the Arabic world

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:24.410 align:middle line:10%
and the ancient world,
in general, realized

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:28.040 align:middle line:10%
that the moon has a huge
effect on our bodies.

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.220 align:middle line:84%
It has an effect
on our food supply,

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.230 align:middle line:84%
and it pulls the
oceans of the world.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.770 align:middle line:84%
And so on the moon was very
important to the ancient world.

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:39.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that is a
whole study in itself

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:84%
why the ancient Arabic world had
such a reverence for the moon.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:47.870 align:middle line:84%
They always used the moon
to keep the track of days

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:84%
because their days
started at sundown--

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:90%
at 6 o'clock-- because why?

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Because that's when
the moon comes out.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.370 align:middle line:84%
While the Christians were
worshiping and having

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.390 align:middle line:84%
their holidays and important
times in their religion

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.680 align:middle line:90%
on Sun-day--

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.850 align:middle line:84%
they were worshipping
the sun of god--

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
the ancient Arabic world
and the ancient Hebrews

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:13.520 align:middle line:84%
were under the influence
of the moon god.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Christians, as you know,
have a sun calendar.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And their days start
from sun to sun,

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.140 align:middle line:84%
while the Hebrews in
the ancient Arabic world

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:29.300 align:middle line:84%
had a lunar calendar, which
their days from sundown

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.710 align:middle line:90%
to sundown.

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.920 align:middle line:90%
The moon, as it comes up--

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and it was referred
to as the lunar

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:43.460 align:middle line:84%
god, who lived in the mountain
and the real Mount Sinai.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:49.010 align:middle line:84%
Mount Sinai itself was
understood to be a volcano.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
when Moses goes up

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:84%
unto the Mount Sinai to get the
new Ten Commandments from god,

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
he is confronted by the
mountain is on fire.

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And so anytime you
have a mountain

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:84%
on fire, that happens
if you have a volcano.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And so Mount Sinai
was known and is even,

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.290 align:middle line:84%
today, recognized as
being probably connected

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.810 align:middle line:90%
to volcano worship, also.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.570 align:middle line:10%
And so this is
why Moses goes up,

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.340 align:middle line:10%
and he sees the
mountain on fire.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.720 align:middle line:90%
And he talks to god.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.020 align:middle line:84%
And the scriptures-- even in
the new-- in the Old Testament,

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:31.880 align:middle line:84%
the Bible says that the ancient
Hebrews were frightened when

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.550 align:middle line:84%
they would hear the thunder in
the mountain because they said

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:35.510 align:middle line:90%
thunder--

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:84%
was a word we call thunder,
but the ancient Hebrews

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:90%
said it was the voice of god.

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.370 align:middle line:84%
He is talking to them,
and he had lightning.

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And that was trying to
get their attention.

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So god was very angry and very
upset with the Jewish people

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
because it was like
a mountain on fire.

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, we're
talking about a volcano.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So Moses becomes important
in volcano worship also.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.510 align:middle line:10%
Here you will see
Moses-- pictures.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.420 align:middle line:10%
These are all pictures
from Christian and Jewish

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.510 align:middle line:10%
publications showing Moses
going up into the mountain.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:10.940 align:middle line:10%
And it appears to be a volcano.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:13.640 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's because
it was a volcano.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:10%
Here we have some a
Jewish publication

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:10%
showing the children of Israel
running away when they hear

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.190 align:middle line:10%
god thundering in the mountain.

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:25.440 align:middle line:90%
It looks like a volcano.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.359 align:middle line:10%
All of the pictures of Moses
going up into the mountain

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:30.660 align:middle line:10%
to get the Ten
Commandments always

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.265 align:middle line:10%
shows the mountain on fire.

00:17:32.265 --> 00:17:34.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.400 align:middle line:10%
So here we have Moses preparing
to go up in the mountain

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.130 align:middle line:10%
to get the new Ten
Commandments from god,

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:45.330 align:middle line:10%
and it appears to be a volcano.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.580 align:middle line:10%
Here as a particular
religious celebration.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:53.080 align:middle line:10%
It's called the Feast of
the Giving of the Law.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:55.980 align:middle line:10%
And in the Hebrew
reference works,

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.470 align:middle line:10%
you'll look up the
Celebration of the Feast

00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:59.930 align:middle line:10%
of the Giving of the Law.

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:10%
And what do you
see, but a volcano?

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So the word volcano comes
from a Latin volcano

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:90%
god called Vulcan or Vulcanus.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.920 align:middle line:84%
It's derived from an old
Cretan deity Velchanos.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Here is the old
volcano god Vulcan.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.440 align:middle line:84%
And it was always
because the people

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.020 align:middle line:84%
were frightened to
death of the thunder

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:84%
and the lightning that
was caused by the volcano.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And they thought it was
god talking to them.

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And so then we talk
about Prometheus

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.380 align:middle line:84%
was another ancient
god about the time--

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.620 align:middle line:84%
was also a volcano god who
was worshipped and took him

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.680 align:middle line:84%
to Greece, while
Yahweh was a volcano

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.790 align:middle line:84%
god, who the worshippers
took him back to Judah.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is, again,
why Moses encountered

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.790 align:middle line:90%
god in the burning bush.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.200 align:middle line:10%
And it seems as not
only the burning bush--

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.020 align:middle line:10%
the whole mountain was on fire.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.120 align:middle line:10%
Yahweh was worshipped
by the Jews

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.800 align:middle line:10%
as a volcano god
and a lunar deity.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
interesting connections

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.230 align:middle line:84%
with the ancient
world religions that--

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:15.030 align:middle line:84%
it's not that easy to explain
how all of these pieces

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:84%
came together to form
a particular religion.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:84%
It says in one of
the reference books--

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.760 align:middle line:84%
it says, "Yet the
original Yahweh

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:84%
seems to have begun
as a volcano god also.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:84%
Mount Sinai, where
Moses encountered him,

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:33.060 align:middle line:84%
was the seat of a Midianite
god who had formerly

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:35.840 align:middle line:90%
dwelt in a volcano.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.290 align:middle line:10%
Here we have Moses
getting the law from god.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see the
lightning, and the fire,

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:46.000 align:middle line:84%
and the thunder, and
lightning all around him.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.100 align:middle line:84%
We go back to the Book
of Exodus, where we read,

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:55.120 align:middle line:84%
"And the Lord went before them
by day in a pillar of cloud."

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is talking
about the time

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.820 align:middle line:84%
when the Jews were
leaving out of Egypt,

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
and god was going
to be with them

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.230 align:middle line:90%
as they went on their journey.

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.980 align:middle line:84%
And so it said that god
went before the people,

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:10.780 align:middle line:90%
by day, a pillar of cloud.

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:15.570 align:middle line:84%
He showed that he was with them
by having a cloud follow them

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.560 align:middle line:84%
everywhere they went
to lead the way out.

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:22.350 align:middle line:84%
And by night, he would
have a pillar of fire

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.890 align:middle line:84%
to give them the indication
that he was with them at night.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:27.690 align:middle line:90%
They could see the fire.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:29.130 align:middle line:90%
So they knew god was with them.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:84%
In the daytime, it would
be a pillar of cloud.

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.230 align:middle line:84%
And at night, it would
be a pillar of fire.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.010 align:middle line:90%
It goes on to say in 22--

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:40.110 align:middle line:84%
it says, "He took not away
the pillar of cloud by day

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:44.110 align:middle line:84%
and the pillar of fire by night
from before the people" to let

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.000 align:middle line:90%
them know he was with them.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what you get in
a volcano is a pillar of cloud

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.820 align:middle line:90%
by day, right?

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:53.880 align:middle line:84%
A pillar of cloud by
day does not necessarily

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.840 align:middle line:90%
mean god is there.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.100 align:middle line:90%
It means it's a volcano.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And then you have a
pillar of fire by night.

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:01.740 align:middle line:90%
Of course-- a volcano.

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:84%
So we go onto read, in different
parts of the Old Testament

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:84%
Bible, about Yahweh
being a god of fire

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and the pillar of
fire, et cetera.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, here in Job 38 in the
Old Testament, we read that--

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:21.330 align:middle line:90%
in the footnotes, "The storm.

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:90%
The clouds.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:90%
God's tent."

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And so the ancients
believe the clouds

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.990 align:middle line:84%
were a tent in which god lived
when he was following them.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:32.920 align:middle line:84%
So, "The clouds,
God's tent, gather

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.280 align:middle line:84%
as the thunder, 'the
voice' of Yahweh roars;

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.670 align:middle line:84%
they descend, and God shoots
the 'arrow' of his lightning."

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And down in 37, it says,
"his thunderbolts."

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.150 align:middle line:10%
"God thunders wonderfully
with his voice,"

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:51.880 align:middle line:10%
showing that the Yahweh
in the Old Testament

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:57.370 align:middle line:10%
was just another volcano god
who thunders with his voice.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:10%
And of course, Zeus
was also connected

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:04.010 align:middle line:10%
to the worship of Yahweh because
he was also a god of lightning

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.810 align:middle line:10%
and thunder--

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:10%
the same as Yahweh.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.220 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
there's a whole story

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:14.890 align:middle line:84%
about the connection between
Zeus and Jehovah because today,

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:18.910 align:middle line:90%
Zeus gives us our word for god--

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:20.950 align:middle line:90%
Deus-- in Latin.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And so Deus is Latin, as god,
is taken from the name of Zeus.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.470 align:middle line:10%
And they even have a canal
called the Suez Canal, which

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.450 align:middle line:10%
is Zeus spelled backwards.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So Zeus was very important
back in those ancient days,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.940 align:middle line:90%
too, as a volcano god.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.700 align:middle line:84%
You can see how the ancient
people would be frightened,

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.670 align:middle line:84%
thinking that god was
in this holy mountain,

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:47.710 align:middle line:90%
and the mountain's on fire.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:49.675 align:middle line:10%
We keep in mind that
in the Hebrew language,

00:22:49.675 --> 00:22:53.920 align:middle line:10%
it says, "Thunder is called
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH] or voices,

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.770 align:middle line:10%
for it is considered
the voice of God."

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
The Bible, in the
Old Testament, uses

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.770 align:middle line:90%
the term for the voice of god.

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But it is actually
the word for thunder.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.720 align:middle line:10%
"After it a voice
roared; he thundered

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:13.150 align:middle line:10%
with his voice of
his excellency,"

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:18.160 align:middle line:10%
again just showing that we were
talking about a volcano god

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:21.880 align:middle line:10%
going all the way back
into ancient Egypt.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.180 align:middle line:10%
And "Yahweh was also
called Valcanus."

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.400 align:middle line:10%
He was a Vulcan God--

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.830 align:middle line:10%
the god of the Vulcans.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Even today, in Hawaii--

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle line:84%
the volcano goddess--
the whole idea

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:38.800 align:middle line:84%
of connecting a
god with a volcano

00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:43.630 align:middle line:84%
has to do with the sexual
reproduction of the human race.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.330 align:middle line:90%
That's the fire of reproduction.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And so it's the fire that
gives life to the earth.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.570 align:middle line:84%
That's where it
actually came from.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Today, the Jewish religion is
not as dominated by the moon

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:00.380 align:middle line:84%
as it was maybe
thousands of years ago.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.770 align:middle line:10%
So ideas change
from time to time.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:08.440 align:middle line:10%
Here's another important part of
the Moses story is that Moses--

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.760 align:middle line:10%
we are told, when the Israelites
were trying to get out

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.390 align:middle line:10%
of the area they were in,
and god was with them,

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:10%
they didn't have the foods.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.920 align:middle line:90%
And they were starving.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And so they came to Moses and
said, you told us to leave,

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:90%
and we're following you.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:84%
But now, we don't
have any food to eat.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Moses talks to god.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:36.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's said that god
gave to the Hebrew people

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.530 align:middle line:90%
a manna to eat.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:90%
And it was spelt M-A-N-N-A--

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.480 align:middle line:90%
manna.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it was the
manna from heaven.

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:90%
God said, all right.

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:84%
I will give you
food for the moment.

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:47.290 align:middle line:90%
You're not going to starve.

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:50.620 align:middle line:84%
God told Moses, tell the people
to go out in the morning--

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.970 align:middle line:90%
early morning.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And on the ground, there
will be little round,

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:59.110 align:middle line:84%
white disk--shaped things, and
to eat it because this will be

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.130 align:middle line:90%
good for you.

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that will save
you from starving.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Manna, actually, in
Hebrew means what

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:11.560 align:middle line:84%
is it because the people
didn't know what it was.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.530 align:middle line:90%
It was on the ground.

00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:14.280 align:middle line:90%
And it was good to eat.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.880 align:middle line:90%
But they don't know what it is.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.035 align:middle line:84%
Then the Bible goes on
to say that it was small.

00:25:20.035 --> 00:25:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Manna was small.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.320 align:middle line:90%
It was round, flaky.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.630 align:middle line:90%
It was white.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.950 align:middle line:84%
It was obviously from
heaven because Moses

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.060 align:middle line:90%
said god gave it to them.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And so here we have
pictures of the Israelites,

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:35.650 align:middle line:84%
under Moses' direction,
out in the morning picking

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.620 align:middle line:90%
the manna from heaven to eat.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Even in the Bible, it
says, "And when the dew"--

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.250 align:middle line:84%
this is in Exodus
talking about this time.

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:84%
And it says, "And when the
dew that lay on the ground

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.230 align:middle line:84%
was dried up in the
morning, behold,

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:52.270 align:middle line:84%
on the face of the
wilderness, there

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:56.440 align:middle line:84%
lay a small, round thing
as small as hoar frost

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.580 align:middle line:90%
on the ground.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And when the children
of Israel saw it,

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.020 align:middle line:84%
they said to one
another, it is manna,

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.840 align:middle line:84%
for they did not
know what it was.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And Moses said to them, 'this
is the bread which the Lord has

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:90%
given you to eat.'"

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:18.490 align:middle line:84%
We now know that what we were
talking about was mushrooms.

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking about the
ancient people of Israel

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:84%
were being fed, by
god, mushrooms--

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.500 align:middle line:90%
some magic mushroom.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.080 align:middle line:10%
And so you see the
people of Israel,

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.010 align:middle line:10%
on the grounds in the
morning, picking mushrooms.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:32.962 align:middle line:10%
And we know now--

00:26:32.962 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:10%
there's been a lot
of books written

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.760 align:middle line:10%
about the magic
mushroom, as it's

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:41.470 align:middle line:10%
used in the religious rituals,
and in the Jewish culture,

00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:43.660 align:middle line:10%
and in the ancient cultures
of the Middle East.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.330 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people use mushrooms.

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:48.820 align:middle line:10%
Today, like James
Arthur's famous book,

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.460 align:middle line:10%
"Mushrooms and Mankind,"
"The Mystery of Manna,"

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:57.910 align:middle line:10%
"Magic Mushrooms," "Psilocybin
Mushrooms of the World,"

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.680 align:middle line:10%
"Psychedelic Sacraments"
of the mushroom.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.370 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people do not
know that the Hebrews were

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:06.550 align:middle line:84%
very interested in
this manna from heaven

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:08.500 align:middle line:90%
and have kept the tradition.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And today, mushroom
and eating mushrooms

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:84%
are still being used
today around the world.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.170 align:middle line:84%
But what we're talking
about, actually,

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:21.910 align:middle line:84%
is the magic mushroom, which
was a psychedelic mushroom.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Eating a mushroom,
we are told, enhances

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.900 align:middle line:84%
your ability to
understand things openly,

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.810 align:middle line:84%
open your mind up so
you can understand,

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and see things, and
experience the spiritual

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and the metaphysical
properties of life.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Here is an article in Israel.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.830 align:middle line:84%
It says, "Moses
was high on drugs,

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Israeli researcher writes."

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.800 align:middle line:84%
There's been quite a
few articles in Israel.

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Here's another one from an
Israeli magazine or newspaper.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.360 align:middle line:10%
"Hebrew University researcher:
Moses was tripping out

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:10%
on Mount Sinai," showing
that even in Israel, they

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:07.300 align:middle line:10%
realize that Moses was not
only the leader of a moon cult,

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.270 align:middle line:10%
he was also connected
to a volcano god,

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:11.800 align:middle line:10%
and then also, he
was the one that

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.400 align:middle line:10%
is introducing the
use of magic mushrooms

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.340 align:middle line:10%
to the Jewish community.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:21.190 align:middle line:84%
You can actually see the
connection with the so-called

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:27.620 align:middle line:84%
New Age movement today and the
progression of the same old--

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.280 align:middle line:84%
as I've said before,
the more we change,

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.780 align:middle line:90%
the more we stay the same.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.540 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're talking about
a new age that's coming,

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:39.340 align:middle line:84%
a new time, and a new law, and
a new understanding of god.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:43.340 align:middle line:84%
And what's part of that
is magic mushrooms, again,

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.910 align:middle line:90%
and natural phenomena.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:48.520 align:middle line:84%
Moses was not the
only one on mushrooms.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:84%
We also see mushrooms going
back even further back in time

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.940 align:middle line:90%
than the time of Moses.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:84%
If you look today, you will see,
in the Vatican, Adam and Eve

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:03.820 align:middle line:84%
supposedly in the Garden of Eden
with the tree of the knowledge

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.140 align:middle line:90%
of good and evil.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:08.530 align:middle line:10%
Actually, in the Vatican,
it shows Adam and Eve

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:10%
at the mushroom--
taking mushrooms.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:16.630 align:middle line:10%
There's another Christian
fresco showing amanita muscaria

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:21.260 align:middle line:10%
as the tree of good and
evil in the Garden of Eden.

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.460 align:middle line:10%
So according to the
ancient Vatican records,

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.300 align:middle line:10%
Adam and Eve were not in
the garden with the tree,

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.800 align:middle line:10%
as we've been told.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But they actually show Adam
and Eve eating mushrooms.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:37.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was opening their
mind to be against god

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and to do all kinds of things
that they couldn't do before.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.930 align:middle line:84%
So the magic mushroom has been
around for a long time, too.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.680 align:middle line:10%
John Allegro was
number three man

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:51.310 align:middle line:10%
in the translation of
the Dead Sea Scrolls.

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:55.420 align:middle line:10%
And in it, his book called, "The
Sacred Mushroom and the Cross,"

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.020 align:middle line:10%
which is a study of the nature
and the origins of Christianity

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:02.730 align:middle line:10%
within the fertility cult
of the ancient Near East,

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:10%
in which he shows that
ancient Christians were

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:06.880 align:middle line:10%
on mushrooms, also.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.640 align:middle line:10%
"The Sacred Mushroom
and the Cross"

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.070 align:middle line:10%
has been a very famous
book for a long time.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And it opened up a whole new
study in Christianity, also,

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:20.430 align:middle line:84%
about their use of
the magic mushrooms.

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:24.110 align:middle line:90%


00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Because if you used the
magic mushrooms, yeah.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.490 align:middle line:10%
You'll talk to God, all right.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.680 align:middle line:84%
You'll have some
psychedelic experiences.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.180 align:middle line:84%
And Christians will call
that, I talked with the Lord.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:33.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:35.780 align:middle line:84%
It's just a
psychedelic experience

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.780 align:middle line:84%
that mushrooms
have on your mind.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.290 align:middle line:10%
But we see them--

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:44.010 align:middle line:10%
we see this magic mushroom,
which is amanita muscaria.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:10%
This particular one is
very potent for giving

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:51.260 align:middle line:10%
the brain a whole new
experience, taking this.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:54.350 align:middle line:84%
And so we see it
used everywhere.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Many, many religions
in the Middle East,

00:30:56.690 --> 00:31:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and India, and Africa
depend on the magic mushroom

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and the effect it
gives in the human mind

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.050 align:middle line:84%
to put you into an altered
state of consciousness.

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.930 align:middle line:10%
So.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are many symbolisms
connected to all of the stories

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.940 align:middle line:84%
coming out of the Old
Testament about Moses.

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
symbols that I think

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.670 align:middle line:84%
is interesting as the
headdress that people

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.000 align:middle line:84%
in royalty and people in
the Middle East use, which

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.580 align:middle line:84%
connects directly to the
idea to Moses introducing

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.920 align:middle line:90%
the magic mushroom--

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:84%
because so many of the priests
were priest of the mushroom.

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.660 align:middle line:10%
There have been many books
written about the fact

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:45.720 align:middle line:10%
that they were called
priests of the mushroom.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:48.810 align:middle line:10%
They wore mushroom headdresses.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Mushroom headdresses
were actually

00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:54.360 align:middle line:84%
rather prevalent in
the ancient times.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.160 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So Moses was involved
in a lot of things.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:06.800 align:middle line:84%
A lot of stuff in the Bible
that Moses is involved with--

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:12.110 align:middle line:84%
we just don't understand
the implications of it.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:15.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm Jordan Maxwell, and
thank you for watching.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:20.672 align:middle line:90%
