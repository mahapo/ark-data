the cutting edge of new thought

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.830 align:middle line:90%
for over half a century.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.700 align:middle line:84%
This is "Secret
Life of Symbols."

>> We think that we are getting
better each day and we have

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.230 align:middle line:10%
come from a more
primitive society.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.750 align:middle line:10%
But we are getting
better every day

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.380 align:middle line:10%
and becoming more superior
in knowledge and technology.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, in point
of fact, we are digressing.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.070 align:middle line:84%
We are moving away from what
we were thousands and thousands

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.750 align:middle line:90%
of years ago.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And I am of the opinion that our
history has been vastly changed

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and so that we don't really
know the history of mankind

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.020 align:middle line:90%
on this Earth.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:84%
We are finding that there
are temples on the ocean

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:84%
floor, pyramids, Machu
Picchu, Chichen Itza,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
incredible structures of
temples and knowledge,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:84%
which is displayed about the
universe, about astrology.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And the astronomical
truths about the universe.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:84%
The ancient, truly prehistoric
and ancient people,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.550 align:middle line:90%
they knew all about it.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.880 align:middle line:84%
We are trying to catch up
today to what they knew

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.060 align:middle line:90%
tens of thousands of years ago.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:84%
We are finding
everything that we

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.720 align:middle line:84%
think we know has already been
here tens of thousands of years

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.320 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:84%
There was a higher lifeforms
on this Earth than we are.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.540 align:middle line:84%
I have a vision of,
from the ancient world,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.160 align:middle line:84%
we're not what we would
refer to as humans.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
I think that they looked like
us, maybe are, in some ways,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.100 align:middle line:90%
like us.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.980 align:middle line:90%
They were far superior.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:84%
The people, whoever
they were, that

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
built the great
pyramid of Egypt had

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.020 align:middle line:84%
an extraordinarily brilliant
understanding of the Earth,

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:84%
of our solar system, of
the galaxy we are in,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
and all of the esoteric
and profoundly important

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.900 align:middle line:84%
knowledge about life
and the spirit of man

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and where we've come from
and where they're going.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it all implies that there
was a far higher civilization

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.840 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.780 align:middle line:84%
And the best science
we have today

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
are admitting that
we're just trying

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.190 align:middle line:84%
to catch up with what the
ancient peoples already knew.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
These ancient brilliant
builders and teachers,

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.370 align:middle line:90%
they didn't grow into that.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.910 align:middle line:90%
They came in fully developed.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
When you look at Egypt,
Egypt as a classic example,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.140 align:middle line:84%
if you go to the very beginnings
of Egypt, it was already--

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
it came in as an extraordinarily
brilliant society of builders

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:84%
and knowledge and
then, eventually,

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.410 align:middle line:84%
devolved into what
Egypt is today.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
But there was a time when
Egypt was in its prime

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.310 align:middle line:90%
when it was founded.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So it didn't kind of
work up to, as we say,

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
we're working up to some
kind of a wonderful future.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:90%
But Egypt didn't do that.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.900 align:middle line:90%
It came in at its pinnacle.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.340 align:middle line:90%
How is that possible?

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:84%
The only way it's
possible is because when,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:84%
whoever this was that we
call the ancient Egyptians,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
they were not of this
world to start with.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.700 align:middle line:84%
They came here knowing
all that we still

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.500 align:middle line:90%
are trying to find now.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:84%
So it implies that they
were not from here.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:84%
They came in fully understanding
the whole universe.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.459 align:middle line:84%
And they were able to do
things with their temples

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and with the way that they
laid out the pyramids.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:90%
They knew things we didn't know.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.990 align:middle line:90%
And we still don't know.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.720 align:middle line:90%
And we're still trying today.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.770 align:middle line:84%
In metaphysics, in
occultism, religion,

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to find the bottom
line that the ancient peoples,

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:90%
they already knew.

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.330 align:middle line:84%
There is obviously a high
science behind the life period.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.830 align:middle line:10%
And all of the best of
the best in our human life

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.630 align:middle line:10%
like astrology and alchemy and
all of the other, what I call,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.464 align:middle line:10%
sciences.

00:04:57.464 --> 00:04:59.630 align:middle line:10%
Others would say, no, they're
just a belief systems.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.260 align:middle line:10%
No, they're sciences because,
when you really look into them,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.620 align:middle line:10%
you begin to see that they
are telling you things

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:10%
that scientists are just
now beginning to realize.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
There's a higher
occult or hidden.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.450 align:middle line:84%
The word occult
simply means hidden.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.540 align:middle line:10%
And so there is obviously
a higher science

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.530 align:middle line:10%
or occult science
behind mankind's ability

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.050 align:middle line:10%
to contemplate the spiritual
aspects of life on the earth.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Lots of ancient people
already knew what

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:90%
we're trying to find out today.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:84%
We know that the pyramids, say,
in Mexico, in Central and South

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.160 align:middle line:84%
America, along with the great
temples around the world,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.080 align:middle line:90%
was Solar temples.

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.960 align:middle line:84%
They were the center
for astronomy.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.060 align:middle line:84%
And so the ancient
peoples were not

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:84%
looking for spiritual
answers as such.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:84%
They were looking at
the actual universe

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.310 align:middle line:84%
and trying to figure out where
we are, what we're doing,

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:06.930 align:middle line:90%
and what is the universe.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.660 align:middle line:10%
And so from that inquiry into
the actual setup of the way

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:10%
the universe operates.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Then, from there,
they began to suspect

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.450 align:middle line:84%
that there was some kind of
an unwritten powerful laws

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.590 align:middle line:84%
in the universe that guided
the sun, the moon, the planets,

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:90%
and the holy--

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:90%
of the solar system.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.170 align:middle line:84%
They start off
scientifically just

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.820 align:middle line:84%
looking for answers to what
we're doing here, what is this.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.640 align:middle line:84%
And from there, they
began to develop

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.020 align:middle line:90%
religions or philosophies.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy, astrology,
medicine, and then

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:90%
human interrelationships--

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:84%
and then, from there,
you'll get into all

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:90%
the other metaphysical pursuits.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's why today the world
is half scientific and yet half

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.950 align:middle line:90%
spiritual.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.560 align:middle line:84%
But the spirituality
did not come first, just

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.470 align:middle line:84%
the regular interest
in how the world works.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.530 align:middle line:84%
That's what the ancient peoples
built those great observatories

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:15.330 align:middle line:90%
for.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.740 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted to
study the heavens.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.650 align:middle line:84%
But in doing so, it didn't take
long until around the world

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.430 align:middle line:84%
mankind, that was dealing
the heavens for science,

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.250 align:middle line:84%
began to suspect that there was
something else going on here.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And now comes the
world of spirituality.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Though, as I said, the world
occult simply means hidden.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.190 align:middle line:84%
So there are many
hidden sciences

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:44.160 align:middle line:84%
that the really bright
people who are looking

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:90%
into these things know about.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.290 align:middle line:84%
But, generally speaking,
the world of mankind

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.980 align:middle line:84%
is not really
well-informed about alchemy

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and about the sciences
of spirituality.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.660 align:middle line:90%
But that's growing now, too.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.910 align:middle line:84%
So people are beginning to wake
up to the spiritual relevance

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:07.050 align:middle line:84%
to your life of
spiritual subject.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.990 align:middle line:10%
I think that there
is something there

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:10%
that needs to be looked at,
this whole idea of where

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:10%
man has come from,
where he is right now,

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.280 align:middle line:10%
and, ultimately, where is he
going to go with his knowledge

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.830 align:middle line:10%
and with his life
and experiences.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:29.610 align:middle line:84%
What is the reason why
we're having the experiences

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.850 align:middle line:84%
that each of us
do have each day?

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.620 align:middle line:10%
We're all growing.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.400 align:middle line:10%
And hopefully, we are
growing far more intelligent

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:10%
and insightful and looking
at the spiritual aspects

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:10%
of our life.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.490 align:middle line:84%
That's a very important
feature of being

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:84%
alive, is to not just live
for the material world today.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Let's start asking serious
questions about where were you

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:90%
before you were born?

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And where will you be after
you leave here, this Earth?

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And what is the reason
for our human life?

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:10%
And why are we learning so many
a hard lessons the hard way?

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.360 align:middle line:84%
There seems to be some
sort of an overshadowing

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:84%
presence in the
universe that men

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:26.020 align:middle line:84%
have called God or some sort of
an ultimate spiritual presence

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
that is leading or
directing our evolution.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.860 align:middle line:84%
And if that be the case, which
it seems to be there, then

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
maybe there is some hope
yet for the human race.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.760 align:middle line:84%
If enough people begin to
wake up, spiritually speaking,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and begin to look at
their lives spiritually,

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:84%
then there might
be hope for us yet.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Because this is why
we are in the shape

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.680 align:middle line:84%
we are in today because we are
living in this me generation.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And this generation
that only cares

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.520 align:middle line:84%
about feeding itself and
taking care of itself

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and enjoying itself,
never realizing you

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:84%
have responsibilities
to the world

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.240 align:middle line:84%
that you live in and
to help your fellow man

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.670 align:middle line:84%
to grow and to help
educate other people.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:84%
I can speak for
myself in relation

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to the idea of why do we seek
wisdom and spiritual knowledge.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:30.670 align:middle line:84%
I have always understood that
I have questions within myself

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.020 align:middle line:90%
that others can answer.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And for me, looking
at these questions,

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.260 align:middle line:90%
they make a lot of sense to me.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Why this, and why that,
and why does this happen.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.760 align:middle line:84%
So I have learned
that to think deeply

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:84%
on these spiritual
questions of life

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:52.900 align:middle line:84%
opened me up to a whole
world of knowledge

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.210 align:middle line:84%
because I realize how
much I don't know.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And I am also well aware of
the spiritual implications

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:middle line:84%
of the laws in the
universe around us.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.280 align:middle line:84%
There are certain things you can
do in this world and things you

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.660 align:middle line:90%
cannot do.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.800 align:middle line:90%
And you will pay.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:11.830 align:middle line:84%
You will pay a terrible
price for doing the things

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:13.030 align:middle line:90%
you are not supposed to do.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:19.420 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And I am totally
convinced that there

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.320 align:middle line:84%
is some sort of an overshadowing
force in the world that

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.460 align:middle line:90%
wants us to grow.

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And this concept is
even in Christianity

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.690 align:middle line:84%
where you hear talk
about good angels

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and bad demons and
bad angels, implying

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:84%
that there are good forces,
unseen forces, out there

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.450 align:middle line:90%
and then there are bad.

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And we know that there is
something called good and bad.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And there are certain
things in all society, which

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.240 align:middle line:90%
are known to be bad and evil.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:84%
I tend to think that
there is something

00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.140 align:middle line:90%
to this idea of reincarnation.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.140 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why is
because it is pretty much

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:07.010 align:middle line:84%
agreed upon by so many
of the ancient religions

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and philosophers and great
teachers of the world.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.060 align:middle line:10%
My gut feeling is
that we do come

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:10%
into this world with baggage
from our other lifetimes.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.270 align:middle line:84%
And this is why we begin
to become who we are

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:90%
because of who we were before.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:84%
Another part of that
story is that we

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.740 align:middle line:84%
came in incarnated
on this Earth that we

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:84%
chose a particular lifestyle
we're told and given

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.870 align:middle line:84%
to understand and that we
chose our own parents before we

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.120 align:middle line:90%
came here.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.710 align:middle line:84%
I understand the spirit
world enough to know

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:49.670 align:middle line:90%
that it's very possible.

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And we were in a
spiritual state,

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.240 align:middle line:84%
and then we incarnated
into a physical state.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, the rest of it
is up for speculation.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.320 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I am totally
convinced that there

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:84%
are very legitimate
and real, I choose

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.660 align:middle line:84%
to call it, other worldly
forces, spirit forces,

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.600 align:middle line:90%
demonic forces.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Of that, there is no doubt
in my mind about because I've

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:84%
had too many personal
experiences that

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.560 align:middle line:84%
tells me and proves to me
that somebody is watching us.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Somebody is watching
the human family.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:33.020 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:38.020 align:middle line:84%
The very history of
how America was founded

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and the founding
fathers, so to speak,

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:46.150 align:middle line:84%
what vision they had when they
were putting together the idea

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.990 align:middle line:90%
to found this country.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:49.390 align:middle line:90%
What was their vision?

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.690 align:middle line:90%
What were they thinking?

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And what were they
actually working toward?

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And now that gets into
the subject of Freemasonry

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:84%
to the secret sciences
like alchemy and political.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.170 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of political
stuff in there, too.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.290 align:middle line:84%
You have to be careful
about secret societies

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:13.540 align:middle line:84%
because these different
societies become

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:90%
very powerful and very wealthy.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:17.990 align:middle line:90%
But they have an agenda.

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:20.350 align:middle line:84%
They have a particular
agenda that they're

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:84%
trying to create or
to bring into being.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they will build
the whole world around you.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:90%
And you accept what--

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.630 align:middle line:84%
when you're a child or a
baby, you come into the world,

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.760 align:middle line:90%
and you just accept everything.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't grow
up, as a grown person,

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.460 align:middle line:84%
you just accept
whatever there is

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.880 align:middle line:84%
and because that's
the way it is.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.000 align:middle line:90%
But that's not the way it is.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.640 align:middle line:84%
And you keep in mind that there
were secret societies that

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:52.560 align:middle line:84%
were involved in founding
this country and who were they

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.070 align:middle line:90%
and what were they trying to do.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:59.380 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.340 align:middle line:10%
You have to know
secret societies

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:10%
to understand why there are
so many different symbols

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.720 align:middle line:10%
and emblems in Washington,
DC, and around the world.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.290 align:middle line:84%
Because there's different
groups, societies,

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.350 align:middle line:84%
that are working
towards certain agenda.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And they are putting symbols
out that represent their agenda.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.560 align:middle line:84%
We know that, even
in gangs, when

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.370 align:middle line:84%
you drive to neighborhoods
like Los Angeles,

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and there are scribblings
on the walls of gangs.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:90%
The symbols mean something.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you're in a gang, you
know what those symbols mean.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.960 align:middle line:90%
They're telling you something.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.530 align:middle line:84%
Whoever is controlling that
area, that's their symbol.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole
study that you

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.510 align:middle line:84%
need to get into, studying
the occult symbols of power

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:46.840 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:10%
They're used as a means to
communicate and to influence

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:56.250 align:middle line:10%
you or to connect you
with the spiritual world

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:10%
that they represent.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
a religious symbol.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.980 align:middle line:84%
And that is an
ancient Phoenician god

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:07.020 align:middle line:84%
that was very important
in the Middle East

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:10.140 align:middle line:90%
some 5,000 years ago.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:15.060 align:middle line:84%
That God was called
Dagon, D-A-G-O-N.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.210 align:middle line:90%
Dagon was a fish god.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Interesting how he has evolved
into today's world of religion.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.840 align:middle line:10%
Dagon is still very much
alive with the world today.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:10%
First of all, everyone knows
that Christianity is founded

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:37.080 align:middle line:10%
on the worship of Jesus Christ.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.770 align:middle line:10%
That is accepted
around the world.

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:10%
And most people believe
that the Vatican

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:49.390 align:middle line:10%
is the Center for the worship of
Jesus, the god of Christianity.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:84%
However, millions of people also
believe that the pope of Rome

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:59.910 align:middle line:84%
is leading the
Christians to worship

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Jesus throughout the world.

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.635 align:middle line:10%
But my question is, who is the
pope leading the worship of?

00:17:07.635 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:10%


00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.890 align:middle line:10%
The first symbol that
I want to talk about

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:19.260 align:middle line:10%
is the head dress that the pope,
or the Bishop of Rome, wears.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:10%
That headdress is
very interesting

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.869 align:middle line:10%
and has quite a history to it.

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:29.430 align:middle line:84%
That pope's headdress is
called a pope's mitre.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
The pope's mitre, we've seen
it in many different shapes.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.280 align:middle line:10%
But they're always
basically the same shape.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.570 align:middle line:10%
The pope's mitre is an official
headdress worn only by the pope

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:43.230 align:middle line:10%
or supposedly only by the pope.

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:46.560 align:middle line:84%
But we need to understand
that that symbol goes

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:90%
back at least 5,000 years.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.900 align:middle line:84%
So what we need to know and
what we need to keep in mind

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.990 align:middle line:84%
is that this strange and
interesting headdress

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:06.400 align:middle line:84%
of hat that the pope wears is
impacted by a god name Dagon.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Dagon was a god of
the Palestinians.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:13.160 align:middle line:10%
And Dagon comes from the
word dag, which means fish.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.650 align:middle line:10%
So Dagon was a fish god.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:10%
And here we have pictures of
another fish god named Anis,

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:24.020 align:middle line:10%
the same God but was worshipped
in different countries

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.025 align:middle line:10%
under different names.

00:18:25.025 --> 00:18:27.590 align:middle line:10%


00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:31.580 align:middle line:10%
So we have a god who is
half fish and half man

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:10%
or men who wear
the garbs of a fish

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.670 align:middle line:10%
in their religious celebrations.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:41.060 align:middle line:10%
So here, in the
Jewish encyclopedia,

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.190 align:middle line:10%
under the heading
of Dagon, you will

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:10%
see a picture of the priest
of Dagon or the god himself.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.840 align:middle line:10%
And he is wearing a fish
head and the body of a fish

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.630 align:middle line:10%
down his back.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So now we see the
pope's headdress.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.300 align:middle line:90%
On the top is the pope's mitre.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:10%
Well, when in turn, you then
see he's actually wearing a fish

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:10%
head, the fish god
Dagon, Because he's

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:12.920 align:middle line:10%
representing the worship of
an ancient Phoenician god.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is why today, Christians
on the back of their cars, you

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:90%
will see have a fish symbol.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking that's to denote
them as Christians worshipping

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:24.410 align:middle line:90%
Jesus.

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:30.470 align:middle line:84%
No, it's a fish symbol because
it's Dagon the fish god.

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:10%
The significance is Dagon was
a very important mystical god

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.420 align:middle line:10%
to the ancient peoples in the
Middle East in Babylonian,

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.312 align:middle line:10%
Sumerian, and Canaan.

00:19:41.312 --> 00:19:43.910 align:middle line:84%
And that very
powerful mystical god

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:84%
is still dominating the spirit
and the intellectual thinking

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.800 align:middle line:90%
of religion even to today.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So it's not Jesus
that's influencing

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:90%
the Vatican and the pope.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.670 align:middle line:90%
It's Dagon the fish god.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.320 align:middle line:90%
That's the importance of this.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.700 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.420 align:middle line:84%
The point being is that
religion comes to the world

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.130 align:middle line:90%
in the age of Pisces.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:13.370 align:middle line:10%
And Pisces is, of
course, the two fish

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:15.830 align:middle line:10%
of the constellation of Pisces.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:10%
But Dagon is 5,000 years old.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Another one of
the symbols I find

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:84%
to be very interesting
that's used quite

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:84%
often around the world
today but a lot of people

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.680 align:middle line:84%
don't know how it's connected
to the religions of today,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.050 align:middle line:90%
and that is a magic wand.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:43.350 align:middle line:84%
Magic wands we've heard in
stories galore from children

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:48.890 align:middle line:84%
from childhood days about
magicians who use a magic wand.

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, the magic wand is
just what it says it is.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.670 align:middle line:10%
It's some sort of a
branch of a tree that

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.930 align:middle line:10%
has been consecrated and
made holy by blessings

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:02.390 align:middle line:10%
from the priest.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:04.940 align:middle line:10%
And now, it has
a magical quality

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:09.230 align:middle line:10%
that can do things that
other humans can't do.

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:14.930 align:middle line:10%
The druid priest, they use
the wood of a holly tree.

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:17.544 align:middle line:90%
They use holly wood.

00:21:17.544 --> 00:21:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's where we
get the term today--

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Hollywood in the
magic of holly wood.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.120 align:middle line:90%
Today, we have Hollywood.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:84%
We have Mickey Mouse
waving a magic wand.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.650 align:middle line:10%
On the left side, we also
have actual real magic wands

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:10%
as they are made
today in Europe.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And of course, orchestra leaders
and orchestra conductors,

00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:44.969 align:middle line:84%
they lead the music
with a magic wand.

00:21:44.969 --> 00:21:46.760 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people haven't
thought about that.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.580 align:middle line:84%
But that's what it
is, a magic wand.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a
picture of Moses

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:56.510 align:middle line:84%
where he is conjuring up
the spirits and the universe

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:90%
with a magic wand.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:01.940 align:middle line:84%
That's very interesting,
Moses with a magic wand.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.800 align:middle line:10%
In the ancient Roman Empire,
the most important god

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.140 align:middle line:10%
at the height of Rome's
power in the world

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.770 align:middle line:10%
was a god named Mithra.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.130 align:middle line:10%
Mithra was a sun god.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.600 align:middle line:10%
And according to the Roman
explanation of their god,

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:10%
he was not only a sun god.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:24.410 align:middle line:84%
But he did his miracles
with a magic wand.

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:28.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, here we have Jesus
raising Lazarus from the tomb.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And you will see that Jesus
is using a magic wand.

00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:36.080 align:middle line:84%
How many Christians know
that, all throughout Europe

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and around the world, Christian
churches have Jesus working

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.970 align:middle line:90%
his miracles with magic wands?

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.090 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people don't know that.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So we hear all about
the magical things

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.480 align:middle line:90%
that Jesus was able to do.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.320 align:middle line:84%
But here in the
actual churches, we

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.580 align:middle line:84%
seen that Jesus is doing his
miracles with a magic wand.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:90%


00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:01.670 align:middle line:10%
The importance of
this is to point out

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:06.620 align:middle line:10%
that people do not realize
that, in Christianity,

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:11.120 align:middle line:10%
the understanding in the ancient
world and in the medieval world

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.970 align:middle line:10%
was that these religious
figures like Jesus

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:19.940 align:middle line:10%
were doing there their
miracles with magic wands.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:25.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's actually legitimate,
[INAUDIBLE] real magical system

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.480 align:middle line:84%
of controlling people's
minds and directing

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.020 align:middle line:84%
their spirits and
their hearts and being

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:37.580 align:middle line:84%
able to direct our civilization
through magical symbols

00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:90%
and magical words.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.990 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:45.430 align:middle line:10%
Another symbol that I find
to be very interesting

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:49.360 align:middle line:10%
is, in Star Trek,
there was a Mr. Spock.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.280 align:middle line:10%
And if you'll
remember, Mr. Spock

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.680 align:middle line:10%
was always giving a hand sign.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.650 align:middle line:10%
And he was said to be a Vulcan.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:24:01.660 align:middle line:84%
First of all, his hand sign
was actually a religious symbol

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:04.120 align:middle line:90%
in Judaism and wish.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:08.890 align:middle line:84%
It was a blessing to the
congregation in Judaism.

00:24:08.890 --> 00:24:11.960 align:middle line:10%
it's called the Cohen symbol.

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.760 align:middle line:10%
This symbol is a Jewish
blessings symbol.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.590 align:middle line:10%
But where did it come from?

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:22.210 align:middle line:10%
It comes from the
split half hoof a goat.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.180 align:middle line:84%
It goes back to the
split hoof of a goat

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:28.780 align:middle line:84%
because we're talking about
the age of Ares, the Ram,

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.100 align:middle line:84%
when the Jews were under the age
of the Ram, the Ram or the Lamb

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:90%
of God.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.130 align:middle line:10%
And so that's why today we
call Jesus the Lamb of God,

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:10%
going back to the
Constellation of Ares the Ram.

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:10%
Nimoy even said that
he accepted that sign

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.300 align:middle line:10%
and used it because it
was a sign from his rabbi.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.700 align:middle line:84%
And he thought it was a
very interesting symbol.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.070 align:middle line:90%
So he just used it in Star Trek.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:01.060 align:middle line:10%
I'm sure he probably knew
the meaning of the sign.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:02.830 align:middle line:10%
But that's where he
said he got it from.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.910 align:middle line:90%


00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:09.390 align:middle line:10%
Another subject which is
interesting and very relevant

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:13.160 align:middle line:10%
today is a symbol called
fasces or the fasces.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.250 align:middle line:90%


00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:18.480 align:middle line:10%
On the back of an
American dime, you

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.930 align:middle line:10%
will see a bundle of
sticks tied together.

00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:90%
And it has an axe head with it.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.990 align:middle line:90%
That is called a fasces.

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.930 align:middle line:10%
And this is an ancient
Etruscan symbol

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.050 align:middle line:10%
that was adopted
by the Roman Empire

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.540 align:middle line:10%
to symbolize Rome's power.

00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.670 align:middle line:84%
It's an old ancient
Etruscan symbol,

00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
but it's very important
to the Roman Empire.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:47.790 align:middle line:84%
Ancient Rome's philosophy was,
if there's just one stick,

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:84%
you can beat somebody
with a stick.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:51.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going
to hurt him really.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you've got
two or three sticks,

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.420 align:middle line:84%
now is going to be a
little bit heavy a deal.

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you get five or
six sticks and tie them

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.350 align:middle line:84%
together as one, now you've
got serious strength now.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you beat
somebody with six or eight

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
sticks tied together,
that's serious.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.720 align:middle line:84%
And so then they put
a hatchet head on it

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.420 align:middle line:84%
because an axe head always
represented-- in almost all

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:21.720 align:middle line:84%
the ancient cultures
of the world, accepted

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:84%
that the axe head represented
the presence of God.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.990 align:middle line:90%
God was the great hatchet.

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:29.820 align:middle line:90%
He's giving you the axe.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And so the hatchet
head represented God.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And the bundle of sticks
represented a coalition

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:90%
of troops.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:42.662 align:middle line:84%
So when Rome would go to
another country to overtake it,

00:26:42.662 --> 00:26:44.870 align:middle line:84%
they would take the troops
from this group and troops

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:46.900 align:middle line:84%
in that group and put
them all together.

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've got a strong
force of not just Romans.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.070 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of other
countries are with you.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
we hear today.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.540 align:middle line:84%
When we hear the presidents
talking about doing the Middle

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:03.510 align:middle line:84%
East, they have a coalition of
countries, not just America.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:middle line:90%
We have other countries with us.

00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a coalition.

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:10.030 align:middle line:84%
Coalition is another
name for fasces,

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.460 align:middle line:84%
which is a symbol for
world fascism, where

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:17.550 align:middle line:84%
you can get all the countries
together and have them all

00:27:17.550 --> 00:27:21.330 align:middle line:84%
doing the same thing, all
of the countries marching

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:22.500 align:middle line:90%
to the same tune.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got a
strong military force.

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:27.290 align:middle line:90%


00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:31.260 align:middle line:10%
And the fasces was
usually carried officially

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.370 align:middle line:10%
behind Caesar.

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.000 align:middle line:10%
He would be in the front
of the parade or whatever.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.990 align:middle line:10%
And there would be what is
called lictors behind him.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:10%
They would be
holding the fasces,

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.820 align:middle line:10%
symbolizing Caesar's
power over life and death.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.850 align:middle line:10%
He is the man.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:48.690 align:middle line:10%
He is the boss.

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.790 align:middle line:10%
And so the lictors
would be standing

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:53.970 align:middle line:10%
on both sides of Caesar
on the altars when Caesar

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:57.910 align:middle line:10%
was speaking,
holding those fasces

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:02.100 align:middle line:10%
so that the Roman
people know he has

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.140 align:middle line:10%
the right to life and death.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:09.240 align:middle line:84%
So here, you'll see in
World War II with Mussolini

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:13.090 align:middle line:84%
on the left and his symbol
for his government, a fasces.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, of course.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.280 align:middle line:90%
He's Italian.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.880 align:middle line:10%
That goes back to
the Roman Empire.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And so here we have
Nazi, as you'll see.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.350 align:middle line:84%
The swastika, and
then the Nazi eagle

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:29.160 align:middle line:84%
like the American
bald eagle, but you'll

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.140 align:middle line:84%
see the two fasces on
each side of the swastika.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.890 align:middle line:10%
This is because Germany
was in league with Italy

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.720 align:middle line:10%
during the Second World War.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.050 align:middle line:10%
Mussolini had in mind
to do the same thing

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:48.840 align:middle line:10%
Adolf Hitler wanted to do, was
to create a new world order.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And so Mussolini saw that new
world order as being Catholic,

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.760 align:middle line:84%
as to be Roman,
while Germany saw it

00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:01.340 align:middle line:90%
to be German and not Italian.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
But the two together,
I suppose, they

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.010 align:middle line:84%
figure they'll work that out
once they take over the world.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:10.740 align:middle line:10%
Well, Mussolini, according
to history books,

00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:13.500 align:middle line:10%
actually thought of
himself as Caesar.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.530 align:middle line:84%
He saw himself in
his position of power

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:18.120 align:middle line:84%
at the time of the
Second World War

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.140 align:middle line:84%
as Caesar of the
ancient Roman Empire.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.860 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it
would be right that he

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.860 align:middle line:84%
would pick the symbol that
Caesar used to show his power.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why the fasces
became so fashionable in Italy.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:38.850 align:middle line:84%
But the two fasces you will also
see on the wall behind where

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.700 align:middle line:84%
the Speaker of the House sits
when the President's making

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.880 align:middle line:90%
a speech.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:50.160 align:middle line:84%
The United States has the secret
societies in their government.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:55.410 align:middle line:10%
And behind the government are
very powerful secret societies

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.760 align:middle line:10%
that see itself, these
societies see themselves,

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:07.430 align:middle line:10%
as the promoters and to
generate a new world order.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.550 align:middle line:90%
All countries copy each other.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:14.200 align:middle line:90%
The fascist copy the Etruscans.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.270 align:middle line:90%
The Romans copied the Greeks.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And the Greeks
copied the Egyptians.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And that's just
the way humans are.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:26.300 align:middle line:84%
As much as we change, the
more we stay the same.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.570 align:middle line:84%
We're all still adopting
the same symbols

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.210 align:middle line:84%
that we adopted under
the Egyptian empire.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.920 align:middle line:84%
We're still using
those symbols today.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.460 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids-- let's talk
about the pyramid.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And we all recognize
that there's

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.270 align:middle line:84%
three beautiful pyramids
on what is called

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:47.080 align:middle line:90%
the Giza Plateau in Egypt.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.040 align:middle line:10%
But my question is, there
is only one of the three

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.150 align:middle line:10%
of those pyramids as referred
to as the Great Pyramid.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:58.240 align:middle line:10%
First of all, you need to know
that the pyramid is directly

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.500 align:middle line:10%
behind the Sphinx is
not the Great Pyramid.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:06.220 align:middle line:90%
It is a Great Pyramid in Egypt.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.220 align:middle line:90%
But it is not the Great Pyramid.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:14.030 align:middle line:10%
This is the Great
Pyramid of Egypt.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:19.150 align:middle line:10%
How many sides does
the Great Pyramid have?

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, you would think
if there's four sides

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.220 align:middle line:84%
and then there's the
bottom as a side.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.920 align:middle line:84%
So it would be
five-sided pyramid.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.070 align:middle line:10%
But actually, in point of
fact, no, the Great Pyramid

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.950 align:middle line:10%
has nine sides.

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:33.790 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:37.930 align:middle line:10%
Because on the first day of
the spring equinox or the fall

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.530 align:middle line:10%
equinox, if you are in the
right place at the right moment

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:43.270 align:middle line:10%
when the sun hits
the pyramid, you

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:47.110 align:middle line:10%
will see that each side is
divided down the middle.

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:50.170 align:middle line:10%
But so subtle that when you
are there at the pyramid,

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.850 align:middle line:10%
you don't notice it.

00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But on the first day
of spring and autumn,

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:59.780 align:middle line:84%
you will see the Great Pyramid
is divided down the middle.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.930 align:middle line:10%
And so here, again,
is another picture

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.990 align:middle line:10%
of the pyramid from
above on that special day

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.460 align:middle line:10%
in that special hour when the
sun's hitting it just right.

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.280 align:middle line:10%
And so each side has two sides.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:16.030 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, you've
got not four sides

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.510 align:middle line:10%
but eight plus the
bottom side makes nine.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:23.350 align:middle line:10%
So how many people know that
the Great Pyramid of Egypt

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.010 align:middle line:10%
has nine sides?

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:10%
It's strange.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:30.550 align:middle line:10%
But it seems that no one really
knows why the Egyptians took

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:34.480 align:middle line:10%
so much effort to divide
each side of the pyramid so

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:38.200 align:middle line:10%
perfectly and so
brilliantly and such

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.960 align:middle line:10%
that you would not see
it until a particular day

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:10%
at a particular time.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:46.110 align:middle line:84%
We call it the Great
Pyramid because there

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:52.030 align:middle line:84%
is a lot of important stuff
implied in that pyramid.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And the other pyramids
do not even come close.

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:58.390 align:middle line:84%
They don't have anything like
what's in that Great Pyramid.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:01.540 align:middle line:90%
That is one act by itself.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the only one.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we today
call it the Great Pyramid.

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:09.880 align:middle line:84%
The next subject we'd like
to look out for a moment

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:14.140 align:middle line:84%
is the cornerstone in
the Christian religion.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.260 align:middle line:10%
Christians will tell you
that the church, that

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.650 align:middle line:10%
in the Church of
Christianity, Jesus

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:27.670 align:middle line:10%
is referred to as the
cornerstone of the church.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:30.340 align:middle line:90%
But that's not exactly correct.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The actual scripture says that
he is not the cornerstone.

00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:38.310 align:middle line:10%
It says Jesus is the
chief cornerstone.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:41.170 align:middle line:84%
The cornerstone is what it's
said to be, just a stone

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:42.470 align:middle line:90%
at the corner of a building.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.370 align:middle line:84%
But wherever you set
that cornerstone up,

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:48.130 align:middle line:84%
you're going to lie in all
the other stones up with it.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:51.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's the first one that
decides where this building is

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:53.110 align:middle line:90%
going to be aiming.

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:57.210 align:middle line:84%
And so Jesus Christ,
the cornerstone.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:84%
But Jesus is actually referred
to as the chief cornerstone.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.370 align:middle line:10%
And that's important
because there's

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.630 align:middle line:10%
a totally different
understanding of the word chief

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:08.920 align:middle line:10%
cornerstone.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Chief cornerstone
means the triangle

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:15.340 align:middle line:90%
placed on top of a pyramid.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:19.210 align:middle line:84%
If you take a perfect,
flawless pyramid triangle,

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:23.650 align:middle line:84%
and you cut off the top,
it itself is a pyramid.

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:27.550 align:middle line:84%
But it is a tiny one that
sits on top of the big one.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:31.300 align:middle line:84%
That tiny little pyramid
is called a pyramidion.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:10%
A pyramidion is a
tiny pyramid sitting

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.330 align:middle line:10%
on top of the big pyramid.

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:10%
That's what the
Bible said Jesus is.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.110 align:middle line:90%
He is pyramidion.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.760 align:middle line:90%
He's not a cornerstone.

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:48.130 align:middle line:84%
He is a chief cornerstone, which
is on the top of a pyramid.

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:51.100 align:middle line:84%
That was the genius of
the ancient Egyptians.

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.770 align:middle line:90%


00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And so today, the
more we have changed,

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.040 align:middle line:90%
the more we stay the same.

00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we use the same
symbols that Caesar used.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:05.810 align:middle line:84%
We use the same symbols
that the Babylonian used.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:10.100 align:middle line:84%
That's because
mankind is hard wired,

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:14.150 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, to realize
the importance of very

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:17.540 align:middle line:84%
powerful symbols that
represent your civilization

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.970 align:middle line:84%
and who you are and
where you come from

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:21.880 align:middle line:90%
and what your destiny is.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.350 align:middle line:84%
It's everywhere from
religion to governments

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:29.030 align:middle line:90%
to military, commerce, banking.

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Symbols are a way to
communicate with the world.

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:35.870 align:middle line:90%


00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:37.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jordan Maxwell.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.250 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for watching.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:44.768 align:middle line:90%
