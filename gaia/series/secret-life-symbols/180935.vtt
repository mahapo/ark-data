00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>> This is "Secret
Life of Symbols."

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:21.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So much of the world today
is ill informed about symbols

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.180 align:middle line:90%
and signs.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:90%
That's what I do.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.840 align:middle line:10%
I try and help
people to understand

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.000 align:middle line:10%
the symbolism, the signs, the
hidden indicators of where

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.360 align:middle line:10%
we are in the period of
time, and where we're going,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:10%
and what's coming, because
actually today there

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:10%
is so much violence and
hatred among peoples

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:10%
and different groups,
because no one seems

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:10%
to understand we are all
one people on the Earth.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:10%
And we all have one history
of the Earth and the times

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.950 align:middle line:10%
in which we're living.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.300 align:middle line:10%
And so we need to realize that
all the different religions are

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:10%
basically telling
us certain things

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.830 align:middle line:10%
about the ordinances of heaven.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I think it will help
the world and where

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.610 align:middle line:84%
we're going if we all start
looking at symbols and emblems

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and educating ourselves
to what these things mean.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.090 align:middle line:90%
In Job 38:33, where it says--

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.520 align:middle line:84%
God is saying to
Job, can you bind

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.750 align:middle line:90%
the chains of the Pleiades?

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.730 align:middle line:84%
The Pleiades is one of the
constellations in the heavens.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And so here, God
is saying, can you

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:90%
bind the chains of the Pleiades?

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you lean toward
the constellations

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.060 align:middle line:90%
and their seasons?

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And then it says in 33, "do you
know the ordinances of heaven?"

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
The ordinances simply means
a decree or law or directive.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.650 align:middle line:90%
It's the law, to understand.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.640 align:middle line:84%
So God is asking Job, do
you understand the laws

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:90%
that govern the heavens?

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.320 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking the same
question today.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.730 align:middle line:84%
First of all, in order to
know the ordinances of heaven,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.910 align:middle line:84%
you must know the most
important part or feature

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:90%
of the laws of heaven.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.980 align:middle line:84%
The word in the
Bible is Mazzaroth,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:90%
the ordinances of heaven.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.850 align:middle line:84%
If you go to Job 38:32, you
will see the word Mazzaroth.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.870 align:middle line:10%
And in the footnotes, it
says the signs of the zodiac.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Now a lot of people think
that the zodiac should not

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.470 align:middle line:84%
be connected to Christianity
or the Bible at all.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.930 align:middle line:10%
Actually, in point
of fact, the zodiac

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:10%
is the basis for both the
Old and New Testaments.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:10%
When you consult
Bible references,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.110 align:middle line:10%
like the Bible dictionaries
and encyclopedias,

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.700 align:middle line:10%
if you look up the
word Mazzaroth,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.770 align:middle line:10%
it will tell you it's the
12 signs of the zodiac.

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.810 align:middle line:10%
We are given to
understand in the Bible

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.220 align:middle line:10%
that God created the zodiac.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And that may sound
strange to a lot of people

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
because most people think
of the zodiac as something

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.620 align:middle line:84%
evil, especially
in Christianity.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But, no, the zodiac is the basis
for much of our learning today,

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.460 align:middle line:84%
much of our symbolism
today, especially

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.430 align:middle line:90%
in religion and politics.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even the watch you
wear is 12 signs of the zodiac,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:84%
or the 12 signs
that go in a circle.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the word
zodiac means, the 12 signs.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.830 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the Kingdom
of God all the time,

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.750 align:middle line:84%
but most people don't realize
what the kingdom really is.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.750 align:middle line:84%
We humans put
different life forms

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.160 align:middle line:90%
into different categories.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.980 align:middle line:84%
We say fish are in schools,
and cattle are in herds.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
What kind of life forms do we
humans say are in a kingdom

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.700 align:middle line:90%
if it isn't animals?

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:90%
Animal kingdom.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.880 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks came up with
the idea that the zodiac

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.350 align:middle line:84%
was a kingdom of animals
that circle the earth.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.899 align:middle line:84%
And so when we say
in our prayers,

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.990 align:middle line:84%
even in the Roman
system that gave us

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot of our understanding
of the zodiac today,

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.200 align:middle line:84%
we say in our
prayers, our father,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.755 align:middle line:84%
who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

00:04:31.755 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:84%
Let thy kingdom
come, and let thy

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:41.490 align:middle line:84%
will be done, on the
Earth as it is in heaven.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.230 align:middle line:84%
We are living our
lives in the zodiac.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
All cultures in
the world recognize

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.620 align:middle line:84%
that the zodiac is
important in their theology,

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.970 align:middle line:90%
in their belief systems.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.980 align:middle line:10%
And when you go to Bible
bookstores or bibles

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:10%
seminaries, go into
the large libraries.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:10%
And you will begin to
see that there are so

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:10%
many books that are written
by Christian and Jewish

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.520 align:middle line:10%
theologians and people
who study religions.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.520 align:middle line:10%
"Wycliffe Bible
Commentary" talks about

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.230 align:middle line:10%
"to qualify as a director and
judge a man's life on Earth,

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:10%
one must be able to govern
the heavenly bodies that

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.870 align:middle line:10%
rule the earth.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.540 align:middle line:10%
Note the repeated
mention of the influence

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.670 align:middle line:10%
of the atmospheric or astral
heavens on earthly affairs."

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.460 align:middle line:10%
We're talking astrology.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.600 align:middle line:10%
Here in "The New
Interpreter's Bible," it says,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:10%
"some connection between
what happens in the heavens

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:10%
and what happens on Earth is
presupposed in the question"

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:10%
that Job is being
asked by God, if he

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:10%
knows the ordinances of heaven.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Being asked that question
obviously means that God has

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.470 align:middle line:90%
a sign, ordinances in heaven.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're calling it
the zodiac, Mazzaroth.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to Genesis 1:14
while we're on this subject.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:10%
And in Genesis, the first book
of the Bible, the first page,

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:10%
says, "God said
let there be lights

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:10%
in the firmament of the
heavens to divide the day

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.030 align:middle line:10%
from the night.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:10%
And let them be for signs."

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Another Bible translation
says, "and God

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle line:84%
said let there be light
holders in the firmament

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:84%
of the heavens, to divide
the day from night.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.410 align:middle line:90%
And let them be for signs."

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.940 align:middle line:84%
The word signs means
things to come in Hebrew.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:84%
The word for signs,
the word is oth,

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.360 align:middle line:84%
O-T-H. This is a
Hebrew word which

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.680 align:middle line:84%
is translated in the Bible
as just things to come.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what the
zodiac purports to do.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.410 align:middle line:84%
It tells you about
things to come.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
All Christians are
aware that Jesus

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.950 align:middle line:84%
says to his apostles
that in my father's house

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.170 align:middle line:90%
are many mansions.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Dictators and kings
have always felt

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.870 align:middle line:84%
that there is a mansion
in heaven for them.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a misunderstanding.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
The incorrect way is to
say in my father's house

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:90%
are many mansions.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.600 align:middle line:10%
But other translations
say, in my father's house

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.730 align:middle line:10%
are many abodes.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.530 align:middle line:10%
Abodes is where you live.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.410 align:middle line:10%
Where you are is in your abode.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.050 align:middle line:10%
In my father's abode are
many dwelling places.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Oh, now we're getting to
it, because the heavens

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:90%
is where God is.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.660 align:middle line:10%
And if God is in
heaven, the scripture

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.730 align:middle line:10%
says that in my father's
abode are many houses,

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:49.230 align:middle line:10%
are many resting places for
the sun, houses of the zodiac.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.050 align:middle line:84%
Basically, it
boils down to this,

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:84%
that both the Old
and New Testament

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.620 align:middle line:90%
are based on astrology.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:04.390 align:middle line:84%
The 12 signs that the zodiac
is part of the number 12

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.850 align:middle line:90%
in Christianity.

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:10.410 align:middle line:10%
There were 12 tribes of Israel,
the 12 brothers of Joseph,

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:10%
the 12 breastplate stones
on the high priest,

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.810 align:middle line:10%
and then the 12 Apostles.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Look in the Bible, and you will
see how many times 12 is used.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.230 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on the
12 signs of the zodiac.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:28.080 align:middle line:84%
There was no 12
tribes of Israel.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.900 align:middle line:10%
Each one of those signs
in the 12 tribes of Israel

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:35.789 align:middle line:10%
was an astrological indicator as
to what each month represented

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:38.010 align:middle line:10%
in the ancient Jewish religion.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient Jewish
religion understood this.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
It's people today who
are not studying theology

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.885 align:middle line:84%
do not understand that the whole
of the Old and New Testament

00:08:47.885 --> 00:08:48.685 align:middle line:90%
is a metaphor.

00:08:48.685 --> 00:08:52.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.930 align:middle line:84%
"HarperCollins Study
Dictionary" says

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
"the Lord made the
constellations,"

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.040 align:middle line:90%
the Pleiades and Orion.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how one can
read something like this

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.840 align:middle line:84%
and not see that
the Bible is saying

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:84%
God made the constellations
of the zodiac.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:11.280 align:middle line:84%
"New International
Bible" says he, God,

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.070 align:middle line:84%
is the maker of the bear
and Orion and the Pleiades

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and the constellations
of the South.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:10%
So if you want to find
fault with astrology,

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:10%
then you'll find your fault
with the ideas and concepts

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.565 align:middle line:10%
that God has put into
the heavens as laws.

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:30.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Many philosophers have talked
about that foolish people,

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:38.090 align:middle line:84%
ignorant and foolish people,
are dominated by the zodiac.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:84%
They don't know that their
personalities and things that

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.160 align:middle line:84%
happen to them are because
of the stars and the moon

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and the influence of
these heavenly signs,

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:53.810 align:middle line:84%
but that wise people are
guided by these signs.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And so it occurred to me
that for thousands of years,

00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:84%
mankind has navigated around
the world on the high seas

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.330 align:middle line:90%
by a knowledge of the stars.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the Bible is
saying you should navigate

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.380 align:middle line:90%
your life by the stars.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:10%
Here we have a
typical publication

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:10%
in Christianity talking
about astrology as satanic.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I'm spending
so much time talking

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.710 align:middle line:84%
about the biblical
reference words,

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.220 align:middle line:84%
saying that, no, it
is created by God.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:90%
It is not satanic.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.510 align:middle line:84%
If you really are interested
in the illogical and spiritual

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:84%
subjects, especially in
relation to the Bible,

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:43.040 align:middle line:84%
you need to get "The
Companion Bible" by Kregel,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's an
astounding work where

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle line:84%
it gives one half of the
page is the scripture.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.660 align:middle line:84%
The other half of each
page are the footnotes.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And the footnotes will
actually blow you away

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.680 align:middle line:84%
because it tells you the truth
about what these symbols really

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.420 align:middle line:90%
mean and where they came from.

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.300 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.770 align:middle line:10%
In the back of the Kregel
Bible, it talks about the word

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.400 align:middle line:10%
and where it came from in
the Hebrew and what it means.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:18.110 align:middle line:10%
And it basically is saying that
it is telling you about things

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:19.820 align:middle line:10%
to come, astrology.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.340 align:middle line:10%
So here we see the four seasons,
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:10%
writing a story about
their risen savior.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.760 align:middle line:10%
And what do you see them
all four writing about?

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:44.550 align:middle line:84%
The sun, this is why
Jesus had 12 apostles.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Jesus represents God's
sun, not S-O-N, S-U-N.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is a metaphor in the
New Testament for the sun.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:90%
And he was our risen savior.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the sun
rises each morning.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:07.960 align:middle line:84%
You'll see this famous painting
where there are 12 apostles.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And to Jesus' right, there is
the first apostle to his right

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.290 align:middle line:90%
is a woman.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.160 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people do not know that
one of the 12 Apostles of Jesus

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:90%
was a woman.

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
zodialogical sign call Virgo.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.990 align:middle line:90%
Virgo was a virgin.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.390 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have to
have one woman in there,

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:90%
to represent Virgo.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.565 align:middle line:84%
The 12 Apostles are the
12 signs of the zodiac.

00:12:36.565 --> 00:12:39.910 align:middle line:90%


00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Now let's look at some of
the zodiac symbols used

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.980 align:middle line:90%
in religious history.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.900 align:middle line:84%
And we'll start with
Taurus the bull.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.760 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.510 align:middle line:84%
The age of Taurus was
the age of agriculture,

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.720 align:middle line:84%
when the cows and
animals that we were now

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.690 align:middle line:84%
beginning to use
as food, that was

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:84%
just one of the qualities
of the age of Taurus.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:10%
The age of Taurus is
between 4,400 and 2,200 BC.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.850 align:middle line:10%
And keep in mind
that Taurus the bull

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:10%
was recognized all
over the world,

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:10%
by all governments and all
religions of the world.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Everybody knew what it
meant, except us today.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.350 align:middle line:84%
So this is why you have
words like holy cow,

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.645 align:middle line:84%
and the cow is still
holy in India today.

00:13:28.645 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:10%
We see the Egyptians
worshipping the sun

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.670 align:middle line:10%
between the horns of the bull.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:46.940 align:middle line:84%
The sun is very important to
the 12 sides of the zodiac.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Most people do not realize that
Taurus being in the heavens

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.400 align:middle line:84%
as a constellational sign
was very, very important

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.080 align:middle line:90%
to Judaism.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.070 align:middle line:10%
Here is Taurus,
the cow, the bull.

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:02.340 align:middle line:10%
And he is in heaven.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:10%
You see the sun behind him.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:10%
So the sun is in the
age of Taurus, the bull.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:15.000 align:middle line:10%
And, of course, we have
many stories about the Jews

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.360 align:middle line:10%
worshipping the golden calf.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.330 align:middle line:84%
People don't understand what
that story is all about.

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Moses goes up to the
mountain to talk with God

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:31.020 align:middle line:84%
because it is time
for God to change

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.662 align:middle line:90%
the ordinances of heaven.

00:14:33.662 --> 00:14:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
here to remember

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:84%
that each sign of
the constellation

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.810 align:middle line:90%
lasts 2,150 years.

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:48.630 align:middle line:84%
Every 2,150 years, the
world changes completely.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:52.540 align:middle line:84%
All the great religions
of the world realize that.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.190 align:middle line:84%
And now Moses comes down
with a new beginning

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:00.960 align:middle line:84%
of a new way to worship
God, a new time when

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.660 align:middle line:84%
God is going to be worshipped
in a different way.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And so Moses goes up to find
out what that new way of worship

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:10.900 align:middle line:90%
that God wants people to do.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we have the story
of the golden calf, golden,

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:90%
well, because the sun is golden.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:24.540 align:middle line:84%
And calf is a bull, so we have
the golden calf or the bull,

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.835 align:middle line:84%
Taurus, and the sun
in the age of Taurus.

00:15:26.835 --> 00:15:38.150 align:middle line:90%


00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:84%
Today, Israel is trying to bring
back the good, old days of bull

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.330 align:middle line:90%
worship.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.660 align:middle line:84%
But it's impossible
because Taurus is gone.

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.920 align:middle line:10%
We're in the age of Pisces.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.350 align:middle line:10%
And they want to go
back to the old days.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:57.280 align:middle line:84%
The way we worshipped God in the
old days was the golden calf.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:84%
We are in Pisces, and we
are at the end of Pisces.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why the Christians
talk about the end

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:84%
times we are living in, the
last days we are living in.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.600 align:middle line:90%
The last days of what?

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:90%
The last days of Pisces.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:14.615 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to
find the perfect bull.

00:16:14.615 --> 00:16:17.540 align:middle line:90%


00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.670 align:middle line:10%
The Temple Institute
says that you

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.980 align:middle line:10%
need to find a red heifer
that's born in Israel,

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:10%
and it has to be
a particular bull.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:10%
The Israeli
government is planning

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:10%
a new temple coming in Israel.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:33.380 align:middle line:10%
And, of course,
it will be assumed

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.000 align:middle line:10%
that they're going
to go back to all

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.880 align:middle line:10%
of the old ways of
the Taurus the bull.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, so therefore, they've
got this Jewish girl picking

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.720 align:middle line:84%
fleas off of a cow
because they want

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:48.020 align:middle line:84%
to make sure the bull is
going to be completely clean,

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.010 align:middle line:84%
look his best, smell good, so
that they can cut his head off

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and bring about the dispensation
of Taurus the bull again.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.500 align:middle line:10%
You can get the same bull
in Christian churches also.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:10%
Christians are equally as
ignorant and ill informed

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.165 align:middle line:10%
about their foundations
of their religion.

00:17:05.165 --> 00:17:07.710 align:middle line:10%


00:17:07.710 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:10%
Now you'll see this one shows
in the yellow square the bull.

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.690 align:middle line:10%
The Catholic church
in the Vatican

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:19.700 align:middle line:10%
realizes that there was
a time, 2,150 years long,

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:10%
when God was ruling the Earth
through Taurus the bull.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.540 align:middle line:10%
And this is where we get
our idea of holy cow.

00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.330 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at another zodiac
symbol in religious history.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
This is very important in
relation to Jewish history.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Ares the ram is the
next constellation

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:43.680 align:middle line:90%
after Taurus the bull.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:10%
The Jewish system of
theology understood

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.320 align:middle line:10%
that's 2,150 years has passed.

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Now we move into the next age
that Moses brought us into,

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:84%
because Moses brought us
into a new dispensation.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.150 align:middle line:10%
And when the Jewish
people would not

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.390 align:middle line:10%
accept the idea at the time,
we are told in the Bible

00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:05.730 align:middle line:10%
that Moses became
so frustrated, he

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:07.890 align:middle line:10%
threw down and broke the law.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:10%
So he was the first law breaker.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:18.850 align:middle line:84%
The astrological time of Ares
was from 2000 BC to 1 AD.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:24.240 align:middle line:84%
That's the 2,150-year period
of time that the Jews were now

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.730 align:middle line:84%
to worship their God in
the age of Ares, the ram.

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, of course,
they have the ram.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
You'll see the sun in
the age of Ares the ram.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:41.820 align:middle line:10%
The ram god is very
famous all over Egypt.

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:45.450 align:middle line:10%
And Ares the ram is very
important not only in Egypt.

00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.030 align:middle line:10%
But in the Old
Testament Hebrew, you'll

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:10%
still see it today,
Ares the ram.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:58.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:58.050 --> 00:19:00.270 align:middle line:84%
That's why Jews
blow the ram's horn.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Instead of parading around with
a golden calf, the bull, now

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.510 align:middle line:90%
today they blow the ram's horn.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they don't
realize that not

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:14.130 align:middle line:84%
only that Jews blow
the ram's horn,

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.590 align:middle line:84%
but there are many cultures
around the world that

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:20.730 align:middle line:84%
blew the ram's horn during
the age of Ares the ram.

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.722 align:middle line:84%
That's why today we have the
shofar are the ram's horns.

00:19:25.722 --> 00:19:27.180 align:middle line:10%
You go back to the
Vatican, and you

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.860 align:middle line:10%
will see the same painting
that was with Taurus the bull.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.700 align:middle line:10%
Then you go back and
see Ares the ram.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:42.810 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Since AD 325, we
have been living

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:53.360 align:middle line:84%
in the sign of the age of
Pisces, Pisces the two fish.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Christianity is the focal
point of what we call Pisces.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:03.530 align:middle line:84%
Pisces represents religion,
a different kind of religion.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:90%
Before it was Judaism.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Now there's Christianity
dominates the world.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And so it has nothing to do with
the Christians fighting Jews

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:90%
or the Jews hating Christians.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:19.490 align:middle line:10%
It has to do with the symbolism
in which the world is living,

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.070 align:middle line:10%
and we happen to be living
in the age of Pisces, the two

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.870 align:middle line:10%
fish.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:26.825 align:middle line:10%
So Pisces is the age
of a new religion.

00:20:26.825 --> 00:20:36.350 align:middle line:90%


00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:41.420 align:middle line:10%
And if you remember that
God's sun, Jesus, S-U-N,

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.570 align:middle line:10%
fed his followers in
the Bible with two fish,

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.470 align:middle line:10%
this was in John 19.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:53.270 align:middle line:10%
It says two fish, that the young
boy who brought to Jesus five

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.665 align:middle line:10%
loaves of bread and two fish.

00:20:54.665 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:10%


00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:10%
It's a symbol of
the age of Pisces,

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:05.460 align:middle line:10%
the time of Christianity
to dominate the world.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:07.190 align:middle line:10%
Then here it is
again in the Vatican.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:11.960 align:middle line:10%
You will see Pisces,
the sign in the zodiac.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Even in Chartres Cathedral,
the stained-glass windows

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.750 align:middle line:84%
in the great church
even says Pisces.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:26.960 align:middle line:90%


00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.880 align:middle line:10%
The fish of the
early third century

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.970 align:middle line:10%
appears to be the most
ancient Christian inscription.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:34.620 align:middle line:10%
And what do you see in the
inscription but two fish?

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:35.420 align:middle line:90%
Pisces.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:38.420 align:middle line:90%


00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:10%
Even the Islamic religion today
recognizes the zodiac symbols

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:44.690 align:middle line:10%
are from God.

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.840 align:middle line:10%
The Islamic world has
many beautiful paintings

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.240 align:middle line:10%
of the 12 signs of the zodiac.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.530 align:middle line:10%
So they understood that
the zodiac is from God,

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.880 align:middle line:10%
and they have a very good
understanding, going back

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:59.990 align:middle line:10%
to their ancient history, of
the symbols of the zodiac.

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:90%


00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Then there is the discovery in
the oldest Christian church,

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.930 align:middle line:90%
and this was really interesting.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.590 align:middle line:84%
There was an old
Christian church found,

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.030 align:middle line:84%
and it was referred to as the
oldest single Christian church

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.270 align:middle line:90%
ever found in Israel.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was a big story
at the time it came out.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.470 align:middle line:84%
In the area called
Megiddo, Israel

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:32.550 align:middle line:84%
was going to build a wing
onto an existing building.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.670 align:middle line:84%
And so they had people go
out and clean up this area

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.340 align:middle line:84%
where they're going to build
the new wing to the building.

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to dig
down to put the foundation.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And when they dug
down, they hit a floor.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.130 align:middle line:90%
They hit a mosaic floor.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:49.290 align:middle line:84%
And so they
discovered-- when they

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.840 align:middle line:84%
started to clean the floor
off, what did they find?

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, here they are when
they've cleaned off the area.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:23:01.530 align:middle line:84%
And what do you see on the
floor but the two fish, the two

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.420 align:middle line:90%
fish of Pisces?

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see the
round circle of the sun.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.610 align:middle line:84%
And the little smoke
going around the circle

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.560 align:middle line:90%
is, of course, a sunburst.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:10%
And in the middle of the sun
is the two fish of Pisces.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:17.340 align:middle line:10%
So Israel is saying this is
the oldest church ever done

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.580 align:middle line:10%
and ever built. Well,
there is Pisces,

00:23:20.580 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:10%
the beginning of Christianity.

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:29.025 align:middle line:10%
Christianity today is simply
the sun in the age of Pisces.

00:23:29.025 --> 00:23:33.270 align:middle line:90%


00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.490 align:middle line:84%
There are so many articles
talking about the zodiac

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.360 align:middle line:90%
in relation to Jesus.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:43.120 align:middle line:84%
They don't realize Jesus is
the sun, a metaphor, S-U-N.

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's talking about his 12
apostles or his 12 followers

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:52.380 align:middle line:84%
are the 12 signs of the zodiac,
Jesus with his 12 apostles--

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John, the four seasons.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is why there are
three months in each season.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Christianity today is
replete with saying that we

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.940 align:middle line:90%
are living in the last days.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.750 align:middle line:90%
We are living in the end times.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we are living in
the last days, of Pisces,

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.680 align:middle line:84%
which means the next
one coming is going

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.855 align:middle line:90%
to be the age of Aquarius.

00:24:15.855 --> 00:24:21.020 align:middle line:90%


00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:10%
Aquarius is the water bearer,
very important point here

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:29.360 align:middle line:10%
that proves what we're
talking about as astrology.

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.260 align:middle line:84%
We are now facing
the next 2,150 years,

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.100 align:middle line:84%
when the sun will officially
be in the constellation

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.630 align:middle line:90%
of Aquarius, the water bearer.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And so in the New Testament,
in the book of Luke 22,

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:84%
the apostles are
asking Jesus, now

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to die,
where are we going to go?

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:55.100 align:middle line:84%
We are your 12 followers,
but where are we going to go?

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.930 align:middle line:84%
And so Jesus answers them
in the book of Luke 22:10,

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:03.200 align:middle line:84%
where Jesus said
unto them, "behold.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.780 align:middle line:84%
When you enter into
the city, there

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:09.110 align:middle line:84%
shall a man meet you
bearing a pitcher of water.

00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Follow him into the house
where he enters in."

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:20.510 align:middle line:84%
It's the house of Aquarius, and
Aquarius is the water bearer.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.670 align:middle line:84%
But we know that
this was talking

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.440 align:middle line:90%
about an astrological sign.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.240 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:31.980 align:middle line:84%
Because men never
carried water, ever.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.190 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient world,
that was something

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.520 align:middle line:84%
that a man would never
do, is to carry water.

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.510 align:middle line:90%
That was a woman's job, period.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:45.620 align:middle line:84%
So why did Jesus say look for
the man with the water pitcher?

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:49.160 align:middle line:10%
As an astrological sign.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.760 align:middle line:84%
The whole of the Bible,
both Old and New Testament,

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.690 align:middle line:90%
is a metaphor.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:57.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a symbolic story
that the theologians have

00:25:57.530 --> 00:26:00.500 align:middle line:90%
known for hundreds of years.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.310 align:middle line:84%
But nobody is
telling the public.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:05.480 align:middle line:10%
That's why I think it's
important to bring this out,

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.140 align:middle line:10%
that people need to know there's
nothing wrong with the zodiac.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.920 align:middle line:10%
The Bible, both Old and New
Testament, says God created it.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:17.690 align:middle line:84%
So if you're calling
down evil upon the zodiac

00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:20.450 align:middle line:84%
as a work of the
devil, that's not

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:21.840 align:middle line:90%
what the scriptures say at all.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:29.020 align:middle line:90%


00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And like the scripture
says in the Bible,

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:34.890 align:middle line:84%
when God said to
his people, do not

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.880 align:middle line:84%
call down evil upon
something I have cleansed--

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.139 align:middle line:84%
when I make something,
don't you call it evil--

00:26:42.139 --> 00:26:43.680 align:middle line:84%
well, this is what
I'm saying that we

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.720 align:middle line:90%
need to keep in mind today.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.690 align:middle line:84%
When you talk about
astrology and the zodiac,

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:53.240 align:middle line:84%
God made that, according
to the scriptures.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.960 align:middle line:10%
So we see the man
with the water pitcher

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.440 align:middle line:10%
is all over the world
in Christian churches,

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.150 align:middle line:10%
but the Christians
don't know that.

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:03.190 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
what these symbols mean.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:08.000 align:middle line:90%


00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.780 align:middle line:84%
The idea that most people
have about the coming age

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.020 align:middle line:84%
of Aquarius is that it will
be an age where there will be

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.690 align:middle line:90%
a lot more openness to society.

00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And people will be far easier
to find information and have

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.820 align:middle line:90%
new ideas and new concepts.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:27.950 align:middle line:10%
What we're talking
about is trying

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:32.000 align:middle line:10%
to educate the people of
this world to the fact

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:10%
that the zodiac, as we
showed in the beginning,

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.720 align:middle line:10%
dominates the Earth
and our heavens.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And we need to know the
ordinances of heaven.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:46.625 align:middle line:84%
And the ordinances of heaven
are basically the zodiac.

00:27:46.625 --> 00:27:51.320 align:middle line:84%
It rules the heavens
over the Earth.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:84%
I hope we've been able
to open your eyes to some

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.540 align:middle line:84%
of the symbolic meanings
that we find in life.

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.590 align:middle line:90%
