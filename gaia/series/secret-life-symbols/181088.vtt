00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
>> If we go back to Genesis
1, the very first chapter

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.300 align:middle line:84%
in the Bible, Genesis 1, so
many people today believe,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:90%
and have been told--

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.030 align:middle line:90%
and that's why they believe it--

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.530 align:middle line:90%
that God made us, God made man.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.420 align:middle line:10%
And they will point
to the scripture that

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.270 align:middle line:10%
says God created Adam
and Eve, and then

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.180 align:middle line:10%
they will say, see, there
it is, God made man.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
the Bible says.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.220 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say
that God made man.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, the
first chapter of Genesis

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.920 align:middle line:84%
says, in the
beginning, God created

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.380 align:middle line:90%
the heavens and the earth.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But that's not exactly
what it says in the Hebrew.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:10%
This is why we are emphasizing
that it says God created

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:10%
the heavens and the earth.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.090 align:middle line:84%
But in Hebrew, the
word God is "El," E-L.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:10%
So if we were to read this
first chapter, the first verse,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.560 align:middle line:10%
in Hebrew, it would
say, in the beginning,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:10%
El created the
heavens and the earth.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.960 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
it says in Hebrew.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:84%
It says, in the
beginning, Elohim

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.730 align:middle line:84%
created the heavens
and the earth, not El.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.460 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning of the heavens
and the earth which are now.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I came across this
many, many years ago,

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.260 align:middle line:84%
talking with a very
impressive, well-known rabbi.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.910 align:middle line:84%
He was the one that
put me onto this

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.660 align:middle line:84%
when I was very young,
that God did not create--

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.290 align:middle line:90%
he said God did not create man.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.100 align:middle line:84%
There's nowhere in
the Old Testament,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:84%
or what you call
the Old Testament,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.750 align:middle line:90%
where it says God created man.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't say that.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And so I began to look at this,
and he gave me all the ideas

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.120 align:middle line:90%
a long time ago.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.750 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing we need
to look at is, as I said,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.820 align:middle line:90%
the word is incorrect.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.540 align:middle line:84%
God is El in Hebrew,
but it's Elohim.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.910 align:middle line:84%
And Elohim means the gods in
the plural, more than one god.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.790 align:middle line:84%
So the correct
understanding of Genesis 1:1

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
is that, in the beginning,
the gods created

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:90%
the heavens and the earth.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.410 align:middle line:84%
We need to define our
terms first about God.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.520 align:middle line:84%
What does the word God mean
in the Old Testament Hebrew?

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.470 align:middle line:90%
Here it is for you.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.160 align:middle line:84%
This is God in the
Hebrew is Elohim.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Gods, more than one.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.970 align:middle line:84%
So in Genesis 1:1, it
says, in the beginning,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Elohim created the
heavens and the earth.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:90%
So it's more than one god.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:10%
But here's the important part.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:10%
We'll see it again.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.670 align:middle line:10%
This is from another
Bible translation,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.770 align:middle line:10%
where the word God
shows up, and then it

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:08.860 align:middle line:10%
says, in Hebrew, it's Elohim,
which is plural, more than one.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:10%
So God, Elohim, is plural.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.020 align:middle line:10%
The word Elohim, on the
top it says the word Elohim

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.370 align:middle line:10%
is a plural word.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.560 align:middle line:10%
In Hebrew, the plural form of
the noun ends in M-I-M-O-T.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.040 align:middle line:10%
Elohim is a plural form.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:10%
On the bottom, it says
it is interesting to note

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:10%
that, even though
Elohim is plural,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:10%
the Hebrew dictionary
still translates

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:10%
it God, instead of gods.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.590 align:middle line:10%
This is what has confused
people around the world,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.340 align:middle line:10%
because the actual word
in the Bible is gods.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is why you will see
a lot of the reference works,

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.570 align:middle line:84%
they will make the
distinction and show you

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.580 align:middle line:90%
this, the plural form of El.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you go to the actual
scriptures in a Hebrew Bible,

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:10%
in the Jewish Bible,
it says Elohim, we,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.750 align:middle line:10%
shall make man in our image
and after our likeness.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.206 align:middle line:10%
But it actually says in
Hebrew, Elohim said we,

00:04:13.206 --> 00:04:16.880 align:middle line:10%
W-E, meaning more than
one, we will make man.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Remember the Moses with
the 10 Commandments,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.450 align:middle line:84%
where Moses receives the law of
the 10 Commandments from God.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
First Commandment?

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:84%
The First Commandment says,
I am the Lord your God,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.260 align:middle line:84%
who have brought you out
of the land of Egypt,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
and out of the house of
bondage, and you shall

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.300 align:middle line:90%
have no other gods before me.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.580 align:middle line:84%
He didn't say there
are no other gods,

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.000 align:middle line:84%
he just said you will have
no other gods before me.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.650 align:middle line:84%
The emphasis, I was told
many years ago, was--

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.200 align:middle line:84%
rabbi pointed out is that God
is saying to the Hebrew people

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.000 align:middle line:84%
with the 10 Commandments,
I am the Lord your God.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.390 align:middle line:90%
You pick me.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.260 align:middle line:84%
So there was a group, what I'm
saying is that picture, say, 12

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
or 14 different
gods, and each one is

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:90%
equal to every other one.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
But if you pick one, and you
make a deal with that one god,

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:84%
then you have a
relationship with that god.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why God says that
Hebrew, I am the Lord your God,

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and I shall not have any
other gods before me.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So basically, it's like a
young man telling his fiancee,

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.250 align:middle line:84%
you know, there are many other
young men out there like me,

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.430 align:middle line:84%
but I'm supposed to-- you know,
I'm going steady with you,

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:46.520 align:middle line:84%
so I don't want to have any
other young men in my place.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.570 align:middle line:90%
So God was a jealous god.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's understandable, if
there were many other gods.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:58.310 align:middle line:10%
So, thou shall have no
other gods before me.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.500 align:middle line:10%
He didn't say there weren't any.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:10%
Now, if you read from
Exodus 20 verse three,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.570 align:middle line:10%
this just is just
some of the ways

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:10%
that it is expressed in
different translations.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.960 align:middle line:84%
Thou shall have no
other gods before me,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.310 align:middle line:90%
yes, have no other gods.

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Then in the Hebrew,
the third one down

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
is from the Hebrew
Bible, and it says,

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.760 align:middle line:84%
thou shall have no
Elohims in my presence.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.780 align:middle line:84%
So the ancient Hebrews
realized that the word was

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.190 align:middle line:90%
mentioning more than one god.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.820 align:middle line:84%
But it's the
Christianity today that

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.630 align:middle line:84%
has caused that Elohim
to be brought down

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.940 align:middle line:90%
to a singular term.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of talk
about this now starting

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.900 align:middle line:84%
to come out that there's a
lot of question about what

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.920 align:middle line:90%
does Elohim mean.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, it just means
more than one deity.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:10%
Judaism is said to be a first
monotheistic religion, mono

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.080 align:middle line:10%
meaning one, theistic
meaning the study of God.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:13.850 align:middle line:84%
But in point of fact, Judaism
is not a monotheistic religion.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:20.780 align:middle line:84%
The correct term is heno,
H-E-N-O, henotheology.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:26.490 align:middle line:84%
Henotheology means picking
one god out of a group.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And so as I said, if you pick
one god out of the group,

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.221 align:middle line:84%
then he is your god,
and you are his people.

00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:34.845 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that that's the
only god in the whole universe,

00:07:34.845 --> 00:07:36.580 align:middle line:90%
no, it's just your god.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.860 align:middle line:90%


00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Deuteronomy 11:16 says,
but be careful not

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.150 align:middle line:84%
to let yourselves be
seduced, so that you

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.220 align:middle line:84%
turn aside serving other
gods and worshipping them.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.520 align:middle line:84%
So the Jewish God,
the God of the Jews,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.830 align:middle line:84%
was telling them, yes,
there are other gods,

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:02.090 align:middle line:90%
but don't be worshipping him.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.160 align:middle line:84%
First, you need to
know that the people we

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
call the ancient Hebrews
were not Hebrews as such.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.370 align:middle line:84%
They were, in fact,
Phoenician or Canaanites.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:14.060 align:middle line:10%
And this is where you can
trace back in the encyclopedias

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.650 align:middle line:10%
and in the dictionaries
about ancient Canaan

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.490 align:middle line:10%
and the ancient
area we call today

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.820 align:middle line:10%
Israel and Lebanon,
that whole area.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:10%
They were called Canaanites.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:28.230 align:middle line:90%
Here, we have another article.

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.740 align:middle line:84%
This one was from
a Jewish magazine,

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:84%
and it talks about it is the
faith of the people of Judah,

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.059 align:middle line:84%
and it's the developed faith
of the Semitic people known

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.730 align:middle line:90%
as Hebrews or Israelites.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:84%
It is recognized as the
first religious tradition

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:90%
noted for its monotheism.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Then it goes on to say,
the Hebrew tradition

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:90%
did not begin as monotheism.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So then we find out that all
the people of the Middle East

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.400 align:middle line:90%
were anything but monotheistic.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.160 align:middle line:84%
The so-called Hebrews
were, in that time,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:10.430 align:middle line:84%
henotheistic, meaning
picking one god out of many.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:14.090 align:middle line:10%
Here at Liberty University, they
had articles about henotheism,

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:10%
toward the assessment of a
divine plurality in the Hebrew

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:10%
Bible.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:25.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping to show you that
this is understood in many Bible

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.130 align:middle line:84%
reference works,
the word henotheism,

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.920 align:middle line:90%
and what it actually means.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:84%
The God of Israel,
an ancient people's

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:38.090 align:middle line:84%
growing understanding from
henotheism to monotheism.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:41.090 align:middle line:84%
We see this happening
with the human race

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.240 align:middle line:90%
Things change.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.720 align:middle line:84%
One religion begins, has
a particular understanding

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
of God, and give it 1,000
years and that changes,

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.560 align:middle line:84%
and add another 1,000
years, and it changes again,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.350 align:middle line:84%
until today we have a whole
new understanding that there

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.060 align:middle line:84%
was only one God
in the universe,

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:84%
and he created man, which in
point of fact is not true.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:84%
The one article in the middle
that was read, it says,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.580 align:middle line:84%
we have previously established
that the mighty ones are

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.340 align:middle line:84%
the sons of God, the
assembly of messengers,

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:18.150 align:middle line:84%
and that Yahweh was a
part of these messengers.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is another thought
being expressed that Yahweh

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.180 align:middle line:90%
was one of the many gods.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:10%
So again, it's important when
you see here in the scriptures,

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:36.140 align:middle line:10%
in the Hebrew it says Elohim
said "we shall make man

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.090 align:middle line:10%
in our image."

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's interesting, too, is
that when Elohim, or the gods,

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.750 align:middle line:84%
said come let us make man in
our image, after our likeness,

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:84%
as I was told many
years ago, this

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.890 align:middle line:84%
was a misunderstanding
of the sentence.

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:58.280 align:middle line:84%
You should not read
it that God said

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:84%
"come, let us make man in our
image, after our likeness,"

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and then that would
prove that God made man.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.420 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.980 align:middle line:84%
The correct way to understand
it is that the gods says

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:17.360 align:middle line:84%
"come, let us make man in our
image, after our likeness."

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.420 align:middle line:84%
Not make man, but let's
make him in our image,

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.890 align:middle line:90%
after our likeness.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, that of course
implies that we have been

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.560 align:middle line:90%
tampered with, with our DNA.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.310 align:middle line:84%
This is maybe a long time
ago, but nonetheless, we've

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.880 align:middle line:84%
been tampered with,
and we still are today.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:10%
Even as humans, we're still
tampering with our own DNA.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:10%
If you go to the encyclopedias
and reference works,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:47.510 align:middle line:10%
you will see a lot of
articles on Hebrew henotheism.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:52.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this is because
it is a well-established fact

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.775 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient Hebrews were
not a monotheistic religion.

00:11:55.775 --> 00:11:58.340 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.885 align:middle line:10%
This is in the
book of Psalms 82,

00:12:00.885 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:10%
where it says God standeth in
the congregation of the mighty,

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.180 align:middle line:10%
and he judgeth among the gods.

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, we see God in
the Hebrew tradition

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.440 align:middle line:84%
is one of the many
gods, and he is standing

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.070 align:middle line:90%
among all the other gods.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's see how other
Bible versions say it.

00:12:21.410 --> 00:12:25.250 align:middle line:84%
God takes his stand
in the divine counsel,

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:29.450 align:middle line:84%
or Elohim God stand in
the divine assembly,

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:90%
where there are other Elohims.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
God has taken his place
in the divine counsel

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.340 align:middle line:90%
and in the midst of the gods.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So the point is that there
is more than one god,

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and that the Hebrew god
was just one of them.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.570 align:middle line:84%
That's in the Old Testament,
but even the apostle Paul

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:51.260 align:middle line:84%
in the New Testament says
basically the same thing.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:84%
In 1 Corinthians in
the New Testament,

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.140 align:middle line:84%
the apostle Paul says,
"for though there

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.860 align:middle line:84%
may be called gods, whether in
heaven or on earth, as there

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:90%
be gods many and lords many."

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Then in 1 Corinthians
8:5, it says,

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.420 align:middle line:84%
"for although there
may be so-called gods,

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:14.490 align:middle line:84%
whether in heaven or on earth,
as indeed there are many gods."

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.920 align:middle line:90%
And there are many of them.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's go on and
move on from there.

00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:84%
We're going back
to Genesis 1:26.

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is where we
see the scripture talks

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:32.120 align:middle line:84%
about when God is creating
man, or recreating man.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And so it says, "God said,
let us make man in our image,

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.650 align:middle line:90%
after our likeness."

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a big
difference between God

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.590 align:middle line:84%
making man or remaking him
in their image and likeness.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:10%
And what does that mean?

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.210 align:middle line:10%
Let's see how other
Bibles put it.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:55.440 align:middle line:10%
The Good News Bible says,
"then God said, and now we

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.800 align:middle line:10%
shall make human beings,
and they will be like us,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.430 align:middle line:10%
and they will resemble us."

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:10%
Here in the New Living
Translation of the Bible,

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:08.790 align:middle line:10%
it says, "then God said, let us
make human beings in our image,

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:middle line:10%
to be like us."

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.810 align:middle line:84%
Common English Bible
says, "then God

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:84%
said, let us make humanity
in our image to resemble us."

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.895 align:middle line:84%
This is a far
better understanding

00:14:20.895 --> 00:14:23.370 align:middle line:90%
of the scripture to start with.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Here's the Complete
Jewish Bible that

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:30.580 align:middle line:84%
says, "then God said, let us
make humankind in our image,

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:90%
in the likeness of ourselves."

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:38.250 align:middle line:84%
So it begins to open up a whole
new understanding about why

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.890 align:middle line:90%
we appear on Earth as we do.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.750 align:middle line:84%
It begins to look like
that we are looking today

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.710 align:middle line:90%
like our creator.

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:52.500 align:middle line:84%
The creators who created
us messed with our DNA,

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and caused us to begin more
and more to look like them.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:01.680 align:middle line:84%
So that opens up a whole
new can of worms also,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.380 align:middle line:84%
to show that there's
more than one god.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And so we look like the
gods that created us.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:10.110 align:middle line:84%
The reason I am showing
so many scriptures,

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:14.400 align:middle line:84%
I want you to understand all
Bibles are saying basically

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.810 align:middle line:84%
the same thing, that we
look like the creators that

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:90%
created us, the Elohim.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:90%
More than one.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And in Genesis 3:22, it
said "the Lord God said,

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:31.890 align:middle line:84%
behold man has
become one of us."

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.540 align:middle line:90%
Now he's become like us.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.670 align:middle line:10%
He looks like us,
he's acting like us,

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:41.850 align:middle line:10%
and he's very destructive
like us, having wars like us.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.730 align:middle line:84%
So the Holy Bible
basically says, now,

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:47.910 align:middle line:90%
let us make man like us.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle line:84%
God did not make
man, as you will see.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:54.240 align:middle line:84%
The word in Hebrew
for man is "Ish."

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:57.750 align:middle line:90%
I-S-H in Hebrew is man.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:04.200 align:middle line:84%
But the Bible says God
made Adm, A-D-M, not Ish.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.240 align:middle line:10%
But if you go back to the
Hebrew Bible and read it,

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.260 align:middle line:10%
it says, in this Hebrew
Bible, preface, it says,

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.530 align:middle line:10%
"according to this, the
Hebrew word for woman

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:19.500 align:middle line:10%
is Ishah, comes from the
Hebrew word for man, Ish."

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Here's another
reference word that

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:25.710 align:middle line:84%
said interesting the words
from man and woman in Hebrew

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:26.700 align:middle line:90%
is identical.

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:84%
Man and Hebrew is
pronounced ish.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.800 align:middle line:90%
And looks like this.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
But the Bible does not
say god created ish.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:84%
It says god created adm.
And this is important, too.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.410 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say that
God created Adam.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:50.770 align:middle line:10%
The letter was adm. We
humans added to be Adam.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:51.590 align:middle line:10%
But it's not Adam.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:10%
It's adm. Here we have the
Hebrew translation, going back

00:16:56.310 --> 00:17:02.520 align:middle line:10%
to Hebrew, it says we
shall make adm, A-D-M,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.060 align:middle line:10%
which means a different
kind of creature.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.119 align:middle line:10%
Adm, A-D-M, not Adam.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:15.540 align:middle line:10%
And we will make him in
the image of us, adm.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Like so many other humans
do, even A-D-M, adm,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:23.880 align:middle line:90%
made human or male offspring.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.465 align:middle line:84%
Look how the Bible describes
it in chapter five of Genesis,

00:17:29.465 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:84%
it says, "and Adam
lived 130 years,

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and begat a son in his own
likeness, after his image,

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.215 align:middle line:90%
and called his son Seth."

00:17:40.215 --> 00:17:43.450 align:middle line:90%


00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Adam lived 130 years, and
begat a son in his own image

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:49.600 align:middle line:90%
and likeness.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:84%
So we are seeing that
that man is now doing

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.920 align:middle line:90%
what the gods did also for us.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.200 align:middle line:84%
They created us
to look like them.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And we now have the ability
to create other offspring.

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And we have a son
who looks like us.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.620 align:middle line:84%
There are many
examples in the Bible

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that show that the
gods look like us.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:90%
No, we look like them.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.900 align:middle line:84%
They look what they
look like to start with.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.410 align:middle line:84%
But we were made
to look like them.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.930 align:middle line:84%
As an example, a
classic example is

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.690 align:middle line:84%
found in the story
of Abraham's meeting.

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Three visitors that
came to visit him.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.840 align:middle line:10%
This is in Genesis 18 and 19.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.470 align:middle line:10%
We're told that Abraham and
Sarah were in their tent,

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:39.730 align:middle line:10%
and that three men come walking
up to the tent, three visitors.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And when Abraham
saw the three men,

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.710 align:middle line:84%
he went out and
bowed down to them

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
and said, what does my
Lord say to his servant?

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're told that Abraham
knew this was the Lord, God.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.450 align:middle line:90%
But he looked like another man.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what
the scripture says.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:02.790 align:middle line:84%
God said, we will make men to
look like us, in our image.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:05.980 align:middle line:84%
In chapter 18 in
Genesis, it said,

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.980 align:middle line:84%
"the Lord appeared
unto him," this

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.220 align:middle line:84%
was Abraham," in
the plains of Mamre.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And he sat in the tent door
in the heat of the day.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:19.810 align:middle line:84%
And when Abraham lifted
up his eyes and looked,

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:23.980 align:middle line:84%
lo, there were three
men stood by him.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And when he saw them,
he ran out to meet them

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.910 align:middle line:84%
at the from temple door and
bowed himself to the ground

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.670 align:middle line:90%
before these three men."

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:10%
And here he is bowing
before the three men

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.750 align:middle line:10%
that Abraham obviously knew
was God coming with two

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:10%
of his assistant angels.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:47.230 align:middle line:10%
And so it says that the
Lord appeared to Abraham.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.780 align:middle line:10%
And then in Genesis
18:2, it says,

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.560 align:middle line:10%
"And he lifted up
his eyes and looked

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.890 align:middle line:10%
and the three men were there."

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:57.130 align:middle line:10%
And so we're told
that Abraham then

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.010 align:middle line:10%
asked the three men to
stay for something to eat,

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.430 align:middle line:10%
to have lunch with him,
and then they could go on.

00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And the Lord said, no,
they were on their way

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:84%
to take care of some business,
and they didn't have time.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And the scripture
says that Abraham

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:16.240 align:middle line:84%
went out and insisted that
they stay for just a short time

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.410 align:middle line:90%
to have lunch.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.030 align:middle line:10%
And God then said to
Abraham, all right then.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:20.830 align:middle line:10%
Do that.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.450 align:middle line:10%
But make it quick,
because we're in a hurry.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:10%
And so the scripture
goes on to say

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:10%
that Abraham's wife Sarah fixed
a lunch for the three men.

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.280 align:middle line:84%
And now we are told that
Abraham went out and sat

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
under the tree with the
three men as they had lunch.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:40.110 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, after eating,
two of the three men

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:84%
got up to be on their way while
the third man stayed a bit

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.500 align:middle line:90%
longer to talk with Abraham.

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So now we've got a guy
sitting under the tree talking

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.050 align:middle line:84%
with Abraham, had
just had lunch.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And the men rose up from
thence and looked toward Sodom.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And Abraham went with them
to bring them on their way.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're told that the men that
left, they were on their way

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.220 align:middle line:90%
to somewhere.

00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:84%
So Abraham quickly
got up and escorted

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:84%
them a short
distance on their way

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.130 align:middle line:84%
while they were all
on their way to Sodom.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:19.440 align:middle line:10%
And it says, in Genesis
19, the next chapter--

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.590 align:middle line:10%
the two men that were
having lunch with Abraham,

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:25.500 align:middle line:10%
and then they got up and
walked towards Sodom,

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.060 align:middle line:10%
that's in chapter 18.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.150 align:middle line:10%
But in chapter 19,
it goes on to say,

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:36.540 align:middle line:10%
"And there came two angels
to Sodom at evening time.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.880 align:middle line:10%
And Lot sat at
the gate of Sodom.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:10%
And Lot seeing these two
angels rose up to meet them.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:48.180 align:middle line:10%
And he bowed himself with
his face to the ground.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.590 align:middle line:10%
And he said, behold now, my
lords, turn in, I pray you,

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:56.910 align:middle line:10%
to come and be in my home
if you're going to be here."

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:58.950 align:middle line:90%
And the men said--

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:02.620 align:middle line:84%
again, we're interchanging
angels and men--

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
and so the men said to Lot,
no, we won't stay at your home.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.940 align:middle line:90%
We will still stay in the city.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.690 align:middle line:90%
We'll be all right.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But it keeps interchanging
men with angels.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.790 align:middle line:84%
So the point in this, according
to the Bible, the word for God

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:24.290 align:middle line:84%
is Elohim and means the
gods, plural, more than one.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And they make us to look in
their image and their likeness.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:90%
We look like them.

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:34.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's why your male
offspring looks human like you.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So here's Abraham meeting
the three men with Sarah,

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.120 align:middle line:90%
offering them to stay for lunch.

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.170 align:middle line:10%
Then we see this portrayed
in many paintings

00:22:45.170 --> 00:22:48.140 align:middle line:10%
in the Bible of the
three men, which

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.690 align:middle line:10%
are actually three angels.

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.370 align:middle line:84%
It implies also that the
third man was actually

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
the Almighty God, because
it's capitalized in the Bible.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is the Almighty God
who looks like a man and stays

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.170 align:middle line:90%
and has lunch with Abraham.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:09.350 align:middle line:10%
So this is why the
Christian New Testament

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:14.850 align:middle line:10%
has the apostle Paul
saying, in the Bible,

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:18.100 align:middle line:10%
"Be not forgetful to
entertain strangers,

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.740 align:middle line:10%
for thereby some have
entertained angels

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:28.160 align:middle line:10%
unaware," meaning that
if you see another man,

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:10%
be careful, because it might
not be, in fact, another man.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.930 align:middle line:84%
It may be an angel
who you look like.

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.510 align:middle line:84%
But he looks like what he
looks like to start with.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:40.850 align:middle line:90%
And you were made in his image.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.070 align:middle line:90%
You were made to look like him.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:46.340 align:middle line:84%
So just be careful when you're
talking to other people.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.630 align:middle line:84%
Show respect, because you never
know who you're talking to.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:55.520 align:middle line:84%
Here, again, in the book
of Hebrews chapter two,

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.640 align:middle line:90%
this is apostle Paul again.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And it says, "Remember
to welcome strangers

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.880 align:middle line:90%
in your homes.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.870 align:middle line:84%
There were some who did
that and welcomed angels

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:07.670 align:middle line:90%
without knowing it."

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:08.540 align:middle line:90%
Very interesting.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.710 align:middle line:84%
That was beginning to see
God didn't make a man.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.650 align:middle line:90%
God remade man.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:90%
He began to change--

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and this is why the
scripture says it that way.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Come, let us make man in our
image, after our likeness.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So today, what I'm
saying, is that we look

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:33.470 align:middle line:90%
like the gods who created us.

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And so this is why Abraham had
to go out and feed the three

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:38.510 align:middle line:90%
men.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you find out,
no, those are the angels

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.480 align:middle line:90%
that went into Sodom.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:48.280 align:middle line:84%
All of this is actually very
important in understanding

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.016 align:middle line:84%
theology and religion from
the Bible's standpoint.

00:24:52.016 --> 00:24:53.890 align:middle line:84%
This is something that
most people have never

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:58.090 align:middle line:84%
heard before, that we looked
like the gods who created

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:01.210 align:middle line:90%
us-- gods, more than one.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.520 align:middle line:10%
So when we go back to Genesis
1:1, "In the beginning,

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.770 align:middle line:10%
God created the heavens."

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:06.970 align:middle line:10%
No, it wasn't God.

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:10%
It was plural--

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:10%
Elohim.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:15.550 align:middle line:10%
And Elohim, plural, gods,
we give the term honotheist,

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.030 align:middle line:10%
meaning more than one god.

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And it is also
interesting to understand

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:27.520 align:middle line:84%
that in Islam and the
Quran, everywhere god is

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:30.970 align:middle line:90%
talking to man, it's we.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:84%
You look it up in the Quran,
you will see everywhere

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.430 align:middle line:84%
that God is talking
to his people.

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:37.690 align:middle line:90%
He keeps saying we.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:38.740 align:middle line:90%
We will do this.

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.120 align:middle line:90%
We are going to do that.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.510 align:middle line:90%
We had you do this.

00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:43.480 align:middle line:90%
We created you.

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And it actually says that in
the Quran-- we created you.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.340 align:middle line:10%
So indeed, there are
many different gods.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.760 align:middle line:10%
God is gods.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And the gods made adm, not
ish, which means they say ish,

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:04.130 align:middle line:84%
and then they took ish
and remade him into adm.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.440 align:middle line:90%
And we call it Adam.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.220 align:middle line:84%
No, the gods came here,
they saw this man,

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, the
man must have been

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:84%
like a Neanderthal man or some
ancient creature, hominid.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:21.370 align:middle line:84%
And the gods said, let
us make him look like us.

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.290 align:middle line:90%
Let us make him in our image.

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:25.390 align:middle line:10%
So that's what I'm saying.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.840 align:middle line:10%
God did not create man,
because man is ish.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.550 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't say he made ish.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:32.740 align:middle line:10%
Ish was already here.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.600 align:middle line:10%
So the three visitors to
Abraham were three men.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.730 align:middle line:84%
But Abraham realized they were
gods, they were the creators.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:45.880 align:middle line:84%
And the gods were always
pictured as either men

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:50.070 align:middle line:90%
with angel wings or not.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:55.230 align:middle line:10%
After the flood of Noah's
day, chapter nine says,

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:59.050 align:middle line:10%
"And God bless Noah and his
sons and said unto them,

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:03.610 align:middle line:10%
be fruitful, multiply,
and replenish the earth."

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:06.340 align:middle line:84%
When I talked to the
rabbi many years ago,

00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, is this a
correct translation

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:14.520 align:middle line:84%
that says be fruitful, multiply,
and replenish the earth?

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Re means to do it again.

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.080 align:middle line:10%
And he said, well, obviously,
if there were people here

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.230 align:middle line:10%
on the earth, and God
decided to destroy

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:25.980 align:middle line:10%
that civilization of that
time, and now there's

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:30.530 align:middle line:10%
nobody on the earth except Noah
and his sons and the wives,

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.120 align:middle line:10%
if you're going to have
people on the earth,

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:38.040 align:middle line:10%
you're going to have to
replenish the earth, obviously.

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So therefore,
replenish is correct.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.280 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I'm asking that
is because re means do again.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.990 align:middle line:90%
Well, if you go back to--

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:52.320 align:middle line:84%
he was, again, in the
Bible and the Jewish Bible.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:53.940 align:middle line:90%
It talks about Elohim.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.210 align:middle line:90%
And Elohim said replenish.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.110 align:middle line:90%
This is important.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.170 align:middle line:10%
Because if you go
to Genesis one,

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:06.570 align:middle line:10%
where God is creating adm
and his wife, it says--

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:09.770 align:middle line:10%
this is in Genesis 1:27 and 28--

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.420 align:middle line:10%
and it says, "God created
man in his own image,

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:10%
after the image
of God created he,

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:17.610 align:middle line:10%
male and female created them.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:19.710 align:middle line:10%
And God blessed them.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.440 align:middle line:10%
And God said unto them,
be fruitful, multiply,

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:10%
and replenish the earth."

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:30.540 align:middle line:84%
So we're not to understand
that God created man

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:31.980 align:middle line:90%
as the very first creature.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:36.770 align:middle line:84%
No, when these gods
created us, they

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:40.860 align:middle line:84%
said to replenish
the earth, implying

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:46.680 align:middle line:84%
that some terrible catastrophe
had happened on the earth

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:84%
and that so much
of life was lost.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:53.130 align:middle line:84%
So now, the gods who
created us say, go out now

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.360 align:middle line:90%
and redo it again.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So how many people in the world
have thought about Adam and Eve

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.200 align:middle line:84%
not being the first
creatures on the earth.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.530 align:middle line:84%
There have been civilizations
here for millions of years.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:10.170 align:middle line:84%
Genesis 1:2 says, "And the Earth
was without form and void."

00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:12.750 align:middle line:84%
That is an incorrect
translation.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.190 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't say that.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.780 align:middle line:90%
Here it is again.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:20.850 align:middle line:10%
Genesis 1:2, "And the Earth
was without form and void."

00:29:20.850 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:84%
The English words in Genesis
1:2, "without form and void,"

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.890 align:middle line:84%
is mistranslation of
the original Hebrew

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.850 align:middle line:90%
words tohu vavohu.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:38.670 align:middle line:84%
The word tohu vavohu means
not without form and void.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.476 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to the original
Hebrew, "In the beginning,

00:29:42.476 --> 00:29:44.100 align:middle line:84%
God created the
heavens and the earth."

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:10%
And then in Genesis 1:2
says, "And the earth

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:52.770 align:middle line:10%
became a waste
and a desolation."

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.710 align:middle line:84%
The earth became a
waste and a desolation.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.830 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't created
without form and void.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Obviously if God's going
to create something,

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.160 align:middle line:90%
it has got to have a form.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.240 align:middle line:10%
And it's not going to be void,
whatever that's supposed to me.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.660 align:middle line:10%
So therefore, the
correct understanding

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:15.120 align:middle line:10%
of Genesis 1:2, the earth
became a waste and a desolation.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:18.330 align:middle line:84%
What are you talking about
the earth became a waste

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:90%
and desolation?

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:24.420 align:middle line:84%
We find that in
the Bible, again,

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:27.510 align:middle line:84%
it keeps telling us all of these
translations, keeps telling us

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.370 align:middle line:90%
that it actually became.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't without form and void.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.640 align:middle line:84%
It was formed the
way god formed it.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.510 align:middle line:84%
But it became a waste
in the desolation.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.870 align:middle line:10%
And here's another
translation of the scriptures,

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:46.440 align:middle line:10%
where it actually says
the earth became a waste.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you understand that
the earth became a waste, not

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:55.200 align:middle line:84%
without form, you can go back to
the reference works in the King

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.850 align:middle line:90%
James Bible.

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:01.320 align:middle line:10%
And it will explain to you
that the words are tohu vavohu.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:04.170 align:middle line:10%
And it gives you all the
understanding right there

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:05.190 align:middle line:10%
in the Bible itself.

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:10.920 align:middle line:10%
But most people don't even look
at the reference works on this.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:17.400 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrew words tohu vavohu is
only found twice in the Bible.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.960 align:middle line:10%
The second place in the Old
Testament book of Jeremiah,

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:10%
in Jeremiah 1:23, where
it says, "I beheld--"

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:28.860 align:middle line:10%
now, Jeremiah is
talking about-- and this

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.520 align:middle line:10%
is in the Old Testament.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:36.850 align:middle line:10%
And Jeremiah says, "I beheld--"
first of all, Jeremiah

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.580 align:middle line:10%
is saying that he
was on his bed,

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:42.490 align:middle line:10%
and that God gave him a vision.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:47.690 align:middle line:84%
The Lord gave Jeremiah a vision
of the old ancient world.

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:50.560 align:middle line:10%
And he said, "I
beheld the earth,

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:54.800 align:middle line:10%
and, lo, it was
without form and void."

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.270 align:middle line:10%
No, it's, "I beheld the
earth, and it became

00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:01.270 align:middle line:10%
a waste and a desolation."

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.270 align:middle line:10%
"And the heavens, and
they had no light.

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:07.360 align:middle line:10%
I behold the mountains,
and, lo, they trembled,

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.120 align:middle line:10%
and all the hills moved lightly.

00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:15.280 align:middle line:10%
I beheld, and there was
no man, and all the birds

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:17.450 align:middle line:10%
of the heavens were fled.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'd beheld, and,
lo, the fruitful place

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.590 align:middle line:84%
was a wilderness, and
all the cities thereof

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:27.670 align:middle line:84%
were broken down in the
presence of the Lord

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.500 align:middle line:90%
and in his fierce anger.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:35.000 align:middle line:10%
For thus hath the Lord said, the
whole land shall be desolate,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.960 align:middle line:10%
and yet, will I
make it a full end."

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So here, we're seeing
that God's showing

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.970 align:middle line:84%
Jeremiah the Earth in
its earliest beginnings

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:49.160 align:middle line:84%
when it was a beautiful--
it says all the cities,

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.830 align:middle line:90%
they were broken up.

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.760 align:middle line:84%
But it says also in
25, there was no man.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So now you have to
wonder, well, who

00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:00.400 align:middle line:84%
was building all the beautiful
cities if there was no man?

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.820 align:middle line:84%
So it implies that something
else was going on this Earth

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:08.320 align:middle line:84%
a long time ago that
we have no idea about.

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.390 align:middle line:84%
But there was a
massive destruction

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:15.190 align:middle line:84%
that happened to this planet
maybe tens of thousands

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:19.060 align:middle line:84%
of years ago, if not, maybe
millions of years ago.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And Adam and Eve were told to go
forth and do it again, start it

00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:27.050 align:middle line:90%
all over again.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to see how
these words are put together,

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:34.840 align:middle line:84%
we begin to see that
God did not make man.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.440 align:middle line:84%
God came here and saw
what the Hebrews call

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:43.000 align:middle line:84%
ish, which was the ancient
man, these ancient hominid

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.800 align:middle line:90%
creatures.

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.340 align:middle line:84%
And they said, come, let us make
these creatures to look like us

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:50.560 align:middle line:90%
and be like us.

00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Now we begin to see
the actual truth,

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.480 align:middle line:90%
is that God did not make man.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:58.840 align:middle line:84%
He remade the creatures
that were here

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.580 align:middle line:90%
that we call hominids.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
we have come from.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:06.980 align:middle line:84%
We looked like the
gods that created us.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:08.239 align:middle line:10%
I'm Jordan Maxwell.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And thank you for watching.

00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:16.619 align:middle line:90%
