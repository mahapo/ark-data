00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>> This is "Secret
Life of Symbols."

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:23.168 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, in the world of
religion, and government,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.570 align:middle line:84%
and secret societies, there's
a very important facet

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.500 align:middle line:84%
to the connection between
governments and religions

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:84%
by secret societies, and that
is the use of the planet Saturn.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:10%
Saturn is referred to
in the ancient world

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:10%
as "Lord of the Rings."

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course he is
the Lord of the Rings.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.190 align:middle line:84%
Men were told to-- when
they get married to--

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.090 align:middle line:84%
get married before your Lord,
and you wear a wedding ring.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:84%
Circles and rings were used
in different religious events.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:15.090 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:84%
In order to show you the
importance of the planet

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
Saturn in religion, generally
speaking throughout the world,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it would be
appropriate to give you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.910 align:middle line:84%
some ideas about the
original Hebrew religion

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and where it came from, and
then how it has progressed

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:90%
over the years until today.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.870 align:middle line:10%
Saturn dominates
the Hebrew religion.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.520 align:middle line:10%
It also dominates many of the
other religions of the world

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.510 align:middle line:10%
in the Middle East.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Originally, there was
an ancient religion,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.535 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't Hebrew or Jewish.

00:01:52.535 --> 00:01:58.300 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.890 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the
Middle East, we

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.730 align:middle line:84%
would find that it was
probably more the Egyptian

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.870 align:middle line:90%
than it was Jewish.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:84%
But the Jewish people or what
we call the Jewish people back

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
then, at that time, the
dominating worship at the time

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.960 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt in the
whole Middle East

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.830 align:middle line:90%
was the worship of the moon.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:84%
The moon worship
was very important.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians, especially,
put a lot of importance

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.510 align:middle line:90%
on the worship on the moon.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:84%
With a moon God, if you were in
Egypt and you're looking east--

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:84%
in the middle of
the Sinai desert

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.280 align:middle line:84%
is an enormously
high mountain range.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And so the people on the
Egyptian side of the Sinai

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.520 align:middle line:90%
would look eastward.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And every evening,
about 6 o'clock,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.700 align:middle line:84%
the moon would come
up from the mountain.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:84%
The moon became known as the
"old man of the mountain."

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And the moon's name, the
old man's name, was Sin.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:84%
S-I-N was the name of a moon
god to the ancient world

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:90%
in the Middle East.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:90%
And the mountain was AI.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So you put the two together
sin and AI because Mount Sinai.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where
Mount Sinai is said

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.670 align:middle line:90%
to be is in the Sinai Desert.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.520 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
the Hebrews today,

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.380 align:middle line:84%
as they did many
hundreds of years ago--

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:84%
they have a lunar calendar
based on the moon.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.410 align:middle line:84%
They trace their
beginnings of each day

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.610 align:middle line:90%
from sundown to sundown.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.410 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.840 align:middle line:84%
Because that's when
the moon comes out

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.260 align:middle line:90%
is from sundown to sundown.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:90%
First of all, was the moon.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.950 align:middle line:84%
Later on, Jupiter
comes into the picture

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.250 align:middle line:90%
in ancient Hebrew worship--

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter because in the ancient
world, Patar, P-A-T-A-R,

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:84%
or P-A-T-E-R. And in the
Phoenician Canaanite language,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.330 align:middle line:90%
that was a Piter--

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
P-I-T-E-R. The ancient
name for the Jews was I-U.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.190 align:middle line:84%
In the King's English, the old
King's English for the word

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.320 align:middle line:84%
"Jew," it wasn't spelt J-E-W.
It was spelled I-U or I-O-U.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So I-U was Jew, and
Pater was the father.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.090 align:middle line:84%
So it became known as the
father of the Jews was IU Pater.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, I's and J's
are interchangeable.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:37.740 align:middle line:84%
So now, it becomes J-U Pater
or Ju-Piter Jupiter now

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.590 align:middle line:84%
becomes very important
in the Jewish religion.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.990 align:middle line:10%
And then from the changing of
the astrological age of Ares

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.320 align:middle line:10%
from blowing the
ram's horn to Pisces,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.520 align:middle line:10%
you now move into
the Christian age.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Today, in the Vatican, we
have a statue of St. Peter.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:90%
No, not "Peter."

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.650 align:middle line:90%
It's Pater.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Father God Pater.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.680 align:middle line:84%
And you put J-U- in front
of it, it become Ju-pater.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.400 align:middle line:84%
That's at the beginning of
the Christian dispensation.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, within the last
500 years, 400, 500 years,

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:90%
Jupiter has now been eclipsed.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:90%
It has kind of gone into quiet.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And now, the main
planet today is Saturn.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.200 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is referred to
as Lord of the Rings.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And as we said, Saturn
is today actually

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.270 align:middle line:90%
the god of the Hebrews today.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.600 align:middle line:84%
In the old Phoenician
Canaanite language,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:84%
you'll spell the name
"Saturn" S-H-A-B-B-A-T-H--

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:90%
Shabbath.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're going
to worship the planet

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.210 align:middle line:84%
Saturn, the Sabbath, you do it
on Sunday called "the Sabbath."

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.010 align:middle line:84%
So when you hear in
the 10 Commandments,

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.320 align:middle line:84%
"remember to keep
holy the Sabbath,"

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.420 align:middle line:84%
Sabbath is the Phoenician
name for the planet Saturn.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Saturn, as a god,
was always called

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:90%
the god of the black robe.

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Black is a very important
color in both Judaism

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and the Catholic
church, in Christianity,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:90%
because black represents Saturn.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is the God who is
a judge over all mankind--

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.920 align:middle line:84%
that's why judges in
courtrooms wear a black robe.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.970 align:middle line:10%
Shabbath also has
another interpretation.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is the seventh planet.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.620 align:middle line:84%
He's also sometimes
represented as the Grim

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.980 align:middle line:90%
Reaper, father time.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Very interesting all
the little details

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
about Saturn and its numbers
applying to it and the colors

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.200 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And we get our idea about
chronology from Saturn.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.180 align:middle line:84%
So we have something called
a calendar, Kronia calendar.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Saturn was Kronus in Greek.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.120 align:middle line:90%


00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Another reason why
Saturn was important

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.770 align:middle line:84%
is because Saturn was understood
to be the inhibitor, one

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.480 align:middle line:90%
who holds you back in life.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.960 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:84%
That's why when you are
celebrating your god

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.200 align:middle line:90%
on the Sabbath, you do no work.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.710 align:middle line:84%
Because the ancients
said, if Saturn

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.750 align:middle line:84%
is the inhibitor
who holds us back,

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.962 align:middle line:90%
then we won't do anything.

00:07:40.962 --> 00:07:42.920 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't have to hold
us back; we'll just not

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.210 align:middle line:90%
do anything on the Sabbath.

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.950 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.760 align:middle line:10%
The reason why Saturn
became known as inhibitor

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:10%
and because it's
circled, ancient man

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:10%
didn't know there were any
other planets out past Saturn.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.090 align:middle line:84%
So they assumed, well,
he's the bottom line.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that
holds us together.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is still important in
the Middle Eastern religions,

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:90%
Arabic religions.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.220 align:middle line:84%
The Star of David is
a six-pointed star.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.680 align:middle line:10%
Well, a six-pointed
star is actually

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.180 align:middle line:10%
referred to by the reference
works as a hex, a hexogram.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
"Hex" simply means six, which
incidentally, in the Bible,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:34.470 align:middle line:90%
six is the number of a man.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:37.210 align:middle line:90%
How do you spell six in Latin?

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:46.960 align:middle line:84%
It's sex, S-E-X. So six
is a six-pointed star.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And today, the Jews call
it the Star of David,

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.610 align:middle line:84%
but the encyclopedias
will show you

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:84%
that a six-pointed
star is a hex.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:57.380 align:middle line:84%
And it will tell you that it was
originally the Star of Saturn.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:02.290 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So in the ancient
world, a priest

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:11.820 align:middle line:84%
would draw a circle on the
ground and draw a triangle.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:15.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, they would build
another triangle, obverse,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.720 align:middle line:84%
going the other way, which
makes it a six-pointed star.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, they would be able
to step inside of the circle,

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and into the star, and
cast a spell on you.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.690 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea was they're
putting a hex on you.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:35.720 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.460 align:middle line:10%
In 1977, NASA sent
out the Voyager

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:47.280 align:middle line:10%
and as that probe moved out into
space, it passed over Saturn.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And as it passed over
Saturn, it happened

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:52.150 align:middle line:84%
to go close to the
north pole of Saturn.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, on
the north pole of Saturn

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.100 align:middle line:84%
is a hexogram, a
six-point hexogram

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:90%
on the north pole of Saturn.

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Scientists cannot explain how
there is a six-pointed star

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.540 align:middle line:90%
on the north pole of Saturn.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.970 align:middle line:84%
And what's even worse
to try and explain

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:84%
is how come the Jews knew
that Saturn was connected

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.450 align:middle line:90%
to six and a hexogram?

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Somehow or another, the Jews
knew that six-pointed star was

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.560 align:middle line:90%
somehow connected to Saturn.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.890 align:middle line:84%
There was no way for us
to know until '77, when

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.850 align:middle line:90%
the space probe went across.

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:84%
NASA had to explain to us
that it was simply a fluke.

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.360 align:middle line:84%
It was something
that just happened.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Nothing to be concerned about.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.080 align:middle line:84%
Then, like 40 years later, when
the Cassini craft goes out,

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:84%
that same hexogram is
still there on Saturday.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't just a little fluke.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:90%
It's there on Saturn even today.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.750 align:middle line:84%
In the motion picture
"Lord of the Rings,"

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:84%
Sauron is portrayed
as an evil eye.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.760 align:middle line:84%
If you go to the
south pole of Saturn,

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:16.270 align:middle line:84%
you will see what all
together looks like an eye.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.530 align:middle line:90%
The all-seeing eye.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:24.170 align:middle line:84%
However, if you think about the
planet Saturn with its rings,

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:84%
if you turn the
angle just right,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.100 align:middle line:84%
now the rings look like
two separate eyelids,

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:84%
with the center
circle as the eye.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot of mysticism
connected to the planet

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Saturn, the Jewish religion,
the Catholic church,

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:90%
and the Catholic religion.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:48.040 align:middle line:84%
Even Islam today has
a symbol of Saturn

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.680 align:middle line:84%
that is dominantly
important to Islam.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
It was a black square
or a black cube.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And the black cube
represents to planet Saturn.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's what mecca
is in Saudi Arabia is

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.080 align:middle line:90%
a black cube, a black square.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.090 align:middle line:84%
All over the world,
large, large, black cubes,

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and architecture, and
churches, and monasteries--

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:84%
huge black square
cubes just like Mecca.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.802 align:middle line:90%


00:12:20.802 --> 00:12:22.920 align:middle line:90%
In the movie "2001--

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Space Odyssey," in the
book, the original book

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.590 align:middle line:90%
gave birth to the movie.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:84%
In the book, it
was the astronauts

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:38.100 align:middle line:84%
were going to the planet
Saturn to find this black cube.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.875 align:middle line:84%
There again is the black
cube and the planet Saturn.

00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:45.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:50.550 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who studies the dark
arts, the dark sciences,

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.610 align:middle line:84%
or the world of the
occult knows that Saturn

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.060 align:middle line:84%
is very important to the dark
side of this world in relation

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:90%
to religion and occultism.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.650 align:middle line:90%
Saturn is the inhibitor.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:06.970 align:middle line:84%
It'll set you back and
teach you a lesson.

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.710 align:middle line:10%
Saturn represents a
government, a military,

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.690 align:middle line:10%
the police department,
and governmental agencies.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:20.745 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.745 --> 00:13:24.460 align:middle line:10%
The Saturnalia was
the celebration

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:27.820 align:middle line:10%
in Rome for the planet Saturn.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And it happened like 13
days before the 25th.

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:37.460 align:middle line:84%
So it was like 12 days before
what we call today Christmas.

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But it was the 12 days before,
and it was called Saturnalia

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.860 align:middle line:84%
because Saturn was,
in Rome, considered

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:90%
to be the God of chaos.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:84%
That was another thing
he was known for.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:51.830 align:middle line:90%


00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.160 align:middle line:84%
What the Romans did
with worshipping Saturn,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.780 align:middle line:84%
they actually had
12 days of chaos

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:03.350 align:middle line:84%
in which the kings
would bow to slaves;

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:05.990 align:middle line:84%
and prisoners were
let loose, and they

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
would be in charge of their
masters who put him in prison.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:84%
There was alcohol, and sex, and
drugs, and whatever you wanted.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.640 align:middle line:84%
In the Roman Empire,
you're free to do

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:90%
whatever it is you want to do.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:22.700 align:middle line:84%
And so if you were a slave,
when Saturnalia comes,

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:84%
you can go to the
house of your master

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and bring him out, and make him
bow down and kiss your feet.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was it was a chaotic
time in which all law was just

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.280 align:middle line:90%
thrown away.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And now, it was up
to anybody, whatever

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:38.900 align:middle line:84%
it is you want, go out
and get it and take it.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.370 align:middle line:90%
Today, we call it Christmas.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:44.870 align:middle line:84%
In the Roman Empire,
the Saturnalia.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:46.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, there was
a Brumalia, which

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.900 align:middle line:84%
was based on the
worship of Saturn, too.

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.750 align:middle line:10%
A very important
NASA scient named

00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:10%
Norman Bergrun has
written a book called

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:10%
"The Ringmakers of Saturn."

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And in that book, Norman
Begrun, the scientist,

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.140 align:middle line:84%
shows actual pictures taken
of the rings of Saturn.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.370 align:middle line:84%
And one in particular
has some sort

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:20.880 align:middle line:84%
of a vehicle, space vehicle,
that is creating another ring.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:10%
And it's not quite finished.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.510 align:middle line:10%
So there's a ring on this side.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:26.490 align:middle line:10%
And there is some
kind of a space

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.440 align:middle line:10%
vehicle creating the ring.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's almost ready
to connect the ring.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:32.970 align:middle line:90%
It's not quite.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And so we have some
beautiful pictures

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.500 align:middle line:84%
is going to ultimately
connect it together,

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.110 align:middle line:84%
and there'll be a
new ring in Saturn.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.020 align:middle line:84%
So we know that the
rings are artificial.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:46.540 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's made them.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.230 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking up in a
conference in San Francisco

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:middle line:90%
a few years ago.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.880 align:middle line:90%
He came over to me.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.240 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't expecting that.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Jordan, I've
come here to meet you.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.920 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk with
you in private.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we went back into
the back of the restaurant

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:03.910 align:middle line:90%
and sat there.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And he says, I'm here
to tell you something.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.970 align:middle line:84%
After I talk to
you, I'm going home.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but you've been
talking about the planet

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.630 align:middle line:90%
Saturn.

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I want to show you some things
about Saturn you don't know.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And so he pulls
out some pictures.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.580 align:middle line:84%
He had the pictures
and NASA pictures.

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:90%


00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So he said, well, what we do
know is that it's inhabited.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
My question was,
could the rings be

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.440 align:middle line:84%
like a dish for
communication in deep space?

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.800 align:middle line:84%
Because we have television,
dishes, the big dishes.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.820 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the rings could be some
kind of a communication device

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:52.820 align:middle line:84%
that can send out or receive
from extreme distances

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.590 align:middle line:84%
hundreds of light years
away with this dish setup.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
that's interesting.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I don't know that
much about that idea.

00:17:03.780 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:90%


00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:13.589 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is a very important
planet that balances out

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:15.839 align:middle line:90%
the positions of other stars.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:19.464 align:middle line:84%
Jupiter and Saturn
dominate our solar system.

00:17:19.464 --> 00:17:20.264 align:middle line:90%
They're so large.

00:17:20.264 --> 00:17:24.180 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is important in not only
its physical qualities of being

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:33.330 align:middle line:84%
able to exert energy
fields and sounds,

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.000 align:middle line:84%
but it also goes back into
ancient history, which

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.320 align:middle line:90%
makes it really interesting.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.200 align:middle line:84%
How did the ancient
peoples know so much

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.800 align:middle line:84%
about the planet Saturn
and also associate Saturn

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:48.510 align:middle line:84%
as they did with
dark mystical forces?

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
Saturn is probably
the dominant figure

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:57.930 align:middle line:84%
in dark religions today in
the occult world, metaphysics.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Saturn plays a prominent
part in all magical systems.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.020 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
in Germany, today there

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:10.470 align:middle line:84%
is a very powerful
secret society called

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:90%
the Brotherhood of Saturn.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:16.540 align:middle line:84%
The books written about
them say they are probably

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
the most important
secret society

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.650 align:middle line:90%
on the face of the Earth.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:84%
They are connected
behind the scenes

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:26.680 align:middle line:84%
to all kinds of powerful
organization, governments,

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.060 align:middle line:90%
secret societies.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.900 align:middle line:90%


00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.040 align:middle line:84%
I think the darkness associated
with the planet Saturn

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.370 align:middle line:84%
and the occult
religions of the world

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:42.025 align:middle line:84%
has to do with some
actual, in fact, influence

00:18:42.025 --> 00:18:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that sovereign has
on the human race

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:51.330 align:middle line:84%
that the Jewish people realized
that we didn't realize.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:55.290 align:middle line:84%
And they probably got the idea
from other ancient cultures

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
that also venerated
the planet Saturn.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I am convinced that
the world we live in

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:07.480 align:middle line:84%
is being dominated by an
extraterrestrial presence.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
extraterrestrial presence

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:15.450 align:middle line:84%
is the one who is feeding us our
ideas about theology, religion,

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:84%
the occult world, governmental
systems, churches.

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:26.785 align:middle line:84%
And somehow, the older teachers
were knowledgeable about planet

00:19:26.785 --> 00:19:27.585 align:middle line:90%
Saturn.

00:19:27.585 --> 00:19:31.410 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.540 align:middle line:84%
But David Icke has been
talking about this, too,

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:84%
for a long time, that Saturn
is a very important planet

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.210 align:middle line:90%
to the occult world.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.080 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.420 align:middle line:84%
Because if you do any
research into a cultism,

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:48.270 align:middle line:84%
secret societies,
Freemasonry, you

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.685 align:middle line:84%
will find that Saturn
dominates the whole subject.

00:19:50.685 --> 00:19:54.620 align:middle line:90%


00:19:54.620 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have been
on this Earth, we humans,

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
the way we live
today-- we've been

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
on this Earth with other
lifeforms, other higher and far

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.610 align:middle line:84%
more intelligent and
creative lifeforms,

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:13.770 align:middle line:84%
that we really haven't
looked at very closely

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:16.100 align:middle line:84%
and haven't really
thought much about it.

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.440 align:middle line:10%
But when you do that
kind of research

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.440 align:middle line:10%
into the things which
are found on the Earth

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:10%
that we can explain--

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:27.650 align:middle line:10%
pyramids, on the floor of
the ocean, and great temples,

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:30.740 align:middle line:10%
and in the Pacific and
in the Atlantic Ocean,

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:32.990 align:middle line:10%
and the pyramids
of Egypt and all

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:37.370 align:middle line:10%
of the wondrous,
beautiful structures

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:40.300 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient and
prehistoric world,

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:42.380 align:middle line:10%
there are just too
many indications

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.410 align:middle line:10%
that there's a higher
civilization that

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.650 align:middle line:10%
has been on this Earth
than we are-- far higher.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:84%
They understood the universe far
better than we do, even today.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.500 align:middle line:84%
And so the Aztec, Maya, the
Incas, the Toltec people,

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.980 align:middle line:84%
the Egyptians,
Babylonians, Sumerians--

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.950 align:middle line:84%
all of these ancient
cultures but far, far smarter

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:05.060 align:middle line:90%
than we are.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.930 align:middle line:90%
We've been learning from them.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Our numerical system
comes from Babylon.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Our understanding
of our religions

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.530 align:middle line:84%
and the concepts
in our religions

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:20.030 align:middle line:84%
come from Egypt, come from the
Hindus, the ancient Hindus.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:84%
So I am totally convinced,
as many other researchers

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and writers on the subject,
that we are not as wonderful

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.250 align:middle line:90%
as we think we are.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
But there were far
more civilizations

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.050 align:middle line:90%
that were far more adapted--

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:42.770 align:middle line:90%
science-- and taught us today.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:45.600 align:middle line:90%
They taught us.

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we're being
manipulated even today

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:84%
by what we call government
and governmental officials.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at the history,
going back 6,000 years,

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.900 align:middle line:84%
it seems as though there's
always been an overshadowing

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:06.970 align:middle line:84%
intelligence behind our
evolution and our destiny.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Someone smarter than we
are has been guiding us.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:20.180 align:middle line:10%
The idea that we have
been created by a higher

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:26.030 align:middle line:10%
form of life, a higher
civilization has created us,

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:29.300 align:middle line:10%
it implies that
they, in creating us,

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:35.390 align:middle line:10%
have purposely not given us
full potential because you don't

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.890 align:middle line:10%
do that with a new experiment.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.530 align:middle line:84%
You just bring it along little
by little and guide it the way

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.200 align:middle line:90%
you want it to develop.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't have the
wherewithal, intellectually

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:54.620 align:middle line:84%
speaking, to break away
from the masters who

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:84%
have created this Earth and
seem to feel that they own us

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.500 align:middle line:90%
and that they can control us.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:04.010 align:middle line:84%
We don't really have
the wherewithal.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:08.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason why is
because knowledge is power.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't understand
some of this hidden knowledge

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:17.510 align:middle line:84%
and hidden history of who we
are and how we've got here,

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.400 align:middle line:84%
if you don't
understand that, you're

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:23.630 align:middle line:84%
never going to understand why
we don't have the power that we

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.850 align:middle line:90%
could have if we join together.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:31.560 align:middle line:90%


00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Even in the biblical
understanding

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:39.150 align:middle line:84%
of the creation by man, it says
that God made man and woman

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.240 align:middle line:90%
in his image after his likeness.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And so it tells us
something about our creator

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.400 align:middle line:90%
by looking at ourselves.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:84%
Because if our
creator was like us

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and we are in that
image and likeness,

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.660 align:middle line:84%
then there are many
good people who

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.790 align:middle line:84%
are working to help
the human family

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and help to educate
and to protect

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:06.840 align:middle line:84%
while there's many bad who
want to just use us for slaves.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.610 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there are
good extraterrestrial life

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:15.180 align:middle line:84%
forms here who want
to see us progress,

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.860 align:middle line:84%
but they also are aware that
we should not become too smart.

00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:23.910 align:middle line:84%
Because if we become too
smart and too clever,

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:27.237 align:middle line:84%
we may be presenting more
trouble for everyone else

00:24:27.237 --> 00:24:28.320 align:middle line:90%
out there in the universe.

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Because we're already talking
about going out to the stars

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:36.690 align:middle line:84%
and setting up new
civilizations on other planets.

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:40.380 align:middle line:84%
But the extraterrestrials look
at us and think, wait a minute.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.900 align:middle line:84%
You're talking about
coming out to the stars

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.050 align:middle line:84%
and setting up new civilizations
like the one you've

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.400 align:middle line:90%
got on Earth today?

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.230 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.140 align:middle line:84%
With all the violence,
and pornography,

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:56.560 align:middle line:84%
and drug addiction, and
murder, and all the bad blood

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.130 align:middle line:84%
among peoples, and you're
going to bring that out

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.450 align:middle line:90%
into the universe?

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.890 align:middle line:90%
You better think about that.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:05.300 align:middle line:90%


00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.080 align:middle line:10%
I think the bottom line
on this is that there

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.120 align:middle line:10%
are two sides to this story.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.280 align:middle line:84%
There are some good
extraterrestrials aliens,

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.070 align:middle line:90%
and there are some who are evil.

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:22.040 align:middle line:84%
Same thing can be said
for the human family.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.880 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
mean everyone's bad.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:27.094 align:middle line:84%
It just means the ones who
are bad are more vocal,

00:25:27.094 --> 00:25:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and you'll see
what they're doing.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:31.380 align:middle line:90%


00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:35.430 align:middle line:84%
Because of the conditions that
the world that we live in today

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:39.720 align:middle line:84%
exhibits that there is a
dark force in this world

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:45.670 align:middle line:84%
that tends to cause man
heartache, and tragedy,

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and drug addiction,
and alcoholism.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- this
is just my opinion--

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:84%
but I think that the reason
why there is so much, again,

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:01.080 align:middle line:84%
drug addiction, alcoholism, the
movement toward "I" and "me"

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and I want what I want,
I think all of that

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:09.840 align:middle line:84%
is part of the frustration of
the human family that realizes

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.030 align:middle line:84%
it's capable of so much more but
that the powers that be over us

00:26:15.030 --> 00:26:16.360 align:middle line:90%
keep us down.

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.160 align:middle line:90%
They won't let you.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:20.880 align:middle line:84%
If you're too smart, you're
going to be in trouble.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.860 align:middle line:84%
Government doesn't
want you to smart

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:28.200 align:middle line:84%
unless you're working
for government.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:30.420 align:middle line:10%
I think when we
were being created,

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:34.010 align:middle line:10%
we were being created
with some kind

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:10%
of an inborn or
hard-wired complex in us

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.270 align:middle line:10%
that we want to look
to something higher.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.740 align:middle line:90%
We want to look to a father.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.950 align:middle line:84%
We want to have a
mother, and father,

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:48.050 align:middle line:84%
and they take care
of us, And they

00:26:48.050 --> 00:26:49.670 align:middle line:90%
make all the decisions for us.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:52.940 align:middle line:84%
So we can just go out, and
play, and have fun as children.

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Because we have the authorities
who take care of us.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that that
stays with the human race.

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:03.560 align:middle line:84%
Because all we are today, all
the adults on the Earth today,

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.530 align:middle line:90%
are just grown-up children.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.390 align:middle line:84%
Most of the adults
think like children.

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:13.400 align:middle line:84%
They don't have an education of
a really well-informed adult.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And so I think that that's
the problem is that our makers

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:21.110 align:middle line:84%
and whoever they were
want to keep us ignorant.

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.710 align:middle line:84%
Because that way, they
can control you better.

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you start
getting too smart,

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:30.170 align:middle line:84%
you start asking the
wrong kind of questions.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And now, you're going
to be in trouble.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.510 align:middle line:10%
Because now, you, as an
investigative reporter,

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.660 align:middle line:10%
you're starting to look at
things going on in this world

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.740 align:middle line:10%
that you're not
supposed to talk about.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:44.420 align:middle line:84%
The best way to
control people is

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.625 align:middle line:84%
to keep them frightened
and confused.

00:27:46.625 --> 00:27:49.680 align:middle line:90%


00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Even the Bible said, basically,
that if the human race

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:84%
were to ever put down its arms,
and stop fighting each other,

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.470 align:middle line:84%
and join together, and use their
minds, and use their spirits,

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.780 align:middle line:84%
that they would be
invincible-- that they

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.390 align:middle line:84%
would be an incredible
civilization

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:12.950 align:middle line:84%
on this Earth of extraordinarily
brilliant creatures,

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:14.490 align:middle line:90%
human beings.

00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And so to keep that from
happening-- because if we

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.600 align:middle line:84%
get too smart, our
creators, or those

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.300 align:middle line:84%
who think that they
own us and control us,

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.520 align:middle line:84%
will have bigger problems
trying to control us.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So they keep us ignorant,
and ill-informed, and unread,

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:33.470 align:middle line:84%
and fighting among
ourselves like children.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.290 align:middle line:90%
That keeps us out of their way.

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:37.884 align:middle line:90%
They don't do what we do.

00:28:37.884 --> 00:28:39.050 align:middle line:90%
They don't fight each other.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.260 align:middle line:90%


00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.460 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there
is something to the idea

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:47.890 align:middle line:84%
that there is an
extraterrestrial presence

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:52.390 align:middle line:84%
in our solar system, and
it has been communicating

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:56.560 align:middle line:84%
with certain humans on the
earth, giving them knowledge.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.690 align:middle line:10%
And so the knowledge
is now out there

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:02.930 align:middle line:10%
that Saturn is very important
to the extraterrestrial world.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.060 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.410 align:middle line:84%

thank you for watching.
