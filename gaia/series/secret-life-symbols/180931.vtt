Life of Symbols."

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.850 align:middle line:10%
>> On this episode I'd like
to talk a little bit about

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.795 align:middle line:10%
the sun, and its symbolic
importance in the whole story

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:29.595 align:middle line:10%
of the zodiac.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, as we begin the
story of the sun,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient
religions of the world,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and how much the sun has
dominated civilization

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.730 align:middle line:84%
for as long as we
have records, we

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.580 align:middle line:84%
need to go back to
the very beginning.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:90%
And that's a long time ago.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to Egypt.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.750 align:middle line:84%
We'll start in
Egypt because that's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.810 align:middle line:84%
one of the oldest
civilizations on the Earth.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And we will see
how Egypt developed

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
the concept of the importance
of the sun in relation

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.460 align:middle line:84%
to theology, spirituality,
and religion.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is an ancient symbol
for the sun, prehistoric,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
that the ancient peoples
drew to represent the sun.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.350 align:middle line:10%
It's an equal armed
cross within the circle.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.180 align:middle line:84%
Here is an artifact that
was found in England.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.066 align:middle line:90%
On its own hinge.

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's on a golden circle,
which represents the sun.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.700 align:middle line:10%
And then you'll see
the cross in between.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.290 align:middle line:84%
And this is about
4,500 years old.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Almost 5,000 years
ago ancient mankind

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.040 align:middle line:84%
drew pictures of what
they perceived the sun

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.740 align:middle line:90%
to be as an equal armed cross.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:84%
And you will see it also in the
ancient religions of the Near

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:84%
and Middle East, the different
ancient gods in the Phoenician,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.420 align:middle line:90%
Canaanite, Sumerian systems.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.030 align:middle line:84%
They all had the
equal armed cross.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's important to remember
that the sun was never

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.320 align:middle line:90%
perceived as a god.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
It was perceived to represent
the spiritual qualities of God.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And that it brought
life to the Earth.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.220 align:middle line:90%
It brought warmth to the Earth.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And brought energy
for us to live.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.000 align:middle line:84%
So all of the good things
about God and his creation

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.340 align:middle line:84%
was best represented by
this symbol of the sun.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the sun
actually even looks

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.690 align:middle line:84%
like it has an equal armed
cross in the heavens.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:10%
The reason why four
equal arms on the cross

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:10%
is because there are four
equal seasons of the year.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.680 align:middle line:84%
We have north, east, west,
and south, the four corners.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Then each one of
those four corners

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:90%
represents a season of the year.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.700 align:middle line:90%
Spring, summer, autumn, winter.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:84%
This is why you have four
gospels, Matthew, Mark,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:90%
Luke, and John.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.280 align:middle line:10%
Because they're talking
about the life of the sun.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.280 align:middle line:84%
The ancient peoples,
like us today, we

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.310 align:middle line:84%
draw a circle, a round
circle, and we divide it

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:90%
into four equal parts.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.096 align:middle line:84%
And so now you have an equal
armed cross inside of a circle.

00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Spring, summer, autumn, winter.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.580 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
symbolism in the Bible

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
that we have misunderstood
and mistaken.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.400 align:middle line:10%
The whole idea is the four
lodging places of the sun.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.520 align:middle line:84%
It gives us our four
seasons of the year.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.840 align:middle line:84%
You will find the equal armed
cross all over the world.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.320 align:middle line:10%
Every race, creed, and
color has the same symbol

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.870 align:middle line:10%
for the ancient sun.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.210 align:middle line:90%
The Nordics had the symbol.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:90%
The Vikings kept the symbol.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.660 align:middle line:10%
Ancient France used the symbol.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.560 align:middle line:84%
This symbol was on rocks,
and carvings, and paintings.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.360 align:middle line:84%
Even in India you have
the equal armed cross.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.210 align:middle line:10%
The Celtic and the
Celtic druids in Europe,

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.540 align:middle line:10%
in England and Ireland
had an equal armed cross.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.950 align:middle line:10%
Native Americans used
it, Central American,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.040 align:middle line:10%
and especially Mayan,
and Inca, and some

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient religions
in South America

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:10%
have used the equal armed cross.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:84%
So it became known
around the world

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.710 align:middle line:84%
that the equal armed
cross within a circle

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.405 align:middle line:84%
represented the 5,000 year old
petroglyph concept of the sun.

00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:10%
Today, people see it everywhere.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.950 align:middle line:10%
And so it has become
not really important,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.870 align:middle line:10%
because it's just
a general symbol

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.990 align:middle line:10%
that people realize is a cross.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Here is a picture of the
ancient Nordic peoples

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
that were preparing for
what we would call today

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:90%
the Easter sunrise service.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.010 align:middle line:84%
Here the ancient
peoples in Europe

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.590 align:middle line:84%
realize that the
sun was coming back

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.050 align:middle line:90%
to the northern hemisphere.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:84%
And it would bring with it the
warmth, the food, and life.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
And so they all gathered
with their sun symbol

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
to welcome back the sun
that had died in winter,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and it was coming back to
the northern hemisphere.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
It became known as what
we call today Easter.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.080 align:middle line:84%
The circle on the cross is
not a man dying on the cross.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the sun on the north,
east, west, and southern parches

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.210 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.250 align:middle line:84%
The idea being, of
course, is that when

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.300 align:middle line:84%
the sun dies in
winter, and then when

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.920 align:middle line:84%
it is reborn on December
25, the sun actually

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:90%
begins to move northward.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.870 align:middle line:84%
And when it does,
that tells the world

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.310 align:middle line:84%
that the sun is now coming back
to the northern hemisphere,

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.210 align:middle line:84%
bringing back the sun to us
in the northern hemisphere.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Because for us, in the
northern hemisphere,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:84%
the sun was dead
to us, because it

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.870 align:middle line:90%
was in the southern hemisphere.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.560 align:middle line:84%
But now it's being born
again, and coming back

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.230 align:middle line:90%
to the northern hemisphere.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:84%
That's the whole
story in itself is

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.200 align:middle line:84%
the vision of the sun
going southward and dying

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.340 align:middle line:84%
on the cross, and then
being reborn on December 25

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.680 align:middle line:84%
when it moves one
degree northward.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And now it is coming back and
sort of springing back to life.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And so in the spring, we call
it springing back to life.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, you will have
this symbol everywhere.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
And even the European
agency for the euro

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.480 align:middle line:84%
uses the same equal armed
cross to represent the new Euro

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.580 align:middle line:90%
establishment.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.120 align:middle line:10%
You will always find in
royalty throughout the world,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:10%
royalty and governments always
use this equal armed cross.

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.340 align:middle line:10%
The Nazis used it.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.660 align:middle line:10%
Even in the parade
of the Nazis used

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.280 align:middle line:10%
the swastika, which is a
symbol of the sun also.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:10%
But you will see
also that they are

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:10%
using the equal armed cross.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.210 align:middle line:10%
Coptic Christians.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:10%
Even the kings and rulers,
like the emperors of Europe

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.850 align:middle line:10%
always had the equal armed
cross on their staff.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Equal armed cross with
the sun god and churches.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:84%
In mid September
around the world,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Christians will gather in
schools and universities

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:49.390 align:middle line:84%
to worship their god
Jesus who died on a cross.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And what they call this
ritual, see you at the pole.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:58.010 align:middle line:84%
See you at the pole means that
Christians will gather around

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
the flagpole at their
colleges and schools

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.540 align:middle line:84%
to venerate and to
worship Jesus, God's son,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.510 align:middle line:90%
the light of the world.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, the sun
is the light of the world.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:10%
But here are Christians
gathering to worship Jesus,

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.680 align:middle line:10%
never realizing that
they are actually

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.030 align:middle line:10%
meeting around a very ancient
symbol of the old petroglyph

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.480 align:middle line:10%
cross.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.510 align:middle line:84%
That this symbol of an equal
armed cross within the circle

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:36.700 align:middle line:84%
represents an old ancient idea
of how to picture the sun.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:84%
And it's really extraordinary
to notice that all churches use

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:42.919 align:middle line:90%
that same symbol.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:10%
And all over the
world people do not

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:50.410 align:middle line:10%
realize that this
cross that they

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:56.680 align:middle line:10%
think represents Christianity is
actually over 5,000 years old.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.860 align:middle line:10%
It's an ancient prehistoric
symbol of the sun.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:10.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:20.265 align:middle line:84%
Jesus has always represented
the sun, the S-U-N. Not S-O-N.

00:09:20.265 --> 00:09:23.760 align:middle line:84%
The etymology of the
word for the sun.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:27.710 align:middle line:84%
You see that sun can
be S-U-N or S-O-N.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:30.550 align:middle line:90%
And depending on how it's used.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:84%
S-O-N and S-U-N are
used interchangeably

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:34.950 align:middle line:90%
in Christianity.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.190 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
Illustrations in the
Christian church,

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
you will see they are all
actually a round, glowing sun.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:52.230 align:middle line:84%
Not a young child, or a baby,
or a man, but the S-U-N.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.310 align:middle line:90%
There's two words.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:58.710 align:middle line:84%
S-U-N, and S-O-N. But
Christianity and Judaism

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.106 align:middle line:84%
are based on the
worship of the S-U-N,

00:10:02.106 --> 00:10:06.150 align:middle line:84%
not S-O-N. That's
a misunderstanding.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:10.110 align:middle line:84%
That misunderstanding
is part of the history

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:90%
of the English language.

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go back into
the King's old English,

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:18.420 align:middle line:84%
you go back into the history
of the English language,

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:22.080 align:middle line:84%
there is a phenomena which in
English class you will learn

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.680 align:middle line:90%
is called the lazy O.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
The lazy O is a
phenomena in English

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.480 align:middle line:84%
which means that
translators always

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:84%
translated sun, S-O-N and
S-U-N all in the same sentence.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And so it became
known as the lazy O.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.910 align:middle line:84%
They were talking
about the S-U-N.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.160 align:middle line:84%
But they used S-O-N
because they were lazy.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.450 align:middle line:90%
They just used either one.

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.410 align:middle line:84%
The mother of Jesus is Mary,
which is actually Mari,

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:59.340 align:middle line:84%
M-A-R-I. Not M-A-R-Y.
Mari means pure.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:05.510 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, the mother of
Jesus is a virgin, or Virgo.

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.570 align:middle line:10%
One of the 12 signs of the
zodiac is a Virgo, the Virgin.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:14.550 align:middle line:10%
So here is Mari, or
Mary, the Virgin, Virgo,

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:20.775 align:middle line:10%
holding the baby Jesus, or God's
sun, the light of the world.

00:11:20.775 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:84%
Today we still have Jesus
as God's son in the heavens.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:84%
And he became now
a great sun god.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:38.110 align:middle line:10%
But the question you need to ask
yourself is, who owns the sun?

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:10%
We assume that the sun
must be owned by someone.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:45.340 align:middle line:10%
Well, mankind
doesn't own the sun.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.640 align:middle line:84%
If anything, you would say
maybe God owns the sun.

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.570 align:middle line:84%
So if God owns the sun,
then it's God's sun.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.010 align:middle line:90%
And he's the light of the world.

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.320 align:middle line:84%
Of course the sun is
the light of the world.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:03.250 align:middle line:10%
Looking at the communion host,
the Catholic communion host,

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.310 align:middle line:10%
you will see it always
looks like the old, ancient

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:08.720 align:middle line:10%
petroglyph sun.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.980 align:middle line:10%
You'll see that the
sun in Jesus' hand

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.430 align:middle line:10%
represents the S-U-N.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:19.780 align:middle line:10%
The holy Eucharist
represents the sun.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.510 align:middle line:84%
This is why the priests
in the church on Sundays

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.925 align:middle line:90%
will raise the sun.

00:12:24.925 --> 00:12:26.440 align:middle line:10%
They will raise it.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.240 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.720 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
what the sun does.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:90%
It rises.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:90%
So the sun rises.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.220 align:middle line:84%
This is why we have
the symbols on the host

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:90%
in the Catholic church.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.700 align:middle line:84%
It is always the
old petroglyph sun.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.150 align:middle line:10%
Jesus means God is with us.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:10%
And you will see the priest
is representing Jesus how?

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.870 align:middle line:10%
As a sun.

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.290 align:middle line:84%
All of this goes back many,
many thousands and thousands

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.890 align:middle line:84%
of years before
Christianity ever existed.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.230 align:middle line:84%
And it has nothing to do
with Christianity at all.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:05.170 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with exactly what
it's showing, sun worship.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And today we're still
doing the same thing.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.880 align:middle line:90%
We're worshipping the sun.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And you will see the
sun is prominent in all

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.200 align:middle line:90%
of Catholicism.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.380 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you
look in Catholicism

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.040 align:middle line:90%
are worshipers of the sun.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:10%
Now, here we have a picture of
Jesus giving to the children

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.590 align:middle line:10%
a part of his body.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:29.820 align:middle line:90%
And what is he giving them?

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.970 align:middle line:90%
A little, round sun disc.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.630 align:middle line:10%
We're told that we should
all take part of his body

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.430 align:middle line:10%
at the first communion.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.120 align:middle line:84%
And at Communion in
the Catholic church

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.760 align:middle line:84%
you take a part of
God's sun's body.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.960 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is very obvious
what's being talked about here.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.680 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking
about sun worship.

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:54.600 align:middle line:90%


00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.410 align:middle line:10%
The idea that the
sun dies on the cross

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:10%
goes back to the old
petroglyph cross.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.240 align:middle line:10%
And so that's where
we see it now,

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.790 align:middle line:10%
all over the world,
all of Christianity.

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:10%
You'll see the sun is
always dying on the cross,

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.260 align:middle line:10%
because in the southern
constellations when you go down

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:16.050 align:middle line:10%
south, when the sun
reaches the lowest

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:10%
part in the sky in the
southern hemisphere,

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:22.080 align:middle line:10%
there is a constellation
of stars that

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.600 align:middle line:10%
look just exactly like a cross.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And so we say the sun,
when it dies in December,

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.810 align:middle line:84%
it goes down and
dies on the cross.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.500 align:middle line:84%
The cross is called
the Southern Cross.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.990 align:middle line:84%
When he was dead, but
now he's coming back

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:84%
to the northern
hemisphere, because he

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.740 align:middle line:90%
promised he would return.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And he is returning,
again, in the spring.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Solar symbolism of the sun
going southward each day

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.890 align:middle line:84%
until it finally
reaches December 22 when

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:58.950 align:middle line:84%
it's at its lowest point
in the southern sky--

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.350 align:middle line:90%
it's down in the south now.

00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.220 align:middle line:90%
It's gone south.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.080 align:middle line:84%
But on December 22, the sun
goes as far in the South

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.070 align:middle line:90%
as it's going to go.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And it stops going
southward on December 22.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't go any
further southward.

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:84%
Then on the 23rd and 24th,
it rises on the same degree.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, for three
days it doesn't move at all.

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.760 align:middle line:90%
It stays the same degree.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.670 align:middle line:84%
So we say, and
the ancient people

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:84%
said that Jesus, our God's
sun, died for three days.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.530 align:middle line:90%
Because it was moving every day.

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.620 align:middle line:84%
And now it's not
moving for three days.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So for three days
the sun was dead.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And on December 25, the sun
moves one degree northward,

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:84%
which indicates, and
even the United States

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Navy will show you
on their instruments,

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.280 align:middle line:84%
that it indicates the
sun is now alive again.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.190 align:middle line:90%
He is born again.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Now he's going to
work his way back

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.690 align:middle line:90%
to the northern hemisphere.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:01.720 align:middle line:84%
Because God's sun
said, I will return.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, he does.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:05.540 align:middle line:90%
He returns every year.

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:90%
So what do you see?

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.120 align:middle line:10%
Do you see a man on this cross?

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.250 align:middle line:84%
Do you see a man
dying on the cross?

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.730 align:middle line:84%
This is what is actually
meant by dying on the cross.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:17.530 align:middle line:90%
It's the sun.

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:20.070 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
During the summer when the sun
is in the northern hemisphere,

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:84%
it is in the
constellation of Leo.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
So he is the lion of
the tribe of Judah.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And then when he dies, he
dies in Capricorn, down south

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.840 align:middle line:90%
when he goes south.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And so now he dies
in the winter.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And then he comes back
and springs back to life.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And when he comes back to
the northern hemisphere,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:50.040 align:middle line:90%
we call it spring.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.890 align:middle line:84%
But when it crosses
the equator--

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:84%
the sun will have to cross
the equator coming back to us

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.780 align:middle line:90%
in the north.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.540 align:middle line:84%
When it crosses
the equator, it is

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.680 align:middle line:84%
said to have passed
over the equator.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.230 align:middle line:10%
So in the Hebrew religion,
when the sun passes over,

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.780 align:middle line:10%
coming back to the
northern hemisphere,

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.520 align:middle line:10%
they call that
celebration the Passover.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.190 align:middle line:84%
But for Christians,
they're worshipping the sun

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:22.410 align:middle line:90%
also as it passes over.

00:17:22.410 --> 00:17:26.430 align:middle line:84%
But they refer to it
as the Resurrection.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And the God's sun
has been resurrected.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.980 align:middle line:90%
He's come back.

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how you say it,

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.030 align:middle line:90%
a Resurrection or a Passover.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.910 align:middle line:84%
It just means the sun
is coming back to us

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:90%
in the northern hemisphere.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Sun worship is a
very old religion,

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.430 align:middle line:84%
dating back thousands of
years before the Roman Empire.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But in Rome, the sun
god was called Mithra.

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:03.400 align:middle line:84%
Mithraism was the main religion
in the Roman Empire at the time

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:08.980 align:middle line:84%
that Christianity was coming
into play in the Roman Empire.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Emperor Constantine was
a follower of Mithra.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And Mithra was God's
sun who died on a cross.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.070 align:middle line:84%
He was dead for three
days and rose again.

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
The Emperor Constantine was
famous for starting the Roman

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:90%
Catholic church.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.830 align:middle line:84%
The Roman Catholic church
was not started by Jesus.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.950 align:middle line:84%
It was started by
a Roman emperor.

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.880 align:middle line:84%
And it was headquartered
in Rome, not in heaven.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:37.540 align:middle line:10%
It was mixing Judaism,
and Mithraism, and some

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.200 align:middle line:10%
of the other religions
of the Arabic world

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.900 align:middle line:10%
that also worshipped
the sun, and brought

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:10%
all of these different
religions together in order

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:52.150 align:middle line:10%
to confirm the power of Caesar
in Rome under one religion,

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:53.900 align:middle line:10%
and one government.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So it was actually
a world government

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:90%
supposedly at the time.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.400 align:middle line:90%
Catholic means universal.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Air is Catholic, because
air all over the world.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:90%
Water is Catholic.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:11.600 align:middle line:84%
Anything which is
all over the world

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.120 align:middle line:84%
is Catholic, because
it's a Latin word that

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.490 align:middle line:90%
means universal.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Constantine was trying to unite
all the religions of the Roman

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:22.610 align:middle line:90%
Empire into one.

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Religious divisions
are very dangerous.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.540 align:middle line:84%
And they can also harbor
treason and anti government.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And so Caesar realized if he
could bring all the religions

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:41.300 align:middle line:84%
into one religion, and
call it Christianity,

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.240 align:middle line:84%
and yet it would have all
the parts of everyone else's

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.050 align:middle line:84%
religion-- it would have
Judaism worship of the sun.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:84%
It would have Yahweh
as a part of it.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.030 align:middle line:84%
It would have Mithraism
as a part of it.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:84%
So that everyone could agree
to follow one religion, which

00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:59.750 align:middle line:90%
Caesar would rule from.

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.130 align:middle line:90%
He would rule from.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:90%
And so it was a political move.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:08.030 align:middle line:10%
But the point is that
Constantine, the Roman emperor,

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:10%
founded the Roman
Catholic church.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.730 align:middle line:90%


00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:19.410 align:middle line:84%
This is a Sumerian picturing
the sun on the altar.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:84%
In the ancient world the
Phoenician Canaanite Sumerians,

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.300 align:middle line:84%
the Hittites, all of
these ancient cultures

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.970 align:middle line:90%
always had helmets.

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:84%
Their military wore helmets
with the rising sun symbol.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:37.560 align:middle line:84%
The rising sun symbol
is still used even today

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:84%
around the world on
helmets and military.

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.610 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:47.170 align:middle line:10%
Here in Rome you'll see the
Romans wearing the rising sun.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:50.850 align:middle line:10%
Again, you will see
here where the Romans,

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:54.430 align:middle line:10%
they were brutal
rulers of the people.

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:57.970 align:middle line:10%
But their symbol
was the rising sun.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And so now let's look
at the sun worship

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:84%
today and its ancient
foundation, which

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.340 align:middle line:90%
was the cult of Sol Invictus.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Sol Invictus is Sol, which
is the sun, and invincible.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:15.190 align:middle line:84%
The sun was said by the
Romans, it was invincible.

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:middle line:90%
Why was the sun invincible?

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Because every year it came
into its power in the summer.

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:24.880 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
die in the winter

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:90%
to the northern hemisphere.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.440 align:middle line:90%
But it would come back.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:33.050 align:middle line:84%
Every year it would come back
to the northern hemisphere.

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:84%
So it may die in the winter,
but it's coming back.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:90%
It's invincible.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:38.890 align:middle line:90%
You can't keep it down.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:42.972 align:middle line:10%
And so we see today
the pictures of Sol.

00:21:42.972 --> 00:21:47.360 align:middle line:10%
And he is the sun
riding across the sky.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.490 align:middle line:10%
The sun was pictured
in Rome as riding

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.280 align:middle line:10%
on a chariot across heaven.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And so the sun was
that lucky old sun

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:02.050 align:middle line:84%
riding around heaven all day,
roaming around heaven all day,

00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:90%
obviously on a chariot.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.403 align:middle line:90%
And here is Sol Invicti.

00:22:07.403 --> 00:22:10.570 align:middle line:90%
Or this is a picture of Mithra.

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
And it shows us the sun spokes,
the sun rays around his head,

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.620 align:middle line:90%
the sun god of Rome.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:20.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the doctoral
thesis there

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:24.640 align:middle line:84%
was a very important book called
"The Cult of Sol Invictus."

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:10%
And in it, it shows you
all of the connections

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:31.300 align:middle line:10%
with the Roman government,
the Roman religion,

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.620 align:middle line:10%
the Roman commerce, the
entire state of Rome.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.030 align:middle line:84%
And the ancient Roman Empire
was all based on the sun.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:43.090 align:middle line:10%
And you'll see like
the sun cult up

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:10%
to the first century
of the empire,

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.070 align:middle line:10%
the political background
of it, the establishment

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:10%
of the cult of Sol Invicti,
the dogma, the teachings

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:54.250 align:middle line:10%
of the ancient religion.

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:59.560 align:middle line:84%
Deus Sol Invictus is
the true Roman sun god.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.810 align:middle line:10%
Of course, the Roman
sun worship can

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:07.760 align:middle line:10%
be traced back to the ancient
Egyptian sun god, Amen-Ra.

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:13.530 align:middle line:10%
So Amen-Ra was-- we use
the word today R-A-Y, ray.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:14.950 align:middle line:10%
Sun ray.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:19.420 align:middle line:10%
But the ancient Egyptians
called their god, Ra.

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.230 align:middle line:10%
That's where ray comes from.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:10%
So it was called the cult of
Ra, or the cult of the sun ray.

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.310 align:middle line:10%
And so here is Amen-Ray,
the official name

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:10%
of the sun god in Egypt.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:32.770 align:middle line:10%
Amen-Ray.

00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:38.980 align:middle line:10%
A-M-E-N hyphen R-A.
Here's Amen-Ra again.

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:42.820 align:middle line:10%
Now, when you see Amen-Ra,
the Egyptian sun god

00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:44.810 align:middle line:10%
was the supreme god
of the universe,

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:48.610 align:middle line:10%
as said by the Egyptians.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.680 align:middle line:84%
But what is
important to remember

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:56.110 align:middle line:84%
is that Amen-Ra today in
our supposed modern day

00:23:56.110 --> 00:24:00.190 align:middle line:84%
world and our Christian church,
both Catholic and Protestant,

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:04.540 align:middle line:84%
they refuse to give up the
old pagan sun cult of Amen-Ra.

00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:08.020 align:middle line:84%
And so today this is why
when you pray to God,

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:11.080 align:middle line:84%
you end up by saying
amen, because you're

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.550 align:middle line:84%
sending your prayer
through God's sun, Amen-Ra.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:19.300 align:middle line:84%
The Catholic church is replete
with all kinds of suns symbols.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.260 align:middle line:84%
You'll always see the Pope
wearing large sun symbols.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.430 align:middle line:10%
It's on his head.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:26.980 align:middle line:90%
It's on his gloves.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:90%
It's on the outside of churches.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.050 align:middle line:10%
It's at the top
of churches also,

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.450 align:middle line:10%
implying the sun is risen.

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:39.470 align:middle line:10%
And the sun rays are
dominating the Catholic church

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:40.270 align:middle line:10%
all over the world.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:90%


00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.590 align:middle line:84%
So here are paintings on
the wall of the Vatican,

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.740 align:middle line:84%
showing the angels,
showing the worker--

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.720 align:middle line:90%
the common man, the worker--

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:56.520 align:middle line:84%
to look to the sun for his
food, and for his life,

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.580 align:middle line:90%
and for everything.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:01.220 align:middle line:84%
God's sun is the
light of the world.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.080 align:middle line:10%
And so the Catholic
church or the Vatican

00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.490 align:middle line:10%
is promoting sun worship.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:10.740 align:middle line:10%
Everywhere the Catholic
church and Christians meet,

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.470 align:middle line:10%
you will see the sun.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:18.350 align:middle line:10%
This is a convention held in
the United States for the pope,

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:22.710 align:middle line:10%
and to honor the pope, and to
honor the Catholic presence

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:23.910 align:middle line:10%
in America.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:29.460 align:middle line:84%
But you will see that there is
a sun in the middle representing

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Christianity.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.010 align:middle line:84%
God's sun, the
light of the world.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.600 align:middle line:90%
"The Savior is Born."

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:41.670 align:middle line:84%
Here are pictures from modern
day magazines of Christians.

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:90%
"The Savior is Born."

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:44.170 align:middle line:90%
Is there a child?

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:45.330 align:middle line:90%
You'll see a child there?

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:46.130 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:90%
You'll see the sun.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.160 align:middle line:90%
And so the sun is always golden.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:56.370 align:middle line:10%
So the little son of God has
the spokes of the ancient cross

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:10%
behind his head.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.390 align:middle line:10%
You will see he's
always pictured

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.440 align:middle line:10%
as a blonde, or the sun baby.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And here's the mother
holding her son.

00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And here in the Vatican is a
very interesting picture of--

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.850 align:middle line:84%
this is a sculpture
in the Vatican.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:19.230 align:middle line:84%
And it is showing Jesus'
mother, the Virgin, which

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.620 align:middle line:84%
is Virgo, the Virgin
of the zodiac,

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:29.250 align:middle line:84%
holding her newborn sun, S-U-N.
And this is in the Vatican.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:33.630 align:middle line:84%
Both baby Jesus and
the grown up Jesus

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:37.230 align:middle line:84%
are trying to show you
what it's all symbolizing.

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:39.540 align:middle line:90%
It's symbolizing sun worship.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Here you have the baby
Jesus showing you the sun.

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.400 align:middle line:10%
Here the sun worship in
the Jerusalem temple,

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.820 align:middle line:10%
the ancient Hebrews
worshipping the sun.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:54.540 align:middle line:10%
Today we have the pope all
over the world carrying

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.060 align:middle line:10%
the sun's symbol for the sun.

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:59.340 align:middle line:90%
This is not a man on a cross.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.700 align:middle line:90%
This is obviously sun worship.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And you will see
the sun everywhere.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.270 align:middle line:90%
Here's the pope.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.610 align:middle line:84%
This is what is being
promoted throughout the world

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:13.680 align:middle line:84%
as Christianity, but which
is in fact sun worship.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, the ancient Egyptians
pictured the sun had wings.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And we see the sun as
rolling across heaven.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:28.860 align:middle line:10%
The sun in India, and the
Hindu worship of the sun.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:33.600 align:middle line:10%
Now, here we have the Inca
priest kneeling on an altar,

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:39.770 align:middle line:10%
and offering up the wine and
the altar to the sun god.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:43.200 align:middle line:90%
The same you will see in Japan.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.190 align:middle line:10%
You'll see in England
the singing praises

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:50.430 align:middle line:10%
and a hymn to the rising sun.

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:53.890 align:middle line:84%
The wood carving
picture of the Jews.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:56.460 align:middle line:90%
And worshipping the sun.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:28:00.970 align:middle line:84%
And here, again, are the four
gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke,

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:02.220 align:middle line:90%
and John.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And they are writing about
their Savior, the sun.

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Because Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.780 align:middle line:84%
are spring, summer,
autumn, winter.

00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:14.370 align:middle line:84%
The four seasons
are symbolically

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:90%
represented by four gospels.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.330 align:middle line:84%
This is a very important book
showing the sun in the church

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:22.470 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Cathedrals are
solar observatories.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course, in India, the
most important sun god in India

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:90%
was Krishna.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:39.540 align:middle line:84%
We know that the Jesuits,
when they went into India back

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:44.640 align:middle line:84%
in the 1500s, they learned
very quickly the whole religion

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.830 align:middle line:84%
of God's sun, the light
of the world in India,

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:90%
who was Krishna.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And they came back and
infiltrated those teachings

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:56.610 align:middle line:84%
and concepts into what
we call Christianity.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.960 align:middle line:84%
This is the work of the
church borrowing the stories

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:06.600 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient world of sun
gods who died on the cross.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, here is an ancient
Babylonian king.

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.550 align:middle line:10%
And his name was Shemesh.

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And he was a
Babylonian sun king.

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see the altar in
front of him has the sun.

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.490 align:middle line:90%
But this is very important.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:23.190 align:middle line:10%
A Babylonian king
being worshipped.

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.500 align:middle line:10%
And his name was Shemesh.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:30.150 align:middle line:10%
It's because in the Hebrew
language, or for the Jews,

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:36.090 align:middle line:10%
Shemesh is the sun in
the Jewish language.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Here we have 37 of what
we call suns of God

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:42.780 align:middle line:84%
from the ancient
world to the modern.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:10%
And they all have the same
identity, and the same stories

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:49.050 align:middle line:10%
that go with their lives.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.540 align:middle line:10%
They were born of a virgin.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.580 align:middle line:10%
They died on a cross.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.490 align:middle line:10%
They were dead for three
days, and then was resurrected

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:57.870 align:middle line:10%
and came back.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Their father was a carpenter.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And almost all of these had 12
followers or twelve apostles.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:09.450 align:middle line:84%
They had the same story
that we have in Christianity

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.070 align:middle line:90%
37 times over.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's a continuation of
the same story coming out

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:16.800 align:middle line:90%
of the ancient world.

00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.416 align:middle line:84%
And today we call it
Catholicism, or Christianity.

00:30:22.416 --> 00:30:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So the reason why
these themes keep

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:28.050 align:middle line:84%
repeating themselves is
because it is what is called

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:30.720 align:middle line:90%
the greatest story ever told.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it is the
greatest story ever told,

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.450 align:middle line:84%
that the son is
born each morning,

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:40.560 align:middle line:84%
and ultimately dies at
night, and then emerges

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.810 align:middle line:84%
the next morning, and
bring light back again.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:90%
But then dies again.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole story is on the
subjects of the whole universe,

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
how our skies work, and
how the planets work.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:01.650 align:middle line:84%
I think that the idea that there
are 37 major sun gods, and each

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:06.570 align:middle line:84%
have the same kind of a
story, where they die and were

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.870 align:middle line:84%
resurrected, and they
had a virgin birth,

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:84%
it seems to imply that there was
some sort of an ancient, really

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.640 align:middle line:84%
truly ancient culture
that developed

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:20.250 align:middle line:84%
this idea and this
story for the world.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it has
become known as the greatest

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:28.470 align:middle line:84%
story ever told, because it
is, in fact, the greatest

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:32.040 align:middle line:84%
story ever told, because so many
ancient cultures have picked it

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.690 align:middle line:84%
up and applied it to their own
selves, their own gods, who

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:40.400 align:middle line:84%
had the same story of dying on
a cross and being resurrected.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:45.900 align:middle line:90%


00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:49.450 align:middle line:84%
There will not be any messiah
coming back for the Jews,

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.430 align:middle line:84%
for the Christians, or for any
other religion on the Earth.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:56.340 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on
ancient concepts

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.300 align:middle line:84%
of the prehistoric and
ancient world of the sun

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.850 align:middle line:90%
representing life to the Earth.

00:32:02.850 --> 00:32:06.870 align:middle line:84%
So there won't be any messiah
coming back, because there

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:10.290 align:middle line:90%
was none to start with.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:15.780 align:middle line:84%
It's all based on the sun
being the giver of life.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:21.090 align:middle line:84%
So now that we have the
technology today that we have,

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:25.590 align:middle line:84%
where we can talk to the
world through the system

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:31.260 align:middle line:84%
of technology, we can now begin
to show the whole world where

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:35.820 align:middle line:84%
all of this has come from, all
of these ideas, concepts, gods,

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.550 align:middle line:90%
and sun gods have come from.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:42.170 align:middle line:84%
We're now able to do that with
the technology we have today.

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:45.050 align:middle line:84%
So so many people
today are now beginning

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:49.220 align:middle line:84%
to see that their ancient and
highly venerated religions

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.380 align:middle line:84%
are merely part of a world
continuation of a same story,

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.720 align:middle line:90%
the greatest story ever told.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.080 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm Jordan Maxwell.

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.700 align:middle line:90%
And thanks for watching.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:11.808 align:middle line:90%
