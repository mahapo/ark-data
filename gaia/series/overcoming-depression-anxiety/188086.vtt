00:00:03.437 --> 00:00:07.365 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:14.260 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Carren, a very
warm welcome to you.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a
treat to be here.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.250 align:middle line:90%
So thank you for having me.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.475 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm so excited about
this beautiful conversation

00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:27.100 align:middle line:84%
that I know we're going to have
because I've actually done some

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:90%
of your work.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.439 align:middle line:84%
And you've actually helped
me through a part in my life

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:84%
where I have a lot of anxiety
around public speaking.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And I came along and did
your art of public speaking

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and went on to do a few more
of your courses as well.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.910 align:middle line:84%
And I can't say
how much they have

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.390 align:middle line:84%
helped me address that
particular part of my life

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.650 align:middle line:90%
that was freaking me out.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.075 align:middle line:90%
>> And I remember you well.

00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:50.156 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:50.156 --> 00:00:50.956 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.956 --> 00:00:52.666 align:middle line:90%
>> Freaking out?

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there were moments.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:90%
But I think even amongst--

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I think even amongst all
the work that you did,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:84%
I really watched you
just excel and rise

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:84%
above and beyond everything
that held you back.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
It was almost as if, when
you came into my programs,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.597 align:middle line:84%
you had this sense of
nothing's going to beat me.

00:01:09.597 --> 00:01:10.930 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's going to hold me down.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Nothing's going to hold me back.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:90%
And you totally nailed it.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Aw, that's very sweet of you.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.020 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.736 align:middle line:84%
Well, you're an
amazing entrepreneur.

00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:23.000 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons
that we have chosen

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.870 align:middle line:84%
on Healthy Me Summits
to invite people

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to share their
personal stories is

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.250 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, as part
of the Healthy Me Summits,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.120 align:middle line:84%
we wanted to have the
experts and talking

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.552 align:middle line:84%
about depression and anxiety
and the tools and the science.

00:01:40.552 --> 00:01:42.760 align:middle line:84%
But we also wanted to have
people that come and share

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.790 align:middle line:84%
their personal story,
so that our audience can

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.220 align:middle line:84%
connect to those that
have truly been there

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.120 align:middle line:84%
and connect with people that
are going to offer them,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
through their story, an
opportunity of perhaps

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.640 align:middle line:84%
connecting with something that
resonates with them that they

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:84%
might not have
thought of yet, that

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
can be just that light
bulb moment for them, that

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:84%
could be the turnaround
that, up until now,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.470 align:middle line:84%
they haven't had the opportunity
of connecting to them.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.260 align:middle line:90%
So with that your story--

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.380 align:middle line:84%
and when I met you, I had
no idea of anything at all.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And so when you shared
with us in the workshop

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and the story just sort of
came out, and I was just like,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:90%
oh my god.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.270 align:middle line:84%
How do you ever come
back from such a space?

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So could you just
share with our audience

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.720 align:middle line:90%
what you have been through?

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.320 align:middle line:90%
I can.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the
point that you make

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.560 align:middle line:84%
is that for most people, what
goes on underneath the surface

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.900 align:middle line:84%
and what goes on
behind closed doors,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.220 align:middle line:90%
we don't show the public.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.810 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't come out.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's not worn as a
great scar on our faces.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:84%
But what's happening
underneath the surface

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
can sometimes be this bubbling,
boiling, seething pool

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:90%
of pain and suffering.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons why
I do the work that I do

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.450 align:middle line:84%
is because I want people to
see that as their experiences

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and as their stories,
they can become more.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.710 align:middle line:84%
And they lost their lives can
evolve as a result of that.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.250 align:middle line:84%
And I guess I wouldn't have
known that had I not going

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.720 align:middle line:90%
my own journey.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:90%
So for me, 2001--

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.010 align:middle line:90%
my partner committed suicide.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.627 align:middle line:90%
Now I wasn't expecting it.

00:03:25.627 --> 00:03:27.460 align:middle line:84%
We were going through
some challenging times

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.320 align:middle line:90%
in our relationship.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.250 align:middle line:90%
That's not a secret.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.920 align:middle line:90%
So we were struggling.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:90%
He was in the movie industry.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:90%
And he was away a lot.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I was working long
hours in my role.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And we just were missing
the mark with each other.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.260 align:middle line:90%
One thing led to another.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.780 align:middle line:84%
The relationship wasn't
able to recover itself.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.290 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately for me, I
thought that this would just

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.353 align:middle line:90%
be a thing of time.

00:03:51.353 --> 00:03:53.770 align:middle line:84%
I thought that we would just
keep working together, seeing

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.720 align:middle line:84%
counselors, trying to make what
we dreamed of come to life.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.580 align:middle line:84%
We'd been together
for eight years.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Our plan was that I
would fall pregnant.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:90%
We would build our dream home.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'd give up work.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And that was just
going to be the dream.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.850 align:middle line:84%
But I felt that if we kept
working at it, we'd get there.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:90%
He didn't have the same vision.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.769 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for him, his vision
was more a case of he--

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:84%
and I'll never know this
to be absolutely true--

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.820 align:middle line:84%
but I think for
him he felt that it

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.380 align:middle line:90%
was beyond his ability to cope.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.960 align:middle line:84%
It was beyond his
ability to make it right.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And there was this deep sense
of self-loathing and self-hatred

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.600 align:middle line:90%
that I saw And.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.330 align:middle line:84%
I watched and
spoke to him about,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.860 align:middle line:84%
that I felt helpless to be able
to save him from himself, which

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.930 align:middle line:90%
ultimately led to his suicide.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.632 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you know,
at the end of the day,

00:04:47.632 --> 00:04:49.340 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't matter how
intelligent we are.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.070 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how old we are.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.900 align:middle line:90%
We're still little kids inside.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, inside there's
still this little person

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't know how to deal
with something like that.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And when I discovered that
he had taken his life,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.920 align:middle line:90%
I pulled into my driveway.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:90%
I was met by the police.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was awfully
traumatic and dramatic,

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.910 align:middle line:90%
the way that I discovered it.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So I think that that whole
understand of what had occurred

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.147 align:middle line:90%
really missed the mark for me.

00:05:17.147 --> 00:05:18.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, at school,
we learn about science.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.790 align:middle line:90%
We learn about maths.

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:20.600 align:middle line:90%
We learn about English.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.267 align:middle line:84%
But we don't learn
about life and death.

00:05:22.267 --> 00:05:24.620 align:middle line:84%
And we don't learn about
the things that really--

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Impact us.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.620 align:middle line:90%
And rock us at the core.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:84%
We don't learn about how
to put that in a frame

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:90%
and understand it.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And the police
officer handed me part

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:90%
of what he'd found in the home.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.440 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, this is
what your partner left behind,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.240 align:middle line:90%
Carren.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.320 align:middle line:84%
He said, so I'm assuming
that it was about you,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.790 align:middle line:90%
and he did it because of you.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Now innocently enough--
innocently enough--

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.860 align:middle line:84%
he wouldn't have known
that he, at that moment,

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.202 align:middle line:90%
told me how to deal with it.

00:05:54.202 --> 00:05:55.160 align:middle line:90%
He wouldn't have known.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.980 align:middle line:84%
In his mind, he was just
giving me information.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:84%
But in my mind, I didn't
know what to do with it.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.565 align:middle line:84%
Here I was sitting
there with this suicide.

00:06:02.565 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:90%
What do I do with it?

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.920 align:middle line:90%
How do I make sense of it?

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.605 align:middle line:84%
How do I reconcile
and assimilate it?

00:06:06.605 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And when he said, it was
your fault, I went, great.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle line:90%
I'll take that.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
So I remember thinking to
myself that I was responsible.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.070 align:middle line:84%
How could I have
been so conceited

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.550 align:middle line:84%
that I was so caught up in my
own pain I'd never seen his?

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.770 align:middle line:84%
How could I be so
oblivious to the person

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:84%
that I loved the
most in the world

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and not see what
he was suffering?

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.420 align:middle line:84%
So of course, that
put me on a trajectory

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
of my own suicidal
experience over the course

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:90%
of the coming weeks and months.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:39.260 align:middle line:84%
And to live with
the responsibility

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.510 align:middle line:84%
that the person that
you love the most

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:84%
has taken their life because
of you, to see his family,

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and to watch the pain
in his father's eyes

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:53.340 align:middle line:84%
was one of the most destructive
emotions I think I felt.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And then to see all of
his dear close friends--

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:90%
like his mates-- look at me.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what
they thought of me.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.713 align:middle line:84%
But in my mind, I thought
they must have hated me.

00:07:04.713 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Because I was the
closest person to him.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.922 align:middle line:84%
And even though they
didn't know what

00:07:07.922 --> 00:07:10.310 align:middle line:84%
had gone on between us
behind closed doors,

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:84%
I thought that everybody was
looking at me with hatred.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
So with that in my mind,
I'd wake up in the morning.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:90%
And I'd look at my face.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:90%
And I'd brush my teeth.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And I hated--
hated-- what I saw.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:90%
I hated the sound of my voice.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.850 align:middle line:90%
I hated the thoughts that I had.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:30.590 align:middle line:90%
I hated my eyes.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.220 align:middle line:90%
I hated my hands.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.290 align:middle line:84%
The amount of
self-hatred that I was

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.040 align:middle line:84%
able to stir up in such
a short period of time,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:84%
when I look back on
that, was profound,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.400 align:middle line:84%
to the point where
I wouldn't eat

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.810 align:middle line:90%
because I hated myself so much.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:49.522 align:middle line:84%
I didn't deserve the
pleasure of food.

00:07:49.522 --> 00:07:51.230 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't laugh
because I didn't deserve

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:52.730 align:middle line:90%
the pleasure of laughing.

00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't wear anything
that was flattering

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.240 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't deserve that.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.480 align:middle line:84%
I developed a rash that
went from the bottom

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.270 align:middle line:84%
of the soles of my feet
all the way up to my chin.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:90%
It just covered my body.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.520 align:middle line:84%
And I would tear my skin
apart with such hate.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.440 align:middle line:84%
But at the time, I'd
think, you deserve this.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.250 align:middle line:90%
Rip it.

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:90%
Rip it.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was like this real
sense of wanting harm

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.420 align:middle line:90%
to come to myself.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.420 align:middle line:84%
And as that
accelerated as it does,

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.150 align:middle line:84%
I fell deeper and
deeper into depression,

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.230 align:middle line:84%
until finally I became so
disassociated from reality

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.320 align:middle line:84%
that, in my mind, I thought
the only way out of all of this

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.039 align:middle line:84%
and the only way to pay my
price was to take my own life.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, I thought
that pays my price.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.530 align:middle line:90%
I killed my partner.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.000 align:middle line:90%
I must die, too.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:84%
My friends and my
family are suffering

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.070 align:middle line:84%
watching this disgusting
creature walk the streets.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:48.270 align:middle line:90%
They'll have peace.

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.530 align:middle line:90%
That works.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.560 align:middle line:84%
My parents are suffering
watching their child be

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.030 align:middle line:90%
self-destructive.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.160 align:middle line:90%
Finally, they'll have peace.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'll be back in my
rightful place with him.

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:90%
Happy days.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:03.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was a very conscious
process that you were going

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:09.960 align:middle line:84%
through of almost planning
the entire process.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.845 align:middle line:84%
>> Right down to
the last moment.

00:09:12.845 --> 00:09:13.645 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:09:13.645 --> 00:09:16.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And just during this
particular time and this

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:84%
experience, had you seeked
out any help at all?

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I had seen maybe 10
to 15 psychologists.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.290 align:middle line:90%
And I'd seen four psychiatrists.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And they had some they
had prescribed me Valium.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.910 align:middle line:84%
They didn't want
to give me anything

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.890 align:middle line:84%
as far as an anti-depressant
was concerned.

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:36.720 align:middle line:84%
They just wanted to
give me the Valium.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle line:84%
But the problem with Valium
is that it numbs the body.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.900 align:middle line:90%
But nothing numbs the brain.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So even though I was
lying there motionless

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.680 align:middle line:84%
because I'd either had
too much, whatever it was,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.540 align:middle line:90%
the brain didn't stop.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And the mind was
constantly on repeat.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.880 align:middle line:84%
It was set to repeat
on how hateful I was,

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.430 align:middle line:84%
how undeserving I was,
how unlovable I was.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.310 align:middle line:84%
Am I still living in this
nightmare that I've created?

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.260 align:middle line:90%
I killed him.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.060 align:middle line:90%
I killed him.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.860 align:middle line:90%
I killed him.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And those thoughts take a
person on an accelerated journey

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:17.790 align:middle line:84%
of absolute depression that,
unless something significant

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
happens to change that,
it's a downward spiral.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
from that, then you

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.122 align:middle line:90%
get the chemical imbalances.

00:10:28.122 --> 00:10:29.580 align:middle line:84%
And then it becomes
a physiological

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.050 align:middle line:90%
and a biological issue.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.770 align:middle line:84%
But it doesn't take long for
what manifests in the mind

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.530 align:middle line:90%
to manifest in the body.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take long at all.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:38.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:90%
So there you were.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.670 align:middle line:90%
You were planning.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.840 align:middle line:90%
And you'd set a date?

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the anniversary of my
partner's suicide was the 14th

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:48.960 align:middle line:90%
of October.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.740 align:middle line:84%
And on the 12th of October,
I'd arranged to fly myself

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.230 align:middle line:90%
from Sydney to Bali.

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And my intention was
that I would be in Ubud.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had my whole
plan laid out.

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:01.140 align:middle line:90%
And no one would know.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.000 align:middle line:84%
There would be a
note they advising

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.620 align:middle line:90%
how to contact my family.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.225 align:middle line:84%
But no one would
actually find me.

00:11:06.225 --> 00:11:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And that was what was
really important to me.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.470 align:middle line:84%
I wanted them to not have
to deal with that side of it

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.870 align:middle line:84%
but to just have to come
to terms with the fact

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:84%
that there would be nothing
but relief, that finally

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:90%
all the suffering was over.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:84%
And in my mind, that's
what I had figured

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.220 align:middle line:90%
was the right thing to do.

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So for me, I felt peace when I
came to that resolved decision.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:84%
Granted, I wasn't
completely associated.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't completely--
I wasn't right.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.990 align:middle line:84%
My two girlfriends
decided to come with me.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:39.060 align:middle line:84%
One of them was my dearest
friend, my best friend Jodi.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.620 align:middle line:84%
Her and I were
like soul sisters.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And I'd always say, you
know, whenever she sneezed,

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.360 align:middle line:90%
I blew my nose.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:84%
It was almost like we just were,
you know, peas and carrots.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.180 align:middle line:90%
We just went together.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.768 align:middle line:90%
And she came with me to Bali.

00:11:52.768 --> 00:11:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And she said there's no
way I'm leaving you alone

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.602 align:middle line:84%
on the anniversary of
your partner's death.

00:11:56.602 --> 00:11:57.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing that.

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.548 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming with you.

00:11:59.548 --> 00:12:00.840 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, well, that's OK.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
She can come with me
for a couple of days.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.490 align:middle line:84%
But then on the anniversary,
I'd book myself into Ubud.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.480 align:middle line:90%
She didn't know.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
But I booked myself
in to go up there.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And then that's where
I would take my life

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:90%
and finally get relief.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So we landed in Bali on
the 12th of October, 2002.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.370 align:middle line:84%
That night, unpack our bags
and head out to the Sari Club.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And like normal Aussies,
we were having a ball.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:29.430 align:middle line:90%
And I actually felt really--

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.510 align:middle line:90%
I felt peace.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I felt calm because I
knew that my end was just

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.447 align:middle line:90%
around the corner.

00:12:34.447 --> 00:12:35.655 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, you know what?

00:12:35.655 --> 00:12:38.370 align:middle line:84%
I can actually now just
spend some quality time

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:90%
with the person I love.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.700 align:middle line:90%
That's all that matters.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.680 align:middle line:84%
But in my mind, I had
this holy grail that

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:90%
was my answer to everything.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:54.210 align:middle line:90%
And it was 11:30 that night.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.225 align:middle line:84%
And I was standing next
to Jodi and Charmaine.

00:12:57.225 --> 00:12:59.850 align:middle line:84%
We were really, really close to
each other because it was loud.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:00.650 align:middle line:90%
It was a nightclub.

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:01.920 align:middle line:90%
And we were talking.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And this fellow grabbed
my arm and spun me around,

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:84%
as if to take me
onto the dance floor

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.260 align:middle line:84%
and as he grabbed me
and spun me around.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.250 align:middle line:84%
That's when the
bombing went off.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't realize
this at the time.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:84%
But I was blown backwards
into the dance floor.

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And Jodi and Charmaine were
blown forwards into the bar.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:84%
So when I woke up, all I could
see was a hand over my face.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.720 align:middle line:84%
I could see
somebody's hair here.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.570 align:middle line:90%
There were legs across me.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:39.570 align:middle line:90%
There were arms across my legs.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:41.640 align:middle line:90%
And nobody was moving.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Everybody was dead still.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
what had happened.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:48.500 align:middle line:84%
In my mind, my first
thought was an earthquake.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.620 align:middle line:84%
But I heard this--
or actually I think

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:57.120 align:middle line:90%
I felt a sensation of pulling.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.220 align:middle line:84%
And it was so intense
that I started screaming.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And I started yelling
saying, I am coming.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.030 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.570 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:04.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm coming.

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing it.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:05.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm going.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:06.320 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.350 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And I started screaming that
because I felt that there was--

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.980 align:middle line:90%
I can't say that I heard words.

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.750 align:middle line:84%
But there was this unbelievable
presence of an urgency.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.120 align:middle line:84%
That's probably the
best way to describe it.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.720 align:middle line:84%
And I managed to
squirm my way out

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.400 align:middle line:84%
from underneath
all of the rubble.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And when I surveyed
what was in front of me,

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:30.780 align:middle line:90%
it was just all alight.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:90%
The roof had caved in.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.420 align:middle line:84%
It was like a grass
thatched roof.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And that was just
completely alight.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And I stood looking for Jodi
and Charmaine to be coming out.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And as I stood waiting for
them, crying out for them,

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.000 align:middle line:84%
I felt my hair on my
face begin to burn.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.500 align:middle line:84%
My eyebrows singed
off, my eyelashes.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.530 align:middle line:90%
And you know that smell?

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:56.130 align:middle line:90%
That smell was just so pungent.

00:14:56.130 --> 00:14:58.330 align:middle line:90%
It filled the air.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:00.108 align:middle line:84%
And I started to feel
and see my hair--

00:15:00.108 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:84%
because my hair was
quite long then--

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:04.553 align:middle line:84%
I started to see and feel
my hair saying to singe.

00:15:04.553 --> 00:15:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I
couldn't stand there.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.330 align:middle line:84%
So I turned to see
what was happening.

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And everybody was
running towards the back

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.607 align:middle line:84%
of the club, where there
was this man standing there.

00:15:13.607 --> 00:15:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I think of him,
I picture somebody that's

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:90%
10 foot tall, so handsome.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.380 align:middle line:90%
And I reckon he had wings.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.490 align:middle line:90%
I reckon he did.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:22.150 align:middle line:90%
I think he had wings.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And he was picking
all of the girls

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle line:84%
up and throwing us into
this small hole that

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.990 align:middle line:84%
had been blown into
the back of the club,

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:34.135 align:middle line:84%
pushing us through this
hole, helping us out.

00:15:34.135 --> 00:15:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But what he didn't realize
that on the other side of that

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.520 align:middle line:90%
was completely ablaze.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So for the girls who
were wearing synthetics,

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:84%
their clothes just
stuck to them and just

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:45.985 align:middle line:90%
burnt through their skin.

00:15:45.985 --> 00:15:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But for those of us who
were wearing cotton--

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and I was lucky, I was
in cotton and denim--

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.420 align:middle line:84%
our clothes didn't burn,
not instantly anyway.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.700 align:middle line:84%
And we at least had
a fighting chance.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So the journey from
that part to getting out

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:05.190 align:middle line:84%
onto the street in and
of itself was just,

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:08.008 align:middle line:84%
you know, climbing
walls, jumping up--

00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:09.300 align:middle line:90%
felt like jumping up mountains.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:12.030 align:middle line:84%
But there was this one
occasion where I was running.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel the flames
burning into my back.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:15.630 align:middle line:90%
I could feel it.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:18.010 align:middle line:90%
And I was screaming.

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.550 align:middle line:84%
And then as I was
screaming, I thought nobody

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.770 align:middle line:90%
is going to hear you screaming.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:24.870 align:middle line:90%
What are you screaming for?

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Run.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:90%
And this was the conversation.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought to
myself, God, please.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Don't let me run into a wall.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:32.263 align:middle line:90%
Please don't let me run to wall.

00:16:32.263 --> 00:16:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Please make the path clear.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.220 align:middle line:90%
Please make the path clear.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And I ran straight
into a brick wall.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.490 align:middle line:84%
5 foot 2, straight into a
brick wall, and I thought,

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm trapped.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Flames at my back, brick wall
in front of me, I'm trapped.

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:84%
And honestly, Jo,
to this day, I've

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:90%
been hypnotized four times.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.020 align:middle line:84%
I've revisited that through
various trance experiences.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And to this day, I cannot tell
you how I found myself standing

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.240 align:middle line:90%
on top of that wall.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.255 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:02.880 align:middle line:84%
There was nothing
for me to grab on to.

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.960 align:middle line:90%
There were no footholds.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:08.020 align:middle line:84%
All I remember--
consciously remember--

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.040 align:middle line:84%
was standing on top of that
wall and jumping off it.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:14.140 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know how I got
to the top of that wall.

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And you know, when I
came back, my sister

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:84%
looked at the huge,
big burn marks

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.995 align:middle line:84%
that were perfectly circular
on my shoulder blades.

00:17:22.995 --> 00:17:27.599 align:middle line:84%
And my sister said, that's where
the angels plugged my wings in

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:90%
to help me fly.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.780 align:middle line:90%
And you know, yeah.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:90%
It was pretty amazing.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I managed to get
myself out onto the street.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.600 align:middle line:84%
But I think this is the
part that, when I look back

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.300 align:middle line:84%
on that experience, this is
the part that's been the most

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.580 align:middle line:90%
profound learning curve for me.

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.490 align:middle line:84%
It was that there were
people dying everywhere.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:57.690 align:middle line:84%
There were women that I sat with
that she took her last breath.

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:59.580 align:middle line:90%
But there was no fear.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.503 align:middle line:84%
And the tears that
I'm crying now

00:18:01.503 --> 00:18:02.670 align:middle line:90%
is just through remembering.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:05.280 align:middle line:84%
But at the time,
there was no fear.

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:90%
There was no sadness.

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, we look back
on experiences like that.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.058 align:middle line:84%
And we imagine that it would
be terribly frightening.

00:18:11.058 --> 00:18:12.910 align:middle line:90%
But it wasn't at all.

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.330 align:middle line:84%
In fact, quite the
opposite for everybody.

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
There was a man who I
sat between his legs

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.890 align:middle line:84%
when I finally got
taken to the hospital.

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.040 align:middle line:90%
And I watched him pass away.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:90%
But there was no fear.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.910 align:middle line:84%
There was just this most
intimate soul connection

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:84%
that none of us were
frightened of each other.

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
None of us needed to
protect ourselves.

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.140 align:middle line:84%
None of us needed to feel
like we were in danger.

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:90%
None of us felt that way.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:84%
All there was was
this incredible sense

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%
of oneness between all of us.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I was
taken to a hospital.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:50.610 align:middle line:84%
And they discovered that the
entire left side of my skull

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.740 align:middle line:90%
had been totally crushed.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.680 align:middle line:84%
And the bone was
pressing in on the brain

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.960 align:middle line:84%
and cutting off
the blood supply.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said to me
that I had six hours to live.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And I found it ironic in
that moment that I'd gone

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:90%
to Bali to take my own life.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.920 align:middle line:90%
And now I was in a fight for it.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:90%
And I looked around the room.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'd shared eight needles
with six people that day

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.360 align:middle line:90%
in that room.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well, if
that's the level of hygiene

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.590 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to
be experiencing,

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.020 align:middle line:84%
then there's no way anybody's
going in to do brain surgery.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.860 align:middle line:84%
It's not happening,
not on my watch.

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So then I had a completely
different focus.

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Now it was about
keeping myself alive.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And there was nothing
in Bali that they

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.280 align:middle line:84%
could give me that would
actually keep me alive.

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.072 align:middle line:84%
There was no medication
they could give me.

00:19:40.072 --> 00:19:40.980 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So it became a very mental
battle and a very conscious

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:90%
battle of, how will I survive?

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.650 align:middle line:90%
How will I keep myself alive?

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.305 align:middle line:84%
And I managed to
through my family--

00:19:51.305 --> 00:19:53.430 align:middle line:84%
there was a phone in the
room-- they managed to get

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:56.303 align:middle line:90%
me booked onto a Qantas flight.

00:19:56.303 --> 00:19:57.720 align:middle line:84%
But the doctors
had told me that I

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.630 align:middle line:84%
had six hours at 7:00
AM in the morning.

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:04.200 align:middle line:84%
So technically, by 1:00 PM, I
should have been lights out.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.050 align:middle line:84%
10:30 that night,
I boarded a plane.

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:84%
And I flew six and a
half hours back to Sydney

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:84%
while I held a drip for another
girl that sat next to me.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Because in my mind, if I
passed away on that plane, then

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:23.260 align:middle line:90%
at least I was on my way home.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:28.610 align:middle line:84%
But in my mind, passing
away was not an option.

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was just a massive
shift and turn around for what

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.830 align:middle line:90%
you had gone for.

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Honestly, Jo, if I
could bottle that shift,

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:44.187 align:middle line:84%
we could make the world a
peaceful place for everybody.

00:20:44.187 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:84%
And then beyond peace,
there would be bliss.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.645 align:middle line:84%
Because we don't want
to rest in peace.

00:20:47.645 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able to become
amazing because of our peace.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:57.660 align:middle line:84%
But when I got home,
my sister told me

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:01.750 align:middle line:84%
that Jodi and Charmaine
didn't make it.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.110 align:middle line:84%
I was in the hospital
after the surgery.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:06.870 align:middle line:84%
And they told me that Jodi
and Charmaine didn't make it.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And you know, I remember
it hitting me dramatically.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.832 align:middle line:84%
Because now I felt responsible
for the death of three people.

00:21:12.832 --> 00:21:14.207 align:middle line:84%
You know, they
wouldn't have been

00:21:14.207 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:90%
in Bali had it not been for me.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.200 align:middle line:90%
How does somebody handle that?

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.007 align:middle line:84%
I certainly didn't have the
equipment to handle that.

00:21:22.007 --> 00:21:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And then a psychologist came in.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And she said to me,
Carren, with everything

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:26.745 align:middle line:84%
that you've been through,
you will experience

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:90%
post-traumatic stress disorder.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.600 align:middle line:90%
So I went, great.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.980 align:middle line:84%
You just taught me how to
deal with this one now, too.

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:33.780 align:middle line:90%
Fantastic.

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Now I've got all the
tools that I need.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was pretty much the
way that my days and weeks

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:45.685 align:middle line:84%
unfolded after coming
out of the hospital.

00:21:45.685 --> 00:21:47.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, coming to
terms with the fact

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.220 align:middle line:84%
that I was responsible for
the death of three people

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:84%
was something that plagued
me beyond any kind of logic.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And I sought the
help of counselors.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.390 align:middle line:84%
I sought the help
of psychiatrists.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:90%
No one could help me.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.110 align:middle line:90%
No one could help me.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:11.250 align:middle line:84%
And part of that was
because I didn't want help.

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:12.840 align:middle line:84%
I didn't want
anybody to help me.

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.790 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to own my pain.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.200 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to own my suffering.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.430 align:middle line:90%
I deserved it.

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> But had something
shifted at that point?

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.610 align:middle line:84%
Had you started to think
about suicide again?

00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.050 align:middle line:84%
Because now you've
got three lives

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:26.633 align:middle line:84%
that you were feeling
responsible for?

00:22:26.633 --> 00:22:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Such a good question.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I'd come so close
to losing my life in Bali,

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.150 align:middle line:84%
my perspective
changed on suicide.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:39.840 align:middle line:84%
And there was this one
occasion when I got home.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.460 align:middle line:90%
And my partner Matt was there.

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And I had just had
an anxiety attack.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I went into
the bedroom and I

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:84%
was having my attack
in the corner,

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:90%
he came to comfort me as he did.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And I pushed him away
with such ferocity.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been with him for
about five years at that point.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And he said to
me, you know what?

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.300 align:middle line:84%
He said you're doing
this to yourself.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.950 align:middle line:84%
You're just doing
this to yourself.

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:07.170 align:middle line:90%
And I can't help you.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:08.660 align:middle line:90%
And it was such--

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.630 align:middle line:84%
it was right timing,
right timing.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.130 align:middle line:84%
Because it shifted
my perspective.

00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:15.060 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, hang on a second.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.110 align:middle line:90%
Is he right?

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.520 align:middle line:90%
No way he's right.

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing this to myself.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm in Bali bombing victim.

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.320 align:middle line:90%
My partner committed suicide.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.182 align:middle line:90%
I deserve this.

00:23:23.182 --> 00:23:24.390 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing this to myself.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.350 align:middle line:90%
I deserve this.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:84%
And I went on for
three days saying,

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.400 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing this to myself.

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:90%
I deserve this.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was the I in
that conversation

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that made me think I am
not doing this to myself.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.640 align:middle line:90%
I deserve this.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.220 align:middle line:84%
I just contradicted
myself right there.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.650 align:middle line:84%
So it took me a while
to actually comprehend

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:49.960 align:middle line:90%
what he'd said, you know.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a
conversation with my dad.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is a story
that I shared.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:55.550 align:middle line:90%
Do you want me to--

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:57.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, when I first
heard you tell this,

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.230 align:middle line:84%
you know, it
brought me to tears.

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:84%
Inside, I just-- you know,
such a beautiful symbolic way

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.530 align:middle line:84%
of describing your
transformation.

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:12.130 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately what you're
about share with us now,

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.080 align:middle line:84%
would you call that
your real catalyst?

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
You know, we all have
that light bulb moment

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:17.770 align:middle line:90%
that really turns you on.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I know what you mentioned
with your partner

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.540 align:middle line:84%
and what he said to
you was one of them.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So just on that note, do you
feel that in your experience

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.030 align:middle line:84%
there were many kind of
light bulbing moments

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:34.720 align:middle line:84%
that came to the big
light bulb moment?

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.340 align:middle line:84%
Or is there one
specific for you?

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.820 align:middle line:84%
Is this one that you're going
to share this with us now,

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.970 align:middle line:84%
is that one that was,
if you were to say,

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:44.920 align:middle line:84%
the one thing that
really pulled me out

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.740 align:middle line:84%
of my self-indulgent
of that pain?

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.060 align:middle line:90%
That's such a good question.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.230 align:middle line:84%
No one's ever asked
me that before.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:56.350 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing that was
memorable other than these two

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:57.880 align:middle line:90%
instances.

00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And I know that my
family and friends all

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.670 align:middle line:90%
tried different things.

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:03.928 align:middle line:84%
My mom used to write
me poems and all

00:25:03.928 --> 00:25:04.970 align:middle line:90%
of those sorts of things.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:07.330 align:middle line:84%
But I think a person's
got to be ready.

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that readiness
isn't only just up to us.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.500 align:middle line:84%
You know, I like to
think that there's

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.400 align:middle line:90%
a universal force at play.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And when the time is right,
the time will be right.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And I had a miniature
Maltese terrier.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.790 align:middle line:84%
She was my little love
of my life, Dolly.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:27.590 align:middle line:84%
And she passed away
after 15 years.

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:28.990 align:middle line:90%
And I remember ringing my dad.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.615 align:middle line:84%
And I've got the best
dad in the world.

00:25:30.615 --> 00:25:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Father, I said,
I just can't do this anymore.

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.000 align:middle line:90%
There's just death.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And then there's
a bit of respite.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:36.457 align:middle line:90%
But then there's more death.

00:25:36.457 --> 00:25:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And then in between
there's just respite.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.150 align:middle line:90%
what's.

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:40.720 align:middle line:90%
The purpose of it all?

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.977 align:middle line:90%
And my dad calls me Booffy.

00:25:41.977 --> 00:25:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And I know that this is going
to go out to millions of people.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.850 align:middle line:84%
But I'm just get trust that
all the millions of people

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.470 align:middle line:84%
are just going to
keep it between us.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:51.730 align:middle line:90%
So my dad calls me Booffy.

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:53.980 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, Buffy,
come and sit on daddy's lap.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.420 align:middle line:90%
And I was 36 at the time.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So I walked up and sat on his
lap, put my arm around him.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:00.003 align:middle line:90%
And my dad says, Booffy.

00:26:00.003 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want
you to think about

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.160 align:middle line:90%
a humble little caterpillar.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.562 align:middle line:84%
He said the humble
caterpillar goes about life,

00:26:05.562 --> 00:26:07.270 align:middle line:84%
being a caterpillar,
doing all the things

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:10.150 align:middle line:84%
he does, thinking that he's
amazing because he can bulldoze

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.210 align:middle line:90%
over a blade of grass.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he
thinks he's awesome.

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:16.250 align:middle line:90%
He said, but life happens.

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:17.560 align:middle line:90%
And instinct occurs.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.957 align:middle line:84%
And that little caterpillar
has no say in it.

00:26:19.957 --> 00:26:22.540 align:middle line:84%
And he said, and then all of a
sudden, that little caterpillar

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.110 align:middle line:84%
starts to transform and spin
himself into a chrysalis.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.580 align:middle line:84%
He doesn't know
what's happening.

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:28.570 align:middle line:90%
He's got no idea.

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:30.760 align:middle line:84%
He has to go along for
the ride because it's just

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.335 align:middle line:90%
life unfolding.

00:26:32.335 --> 00:26:34.020 align:middle line:90%
And he said to me, Booffy.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.670 align:middle line:84%
He said, inside that
chrysalis, that little

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:38.890 align:middle line:90%
caterpillar-- he's liquefying.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:40.450 align:middle line:90%
He's consuming himself.

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.967 align:middle line:90%
He's going through hell.

00:26:42.967 --> 00:26:44.050 align:middle line:90%
And he said to me, Booffy.

00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, what you've been
through is absolutely hell.

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:48.787 align:middle line:84%
He said, no one can
say that it's not.

00:26:48.787 --> 00:26:50.620 align:middle line:84%
He's said, but like
that little caterpillar,

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.180 align:middle line:84%
he said, that's not
the fight of your life.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
He said, the fight
of your life is

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.280 align:middle line:84%
being able to burst
out of that chrysalis

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.250 align:middle line:84%
and to become the
beautiful butterfly because

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:02.760 align:middle line:90%
of what you've gone through.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.150 align:middle line:90%
And oh my goodness.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.540 align:middle line:84%
It was like such a light
bulb moment, you know.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me, the fight
of that caterpillars life--

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:12.580 align:middle line:90%
if anybody tries to help him--

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.802 align:middle line:90%
they'll kill him.

00:27:13.802 --> 00:27:15.760 align:middle line:84%
He said, if anybody tries
to cut the chrysalis,

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.660 align:middle line:90%
they'll cut his wing.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.035 align:middle line:84%
And he won't
develop the strength

00:27:18.035 --> 00:27:20.320 align:middle line:84%
that he needs to be
able to have the wind

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:84%
catch underneath his
wings and for him

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.140 align:middle line:84%
to get a completely different
perspective of life,

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.870 align:middle line:84%
where bulldozing over a blade
of grass is no longer important.

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But seeing the world from a
grander perspective-- that's

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:35.557 align:middle line:84%
now his life, with
absolute beauty.

00:27:35.557 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:90%
And he said to me, Booffy.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.230 align:middle line:84%
He said, that's a
shift in perspective

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.090 align:middle line:90%
that is possible for you.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.180 align:middle line:84%
But none of us can
help you with it.

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.700 align:middle line:90%
He said, you have to understand.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.040 align:middle line:84%
You've gone through
these experiences.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.190 align:middle line:84%
You've experienced depression
to the extent that you have.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:53.260 align:middle line:84%
He said, you've done
everything that you thought

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.760 align:middle line:84%
was the best thing
that you could do

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.430 align:middle line:90%
with what you had at the time.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:59.500 align:middle line:84%
But he said, now you're in
for the fight of your life.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.340 align:middle line:90%
Get ready for it.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.720 align:middle line:90%
He said, being blown up?

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Walk in the park.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.770 align:middle line:90%
This-- fight of your life.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:07.090 align:middle line:90%
And he was right.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:07.990 align:middle line:90%
He was right.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:09.010 align:middle line:90%
Being blown up?

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:10.540 align:middle line:90%
Happened in an instant.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.890 align:middle line:90%
Going through the suicide?

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.000 align:middle line:84%
It happened over
a period of time.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.080 align:middle line:84%
But this now was to
be able does look

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:20.470 align:middle line:84%
at all of my experiences,
the actual experiences

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.620 align:middle line:84%
themselves, the depression--
because that in and of itself

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:25.470 align:middle line:90%
is it is an experience.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:84%
The holding onto the blame
and the responsibility,

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:31.450 align:middle line:84%
the holding onto the suffering--
that in and of itself

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.750 align:middle line:90%
is a yet another experience.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So becoming something
because of that--

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:43.630 align:middle line:84%
having all of those experiences
be the soil that fertilizes

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:45.130 align:middle line:90%
what grows--

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:48.190 align:middle line:84%
that was that conversation
that I had with my dad

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:53.845 align:middle line:84%
that then was the final
catalyst that had me wake up.

00:28:53.845 --> 00:28:54.970 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen overnight.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:90%
But it did happen.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:29:01.600 align:middle line:84%
It was absolutely the
most profound wake-up call

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:84%
I possibly could have had
that placed me squarely

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.460 align:middle line:84%
in the center of how my life
would unfold from that moment

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:14.470 align:middle line:84%
on and how my life was unfolding
from every moment prior.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:16.930 align:middle line:84%
I was always at
the center of it.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:21.880 align:middle line:84%
And the belief of
what I was determined

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.040 align:middle line:84%
the kind of experiences
that occurred in my life.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So while I believed
I was a sufferer,

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:30.310 align:middle line:84%
that I should be in pain,
that I deserved all of this--

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:33.440 align:middle line:84%
that was the kind of
life I was living.

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.367 align:middle line:90%
And that was up to me.

00:29:34.367 --> 00:29:35.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
else to do with it.

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.890 align:middle line:84%
But I did know that
that's what I was doing.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And so up until this point,
it's fair to say that you

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:47.680 align:middle line:84%
actually didn't believe
that you could heal.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>> No way.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:50.050 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:54.250 align:middle line:84%
I had visions of myself
at 80 still on bended knee

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:84%
with tears in my eyes wishing
and begging for an illness

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:58.750 align:middle line:90%
to take my life.

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.910 align:middle line:90%
I had visions of that.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:00.710 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:01.510 align:middle line:90%
No way.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.420 align:middle line:84%
I never believed that there was
a healing possible, not for me.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.650 align:middle line:90%
Because I didn't deserve it.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>>So from hearing these words
of wisdom from your father

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.350 align:middle line:84%
and being ready
to hear from them

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:14.920 align:middle line:84%
and hear those words,
what sort of things

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.720 align:middle line:90%
did you then start to do?

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:84%
What kind of changes
in maybe lifestyle

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:23.380 align:middle line:84%
habits or day-to-day
rituals did you

00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.190 align:middle line:84%
start to change
or begin in order

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:30.260 align:middle line:84%
to support yourself to move
in the right direction?

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So I guess for me it was
really about the realization

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:39.610 align:middle line:84%
that I was the person waking
up with the thoughts that I was

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:45.640 align:middle line:84%
hateful, that I was undeserving,
that I didn't deserve to be

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.840 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.930 align:middle line:84%
When I realized that
I was the one who

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:52.030 align:middle line:84%
was generating
those thoughts, it

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.650 align:middle line:90%
was a real eye opener for me.

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But I did actually come
to that conclusion.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:01.898 align:middle line:84%
Because when I would go to bed
at night and I'd fall asleep,

00:31:01.898 --> 00:31:03.940 align:middle line:84%
I knew that I wasn't
depressed when I was asleep.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.443 align:middle line:84%
Even if I only
slept for an hour,

00:31:05.443 --> 00:31:07.360 align:middle line:84%
I knew that during the
time that I was asleep,

00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:09.500 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't depressed in that time.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So when I woke up I had
to recreate it for myself.

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I recreated depression
for myself with the thoughts

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.060 align:middle line:90%
that I had.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.340 align:middle line:84%
So I had to become
very aware of what

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.980 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking that
was then setting up

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.910 align:middle line:84%
the rest of the experience
of the day for me.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.597 align:middle line:84%
And what I did was I put
a journal next to the bed.

00:31:26.597 --> 00:31:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought,
well, I'm not going

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.800 align:middle line:90%
to try and stop those thoughts.

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.450 align:middle line:90%
Because they're there.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not going to
pretend they're not there.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:35.650 align:middle line:90%
They are there.

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And to a certain extent, I still
believed that I needed them.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I needed that because it was
part of my identity of who

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:42.072 align:middle line:90%
I now was.

00:31:42.072 --> 00:31:43.780 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I'm not
going to stop them.

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm just going to record them.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:46.960 align:middle line:90%
So I wrote them all down.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And I had a little
journal next to the bed.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:50.203 align:middle line:84%
And every morning before
I'd get out of bed,

00:31:50.203 --> 00:31:54.010 align:middle line:84%
I'd write down all the
things that I was thinking.

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And that way I got
it out of my head.

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:58.510 align:middle line:84%
And then I discovered a book
called "The Artist's Way"

00:31:58.510 --> 00:31:59.920 align:middle line:90%
by Julia Cameron.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And I saw that she
has that in her book

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:03.880 align:middle line:90%
called "morning pages."

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And that was a real
confirmation for me

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.305 align:middle line:84%
that I was actually
on the right track.

00:32:07.305 --> 00:32:08.860 align:middle line:90%
I was doing the right things.

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And in that process
of emptying out

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.760 align:middle line:84%
what was going on
between my two ears,

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.280 align:middle line:90%
it then actually left me blank.

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.990 align:middle line:90%
It left it empty.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:17.800 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, OK.

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, now that it's empty, what
am I going to do with empty,

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.100 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And that in and of itself
was a whole new way

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:29.830 align:middle line:84%
of relating to life and to
the day and moment by moment

00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.570 align:middle line:90%
with an empty head.

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:36.320 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not hating on
myself, what am I doing?

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And it really gave
me an opportunity

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:42.530 align:middle line:90%
to ask a different question.

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:45.800 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not hating
myself, what am I doing?

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have an
answer for a couple--

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.950 align:middle line:84%
well, I would say about six
months I didn't have an answer.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.290 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't let
the question go.

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought, this is
part of the fight of my life.

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm going to go
into the fight of my life,

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I can't know what my opponent's
going to do day by day.

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:06.130 align:middle line:84%
I can't know what life is going
to present me with day by day.

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So I have to be prepared to go
into the abyss and the unknown.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:11.710 align:middle line:90%
And hell, I've been blown up.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:13.060 align:middle line:90%
I've been in the abyss.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:15.180 align:middle line:90%
I'll do it again.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And that was the way
that I spoke to myself

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:20.710 align:middle line:90%
and I related to myself.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was the
catalyst to me saying, well,

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:27.800 align:middle line:84%
if I'm not hating
myself, what am I doing?

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought,
well, I'm helping people.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:31.330 align:middle line:90%
That's what I plan to do.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:32.680 align:middle line:90%
I will help people.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And then it would become
another question of, how?

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.770 align:middle line:90%
What will you do?

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:37.768 align:middle line:90%
What do you love?

00:33:37.768 --> 00:33:40.060 align:middle line:84%
Because I thought, I can't
have gone through everything

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.950 align:middle line:84%
I've gone through to just go
back into a nine-to-five job

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:44.900 align:middle line:90%
that I hate being a part of.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.880 align:middle line:84%
I've got to create
something amazing.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was when I
decided that I would become

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.220 align:middle line:84%
a professional speaker
and I would start

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.770 align:middle line:84%
sharing my experiences
with other people,

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:56.990 align:middle line:84%
so that we would know
as people and humans

00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.980 align:middle line:84%
that we could get over
bankruptcy, a divorce, a car

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.080 align:middle line:90%
accident, a loss of a loved one.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:06.350 align:middle line:84%
We can get over the
normal traumas of life

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and understand that, with some
help, we can handle anything

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:14.870 align:middle line:84%
and that we are the most
resilient beings and the most

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:19.610 align:middle line:84%
complex beings that are
on the face of the earth.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:21.389 align:middle line:90%
So I really wanted to do that.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:24.409 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't all
smooth sailing.

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:25.679 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't all smooth sailing.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So through that time were
you still experiencing panic

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.330 align:middle line:90%
attacks?

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:31.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Look.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I think that the flashbacks,
the panic attacks, the anxiety,

00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.820 align:middle line:90%
the emotion behind it--

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, even just
sharing with you earlier,

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.580 align:middle line:90%
the emotion is still very real.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I think that over the years
it's become less frequent.

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.540 align:middle line:84%
As far as the anxiety
and the panic attacks,

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:84%
they were very frequent
for a long, long time.

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:59.990 align:middle line:84%
But what I found was that when
I was in resistance of them,

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:03.680 align:middle line:84%
wishing that they weren't there,
and stomping my feet about it,

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.600 align:middle line:90%
it just accelerated them.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:84%
So I thought in my mind I had
to do the direct opposite if I'm

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.530 align:middle line:90%
to heal from this.

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And my objective was from
what my dad had said to me.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.890 align:middle line:90%
This is the fight of your life.

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:20.990 align:middle line:84%
And I know in any kind of fight,
you give in, and you've lost.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:22.890 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't
an option anymore.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:26.420 align:middle line:84%
I think for me it was
about whatever it takes.

00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.600 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that if
I was in resistance

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.930 align:middle line:84%
to the panic and the anxiety,
then it lasted longer.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So the direct opposite
of that was acceptance.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.820 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
that looked like.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:39.620 align:middle line:90%
But I just tried it.

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And bearing in mind, I was
still seeing psychiatrists

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:43.400 align:middle line:90%
and psychologists.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:47.250 align:middle line:84%
I was still on and off
anti-depressants at that time.

00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.500 align:middle line:90%
But I have to still be honest.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.610 align:middle line:90%
None of it helped.

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:50.870 align:middle line:90%
None of it worked.

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:54.800 align:middle line:84%
Because my mind was way
stronger than anybody else's.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's true
of everybody, particularly

00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.800 align:middle line:84%
people who are experiencing
anxiety, depression.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.550 align:middle line:84%
We think that there's
a weakness in that.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:03.800 align:middle line:90%
But let me tell you something.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Those minds are
like a steel trap.

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And you know, the timing's
got to be right for the person

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:14.330 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get to the other
side of that for themselves.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And that was when
I really realized,

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.530 align:middle line:84%
if I am going to be in
this fight of my life,

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:20.067 align:middle line:90%
I'm the fighter.

00:36:20.067 --> 00:36:21.650 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one with the
boxing gloves on.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.060 align:middle line:84%
As much as I had
my partner there

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:26.090 align:middle line:84%
and my family is here to support
me, no one could fight for me.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:27.170 align:middle line:90%
I had to fight for me.

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:31.250 align:middle line:84%
And I had to become
something worth fighting for.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I didn't feel
that I was worth fighting for.

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:39.800 align:middle line:84%
But just knowing
that I was in a fight

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:42.560 align:middle line:84%
spurred me on to the next day
and then the next day and then

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:43.760 align:middle line:90%
the next day.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So being with the anxiety,
sitting with it and saying,

00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:47.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm anxious.

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrified.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:49.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm having a panic attack.

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.070 align:middle line:84%
Let me just stop
everything that I'm doing,

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.650 align:middle line:84%
not distract myself with
shopping or watching

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:57.080 align:middle line:90%
television or eating.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:36:58.550 align:middle line:90%
Stop everything that I'm doing.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.720 align:middle line:90%
Sit on the floor.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And be in the anxiety.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.160 align:middle line:90%
Sit with it.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And the most fascinating thing
about being in the suffering

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.650 align:middle line:90%
is it actually is like a wave.

00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:11.720 align:middle line:84%
It rides itself
out to the shore.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And the emotion burns itself
out if you go with it.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:16.220 align:middle line:84%
But if you fight
up against it, it's

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.012 align:middle line:90%
going to build in pressure.

00:37:18.012 --> 00:37:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
that at the time.

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.887 align:middle line:84%
But of course, now
looking back, I

00:37:20.887 --> 00:37:24.210 align:middle line:84%
can see that's absolutely a
reality, no matter what it is.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:27.170 align:middle line:90%
So I would just force myself--

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.440 align:middle line:84%
as a ritual, I would
do the morning pages.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.480 align:middle line:84%
I would force myself whenever
I had a moment or a day--

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.400 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes
it was a whole day--

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.550 align:middle line:84%
I would force myself to not
do anything to distract myself

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.310 align:middle line:84%
other than just being with
the emotion that was there

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:44.780 align:middle line:90%
or the anxiety that was there.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.920 align:middle line:90%
I forced myself.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.480 align:middle line:90%
That was challenging.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.090 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm somebody who
likes to distract myself.

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.600 align:middle line:84%
I've always been go
shopping, go eat something,

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.543 align:middle line:90%
take your mind off it.

00:37:54.543 --> 00:37:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And most people will
tell us to do that.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:58.377 align:middle line:84%
You know, you start sobbing,
people will go, oh, sh,

00:37:58.377 --> 00:38:00.140 align:middle line:90%
don't cry.

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So you know, I came
from that same mindset,

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.790 align:middle line:90%
that same conditioning.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's very interesting
to hear after, you know,

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:84%
speaking to so many amazing
people and their stories is

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:14.120 align:middle line:84%
a common theme that I'm
starting to establish now.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And that is, as you
say, when we can

00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:18.770 align:middle line:84%
learn to use our breath
and our mindfulness

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:21.780 align:middle line:90%
to sit in that emotion--

00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.660 align:middle line:84%
which, you know,
science has shown

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.930 align:middle line:84%
us is just energy in motion,
energy moving through the body.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:32.000 align:middle line:84%
And so that emotion that has
such strong feeling to it--

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.230 align:middle line:84%
when we can start to learn
to be with it, sit with it--

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:40.370 align:middle line:90%
we disperse its power over us.

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:43.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
really, you know,

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:47.420 align:middle line:84%
as you said before, the
power in someone's mind

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.850 align:middle line:84%
who is actually suffering from
depression, anxiety, little

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.870 align:middle line:84%
do they know really
how powerful they are.

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And the journey to
actually harnessing

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.350 align:middle line:90%
the power of the mind--

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:02.060 align:middle line:84%
and the irony of that
now is that that's

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.310 align:middle line:90%
exactly where you are.

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:04.250 align:middle line:90%
It's where you teach.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's the area
in which you now

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:11.120 align:middle line:84%
live your life traveling and
teaching and mentoring others

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.580 align:middle line:84%
as to how to really harness
the power of the mind

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.550 align:middle line:84%
and the power of
mindset and mindfulness.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Can you just share with
us where you are today

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.530 align:middle line:90%
and how that gift is shared?

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, I
so see it as a gift.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.730 align:middle line:84%
I really look at
my experiences--

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.430 align:middle line:90%
and I'm on an evolving journey.

00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:30.570 align:middle line:90%
I really look at my experiences.

00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:33.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think to
myself, wow, if only

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:38.390 align:middle line:84%
I knew the lives that my
experiences would touch.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's not me.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:44.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not me is this person that
feels like a seven-year-old kid

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.050 align:middle line:90%
inside.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.925 align:middle line:84%
Because if you said,
let's go roller skating,

00:39:46.925 --> 00:39:48.630 align:middle line:90%
I'd be with you in a heartbeat.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.300 align:middle line:90%
So it's not actually me.

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.520 align:middle line:90%
It's the experiences.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:56.750 align:middle line:84%
And it's what was produced as
a result of those experiences

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:00.950 align:middle line:84%
that have been my greatest
teachers and show me who I am.

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And what I've also realized
is that we are all the same.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.760 align:middle line:90%
We are all the same.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.630 align:middle line:84%
We come wrapped in
different packages.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:12.380 align:middle line:84%
But underneath, we
are all the same.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:16.003 align:middle line:84%
And we use our story
and our experiences

00:40:16.003 --> 00:40:17.420 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
course of our lives

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:20.510 align:middle line:84%
as a vehicle to
have us become less.

00:40:20.510 --> 00:40:24.470 align:middle line:84%
We apply so much meaning to
what's occurred in our lives.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:26.390 align:middle line:90%
Somebody's unfaithful.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm not deserving.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.030 align:middle line:90%
I shouldn't trust men.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.250 align:middle line:84%
Or somebody goes
through a bankruptcy.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm bad with money.

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:34.598 align:middle line:90%
I'll never be any good.

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:36.890 align:middle line:84%
You know, like you hear
something when you're a child--

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:39.380 align:middle line:90%
you never win competitions.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:40.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm a failure.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.830 align:middle line:84%
We attach all this
meaning to all

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:47.690 align:middle line:84%
these insignificant occurrences
that are simply experiences.

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Yes, some of them come with
challenge and some of them

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:51.302 align:middle line:90%
come with contrast.

00:40:51.302 --> 00:40:52.760 align:middle line:84%
But there's a real
point that we're

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.740 align:middle line:84%
missing is that the
contrast and the challenge

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.960 align:middle line:84%
is designed to have
us become more.

00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not designed to
have us become less.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.040 align:middle line:84%
We live in an
expanding universe.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.660 align:middle line:84%
We are constantly evolving
and changing physiologically,

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:07.170 align:middle line:90%
biologically.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So why would our conscious
experience and awareness

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.260 align:middle line:84%
through our experiences
have us become less

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.990 align:middle line:84%
when the whole aim of
life is to become more?

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Either way, we're
landing up in a box.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:21.200 align:middle line:90%
That's the way I see it.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Either way, we're
landing up in a box.

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.230 align:middle line:84%
We're either going to get
there with this belief that

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:25.340 align:middle line:90%
were useless and hopeless.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Or we're going to get
there with this belief

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.220 align:middle line:90%
that everything is possible.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.200 align:middle line:90%
Let me give it a go.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And through my
experiences, it had

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.590 align:middle line:84%
me see that it wasn't just
me that was suffering.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Granted, my experiences
were fairly unique.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.340 align:middle line:90%
My feelings were not unique.

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:47.990 align:middle line:84%
The depression, the
anxiety, the residual--

00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:50.780 align:middle line:90%
the suffering-- was not unique.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And the Dalai Lama said that
pain happens in an instant.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Suffering is our
desire to hold onto it.

00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Now there's a statement worth
a million bucks honestly.

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And because of all
of that realization,

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:11.270 align:middle line:84%
it's driven me to do
the work that I do now.

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:15.620 align:middle line:84%
Because I really see
that, as somebody

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:18.140 align:middle line:84%
who's experienced what I have,
it didn't just occur for me.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It's occurred on
behalf of mankind.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And the crime would be in
me holding that learning

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and that knowing to myself
of who we are, what we are,

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and what's possible
for us beyond what we

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.540 align:middle line:84%
read in books, beyond what
we're conditioned to believe.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:39.140 align:middle line:84%
The real us, the true us, the
seven-year-old inside of us--

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.820 align:middle line:90%
that is the real us.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:44.570 align:middle line:84%
Now how does that find
its way in this world

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:47.780 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is so powerful,
potent, and profound that it

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.600 align:middle line:84%
becomes the most extraordinary
example for everybody

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.730 align:middle line:90%
else in our lives?

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And bottling the
focus and potency

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:02.540 align:middle line:84%
of what occurred in Bali
is what I really believe

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:05.120 align:middle line:84%
has become my
blessing and gift now.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.650 align:middle line:90%
And the work that I do--

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:08.540 align:middle line:90%
I run workshops.

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.760 align:middle line:90%
And I speak globally.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.990 align:middle line:84%
I do in excess of about 180
presentations every year.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:17.610 align:middle line:84%
I am Australia's most
experienced speaker.

00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:20.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm now one of the most sought
after presenters on mindset

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and the psychology
of wealth and health

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:27.980 align:middle line:84%
from a point of view
of that deep self

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:32.930 align:middle line:84%
and also the effortless
self, by being

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:35.120 align:middle line:90%
able to be us effortlessly.

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:38.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is being the
seven-year-old without all the

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.940 align:middle line:84%
baggage, to be the
self effortlessly.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.590 align:middle line:90%
And it takes reconditioning.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:45.890 align:middle line:90%
It takes seeing a new normal.

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:47.600 align:middle line:84%
And I feel very
blessed that I was

00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:52.700 align:middle line:84%
able to have somebody put a
bomb under my butt to wake me up

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.890 align:middle line:90%
on behalf of humanity.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And now I really feel like
it's come full circle.

00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:01.070 align:middle line:90%
And it hasn't even finished yet.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.640 align:middle line:90%
Feel like the rain just started.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.490 align:middle line:90%
It's just the beginning.

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But I feel blessed to
be able to do this work

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:11.210 align:middle line:84%
and to touch the lives
of as many people

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:13.220 align:middle line:84%
as I possibly can before
the end of my days,

00:44:13.220 --> 00:44:17.360 align:middle line:84%
to wake as many people up, and
to be part of this ground swell

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:19.880 align:middle line:84%
that you're obviously
part of it as well.

00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:21.860 align:middle line:84%
You know, to have people
say, hang on a sec.

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm at the center of this.

00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:25.310 align:middle line:90%
I am the cause.

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:27.350 align:middle line:90%
I am also at the effect.

00:44:27.350 --> 00:44:28.850 align:middle line:90%
And I am responsible.

00:44:28.850 --> 00:44:29.710 align:middle line:90%
It's my life.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:32.320 align:middle line:90%


00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Carren, thank you so
much for sharing your story,

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.840 align:middle line:84%
for the inspiration that you
are now and that you continue

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.970 align:middle line:90%
to live for.

00:44:42.970 --> 00:44:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Every time I think of you, I
just think of the caterpillar

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:49.870 align:middle line:84%
into this most beautiful
butterfly which you are now.

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you fly around
just sharing your beauty

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:54.640 align:middle line:90%
and your inspiration.

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you so much
for today and for sharing

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.760 align:middle line:84%
and for everything
you continue to do.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.130 align:middle line:84%
You're truly, truly
a gift to us all.

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.930 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:05.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:06.260 align:middle line:90%
And right back at you.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.060 align:middle line:90%
Right back at you.

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:09.380 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:15.000 align:middle line:90%
