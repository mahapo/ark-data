00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:12.830 align:middle line:90%


00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Dr. Demartini, welcome.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Thank you again for joining us.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Today, we're going to be
talking about three steps

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.840 align:middle line:90%
to beating financial anxiety.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly know
I've experienced, myself,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.710 align:middle line:84%
anxiety around finances
and learning to manage

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.310 align:middle line:90%
my money and my wealth.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned how
intimately related

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.200 align:middle line:84%
it is to my health
and my well-being,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:84%
and that anxiety, when
we're not managing

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:84%
our money and our
relationship to money,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.830 align:middle line:84%
impacts our relationship
to our health.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to talk to you
today about three key values

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.120 align:middle line:84%
that I know you have in
relationship to money,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and creating wealth,
and financial health.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.300 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, perfect.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Firstly, I'd like to
share that everybody

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.325 align:middle line:84%
lives by a set of
priorities, a set of values,

00:01:05.325 --> 00:01:06.950 align:middle line:84%
things that are most
important to least

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:90%
important in their life.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.530 align:middle line:84%
And that set of values
or hierarchy of values

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.857 align:middle line:84%
dictates their
financial destiny.

00:01:15.857 --> 00:01:16.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say it again.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
The hierarchy of
one's values dictates

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.750 align:middle line:90%
their financial destiny.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say you meet
somebody, and it's a woman.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And her highest value
is her children,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.750 align:middle line:84%
children's health,
children's education,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:90%
children's entertainment.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And the next is home,
furniture, socializing, travel,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and then shopping,
and fitness, and then

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.235 align:middle line:84%
shoes, and shoes, and shoes,
and shoes, and shoes, and Jimmy

00:01:46.235 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:90%
Choo shoes.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.110 align:middle line:84%
That set of values, even
if you went down further,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.610 align:middle line:84%
you don't see building business,
you don't see building wealth,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
you don't see saving
money in that list.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So the second that woman
gets money and receives it

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.750 align:middle line:84%
from whatever form, either
from working, inheritance,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.990 align:middle line:84%
or even from her
husband, that money will

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.570 align:middle line:90%
spend according her values.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.680 align:middle line:84%
The hierarchy of your
values dictates how you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.670 align:middle line:90%
spend and manage your money.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not-- it does not
matter how much you make.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.400 align:middle line:84%
What matters is how you
manage what you make,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.890 align:middle line:84%
and your values dictate
how you manage it.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Because the second she
gets money, most of it's

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.077 align:middle line:90%
going to go to her children

00:02:26.077 --> 00:02:28.660 align:middle line:84%
If there's a little extra, then
it's going to go to the house.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And a little extra,
it's going to go

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:90%
to entertainment and travel.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.175 align:middle line:84%
And finally, it's going
to be shopping at the end.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
You have other set of values
that shopping is at the top,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.760 align:middle line:90%
and they're consumers.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:84%
The second they get
money, they spend it

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.472 align:middle line:84%
on immediate gratification
and consumerism.

00:02:41.472 --> 00:02:43.430 align:middle line:84%
And they buy depreciables
that go down in value

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:90%
the moment they buy.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.950 align:middle line:84%
People that have a
wealth value system,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:84%
they have a desire to build a
business that serves people,

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:90%
so they have a source of income.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.390 align:middle line:84%
They desire to manage the
business so it's profitable.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.400 align:middle line:84%
They have a desire to
save a portion of it

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.920 align:middle line:84%
to build up liquidity to
stabilize the business so they

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.430 align:middle line:84%
have a sustainable business
and to reduce the volatilities

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.340 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:84%
They have a desire to invest
and learn the art of investing,

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:90%
so it's working for them.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:84%
And they have a desire
to accumulate money

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.550 align:middle line:90%
and a cause for money.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.100 align:middle line:84%
When they have those
values, when they get money,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.600 align:middle line:84%
instead of spending it,
they put it in investments.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.760 align:middle line:84%
So the money works for them,
and so they become its master.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Instead of them
working for money,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:90%
so they become its slave.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:84%
So the hierarchy of
one's values dictates

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.280 align:middle line:90%
their financial destiny.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, what does that have
to do with the anxiety?

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.823 align:middle line:84%
Any time you set a goal that's
not aligned with your values,

00:03:34.823 --> 00:03:36.906 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have what
I call the A, B, Cs, Ds,

00:03:36.906 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:90%
Es of negativity.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.973 align:middle line:84%
Internal anger and aggression,
internal blame and feelings

00:03:40.973 --> 00:03:42.890 align:middle line:84%
of betrayal, internal
criticism and challenge,

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:84%
internal despair and depression,
and the desire to escape.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.355 align:middle line:84%
And people have that around
their financial situation.

00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:51.230 align:middle line:84%
They feel frustrated
and angry at themselves.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.012 align:middle line:84%
They feel-- they
blame themselves,

00:03:53.012 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:84%
they feel they
betrayed themselves.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.637 align:middle line:84%
They can't get ahead, they've
criticized themselves,

00:03:56.637 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:90%
they feel depressed.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
escape their life,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.770 align:middle line:84%
and that's because
they're expecting

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.560 align:middle line:84%
to get wealthy and have more
money at the end of their month

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.310 align:middle line:84%
than month at the
end of their money,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.400 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have the values
that will lead them there.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:84%
So the second they get
money, they immediately

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.970 align:middle line:84%
spend it and buy
depreciables and consumables

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.370 align:middle line:84%
which make them go into
debt instead of actually

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.110 align:middle line:84%
going to get into
assets that grow

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and become financially wealthy.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So unless you have the hierarchy
of values that is really geared

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.378 align:middle line:84%
towards saving and
investing in money,

00:04:23.378 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:84%
it's not likely to
happen, and you're

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.802 align:middle line:84%
going to have
anxieties around it.

00:04:26.802 --> 00:04:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting
is that money circulates

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:84%
through the economy from those
who value it least to those

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
evaluate most, and for
people who value themselves

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.320 align:middle line:84%
least to people who
value themselves most.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And people that value serving
people least to those who

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.380 align:middle line:90%
value serving people the most.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.620 align:middle line:90%
So that leads to three things.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.100 align:middle line:84%
If you exaggerate yourself and
project your values onto others

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and minimize them,
you're not going

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.060 align:middle line:84%
to meet their needs when
you're serving them,

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and you won't have
a source of income.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.680 align:middle line:84%
If you minimize yourself
and exaggerate others

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.750 align:middle line:84%
when you're going in
negotiation or selling,

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.250 align:middle line:84%
then you also give
away the profits.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.260 align:middle line:84%
You'll negotiate
away your profits.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
equanimity within yourself

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.850 align:middle line:84%
and equity between you and
others and you're equal,

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.717 align:middle line:84%
then you'll care
enough to communicate

00:05:09.717 --> 00:05:12.050 align:middle line:84%
what you have to offer, your
product, services, or ideas

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.340 align:middle line:90%
in terms of their values.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.895 align:middle line:84%
They'll buy it, and you'll
meet their needs, which

00:05:15.895 --> 00:05:17.270 align:middle line:84%
is a source of
income, and you'll

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.610 align:middle line:84%
meet your own needs, which
you mean, I value my self.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
My self-worth is up,
and I'll save a portion.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So net worth occurs when you
have other worth and self-worth

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.140 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.307 align:middle line:84%
It means you care enough
about others to serve them,

00:05:28.307 --> 00:05:30.230 align:middle line:84%
and you care enough
about yourself to save.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.880 align:middle line:84%
When you put those
two together, you're

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:84%
on your way to having
some self-worth.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:84%
When you live by
your highest values,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.805 align:middle line:84%
you have more of
an equitable mind.

00:05:37.805 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
You have objective
reasoning, and you're more

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:84%
understanding that it
takes serving people

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:84%
to have a source of
income, and it takes

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.260 align:middle line:90%
saving in order to keep that.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you're living in a
unfulfilled life, the animal

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.880 align:middle line:84%
brain, the amygdala
comes on line,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and you want avoid
pain and seek pleasure,

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.840 align:middle line:84%
and you want immediate
gratification,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.840 align:middle line:84%
and you have addictive
behaviors to consumerism,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.257 align:middle line:84%
and you're consuming other
people's brands, because you're

00:05:57.257 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:84%
not fulfilled instead of
building your own brand

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.030 align:middle line:90%
to fulfill yourself and others.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:10.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So that relationship between
self-worth and the core values,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.780 align:middle line:90%
is there an order?

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.220 align:middle line:90%
And which comes first?

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.280 align:middle line:84%
You have to have self-worth
first in order then

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.020 align:middle line:84%
to make those core values in
order, in which they need to be

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.900 align:middle line:90%
for you to attract the money?

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, no.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:26.193 align:middle line:84%
Well, every human being has a
set of values no matter what.

00:06:26.193 --> 00:06:27.235 align:middle line:90%
It's automatically there.

00:06:27.235 --> 00:06:29.485 align:middle line:84%
They're Born and they're
evolving through their lives.

00:06:29.485 --> 00:06:31.820 align:middle line:84%
It's evolving, but they
have a core set of values.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
If they set goals that match
it, they have fulfillment.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.407 align:middle line:84%
But if they don't have a
value on wealth building,

00:06:37.407 --> 00:06:39.490 align:middle line:84%
then they'll have a fantasy
about wealth building.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.530 align:middle line:84%
1% of the population or less
become financially independent,

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.547 align:middle line:90%
only 1%.

00:06:43.547 --> 00:06:45.380 align:middle line:84%
So most people don't
have a value on wealth,

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.092 align:middle line:84%
but they have a
value on consumerism.

00:06:47.092 --> 00:06:49.300 align:middle line:84%
They want the fancy lifestyle
of the rich and famous.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So they can have
a value on themself?

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:90%
>> But just not a value on--

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they won't have
financial independence unless

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.122 align:middle line:84%
they have a value
on wealth building.

00:06:57.122 --> 00:06:59.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to happen,
or unless they inherit it,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.160 align:middle line:90%
or marry somebody that has it.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:90%
So you've got a choice.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.220 align:middle line:84%
Either set goals that
match your values

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.590 align:middle line:84%
to have fulfillment
that you may or may not

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
have financial independence
unless you have

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.340 align:middle line:90%
a value on wealth building.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Or you can change your
values to match your goals.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So I train people in both
of them in my programs,

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
because some people have
a great set of values,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.730 align:middle line:84%
and they do want to change
it, and they're grateful.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
But they just need to set
real goals that now match it

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.830 align:middle line:84%
so they can feel fulfilled
and quit living in fantasies

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:90%
about who they are.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.550 align:middle line:84%
Others would like to
change their values.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.780 align:middle line:90%
Really simple.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.580 align:middle line:84%
You change your
value spontaneously

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.010 align:middle line:84%
by stacking up benefits
associated with it.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Let me give an example.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:37.730 align:middle line:84%
If a young girl
who's eight years old

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:84%
is about to sing solo in front
of her elementary school,

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.100 align:middle line:84%
and she's got a white
dress on, and pigtails,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and she stands up
and is about to sing,

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and she goes and sings,
and she's like an angel.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Her voice is perfectly clear,
she doesn't miss a tune,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.377 align:middle line:90%
in perfect pitch, and doesn't--

00:07:53.377 --> 00:07:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And they applaud and they
give a standing ovation,

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.505 align:middle line:84%
she's probably
going to sing again.

00:07:57.505 --> 00:07:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But if she goes up there,
and gets off key, forgets

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.790 align:middle line:84%
her words, and everything else,
and wants to run off stage,

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:02.990 align:middle line:84%
and people throw at
her, and boo at her,

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.580 align:middle line:84%
and they don't want to
talk to her afterwards,

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.170 align:middle line:84%
she may never get
up there again.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:84%
So the pleasures or the
pains associate with an event

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.610 align:middle line:84%
can make you accentuate or
decentuate doing something.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:15.955 align:middle line:84%
So you can stack up benefits
and raise a value up

00:08:15.955 --> 00:08:18.140 align:middle line:84%
on your value list, or you
can stack up draw-backs

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.710 align:middle line:84%
and lower it, and remodel
your value system.

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Life's doing it anyway, but
you can do it consciously.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.820 align:middle line:84%
So I can literally
add new values

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:84%
and help wealth building become
high on a person's values.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:30.179 align:middle line:84%
I do it every
weekend in programs

00:08:30.179 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:84%
to show them how to build
wealth and their life.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Because until they have
truly a value on it,

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:35.340 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to happen.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've been watching
people get wealthy.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:84%
And I've interviewed
many, many billionaires.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.980 align:middle line:84%
And I can see the
people that are

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.960 align:middle line:84%
poor in townships
versus very wealthy,

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.710 align:middle line:84%
and they have a
different set of values.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So, so long as you have
a value on wealth building

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:84%
but not a value on yourself,
you can still create your value?

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Your self-worth is directly
proportionate to the congruency

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.612 align:middle line:84%
between your actions
and your values.

00:08:56.612 --> 00:08:58.070 align:middle line:84%
If you're setting
a goal and you're

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.320 align:middle line:84%
taking actions that's aligned
with your highest value,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:90%
your self-worth gives up.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you set a goal that's
not aligned with your highest

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
values, your
self-worth goes down,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
because if you set a goal
that's aligned with your highest

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.925 align:middle line:84%
values, you're disciplined,
reliable, and focused,

00:09:08.925 --> 00:09:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and you have an acute
awareness of what

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.623 align:middle line:84%
it takes to see
opportunities and act on it.

00:09:12.623 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:84%
But if you're setting goals that
aren't really important to you,

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle line:84%
you'll procrastinate,
hestitate, and frustrate.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:18.410 align:middle line:90%
You'll be unfulfilled.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:19.790 align:middle line:84%
If it's challenging,
you'll give up on it,

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and you'll want immediate
gratification to compensate.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.960 align:middle line:84%
The key is to set goals
that are congruent.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.238 align:middle line:84%
The key is to make sure you
have a value on wealth building.

00:09:28.238 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
If you put those
two together, you're

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.340 align:middle line:84%
on your way to get
to one-percenters.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.923 align:middle line:84%
If not, you're going
to bang your head

00:09:32.923 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:84%
against the wall with the
A, B, C, Ds of negativity

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.710 align:middle line:84%
and think there's
something wrong with you.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And your self-worth
is going to go down,

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.680 align:middle line:84%
because you're trying to be
wealthy without the values that

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:90%
will lead you there.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And the second you get
money, you keep spending it.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:90%
You go, I keep sabotaging.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.820 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing that?

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.092 align:middle line:90%
Why don't I blow my money?

00:09:46.092 --> 00:09:47.300 align:middle line:90%
No, you're not blowing money.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.508 align:middle line:84%
You're spending it on what
really is valuable to you.

00:09:49.508 --> 00:09:51.650 align:middle line:84%
You just think you have a
value on wealth building.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.452 align:middle line:84%
I asked people, 5,000
people in South Africa.

00:09:54.452 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And I stood up and
I said, how many

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.660 align:middle line:84%
do you want to be
financially independent?

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.820 align:middle line:90%
All the hands went up.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:84%
I said, quickly, write
down on a piece of paper.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:05.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you 30,
60 seconds to write down

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.540 align:middle line:84%
what you would do if I give
you $10 million dollars US.

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.070 align:middle line:84%
So on your mark, get
set, you got 60 seconds.

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.537 align:middle line:84%
The 10 most important things you
would do if all of a sudden you

00:10:14.537 --> 00:10:17.490 align:middle line:84%
had $10 million, and you
never had to work again.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And they quickly
wrote it all down.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.732 align:middle line:84%
I said, now pass it to
the person next to you,

00:10:21.732 --> 00:10:23.690 align:middle line:84%
and then calculate how
much of that $10 million

00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:84%
is spent and left as
actually cash left.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.565 align:middle line:84%
99% of that room had spent
between $2 million and $8

00:10:31.565 --> 00:10:33.857 align:middle line:90%
million in less than a minute.

00:10:33.857 --> 00:10:35.940 align:middle line:84%
I could go on that trip,
I could buy that new car.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:84%
They were all
buying depreciables,

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.840 align:middle line:84%
and they were fantasizing
about the wealthy lifestyle.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Those people will never be
financially independent.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.060 align:middle line:84%
There were seven people
out of 5,000 people

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.270 align:middle line:84%
that honestly wrote down what
they would do with investments

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:51.253 align:middle line:90%
to make it $20 million.

00:10:51.253 --> 00:10:52.670 align:middle line:84%
Those are the seven
that are going

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:55.197 align:middle line:84%
to be financially
independent, because if you

00:10:55.197 --> 00:10:56.780 align:middle line:84%
don't have a value
on wealth building,

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:57.855 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to happen.

00:10:57.855 --> 00:10:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And people have
fantasies all the time.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.997 align:middle line:84%
And they go, I can't
seem to get ahead.

00:11:01.997 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:90%
They have plenty of money.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.510 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people double
and quadruple their income

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:07.190 align:middle line:84%
over a 20-year period
and still can't

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.020 align:middle line:84%
pay their bills, because it's
not about how much you make.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.690 align:middle line:84%
It's about how you
manage what you make,

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.390 align:middle line:84%
and how you manage it
is based on your values.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And I remember experiencing
exactly what you're talking

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.560 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.930 align:middle line:84%
I listened to a whole series
on your financial coaching.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And one part of it
always stuck with me,

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:84%
and it was the simple
commitment to put 10% away

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:90%
of everything that you want.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:40.670 align:middle line:84%
From the moment I listened
to that one line on that CD,

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.650 align:middle line:90%
I started from that day onwards.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:45.950 align:middle line:84%
The next paycheck, I
started putting 10% away.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And just how it made
me feel the moment I

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:53.360 align:middle line:84%
did that, it alleviated
so much anxiety,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:58.550 align:middle line:84%
because I knew at a
level, I was I was saving.

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:84%
Even if it felt like a
struggle to put that 10% away,

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:06.170 align:middle line:84%
I'd look at where I'd have to
stop spending in order to be

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:08.030 align:middle line:90%
able to put that 10% away.

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:10.877 align:middle line:84%
And how that made me feel
changed my whole mindset.

00:12:10.877 --> 00:12:12.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And you attracted more
opportunities for money.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because when
you manage money wisely,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.145 align:middle line:90%
you get more money to manage.

00:12:16.145 --> 00:12:17.750 align:middle line:90%
It's a basic law.

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.640 align:middle line:84%
People always wait
for extra to do it,

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.440 align:middle line:84%
but Parkinson's law
won't allow them to.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.230 align:middle line:84%
If you don't spend your money on
savings and investments upfront

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.150 align:middle line:84%
and pay yourself
first, you will always

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.593 align:middle line:84%
have unexpected bills come
into erode the possibility.

00:12:28.593 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:90%
You can't pay yourself last.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.920 align:middle line:90%
You pay yourself first.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Rich people automatically
pay themselves first.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.517 align:middle line:84%
Poor people automatically
pay themselves last.

00:12:34.517 --> 00:12:36.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's been historically shown.

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to value yourself,
and you have to value wealth.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:90%
And I made a statement.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:84%
Boy, this is really going to
push the buttons out there.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.577 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking at a
church, and the room--

00:12:46.577 --> 00:12:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say it was
the wealthiest church.

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:90%
It was kind of a mid-range.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if you're
poor, it's because you

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.210 align:middle line:84%
don't care about
humanity, and I just

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.670 align:middle line:84%
paused, just to see
what their reaction is.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.087 align:middle line:84%
And people, you could see them
ruffling of their feathers,

00:13:01.087 --> 00:13:02.548 align:middle line:90%
sitting up.

00:13:02.548 --> 00:13:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I said, because if you
care about humanity,

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.950 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go find
out what people need,

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:84%
and you're going to directly
or indirectly find a solution

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
to solve those needs, because
you care about people,

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.220 align:middle line:90%
and you want to help them.

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.860 align:middle line:84%
When you do, you have
a source of income.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.750 align:middle line:84%
If you don't care about
humanity and you're

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.280 align:middle line:84%
kind of living in this
socialistic world,

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.988 align:middle line:84%
the world's supposed
to take care of you,

00:13:20.988 --> 00:13:23.720 align:middle line:84%
and entitlement instead
of an empowerment,

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.070 align:middle line:90%
you'll be poor in life.

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:84%
You have to care about
humanity to go out

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:27.890 align:middle line:90%
and find a way of serving it.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.700 align:middle line:90%
You have a talent.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.367 align:middle line:84%
You have a unique,
competitive advantage

00:13:30.367 --> 00:13:33.140 align:middle line:84%
based on whatever's highest on
your values, and it's service.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.340 align:middle line:84%
If you value that, you
have a source of service.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't value
you, you won't keep it.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.400 align:middle line:90%
And you started valuing you.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.600 align:middle line:84%
And when you-- the
moment you value you,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:90%
the world starts valuing you.

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.330 align:middle line:84%
As long as you pay
yourself first,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.110 align:middle line:84%
other people start
paying you first.

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think also, another
lesson that I learned,

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:52.340 align:middle line:84%
and I'm still refining,
still learning

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:84%
within that space
is the relationship,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.390 align:middle line:84%
the mental and emotional
relationship towards money

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:02.210 align:middle line:90%
and valuing money itself.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.230 align:middle line:84%
So valuing-- if I
see a $0.05 piece,

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:07.790 align:middle line:84%
I'll pick it up
because I value it,

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.050 align:middle line:84%
not just, oh, it's only
$0.05, and leave it there.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I got to share a story.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:17.088 align:middle line:90%
I was 9 years old, and my dad--

00:14:17.088 --> 00:14:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I went to my dad, and I said,
Dad, I want to earn some money,

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.463 align:middle line:84%
because I want to buy
a baseball, and a bat,

00:14:21.463 --> 00:14:22.875 align:middle line:90%
and a glove.

00:14:22.875 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
if you mow the yard.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.990 align:middle line:84%
Yes, because I had
those responsible.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.450 align:middle line:90%
Have you edged the sidewalk?

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Have you cut the hedges?

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.167 align:middle line:90%
Have you swept the sidewalk?

00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:33.890 align:middle line:90%
How to cleaned out the gutters?

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:34.110 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:90%
Have you cleaned the garage?

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:35.900 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%
Have you pulled the weeds?

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:38.450 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Have you cleaned your room?

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
He said, Son, I don't
have anything else that

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:84%
needs to be done, so I
can't just give you money

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.035 align:middle line:90%
without you doing some service.

00:14:47.035 --> 00:14:48.410 align:middle line:84%
So I suggest you
go the neighbors

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.785 align:middle line:84%
and see if you
can find something

00:14:49.785 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:84%
profitable and
productive for them.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.537 align:middle line:90%
I went, OK.

00:14:53.537 --> 00:14:54.620 align:middle line:90%
So I went down the street.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:57.317 align:middle line:84%
I went up to the Evans,
which is two doors down,

00:14:57.317 --> 00:14:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and I saw that their
yard was sort of messy,

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.858 align:middle line:84%
and I knew I could do
something about it.

00:15:00.858 --> 00:15:03.162 align:middle line:84%
And I asked if I could help
straighten up their yard.

00:15:03.162 --> 00:15:04.370 align:middle line:90%
And she said, well, how much?

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.037 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what to think,
and so I just made up a number.

00:15:07.037 --> 00:15:08.780 align:middle line:84%
And they should, well,
that sounds fair.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.375 align:middle line:84%
And I spent most the
day clipping the hedges.

00:15:11.375 --> 00:15:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I got stung by bees, I
trimmed it, I did everything,

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:17.200 align:middle line:84%
and I used all the
equipment from the garage.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:84%
And I went out and bought
a baseball and a glove

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.257 align:middle line:90%
with the money I made.

00:15:20.257 --> 00:15:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And my dad said, I see you
got a new baseball and glove.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.370 align:middle line:90%
That's fantastic.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.060 align:middle line:90%
Where did you get it?

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
did what you said.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:90%
I worked.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, what
equipment did you use?

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, the
one in the garage.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:30.210 align:middle line:84%
He said, Son, I have
to teach you something.

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
There's a thing
called depreciation,

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.775 align:middle line:84%
and there's cost in that
use of that equipment,

00:15:34.775 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:84%
and let's calculate
what you did,

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:84%
and let me calculate
what you owe me.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.903 align:middle line:90%
And it turned out to be $7.50.

00:15:40.903 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd already
spent the money.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:90%
So I went, oh, gosh.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And now I had to do two yards
to pay that back, plus what

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.770 align:middle line:90%
I owed him for those two yards.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that that was
the responsibility I had.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.290 align:middle line:90%
And I understood that.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.690 align:middle line:90%
He explained it to me.

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, I was
burned out a little bit,

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.468 align:middle line:90%
working harder and making less.

00:15:58.468 --> 00:16:00.510 align:middle line:84%
And some kid came by on
a bicycle, and I saw him,

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:02.593 align:middle line:84%
and I said, hey, would you
like to push lawnmower?

00:16:02.593 --> 00:16:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I'll pay you $0.50 to
push the lawnmower.

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:05.580 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So I had three kids helping
do the yards, another three

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:09.480 align:middle line:90%
kids, another three kids.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.010 align:middle line:90%
I got nine kids working.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I went in borrowed the
Zoobroads' and the Malas'

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.260 align:middle line:90%
equipment across the street.

00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:16.790 align:middle line:84%
And I had three
pieces of equipment,

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.290 align:middle line:84%
doing three yards at a time,
going through the neighborhood,

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.568 align:middle line:90%
doing all the yards.

00:16:20.568 --> 00:16:22.110 align:middle line:84%
And I ended up paying
everybody else,

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:84%
my dad off, everything else,
and I made a net of $45

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.430 align:middle line:90%
after everything was paid.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.600 align:middle line:84%
This was in 1963, which
is about $700 a day

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:90%
today, which is good money.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.800 align:middle line:84%
If I had a kid like
that, I'd had more kids.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So my dad saw that
that was happening,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.700 align:middle line:84%
but I was spending my money,
buying bicycles, buying

00:16:38.700 --> 00:16:41.970 align:middle line:84%
golf clubs, buying this and
that, and saw I wasn't saving.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So he bought me a
coin collection set,

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.197 align:middle line:90%
and he bought me a piggy bank.

00:16:46.197 --> 00:16:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want you
to put money in here

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:49.170 align:middle line:84%
to teach you how
to learn to save,

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.920 align:middle line:84%
because if you keep consuming
it, you'll always have to work.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
But if you start saving
it, it will work for you.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.087 align:middle line:84%
So I flip the coin
collection and start

00:16:56.087 --> 00:16:58.420 align:middle line:84%
to put the right coins in
there, and it was kind of fun,

00:16:58.420 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:90%
and thought longer term.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.590 align:middle line:90%
And I got the piggy bank.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.630 align:middle line:84%
My dad never gave me the
key or the combination

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.010 align:middle line:90%
to open that piggy bank.

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.230 align:middle line:84%
In my 52nd floor
building in Houston,

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Texas, in my office
on the credenza

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.140 align:middle line:84%
is that original
bank 52 years ago,

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.970 align:middle line:84%
still sitting with the
same original coins.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.262 align:middle line:84%
It's worth probably-- I don't
even know how much today.

00:17:17.262 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:90%
Those are original coins.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's still there, and I
never want to use that money,

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.250 align:middle line:84%
because it is a metaphor
for thinking long term.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And then my father
did one more thing.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.310 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want you to know what
it's like to buy your freedom.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.185 align:middle line:90%
I said, what is that?

00:17:29.185 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:84%
Every time he talks to
me, I'm losing money.

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:32.760 align:middle line:90%
I said, what is that?

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.385 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want you to know
what it's like to have freedom,

00:17:35.385 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:84%
so from now on, you're going
to pay for clothing, rent,

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:38.905 align:middle line:90%
and food.

00:17:38.905 --> 00:17:41.280 align:middle line:84%
But now, you're going to have
freedom on your new bicycle

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.738 align:middle line:84%
to go anywhere you want as long
as you're home at 9 o'clock

00:17:43.738 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.180 align:middle line:84%
So I started exploring
35 mile bike rides,

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:50.910 align:middle line:84%
40 mile bike rides on
my bike, and come back,

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and be there by 9 o'clock,
and bought freedom,

00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:55.858 align:middle line:84%
but I had to pay
him $7.50 a week.

00:17:55.858 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
And in the process of
doing it, I got my freedom.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And he was trying to prepare
me for being an entrepreneur,

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.160 align:middle line:84%
to let you know that the
more accountability you have,

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:84%
the more opportunities
you have in life,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.152 align:middle line:90%
and I'm very grateful for that.

00:18:06.152 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And sometime today, we don't
always-- we rescue people,

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.070 align:middle line:84%
enable people instead of
making them accountable.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:12.940 align:middle line:84%
We rob them of dignity,
accountability, responsibility,

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and productivity,
and then expect them

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.088 align:middle line:90%
to have wealth consciousness.

00:18:16.088 --> 00:18:18.630 align:middle line:84%
They don't have a void to drive
them to want to build wealth.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:21.120 align:middle line:84%
And so as a result of it,
we have a social environment

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.787 align:middle line:84%
where everybody's
expecting other people

00:18:22.787 --> 00:18:23.800 align:middle line:90%
to take care of them.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you give
us, before we finish,

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.940 align:middle line:84%
maybe just three simple
exercises that our audience

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:84%
could start doing for themselves
today that would start

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:84%
to improve their
relationship with money?

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:35.424 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:35.424 --> 00:18:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I mean--

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.183 align:middle line:84%
>> The first thing I would do
is make a list of everything you

00:18:39.183 --> 00:18:41.340 align:middle line:84%
do in a day, everything,
your entire day,

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.590 align:middle line:90%
personal and professional.

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And then put next
to it how much does

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.650 align:middle line:90%
it produce per minute or hour?

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:49.650 align:middle line:84%
How much does that
actually generate?

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.343 align:middle line:84%
And then next to that, how
much meaning does it give you.

00:18:52.343 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:84%
And next to that
is, what would it

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.260 align:middle line:84%
be, the replacement
cost, if you had

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:90%
to delegate that to somebody?

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:00.060 align:middle line:84%
And next to it is how
much time is spent.

00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And get in touch with how
you're really managing your day

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:84%
and looking at what you're
doing, because if you're

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.400 align:middle line:84%
doing things all are lower
value and devaluing you,

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.410 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have a
devalued consciousness.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:11.700 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing
the highest priority

00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:84%
things, and most productive
things that serve the most

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.560 align:middle line:84%
people, that produce
the most income,

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle line:84%
you're going to raise
your wealth consciousness.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So first, do an inventory
about how you're really

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:20.970 align:middle line:84%
spending your day,
because if you're

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:23.580 align:middle line:84%
doing low priority things
and doing devalued things,

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.130 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
a devalued life.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.610 align:middle line:84%
But if you're doing the
highest priority things that

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:28.410 align:middle line:84%
serve the most people, that make
the biggest difference, that

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.077 align:middle line:84%
have meaning, that
you can't wait to do,

00:19:30.077 --> 00:19:32.820 align:middle line:84%
that makes a difference,
and you get rewarded for it,

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:84%
then make, next, after
you identify that, make

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.970 align:middle line:84%
sure you save a portion of
it, like you'd say, save 10%.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.280 align:middle line:84%
If you're 20 years
old, if you save 10%,

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:43.613 align:middle line:84%
you can retire at 65
financially independent.

00:19:43.613 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:84%
If you're 30 years old,
you'll need to do 20%.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:46.800 align:middle line:90%
If you're 40 years old, 30%.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:90%
50 years old, 40%.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.530 align:middle line:84%
60 years old, 50%
of your income.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So the longer you wait,
the harder it is to do,

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.030 align:middle line:90%
and the less probable.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:56.473 align:middle line:84%
So the sooner you get
started on saving and then

00:19:56.473 --> 00:19:58.140 align:middle line:84%
learning to invest
after you've built up

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:84%
a cushion of cash, the greater
your financial possibilities.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.380 align:middle line:84%
So save and then invest
before you ever speculate.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.637 align:middle line:84%
So save a portion of it, and
then make sure on a daily basis

00:20:08.637 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:84%
that you're grateful
for what you get to do,

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:11.580 align:middle line:84%
because when you're
grateful for what you get,

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:13.420 align:middle line:90%
you get more to be grateful for.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.590 align:middle line:90%
And learn and study it.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.230 align:middle line:84%
Become educated on it,
because intelligent people

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.202 align:middle line:84%
that really know
about wealth building

00:20:19.202 --> 00:20:20.660 align:middle line:84%
are the people that
end up with it.

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.500 align:middle line:84%
I've never met a wealthy person
who didn't understand wealth.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.450 align:middle line:84%
So study and make it
a commitment to do it.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.700 align:middle line:84%
Warren Buffett, by age
11, had read every book

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:84%
in Omaha, Nebraska Library on
wealth building and finance,

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:90%
by the time he was 11.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.200 align:middle line:84%
So he's wealthy because
he had a value on it.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.600 align:middle line:90%
So, and also, one last thing.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.340 align:middle line:84%
Stack up 1,000 benefits of
why building a business,

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.640 align:middle line:84%
managing a business wisely,
saving a portion of it,

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:84%
investing in it,
accumulating it, and serving

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.000 align:middle line:90%
a cause with it.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Write down 1,000 benefits
of doing those things.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:84%
If you do, you'll have a
bigger reason for doing it,

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:56.800 align:middle line:84%
and you'll actually end up
with wealth, financially.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.230 align:middle line:84%
We all have wealth in
non-financial terms.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Our children, our social
life, our spiritual quest.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
But if you want financial life,
a wealth in financial ways,

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.400 align:middle line:84%
you'll have to have a value
on it and serve people.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
your time, your wisdom.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.510 align:middle line:84%
I've certainly reduced
my levels of anxiety

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.700 align:middle line:84%
by following so much of your
guidance around finances.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that that's going to
be the same for our audience,

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.277 align:middle line:90%
and I know it will be.

00:21:23.277 --> 00:21:24.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:26.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:90%
