00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.930 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.860 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Donal, a very warm welcome.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.503 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:17.503 --> 00:00:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I have the pleasure of
introducing you as both

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:84%
a personal friend and a
mentor for many years.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.700 align:middle line:84%
And you are, after all,
Australia's only CHEK Level 4

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:84%
practitioner and holistic
lifestyle coach in level 3.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And you've spent the last 23
years in the health and fitness

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.500 align:middle line:84%
industry, leading the
way in your lectures,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and your mentoring,
and your teaching.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And you bring into what you
do Paul Chek's model, which

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.100 align:middle line:90%
is very holistic.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I want to start
off by just asking you,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.800 align:middle line:84%
what brought you here to where
you are today and your journey

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.320 align:middle line:84%
thus far in the health
and fitness industry?

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all,
thank you very much, Jo.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.630 align:middle line:84%
I think my journey started
when I got into fitness myself.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And as I went through
that whole career

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
of playing sports in
the morning and so on,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.420 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to improve myself.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So I got into exercise and
training-- went to the gym.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And I found a great affinity
to improving my body.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I
suppose, working

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.970 align:middle line:84%
with clients over
the years, I found

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
there was more
knowledge I had to gain.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was something
missing from my toolbox.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:84%
So after about 10 years
of being a strength

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.093 align:middle line:84%
coach and personal trainer,
I came across Paul's work.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of resonated with me
that it was something holistic.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.870 align:middle line:90%
It made a lot of sense.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
It was common kind
of at that time

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.890 align:middle line:84%
to just like take your
whey proteins and so on,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.640 align:middle line:84%
and not actually address the
other side of the recovery.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.590 align:middle line:84%
From working with
athletes, I found

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:84%
that was the biggest
missing link.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.200 align:middle line:84%
So from there, I got into
rehab, which really excited me.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.110 align:middle line:84%
And I really enjoyed helping
people getting out of pain.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.390 align:middle line:90%
So that's my journey.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.718 align:middle line:84%
I've been in it for now,
as you said, 23 years

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and moved over here to
Australia a couple of years ago,

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and have a great life on
the northern beaches here.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:84%
So I run my studio with
my wife, Place of CHI.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really helpful
to a lot of clients.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm grateful
to a lot of clients

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:84%
to help me on my
journey to help them.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So Donal, today we're
really looking through the lens

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:84%
of movement and breathing
to really address how we can

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.270 align:middle line:84%
better overcome
depression, anxiety.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So when clients come to
you and they present with

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.360 align:middle line:84%
depression, anxiety, how do you
work with them to help balance

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.040 align:middle line:84%
their physiology
and their biology?

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.910 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, the first thing we
do is assess the client.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.820 align:middle line:84%
And the way we assess, as
you know in the CHEK program,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.790 align:middle line:84%
we look at all
facets of the body.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.310 align:middle line:84%
It's not just the physical,
the mental, emotional,

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.080 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual comes into that.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:84%
A lot of lifestyle factors
are the biggest concerns

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
when start working with
anxiety, depression.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
don't know where

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
to go and have tried
numerous medications

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.380 align:middle line:84%
or other treatments,
but really have not

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:84%
taken the journey
upon themselves

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:84%
to reflect in and
see what this is.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:90%
And sometimes, it's a lesson.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.600 align:middle line:84%
As we say, the pain teacher
comes along to teach us.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, we don't know
how to interpret the language

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.110 align:middle line:90%
of the body and where to start.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.130 align:middle line:84%
So we start off with the
assessment protocols.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we work with
them on their six foundation

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.330 align:middle line:90%
principles.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And then from there, we
work into a coaching model.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And I know Paul Chek will be
probably talking later on about

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.910 align:middle line:84%
the 1-2-3-4, which is your
one love, your two forces,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.430 align:middle line:84%
your three choices in life,
and then Paul has a model

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.810 align:middle line:90%
of the four doctors.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And that's a great
starting point

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.800 align:middle line:84%
for depression and
anxiety to start

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.160 align:middle line:84%
to see how they can start
to take control and start

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.600 align:middle line:84%
to move in a
direction that's more

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.520 align:middle line:84%
in alignment with
their emotions.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.130 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people also
don't understand

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:84%
the neurological response
and the biochemistry response

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.430 align:middle line:90%
to thinking that way.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So now we also use
movement to increase

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.990 align:middle line:84%
dopamine, serotonin responses
in the body that sometimes have

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.610 align:middle line:84%
been suppressed
through medication

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:90%
or just that stinking thinking.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.650 align:middle line:84%
So they get caught
in that trap loop.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And we try to break
them out of that.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.330 align:middle line:84%
But first, you've to give
them a carrot, the motivator.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.223 align:middle line:84%
So that's their one love for
what we call their legacy.

00:04:15.223 --> 00:04:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Where's their journey?

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.079 align:middle line:84%
They need to attach
that to what Paul says

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and what we say is,
what do you love

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.160 align:middle line:90%
enough to make a change for?

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And once I find that, then
I can anchor that to that

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and use exercise to create
those good-feel hormones

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and use lifestyle factors
to balance out biochemistry.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.220 align:middle line:84%
A lot of it is biochemistry
that's imbalanced.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, the factors
of drinking that Diet Coke

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.463 align:middle line:84%
or having some foods, or
sugars are interfering.

00:04:44.463 --> 00:04:45.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's like a fog in there.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:84%
So they want to think
healthily and work forward,

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.580 align:middle line:84%
but they're having
these factors coming

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.060 align:middle line:84%
in, what we'd say from there
an epigenetical factors,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.570 align:middle line:84%
or what Bruce Lipton would
say, their biology of belief

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.750 align:middle line:84%
is dictated by their
environment, the area

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.122 align:middle line:84%
they live in, or what
they expose themselves to.

00:05:07.122 --> 00:05:08.330 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we start with.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.410 align:middle line:84%
We start off with
a plan where they

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.830 align:middle line:84%
work on lifestyle factors
and then an exercise program.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.750 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, with
the exercise program,

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.310 align:middle line:84%
it's a bit like
playing with fire.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:18.967 align:middle line:90%
We have to be very cautious of--

00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:84%
you get these people
that get addicted

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:84%
to that kind of runner's high
and that endorphin release.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you're already
in a stress state,

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:90%
that's adding more stress on.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.923 align:middle line:84%
So you're throwing
petrol on the fire.

00:05:28.923 --> 00:05:30.840 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important
to educate the client

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:90%
about, what are the steps?

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.300 align:middle line:90%
What are the processes?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
What is your body
able to handle now?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:84%
So we call that the
physiological load.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
So once we identify
their physiological load

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.950 align:middle line:84%
through questionnaires
and assessment protocols,

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:84%
we can then put in
a step-by-step plan,

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.070 align:middle line:84%
a process plan so they
take small little goals

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:84%
and work to that
overall major goal.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.930 align:middle line:90%
So that's what we start with.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So Donal, we started
off, and you mentioned that

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.220 align:middle line:84%
the beginning of the process you
do a full physical assessment

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.360 align:middle line:90%
with somebody.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
And a postural
assessment is part

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.350 align:middle line:90%
of that physical assessment.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And I know for
myself when I first

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.840 align:middle line:84%
started in the CHEK system
that I didn't really

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:84%
correlate the
importance of posture

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.933 align:middle line:84%
and how that drives
how we think and feel.

00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:19.350 align:middle line:84%
So can you talk
to us a little bit

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.940 align:middle line:84%
about how posture
actually affects

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.300 align:middle line:90%
the biochemistry of the body?

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.513 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's a huge question.

00:06:24.513 --> 00:06:25.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's really interesting.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.722 align:middle line:84%
I was the same when I
started off in the program.

00:06:27.722 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
I was amazed at how
much posture can

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.950 align:middle line:84%
be a kind of a window into
even how a person emotionally

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.570 align:middle line:84%
is holding themselves
and guarding themselves.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.510 align:middle line:84%
So we see a lot of
forward-head posture.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.270 align:middle line:84%
We see a lot of
problems where posture

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:90%
will drag us into a position.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And that can
compress capillaries.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.140 align:middle line:84%
It can compress lymphatic flow
circulation, oxygen exchange.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So when we start
to go forward, we

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.750 align:middle line:84%
lose the efficiency of the
nasal passage from breathing.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.960 align:middle line:84%
And a gentleman called Ryback
did a study with monkeys.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.395 align:middle line:84%
And he saw that when he
stuffed up their noses,

00:07:03.395 --> 00:07:04.770 align:middle line:84%
they all went to
mouth breathing.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So we see a person
that's anxious

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:84%
go and shift into a sympathetic
dominance, which is that fight

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.790 align:middle line:84%
or flee response when
the body gets wound up.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And they'll breathe
more through their mouth.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, that changes the
biochemistry a lot.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.550 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is then
oxygen exchange, assimilation,

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.410 align:middle line:84%
digestion, elimination are
all affected by your breath.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.720 align:middle line:84%
As your breath
moves, it's a pump.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And the diaphragm
pumps and helps

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.920 align:middle line:84%
to bring blood flow
and nutrients around.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.620 align:middle line:84%
If the head goes forward,
we reduce the efficiency

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.880 align:middle line:90%
of that system.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So also, around the
top of the neck,

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.300 align:middle line:84%
we have the vagus nerve
and the nervous system

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.850 align:middle line:84%
of the upper cranial
cervical nerves.

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:47.198 align:middle line:90%
They dump the nervous energy.

00:07:47.198 --> 00:07:49.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you stay in that stress
state or that stinking thinking

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.870 align:middle line:84%
for a while, it tightens
up all the muscles

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:84%
around the traps, all up
along the neck, the scalenes,

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:90%
the sternocleidomastoid.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.870 align:middle line:84%
All these structures
start to get tight.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.598 align:middle line:84%
So doing a simple
postural analysis,

00:08:00.598 --> 00:08:02.890 align:middle line:84%
you can see that there might
be some structural issues.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:05.340 align:middle line:84%
But also, what's
driving that behind it?

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Because when you start
to do the stretches

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.387 align:middle line:84%
and the corrective
exercise, and the posture

00:08:09.387 --> 00:08:11.220 align:middle line:84%
comes back in again,
and we see those people

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:84%
that are hanging low and
holding themselves down low.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And then by putting a client
on a Swiss ball or something

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.260 align:middle line:84%
to lay over and
open up the system,

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.650 align:middle line:90%
you see the color in their face.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.630 align:middle line:90%
Their emotion changes.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of like cleans
the slate for the day.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And now we've got a
process to work with.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:90%
So posture has a big concern.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
The other thing with
posture is we have

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:90%
curvatures in the lower spine.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And then they're all
affected by the head.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.260 align:middle line:84%
The head is a mass that
has to be controlled.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.610 align:middle line:84%
It's a center of kind of gravity
that when it pushes forward,

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:84%
the pelvis will move
underneath to balance.

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.080 align:middle line:84%
So these two structures
are balancing.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And that can cause
spinal alignment issues.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:51.420 align:middle line:84%
And when that starts to happen,
we have visceral compression.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So the viscera is the organs
inside the abdominal wall.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.230 align:middle line:90%
They get compressed.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.630 align:middle line:84%
So muscles then
will start to adapt

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:90%
to that stressor on the system.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:84%
That can compress the
ovaries, the testes.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And we call it
visceroptosis, where

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:90%
the abdominals will pour out.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
And that can compress the
prostate, the digestive system,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.150 align:middle line:90%
the colon.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So when you do a
postural assessment,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.070 align:middle line:84%
it's a little window into
what might be going on behind.

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, certainly, there's
some physical stuff.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.030 align:middle line:90%
You know, people sit at a desk.

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.550 align:middle line:90%
And we could look at ergonomics.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:84%
But when you've done
all those and you've

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:29.070 align:middle line:84%
eliminated the physical and the
postural issue's still there,

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.770 align:middle line:84%
we need to look at those
different areas in the body.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.030 align:middle line:90%
And we use the Chakra system.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:36.400 align:middle line:84%
There's related emotional
issues to each different Chakra.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.400 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people with
communication issues

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.390 align:middle line:90%
will have neck issues.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people with
safety and security

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.247 align:middle line:84%
have lower back
issues, and so on.

00:09:42.247 --> 00:09:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So the correlations
we see maps over.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.910 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say, the
first time I saw that, I

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.740 align:middle line:90%
was very skeptical of all that.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.750 align:middle line:84%
And now from doing
that for over 15 years,

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:90%
I really see the correlations.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.432 align:middle line:84%
And it fascinates me
time and time again.

00:09:56.432 --> 00:09:58.140 align:middle line:84%
You can do a length-tension
relationship,

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.920 align:middle line:84%
which is a way of measuring
how much room the muscle has

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.140 align:middle line:84%
and how much give
it has in the joint.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.765 align:middle line:84%
And you stretch it,
or you exercise it.

00:10:05.765 --> 00:10:07.598 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, it
tightens back up again.

00:10:07.598 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
You're going, hmm,
there might be something

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:90%
behind that that's driving it.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.272 align:middle line:84%
So the posture gives
me a starting point.

00:10:13.272 --> 00:10:14.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like a breadcrumb
trail that I

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.660 align:middle line:84%
start to follow, clues to try
and unravel back the layers

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.190 align:middle line:84%
to see if the mental-emotional
is driving that physical issue.

00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:84%
Or is that just
a physical issue?

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we assess
the physical body

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:90%
and then go through that.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Apart from that,
I think, posture--

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.410 align:middle line:84%
also we start to see when
you hold yourself upright,

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:36.000 align:middle line:90%
we have that confidence.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And it's nearly
like that saying you

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.455 align:middle line:84%
say you fake it
till you make it.

00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:40.980 align:middle line:84%
You hold yourself
in that posture.

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.460 align:middle line:84%
So correcting people's
posture, even though sometimes

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:84%
the client has not built
up that relationship

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:51.060 align:middle line:84%
in the first couple of sessions
to talk about depression

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:54.480 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety to a deeper level
to get to the root cause,

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:84%
by starting to train them
and teaching them to hold

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.830 align:middle line:84%
themselves up, that
starts to bring

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.740 align:middle line:84%
the biochemistry with the
lifestyle factors clearing up,

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.110 align:middle line:84%
starts to release some
of these compressions,

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:84%
helps oxygen and water, and
nutrition to flow around

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:90%
the body without these blocks.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:84%
And that allows to
uplift their energy.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:14.610 align:middle line:84%
Now they have
something to work with.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard you say many
times and we use this a lot,

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:19.920 align:middle line:90%
to put that positive energy in.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.780 align:middle line:84%
It's that working in
versus working out.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.250 align:middle line:84%
We need to have this
like a bank account.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.792 align:middle line:84%
You can't keep on
taking withdrawals.

00:11:24.792 --> 00:11:27.350 align:middle line:84%
You have to have that
bio-battery recharged.

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And it's a great analogy to
kind of see that we sometimes

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.510 align:middle line:84%
have to give ourselves time to
learn how to hold and position

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.310 align:middle line:90%
ourselves.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:39.090 align:middle line:84%
And then by giving the right
exercises to align the posture,

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.160 align:middle line:84%
we start to open up
the pathway to then

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.800 align:middle line:84%
have that clean slate so that
we don't have biochemistry.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.210 align:middle line:90%
We don't have compressions.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.440 align:middle line:90%
We don't have restrictions.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.380 align:middle line:84%
We have the body
pumping and oscillating.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:52.427 align:middle line:84%
So now we have a great level
playing field to work from.

00:11:52.427 --> 00:11:54.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I start
to work with those clients

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:55.590 align:middle line:90%
with the posture.

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And corrective exercises
have gone a long way

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.613 align:middle line:90%
in the last 10 to 15 years.

00:12:00.613 --> 00:12:02.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're having great
success with that.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:04.950 align:middle line:84%
And then when we map
on the psychology

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:09.450 align:middle line:84%
or the emotional responses, and
the patterning, and the habits,

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:84%
and how they respond to
different situations,

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:84%
they're in a much better
place to handle that or even

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.940 align:middle line:84%
start to work on those
issues that they haven't

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:23.820 align:middle line:84%
been able to because it was just
too big of a story to deal with

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.820 align:middle line:84%
or too big of a situation to
deal with at the present time.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the things that
really fascinates me there just

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:34.500 align:middle line:84%
around posture is the fact
that our thoughts and our state

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.290 align:middle line:84%
of mind can actually
drive our posture,

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:84%
as well as just bad
ergonomics, as an example,

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:44.870 align:middle line:84%
can then play back into
affecting how we think and feel

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's this
two-way relationship

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.875 align:middle line:84%
between our posture and how
it makes us think and feel

00:12:52.875 --> 00:12:56.880 align:middle line:84%
all versus how we think and
feel affects our posture.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.858 align:middle line:84%
And another thing that you do
such an amazing job at teaching

00:13:01.858 --> 00:13:03.150 align:middle line:90%
is the importance of breathing.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the moment our
posture is out of alignment,

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:07.920 align:middle line:90%
it affects our breathing.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And we know that when we are
anxious or in a state of fight

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:84%
or flight, our breathing
goes into what we call

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:90%
secondary respiratory state--

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:17.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.960 align:middle line:90%
>> --or chest breathing.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> So can you talk a little
bit about how breathing

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.480 align:middle line:84%
as a hierarchy of the body
drives our state of being

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and our thinking, and
our thought processes?

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.850 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, the
emotional, the psyche,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:34.510 align:middle line:90%
drives the breathing response.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So if we had some
stressful event here

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.730 align:middle line:84%
or something jumped out at
us here and gave us a fright,

00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:41.440 align:middle line:84%
we'd change our breathing,
our rapid response.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.440 align:middle line:84%
And that was as
a way of survival

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:84%
in the human species to move
and get out of that threat.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:84%
But when we stay in that
response through the whole day,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.750 align:middle line:90%
that has a problem.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
So when we look at the
breathing and how it works,

00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:00.690 align:middle line:84%
we have muscles that kind of
are those respiratory muscles,

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:03.228 align:middle line:84%
the diaphragm, which
pumps the system.

00:14:03.228 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:84%
When we get stressed,
we start to use

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.830 align:middle line:84%
the secondary accessory
muscles, the scalenes.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And we start using
some of these muscles

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
here instead of actually
having a full breath.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, the
biochemistry starts to change.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.010 align:middle line:90%
And that shifts you by--

00:14:17.010 --> 00:14:20.160 align:middle line:84%
you can shift someone
into a state of stress

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:22.200 align:middle line:90%
by breathing incorrectly.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.520 align:middle line:84%
So when we assess
breathing, it's very funny.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
People breathe differently
in different postures.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:29.220 align:middle line:90%
So we're sitting here.

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.680 align:middle line:84%
But if we did a postural
assessment and breathing

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:84%
assessment standing up, we
may see a totally different

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.760 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.802 align:middle line:84%
And this can correlate to
their work environment.

00:14:36.802 --> 00:14:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But when they're at
home, they're fine.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.220 align:middle line:84%
It's only when they're
in work, or when they're

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:43.290 align:middle line:84%
lying on their
belly, or they have

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.110 align:middle line:84%
compression or inflammation,
that can change the breathing.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:47.610 align:middle line:84%
If they're lying
on their back, they

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:49.020 align:middle line:84%
may have a joint
out of position,

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's sore to
lie on their back.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.660 align:middle line:84%
That can change the
breathing as well.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So we just don't assess
breathing and standing.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:84%
We assess breathing in an all
fours position, prone, supine,

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and also in a seated position,
which is very important.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.480 align:middle line:84%
And we need to look
at the triggers

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:90%
to start to change that.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So there are
psychological issues,

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:84%
but there are also
physical issues.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you clear those,
we need to make sure

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:14.658 align:middle line:84%
that the muscles that do the
breathing are also healthy.

00:15:14.658 --> 00:15:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that we've seen

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of digestive
issues and the inflammation,

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:22.110 align:middle line:84%
that that starts to bring
the breathing rate up.

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.257 align:middle line:84%
It's funny where we
see breathing rate.

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:26.090 align:middle line:84%
If you're breathing and
you're sitting down,

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.190 align:middle line:84%
you should be breathing
at anywhere between--

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:33.390 align:middle line:84%
I think the books say from 14
to 16 is the average breaths.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.618 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what we find
with healthy individuals.

00:15:35.618 --> 00:15:37.410 align:middle line:84%
That's the average of
the people out there,

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:38.740 align:middle line:90%
which is the norm now.

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.317 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think it's the
natural breathing rate.

00:15:41.317 --> 00:15:42.900 align:middle line:84%
When I work with
healthy individuals--

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.710 align:middle line:84%
we've worked them with
them for a while--

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.598 align:middle line:84%
they've corrected
their physiology.

00:15:47.598 --> 00:15:49.140 align:middle line:84%
They've corrected
their biochemistry.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.880 align:middle line:84%
They've addressed the
lifestyle factors.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.922 align:middle line:84%
They're breathing rate
will go anywhere between 8

00:15:52.922 --> 00:15:54.125 align:middle line:90%
and 10 breaths per minute.

00:15:54.125 --> 00:15:54.265 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:15:54.265 --> 00:15:54.550 align:middle line:90%
That's a big difference.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:55.883 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's quite a difference.

00:15:55.883 --> 00:15:58.690 align:middle line:84%
And that response in
the body can really--

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.410 align:middle line:84%
it's like stoking up the fire,
throwing fuel on the fire

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.870 align:middle line:84%
all the time, can
drive you into a state

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
where the body then
gets that habit.

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And we start to see different
ways to release muscles.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:12.930 align:middle line:84%
But if the psychology is there,
it's going to wind us back.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:15.828 align:middle line:84%
And then if you get to
understand what's driving that,

00:16:15.828 --> 00:16:17.370 align:middle line:84%
but you haven't
released the muscles,

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:18.578 align:middle line:90%
you go back into the pattern.

00:16:18.578 --> 00:16:19.378 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:16:19.378 --> 00:16:21.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's a faulty
recruitment pattern.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.010 align:middle line:84%
To change a faulty
recruitment pattern

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:90%
takes about 3,500 repetitions.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:84%
So you have to do an
exercise specifically

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.480 align:middle line:84%
on re-breathing for
that length of time.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And we breathe
26,000 times a day

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.910 align:middle line:84%
if you use that average
of 14 to 16 times.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:41.130 align:middle line:84%
But a healthy individual will
be able to calm down the breath.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.210 align:middle line:90%
I know you do meditation.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.290 align:middle line:90%
I do meditation.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.030 align:middle line:84%
And we can bring our breath
all the way down maybe

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.410 align:middle line:84%
three or four
breaths when you're

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:48.120 align:middle line:90%
in a really relaxed state.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And to me, that's quite
amazing to see someone

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.770 align:middle line:84%
when we get them
in an environment

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
where we teach them how
to breathe properly.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And that starts to change
their biochemistry,

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:84%
release all of the muscles
that are kind of the problem

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.970 align:middle line:84%
muscles at the moment
that are being facilitated

00:17:02.970 --> 00:17:05.190 align:middle line:84%
or tightened up
because of the posture,

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.960 align:middle line:84%
because of the
activities, because

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.160 align:middle line:90%
of poor exercise choices.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:11.730 align:middle line:84%
So when we do that
breathing assessment,

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.800 align:middle line:90%
this identifies where we start.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.640 align:middle line:84%
And breathing-- we use a
totem pole of priority.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:84%
So when we assess the
program, Paul Chek

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:90%
developed a totem pole.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:24.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a hierarchy of what
you should address first

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:84%
and what can be
affected by breathing.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So at the top, we
have the psyche.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.510 align:middle line:90%
But the next is breathing.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:84%
Hold your breath for 3 minutes,
and you're pretty much done.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.460 align:middle line:90%
So breathing.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
And then we have the jaw,
mastication, and how you eat,

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.860 align:middle line:84%
and how you occlude
down and bite.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And the human
species will always

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.310 align:middle line:84%
try to keep the jaw and the
eye level with the horizon,

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.110 align:middle line:84%
because when that starts to
go off the jaw, you can't eat,

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.910 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:51.990 align:middle line:90%
We won't survive.

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:84%
From there, you get to the
auditory system, the vestibular

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.585 align:middle line:84%
system, then down to
the cervical spine.

00:17:57.585 --> 00:17:59.460 align:middle line:84%
So on a priority, if
you have a neck problem,

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.550 align:middle line:84%
it could be actually
caused by a breathing issue

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.650 align:middle line:90%
or a temporomandibular joint.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:08.280 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, if you have a visceral
issue, or an organ issue, which

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:84%
is further down the
totem pole, that

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.360 align:middle line:84%
can be caused by
breathing, as the analogy

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.788 align:middle line:84%
I gave earlier on when the
posture starts to change,

00:18:14.788 --> 00:18:16.830 align:middle line:84%
because the body has gone
forward, because you're

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:90%
trying to open up your mouth.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:22.350 align:middle line:84%
If you do a simple thing of just
sit up tall, pull your chin in,

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and breathe through your
nose, it feels kind of nice.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you poke your head
forward in bad posture,

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:84%
breathe through your
nose, it feels restricted.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.920 align:middle line:84%
If you breathe through your
mouth forward, it feels easy.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.295 align:middle line:84%
Pull back in here,
it feels restricted.

00:18:36.295 --> 00:18:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
simple thing that you

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.920 align:middle line:84%
can do in front of the mirror
and see, well, wow, that does

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.750 align:middle line:84%
feel better when
I hold myself up.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.770 align:middle line:84%
What that does to the
biochemistry, what

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.510 align:middle line:84%
that does to the
psyche, what that does,

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.760 align:middle line:90%
it's your inner relaxed state.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.630 align:middle line:90%
You're not in a stressed state.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So when we start to
look at that totem pole,

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.260 align:middle line:90%
breathing is at the top.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.932 align:middle line:84%
And once we start to
have breathing issues--

00:18:55.932 --> 00:18:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I've had clients
that have had disk

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.910 align:middle line:84%
injuries and spinal issues,
and nerve compressions,

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and visceral diseases,
and nobody's ever

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:90%
addressed the breathing.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.975 align:middle line:84%
And we teach them
how to breathe.

00:19:04.975 --> 00:19:07.015 align:middle line:84%
And it starts to
balance and calm down.

00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And now we can start
to work with them.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Now they have the energy.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.990 align:middle line:84%
Imagine breathing 26,000
times a day wrong.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.130 align:middle line:84%
That can really
stress out the system.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And if we change that, imagine
how much more energy we'd have

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and how much more
you're laboring

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.690 align:middle line:90%
against these restrictions.

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.600 align:middle line:84%
So the analogy,
it's like driving

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.952 align:middle line:90%
with your handbrake on all day.

00:19:26.952 --> 00:19:28.410 align:middle line:84%
And we suddenly
lose the handbrake,

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:90%
and oh, my god, now I can drive.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Or you're walking through mud.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.920 align:middle line:84%
And then we get you out
on the normal pavement

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.550 align:middle line:90%
and see how it feels.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.577 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that takes some
physical restriction work.

00:19:39.577 --> 00:19:41.160 align:middle line:84%
We've got to do some
deep tissue work,

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.118 align:middle line:84%
because they could have
been breathing that way

00:19:43.118 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:90%
for a long period of time.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:47.340 align:middle line:84%
Another one, may we have to work
through all the emotional kind

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.810 align:middle line:90%
of baggage.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And the big one that we see
is communication and inability

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.110 align:middle line:84%
to communicate clearly,
or effectively,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.900 align:middle line:84%
or not being willing to
communicate with someone.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:00.445 align:middle line:84%
And then the other one is in
the diaphragm, we have grief.

00:20:00.445 --> 00:20:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people who have
suffered grief in their life

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.737 align:middle line:84%
and not being able to
come to terms with that.

00:20:04.737 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:90%
It can guard and hold down.

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And that restricts the
diaphragm and the intercostals,

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.010 align:middle line:90%
and the respiratory muscles.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes, we
need to get in there

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and do a little bit of
a release physically,

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.910 align:middle line:84%
and then also work on those
mental and emotional baggages.

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And maybe their spiritual
beliefs are holding them back.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.150 align:middle line:84%
It could be something
that is outside the scope

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.093 align:middle line:84%
of my practice, where I
might have to refer it

00:20:26.093 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:84%
to a psychologist
or someone who's

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.330 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more
skilled to address those.

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:31.590 align:middle line:90%
>> This is great information.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:33.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think
that people really

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:84%
need to hear the relationship
between how the body works

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:41.550 align:middle line:84%
as a system of systems to really
understand what comes together

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.470 align:middle line:84%
for them to create their
experience mentally

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:47.490 align:middle line:84%
and emotionally so they can
manage stress more effectively

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:50.270 align:middle line:84%
and depression,
anxiety during the day.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:51.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.445 align:middle line:84%
>> So one of the things that
I really want to ask is when

00:20:53.445 --> 00:20:59.230 align:middle line:84%
somebody comes and they're
emotionally out of balance,

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.280 align:middle line:84%
how do you work with them
through those thought

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.080 align:middle line:90%
processes?

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.810 align:middle line:84%
How do you use exercise as a
way to help balance somebody's

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:07.610 align:middle line:90%
system?

00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:08.410 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Well, if we understand
that exercise

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:15.330 align:middle line:84%
will release glucocorticoids
and release antigens, which

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:18.150 align:middle line:84%
are beneficial
hormones, hormones

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.580 align:middle line:84%
are emotions in
action, basically.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:26.640 align:middle line:84%
So the hormones are those neural
transmitters and the peptides

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that are going
around predominately

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.240 align:middle line:90%
from fats and proteins.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.160 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing that
we start to look at

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and when we want to
address that is I

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:38.220 align:middle line:84%
look at the
nutritional component,

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:84%
because that's what
gives the raw material

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.260 align:middle line:90%
to make good healthy hormones.

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And from there,
when we start to do

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.240 align:middle line:84%
the exercise and
the movement, then I

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.480 align:middle line:84%
know that the body can
recover or run that system.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:84%
If I bring a person that's
depressed or anxious,

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.420 align:middle line:84%
or suffering from anxiety
and have these attacks,

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:84%
and they don't have the
resources to run the system,

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:84%
all I'm doing is
stressing the system.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So if we look at "The
Biggest Loser" or we

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:07.120 align:middle line:84%
look at these contests where
people are pushing, pushing,

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:07.920 align:middle line:90%
pushing.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.290 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes the body's not
ready to push straightaway.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we've got to do some
leveling out of the foundation

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:84%
and build that first
before we push them.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.550 align:middle line:90%
We know exercise is beneficial.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:21.720 align:middle line:84%
We know exercise is great
to balance out the system.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.510 align:middle line:84%
But as I said before, it
can be a double-edged sword.

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:27.270 align:middle line:84%
Some people have a high
physiological load,

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:84%
which doesn't allow them to have
any more stress in the buckets.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:31.920 align:middle line:90%
Their buckets are already full.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.587 align:middle line:84%
And that's just going
to wind them down.

00:22:33.587 --> 00:22:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So they may feel good
for two or three weeks.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.350 align:middle line:90%
They hit the gym.

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:39.400 align:middle line:84%
It's January, New
Year's resolutions.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Everyone gets moving
and doing stuff.

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:43.140 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately,
they sometimes

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.120 align:middle line:84%
just go in like a bull
in the china shop.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's can be a
problem, because it's

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.710 align:middle line:84%
very sad for me as a
fitness professional

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.330 align:middle line:90%
when I first started off.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.620 align:middle line:84%
The general approach is
the same for everybody,

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.900 align:middle line:90%
which shouldn't be the case.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.640 align:middle line:84%
It should be an individual
approach for everybody.

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So Donal, can you share with
us in that case when somebody

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.090 align:middle line:84%
comes and they're
emotionally imbalanced,

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.310 align:middle line:84%
how do you start working
with them on their thought

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:06.210 align:middle line:90%
processes?

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And how do you use exercise to
help balance them emotionally?

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So I certainly work with
exercise for all its benefits.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:84%
But the first thing I have to
do before I get into exercise

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.380 align:middle line:84%
is clean the slate
and make sure they're

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.665 align:middle line:90%
able to handle the exercise.

00:23:21.665 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people
that will come in

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.680 align:middle line:84%
will have what we call a high
physiological load, which

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.480 align:middle line:84%
means their systems
are already overloaded.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:28.920 align:middle line:90%
Their buckets are already full.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And putting more exercise
in on top of that,

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.660 align:middle line:84%
even though we know the
benefits of exercise,

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.000 align:middle line:84%
can be just enough-- it's the
straw on the camel's back.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.260 align:middle line:84%
And what we need
to do is identify--

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.720 align:middle line:84%
do they have the resources
to run the system first?

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So when we start to exercise,
when we start to move,

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:49.710 align:middle line:84%
we start to see that the body
needs proteins and fats to run

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:51.173 align:middle line:90%
the hormonal system.

00:23:51.173 --> 00:23:52.590 align:middle line:84%
So there's three
families of fats.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:53.760 align:middle line:90%
We've got the lipoproteins.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.930 align:middle line:90%
We've got the amino acids.

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And we've got the glycogen.
Now, most of the repair hormones

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:01.290 align:middle line:84%
and the sex hormones need
the protein and the fat.

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
I need to look at

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:06.570 align:middle line:84%
is, are they taking in the
resources to run the system?

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Once I've cleared that, then I
know the bucket will come down.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.060 align:middle line:90%
And now I start exercise.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.550 align:middle line:90%
However, if they--

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:16.740 align:middle line:84%
New Year's resolutions,
January 1, they get

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.158 align:middle line:84%
started, get out
to the gym, push

00:24:18.158 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:84%
it really hard for a
couple of weeks, which

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.200 align:middle line:90%
we know they need to exercise.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:24.070 align:middle line:84%
And we'd like to see
more people more active.

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.710 align:middle line:84%
But if they haven't
set them up--

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:27.685 align:middle line:84%
or set themselves
up for success,

00:24:27.685 --> 00:24:28.810 align:middle line:90%
they're just going to fail.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And one of those things that I
see from watching "The Biggest

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.110 align:middle line:84%
Loser" and all those great
competitions of getting people

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:84%
to move and do stuff,
sometimes they push too hard.

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:40.143 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I've
learned over the years

00:24:40.143 --> 00:24:42.060 align:middle line:84%
that when I first started
off in the industry,

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.520 align:middle line:84%
that was something that was
missing from my tool box.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.310 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that I was
pushing athletes too much.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:49.468 align:middle line:84%
And they were breaking
down, because I

00:24:49.468 --> 00:24:50.760 align:middle line:90%
wasn't looking at that, though.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.080 align:middle line:84%
That was the nutritional
side of things,

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.872 align:middle line:84%
or that was the
dietician's responsibility.

00:24:53.872 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:84%
That wasn't mine as
the strength coach.

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:58.170 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned that
they weren't covering that.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.838 align:middle line:84%
So what we started to do
was focus on the recovery.

00:25:00.838 --> 00:25:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think the CHEK
program, when it came along,

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.698 align:middle line:84%
to look at all the
systems, and we're

00:25:04.698 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:84%
one of the only
disciplines out there

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that's a multidisciplinary
approach that

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.090 align:middle line:90%
looks at all systems.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:11.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't just
specialize in one area.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:12.500 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I'm a strength coach.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I can coach
you lifestyle stuff.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's the interpretation
of all the systems

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and working out how
one system flows over.

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:90%
It's so great to use exercise.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.490 align:middle line:84%
If we use exercise,
we actually get

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.640 align:middle line:84%
those dopamine, serotonin,
good-feel hormones

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:90%
being released.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But also, we have
catabolic hormones

00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.800 align:middle line:84%
that can actually break
down and wind up the system.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.800 align:middle line:84%
So cortisol will be elevated
for at least 8 hours

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:90%
after exercise.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, when cortisol goes up, your
immune system gets suppressed.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Your growth and
repair get suppressed.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:90%
Gluconeogenesis starts to go up.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Respiratory rate goes up.

00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:90%
Circulation goes up.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, gluconeogenesis
is your body's

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.790 align:middle line:90%
eating away at resources.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.760 align:middle line:84%
So if you haven't
eaten the right foods,

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.740 align:middle line:84%
your body starts to eat
away at your muscle mass.

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, anybody that knows anything
about your metabolism, that's

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:90%
an alarm bell, what I just said.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.005 align:middle line:90%
Now your muscle mass goes down.

00:26:08.005 --> 00:26:09.380 align:middle line:84%
And you're trying
to lose weight,

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.338 align:middle line:84%
but what actually happens
is because you're not

00:26:11.338 --> 00:26:14.120 align:middle line:84%
taking the right resources in,
your body starts to eat away.

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And that slows down
your metabolism.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.670 align:middle line:84%
So when you work out
on a stress response--

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.170 align:middle line:84%
this is something we have to
work with a lot of our athletes

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.460 align:middle line:90%
is teach them--

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.330 align:middle line:84%
when do you get quicker,
faster, stronger?

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:27.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not in the gym.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.300 align:middle line:84%
It's the recovery
when you sleep.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:32.240 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't have the
nutrients to feed that recovery

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
system, you're just going
to go spiraling down.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.750 align:middle line:90%
So exercise is great.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:42.740 align:middle line:84%
We start off with a concept of
working in before you work out.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.780 align:middle line:90%
Train, don't drain.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So you must have
something in the account

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:48.800 align:middle line:90%
first before you go to the gym.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So once we've assessed
that physiological load

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and identified
their high priority,

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.770 align:middle line:84%
we'll give them things
like zone exercise

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:59.152 align:middle line:84%
or what we call chi-building,
or energy-building exercises.

00:26:59.152 --> 00:27:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Our viewers might have noticed
that when you go for a walk,

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.440 align:middle line:84%
even though you didn't
feel like going for a walk

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.315 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning and
someone dragged you out,

00:27:05.315 --> 00:27:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and halfway through, you
get this uplift of energy.

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.350 align:middle line:90%
So that's very enlightening.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.315 align:middle line:84%
And it brings that
good-feel hormones in there.

00:27:13.315 --> 00:27:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And if they've been sitting
in that depressed state

00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.950 align:middle line:84%
or anxious, sometimes just
getting gentle movement

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:22.820 align:middle line:84%
without pushing the system into
sweating, without the tongue

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.790 align:middle line:84%
drying out, which are all
the physiological responses

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:29.720 align:middle line:84%
that you're starting to work
out, exercise, take energy out.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.200 align:middle line:84%
To work in, we should be able
to walk on a full stomach

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.550 align:middle line:90%
and not get a cramp.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:36.370 align:middle line:84%
When you start to
exercise excessively,

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:39.560 align:middle line:84%
we push the blood flow away
from the digestive system.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.890 align:middle line:84%
If we go to a stress state--
we're running fast or hard--

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:84%
you shut down the
digestive system.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.460 align:middle line:84%
You shut down the
growth and repair.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:49.650 align:middle line:84%
What we're trying to do here is
bolster the growth and repair.

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.730 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of my clients that have
anxiety issues and depression

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:57.150 align:middle line:84%
issues will work on a
process of 20 minutes a day.

00:27:57.150 --> 00:27:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's a minimum.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.510 align:middle line:84%
If I can get them 20
minutes in the morning,

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:03.540 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes in the evening, and
that can be just a gentle walk.

00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.290 align:middle line:84%
But what I do is I use
zone exercises that

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.200 align:middle line:84%
also work on their
physical restrictions,

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and also working on the
other side of things.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.320 align:middle line:84%
So when we have a posture
issue, a forward-head posture,

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.860 align:middle line:84%
I might give them a zone
exercise, or a Lewitt technique

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.050 align:middle line:84%
that actually works
the cervical spine

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and corrects that
at the same time.

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.340 align:middle line:84%
So not only am I picking
an exercise that's

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
going to bring energy,
blood flow, circulation,

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:84%
bring all the material to that
area of the body to heal it,

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:33.590 align:middle line:84%
but I'm also going
to do a movement that

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:35.740 align:middle line:84%
helps their posture, that
helps their physical.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.980 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm going to
get them exercising,

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:39.530 align:middle line:84%
so I might as well
start on that.

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.550 align:middle line:84%
So killing a bird with two
stones kind of thing or-- yeah,

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:43.350 align:middle line:90%
just working.

00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:45.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Just almost
preparing the body--

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:46.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:50.240 align:middle line:84%
>> For something a little bit
more of what we would call

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.350 align:middle line:90%
a workout.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:84%
>> That becomes a little bit
more stressful on the system,

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:56.550 align:middle line:84%
but now we've created
the foundations.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.730 align:middle line:90%
It's priming the system.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.370 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting the system
ready to handle a little bit

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:02.600 align:middle line:90%
more exercise.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.770 align:middle line:90%
And then that can build up.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:08.000 align:middle line:84%
And once the client's
biological oscillators calm down

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.750 align:middle line:84%
or the heart rate goes down,
respiratory rate goes down,

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.480 align:middle line:84%
then we can start to
know, oh, yes, great.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got to
a moderate level.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.740 align:middle line:84%
We're still a little bit
high, but we're going down.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested to
know with my clients,

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.630 align:middle line:84%
is the stress levels
building in their life,

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.130 align:middle line:84%
or if they start
to make changes,

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.005 align:middle line:84%
and then we are starting
to actually go down?

00:29:27.005 --> 00:29:28.730 align:middle line:84%
At that point where
we're going down,

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I'll bring in a little
bit of stress exercise

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:33.950 align:middle line:84%
and see how much
they can tolerate,

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:35.600 align:middle line:84%
see what happens to
the immune system,

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.490 align:middle line:84%
see what happens to
the respiratory rate,

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:39.400 align:middle line:84%
see what happens to
their body temperature,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:84%
see how well they digest,
see how well they recover.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.590 align:middle line:84%
I work with a lot of chronic
fatigue and adrenal fatigue,

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:47.060 align:middle line:90%
and thyroid issues.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.310 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
body's metabolism has

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:52.340 align:middle line:84%
been on go all the time,
and the hormonal system

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:90%
is really taxed.

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And we start to see the
thyroid issues slows down

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:57.410 align:middle line:90%
the metabolism.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So to kick start it again, we
don't throw a bomb in there

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.210 align:middle line:90%
or throw petrol on the fire.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.160 align:middle line:84%
We have to slowly
encourage the body

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.410 align:middle line:84%
and give the body
the chance to heal.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So the exercise component
is a work-in strategy

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.520 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we work
specific posture muscles.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So we work the back extension
chain or the postural muscles

00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:16.750 align:middle line:90%
that will work.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.050 align:middle line:90%
We work the core.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Once we get the abdominal
wall functioning,

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.250 align:middle line:90%
we have the stability.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Remember I mentioned
the totem pole?

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.958 align:middle line:84%
Well, all the way down near
the end of the totem pole

00:30:25.958 --> 00:30:27.140 align:middle line:90%
is the pelvis.

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And the pelvis is what we call
the gateway to all movement.

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So if the pelvis is off,
that's like the foundation

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:34.100 align:middle line:90%
of the house is off.

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
So we need to make sure that
structural alignment is there.

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're setting
yourself up for years,

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.610 align:middle line:90%
weeks of injury.

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:42.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of
the things that I

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.800 align:middle line:84%
started to see, that there was
huge correlations to movement

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.280 align:middle line:84%
strategies, and the way we hold
ourself, and the emotional,

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.480 align:middle line:90%
and then the visceral.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't just a simple
stretch this and exercise that.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.760 align:middle line:84%
We had to peel back
and understand what

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.040 align:middle line:90%
was going on behind the layers.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.680 align:middle line:84%
So the pelvis for
me when I exercise

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.270 align:middle line:90%
is where I start to stabilize.

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.570 align:middle line:84%
And we'll use Swiss balls
and balancing exercises,

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and then traditional
conditioning exercises.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:11.720 align:middle line:84%
So getting them into squats,
deadlifts, bending actions.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.055 align:middle line:84%
Then I start to get them
lunging, and stepping,

00:31:14.055 --> 00:31:15.680 align:middle line:84%
and so on, where most
people would jump

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.150 align:middle line:90%
on a stepper straight away.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's much harder
to stabilize the pelvis

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.920 align:middle line:84%
when you've got one foot
forward and one foot back.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.980 align:middle line:84%
It's much easier to
have two feet together.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.520 align:middle line:84%
So if there's underlying
disk issues, which

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Shirley Sahrmann in her
research showed back in the '80s

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:33.230 align:middle line:84%
that about 76% of us walk around
with an undiagnosed disk bulge.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I err on the
side of caution,

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.500 align:middle line:90%
because I specialize in that.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:39.500 align:middle line:84%
And I deal with so many
people and X-rays and MRIs.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And they don't even know.

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:41.915 align:middle line:84%
And you look through
the X-ray and MRI,

00:31:41.915 --> 00:31:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, you know you've
got a disc pathology there.

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.170 align:middle line:84%
They're like, I don't
have any problem there.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's already a
weakness in the chain.

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:84%
And so I err on the side of
caution from being in that.

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.470 align:middle line:84%
So I steadily
increase the workload

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and start to spark
up the metabolism

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:00.960 align:middle line:84%
as long as they can maintain
the recovery program,

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.240 align:middle line:90%
so the lifestyle factors.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, that starts to then
kick into balancing out

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:06.620 align:middle line:90%
the biochemistry.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.020 align:middle line:84%
Now they have the raw materials
to start thinking properly.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Now we start to work on
those mental emotional issues

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:14.690 align:middle line:84%
and really start to
use the exercises,

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:17.930 align:middle line:84%
those pause points
through the day

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:21.020 align:middle line:84%
where they can feel those
good hormones releasing.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.900 align:middle line:84%
And then when they have that
at the end of the session,

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:26.360 align:middle line:84%
now we dig in and get into
those emotional things

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.970 align:middle line:84%
about reinforcing the
things that they want

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:32.390 align:middle line:84%
to do, the goals,
understanding their triggers,

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:36.410 align:middle line:84%
their responses to life,
and how they act in those.

00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And I love borrowing Katie's
work, and start to understand,

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.460 align:middle line:90%
is that true?

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.010 align:middle line:90%
Is that really true?

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And start to really
question them

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.270 align:middle line:84%
on why they're having
those thought processes

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and where they're trying
to put their energy in,

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.090 align:middle line:84%
and what they want to
put their energy on?

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I love the saying if you
have a big enough dream,

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.360 align:middle line:90%
you don't need a crisis.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
committed to your goal

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:02.900 align:middle line:84%
and you're focused on that,
and with a coach helping you

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.110 align:middle line:84%
or someone that's done this
with hundreds of other clients,

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.810 align:middle line:84%
we can help them follow
the breadcrumb trail

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:11.240 align:middle line:84%
and identify where their
sticks and their blocks

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.350 align:middle line:84%
are and work to relieve some
of them and give them tasks

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:19.610 align:middle line:84%
and exercises to help to balance
out, so breathing exercises

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:20.760 align:middle line:90%
to help do that.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.930 align:middle line:84%
So later on at night, being
aware of where they breathe.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.690 align:middle line:84%
The belly should raise
in the first 2/3.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And then the chest
should do the last.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Watching in the mirror to see
if their neck muscles turn on,

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.300 align:middle line:84%
the scalenes, or the
sternocleidomastoid muscles,

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:38.110 align:middle line:84%
seeing if their shoulders are
elevating, if the levator scap

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.910 align:middle line:90%
is doing that.

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Or can they breathe?

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:42.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's slow, relaxed.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not a forced breath.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:47.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's some
really great training

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:49.190 align:middle line:84%
we can do to wind
down the systems.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So we use this process
of counting 10 breaths,

00:33:53.210 --> 00:34:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and going up to 3 to 4 seconds
for each breath in, and out.

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And working that up to
about a 5-second breath.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.350 align:middle line:84%
And then doing that for
10 seated on all fours,

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:09.300 align:middle line:90%
lying down, and relaxing.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:14.159 align:middle line:84%
I also use stretches and
exercises in a different way.

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:17.940 align:middle line:84%
In the physiology and
the way the body moves,

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.320 align:middle line:84%
there is neurological
coupling for breathing.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.770 align:middle line:84%
So as we breath, the
spine has what we

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:25.170 align:middle line:90%
call a double sinusoidal curve.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:26.190 align:middle line:90%
And that's a curvature.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.270 align:middle line:90%
It's called a double S-curve.

00:34:28.270 --> 00:34:30.989 align:middle line:84%
So from the cervical curve,
thoracic, lumbar, and then

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:32.590 align:middle line:90%
the sacrum down at the bottom.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:34.830 align:middle line:84%
And as we breathe,
it kind of isolates.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And this pumps the spinal fluid
up and down through the spine.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:42.969 align:middle line:84%
So remember, I was saying
people have 76% disk injuries.

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:47.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, what nourishes and bathes
and keeps those disks healthy

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:48.300 align:middle line:90%
is this breathing mechanism.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:49.675 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not
breathing right,

00:34:49.675 --> 00:34:51.630 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
degenerate your spine.

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.920 align:middle line:84%
You can actually
degenerate your system.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So when we start to
breathe, that oscillation

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:58.810 align:middle line:90%
starts to pump up and down.

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:00.960 align:middle line:84%
So when we start to
do these exercises,

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.540 align:middle line:84%
we're trying to teach
them how to see if they

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.040 align:middle line:90%
can start to move their spines.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.570 align:middle line:84%
We use a foam roller,
lying on their back.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:09.360 align:middle line:90%
We use an unweighted load first.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Because if I get you lying
down, the posture muscles

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.050 align:middle line:84%
that have been tight
and triggered can relax.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And now I can retrain
them without them

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.400 align:middle line:84%
coming on and interfering
with other muscle.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.500 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes the
body kind of pulls

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.890 align:middle line:84%
in like a sub onto the field of
play to get a muscle to work.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.695 align:middle line:84%
But that isn't the best
player for that position.

00:35:29.695 --> 00:35:31.320 align:middle line:84%
There's other muscles
that are attached

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:32.790 align:middle line:90%
that should be doing that job.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:35.670 align:middle line:84%
But because they stay in
that defensive mechanism,

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.200 align:middle line:90%
they adapt different postures.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.210 align:middle line:90%
They adapt different positions.

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So retraining them to
actually get that pumping

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.710 align:middle line:90%
happening, to get the viscera--

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:45.510 align:middle line:90%
and let's face it.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.090 align:middle line:84%
Most people that come to the
gym, when I say the viscera,

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:90%
it's pushing the stomach out.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Not many people go to the gym
to push their stomach out.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.988 align:middle line:90%
They want to bring it back in.

00:35:53.988 --> 00:35:55.530 align:middle line:84%
So there's a little
bit of the psyche

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.740 align:middle line:84%
of kind of getting a
person to relax and allow

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.900 align:middle line:90%
their abdominal wall to expand.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:02.850 align:middle line:84%
And that can be quite
frightening for someone

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:05.100 align:middle line:84%
who's overweight to actually
push their stomach out.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.975 align:middle line:84%
But if they don't do
that, what they're doing

00:36:06.975 --> 00:36:08.620 align:middle line:84%
is strangling the
internal organs.

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:11.550 align:middle line:84%
They're not pushing the
spinal fluid up and down.

00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:13.110 align:middle line:84%
They're not balancing
out the system.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And the body sees
that as a threat.

00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So now what happens is
it winds at the back.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.300 align:middle line:84%
And this subconscious stress
is going all the time,

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.890 align:middle line:84%
because the body
feels, oh, my god.

00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.820 align:middle line:90%
We're in a compromised position.

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So let's give them some
stress to do something,

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.677 align:middle line:84%
the actions to move
to make a difference.

00:36:30.677 --> 00:36:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So you actually have
to learn to do things that

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:35.340 align:middle line:84%
don't necessarily feel
comfortable or natural to them

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:39.050 align:middle line:84%
at first in order to gain
the long-term benefits.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.850 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's funny.

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:41.510 align:middle line:84%
If you look at a child,
they do it naturally.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.652 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't have to
teach this to children.

00:36:43.652 --> 00:36:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So when I went through
infant development

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:47.880 align:middle line:84%
in the CHEK program,
which was a great insight

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:50.860 align:middle line:84%
to why we sometimes develop
posture problems later

00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.500 align:middle line:84%
in life for no apparent reason,
when you actually then assess

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.300 align:middle line:90%
them--

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:57.840 align:middle line:84%
and in the CHEK program,
Paul spends a lot of time

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.290 align:middle line:84%
to educate us on how to
look at movement strategies

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:03.030 align:middle line:84%
that we developed as
a child, actually,

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.350 align:middle line:84%
lead to-- it's kind of the
window to what possible issues

00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:08.005 align:middle line:90%
you could have later on in life.

00:37:08.005 --> 00:37:10.380 align:middle line:84%
So you see a child move around,
and their diaphragm moves

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.180 align:middle line:90%
great.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.990 align:middle line:84%
And their spinal
curvatures are there

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:15.180 align:middle line:84%
if they've gone through
proper infant development.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.110 align:middle line:84%
When I assess adults 30,
40, 50, 60 years later,

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:22.260 align:middle line:84%
and you see that they haven't
developed this pattern,

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.070 align:middle line:84%
that's now how the
body originally

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:26.210 align:middle line:90%
wrote the kind of the coding.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.560 align:middle line:90%
It's the language of the body.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.730 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
software of the body.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:33.690 align:middle line:84%
But that original coding,
we can revisit and rewrite

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:84%
the original coding again
or put in a new file.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.690 align:middle line:84%
So now the hardware is
expressing a problem,

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:42.870 align:middle line:84%
because we're not using
the right software per se.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.420 align:middle line:84%
So now we teach that through
infant development movements.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.212 align:middle line:84%
And that's, I think,
one of the differences

00:37:47.212 --> 00:37:49.823 align:middle line:84%
between what we do and
other exercise professionals

00:37:49.823 --> 00:37:51.240 align:middle line:84%
or health care
professionals is we

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:55.470 align:middle line:84%
look at the etiology going
back through the symptomology

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.990 align:middle line:84%
and going back to what happens
in the body and the body

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.890 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:01.570 align:middle line:84%
How did that body system get
developed in the first place?

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:05.280 align:middle line:84%
So looking back to the root
cause, not just the reactive.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.540 align:middle line:90%
You know, do a rub.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:07.410 align:middle line:90%
Do a stretch here.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:08.940 align:middle line:90%
Put a bit of Voltaren on that.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.073 align:middle line:90%
Get an injection.

00:38:10.073 --> 00:38:11.490 align:middle line:84%
But actually look
at-- well, if we

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.650 align:middle line:84%
keep on using that
faulty software,

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:16.380 align:middle line:84%
you might be good for a
year, but that problem

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.598 align:middle line:90%
is going to reoccur.

00:38:17.598 --> 00:38:19.890 align:middle line:84%
If they're breathing wrong,
we could have a disk injury

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:21.160 align:middle line:90%
waiting to happen.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:23.280 align:middle line:90%
So we've got to train properly.

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.010 align:middle line:84%
So movement strategies--
as we push, we breathe out.

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.813 align:middle line:90%
As we pull, we breathe in.

00:38:27.813 --> 00:38:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And when I went through
college and university

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:33.690 align:middle line:84%
in Harlem way back, we were
told that you always exert

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.030 align:middle line:90%
and breathe out when you push.

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:39.540 align:middle line:84%
But that's not actually feeding
into how the body works.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, that's to reduce
internal pressure, which

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.670 align:middle line:84%
you could have Valsalva
maneuvers, which

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:46.890 align:middle line:84%
is where you compress and
hold your breath, which

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:49.692 align:middle line:84%
could damage capillaries
and bring blood pressure up.

00:38:49.692 --> 00:38:51.150 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
breathing properly,

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:53.820 align:middle line:84%
not holding your breath
with the associated movement

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:55.710 align:middle line:84%
in the nervous
system, it actually

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:57.900 align:middle line:84%
feeds into balancing
out the hormonal system.

00:38:57.900 --> 00:38:59.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't stress
the system out.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.250 align:middle line:84%
The body doesn't feel like,
oh, that's the wrong way.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:03.790 align:middle line:90%
It's in reverse.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:07.770 align:middle line:84%
So if I use exercise, once
I've got my client balanced,

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:11.460 align:middle line:84%
I can start to deal with
those mental emotional issues

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:84%
and start to work with healthy
confidence in their body

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.358 align:middle line:84%
and self-esteem, and holding
the body up posturally.

00:39:18.358 --> 00:39:20.900 align:middle line:84%
And they catch themselves in
the mirror, a reflection walking

00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:21.930 align:middle line:90%
down the street.

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:23.430 align:middle line:90%
And they go, wow, that's great.

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Instead of holding
down and guarding.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.750 align:middle line:84%
And we see a lot of
things shutting down

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:28.930 align:middle line:90%
when people get depressed.

00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:32.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's really about a sense
of achievement, giving clients

00:39:32.100 --> 00:39:34.470 align:middle line:84%
exercises that they
can achieve, not

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:37.530 align:middle line:84%
doing some weird Cirque
du Soleil on a Swiss ball

00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.267 align:middle line:90%
and really challenging exercise.

00:39:39.267 --> 00:39:40.725 align:middle line:84%
You want to give
them exercises you

00:39:40.725 --> 00:39:43.920 align:middle line:90%
know the client can succeed at.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Another trick with
exercise is to use exercise

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:50.580 align:middle line:84%
that crosses the midline,
which balances out

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:52.868 align:middle line:84%
the left and the
right hemispheres.

00:39:52.868 --> 00:39:53.910 align:middle line:90%
So when we get stuck in--

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:54.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Of the brain,
you're talking about.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:55.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:59.590 align:middle line:84%
So the right brain is
that creative and recovery

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:00.390 align:middle line:90%
kind of side.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the left brain is that
analytical, scientific side.

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So I have a lot of people
in corporate that come in,

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.780 align:middle line:90%
high-powered positions.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And I use exercises
that rotate their body.

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:11.280 align:middle line:84%
And it kind of--
it shifts their,

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.942 align:middle line:84%
what we call, ultradian
rhythms, which

00:40:12.942 --> 00:40:14.400 align:middle line:84%
is the rhythms of
the brain when we

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.253 align:middle line:90%
shift from left to right brain.

00:40:16.253 --> 00:40:17.420 align:middle line:90%
So that kind of tricks them.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:19.587 align:middle line:84%
And the clients sometimes
don't know I'm doing that,

00:40:19.587 --> 00:40:20.462 align:middle line:90%
but they feel better.

00:40:20.462 --> 00:40:22.754 align:middle line:84%
And it's kind of like they
do just their normal warm-up

00:40:22.754 --> 00:40:25.230 align:middle line:84%
on a bike or treadmill, and
it won't feel the same at all.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.250 align:middle line:84%
We need something that
crosses the midline.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:28.750 align:middle line:84%
So doing something
where you're just

00:40:28.750 --> 00:40:30.990 align:middle line:84%
rotating the body or
some kind of a movement

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:32.700 align:middle line:84%
where you cross
over the midline.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:34.680 align:middle line:90%
You can actually see the change.

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.120 align:middle line:90%
The eyes start to sparkle.

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:37.350 align:middle line:90%
Their chest lifts up.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:38.730 align:middle line:90%
Their emotions start to lift.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:39.780 align:middle line:90%
They clear.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:43.350 align:middle line:84%
And having exercises, as
I said, that give them

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:47.250 align:middle line:84%
a sense of achievement, that
you can show them an exercise,

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.300 align:middle line:84%
and they go, whoa, that's
really challenging.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.810 align:middle line:84%
And within that
session do the right

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:56.490 align:middle line:84%
exercises as the degression and
show them the base foundation.

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can do that
in half an hour.

00:40:58.070 --> 00:41:01.080 align:middle line:84%
So they walk out like, wow, at
the beginning of the session,

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.710 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't even
attempt that exercise.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.032 align:middle line:90%
But now I achieved that.

00:41:04.032 --> 00:41:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's giving them
another little stepping stone.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.720 align:middle line:84%
See, if you approach
this with the coaching

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.640 align:middle line:84%
and the right steps,
we can achieve--

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.290 align:middle line:84%
the small little things
can build up to be--

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that may be the
only thing they felt

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:17.340 align:middle line:90%
that they've achieved that day.

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:19.740 align:middle line:84%
And that's very empowering
for me as a coach

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:22.320 align:middle line:84%
to walk away with, that I've
given them a glimpse, that you

00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:23.980 align:middle line:90%
can take control.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:27.530 align:middle line:84%
You can be a destiny
of your own future.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:30.360 align:middle line:84%
But you have to
work on what you're

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:35.280 align:middle line:84%
willing to work on today, and
not to throw the whole kitchen

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:37.770 align:middle line:84%
sink and all the different
exercises we see sometimes

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:41.890 align:middle line:84%
in gyms now that are too
functionally way out there.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to meet the
client at their level.

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:46.950 align:middle line:84%
>> So Donal, I just
want backtrack.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.910 align:middle line:84%
A little while ago you used the
term biological oscillators.

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Just so our audience
understands what they are,

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:54.840 align:middle line:84%
if you could
explain that and how

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.110 align:middle line:84%
you reference to using
breath to help balance them.

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So biologic oscillators are
the three major oscillators

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.680 align:middle line:90%
in our body--

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:04.750 align:middle line:84%
brain, heart, and the
enteric nervous system.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.480 align:middle line:84%
If you want to get
more research in this,

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.000 align:middle line:84%
a great website is
the Heart Institute,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.650 align:middle line:90%
or HeartMath Institute.

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's got some
really good stuff

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.540 align:middle line:84%
to go through a
little bit more depth.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:19.500 align:middle line:84%
But a short answer is basically
that when our brainwave, heart,

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.440 align:middle line:84%
respiratory rate, and our
enteric system go offline,

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.600 align:middle line:84%
it's like pendulums going
out of time with each other.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And when we bring them all
in line with each other,

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:28.770 align:middle line:90%
they're balanced.

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:30.420 align:middle line:84%
When they're out
of balance, they're

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:32.470 align:middle line:90%
not in harmony with each other.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So the heart field
is the biggest field.

00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's a thing
5,000 times bigger

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.370 align:middle line:90%
than the rest of the body.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.760 align:middle line:84%
The enteric nervous system
has more nerves in it

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.260 align:middle line:84%
than the spinal cord and
the brain put together.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's a lot of
connection to some pretty

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.510 align:middle line:90%
important stuff down there.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And then the
hormonal system, kind

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:53.280 align:middle line:84%
of the generals and
the neural peptides

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.780 align:middle line:90%
that kind of run the system.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.062 align:middle line:90%
And they're communicators.

00:42:56.062 --> 00:42:57.270 align:middle line:90%
They're the action molecules.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So the proteins
and the fats have

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.860 align:middle line:84%
to be really good to
actually balance that out.

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So breath work can actually
help us to balance that out.

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you take your
heart rate and divide it

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:10.260 align:middle line:84%
in by the amount of breaths
you take in a minute,

00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:13.110 align:middle line:84%
it can give you a
whole number, which

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:14.890 align:middle line:90%
means your system is balanced.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:18.390 align:middle line:84%
If it's fractionated, so
you have 7 in 10 breaths

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:19.890 align:middle line:84%
or something at
that, then you're

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:22.875 align:middle line:84%
going to get a 1 or
a 6-point-something,

00:43:22.875 --> 00:43:24.500 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to be
in an even number.

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:24.702 align:middle line:90%
>> An even number.

00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:25.350 align:middle line:90%
>> A whole number.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:26.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a fractionated number.

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:30.330 align:middle line:84%
That's your first indicator that
maybe your oscillators are off.

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And by using the breath, we
can start to bring that back

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:33.650 align:middle line:90%
into alignment.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:35.525 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, there's
a lot more information

00:43:35.525 --> 00:43:36.647 align:middle line:90%
on that website.

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a really important
thing, though, I think,

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:41.610 align:middle line:84%
because balancing our
oscillators, again,

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:45.180 align:middle line:84%
are going to help to balance
our mood, our state of mind,

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.900 align:middle line:84%
manage anxiety, and lift
us out of that deep--

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.370 align:middle line:90%
>> And allow us to now exercise.

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And that might be giving
us that self-esteem

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:56.190 align:middle line:84%
and that encouragement to
actually-- when you exercise,

00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:58.992 align:middle line:84%
the form of exercise that you
do is very important as well.

00:43:58.992 --> 00:44:00.700 align:middle line:84%
You just don't want
to restrict the body.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.040 align:middle line:84%
You want to actually
pump the system.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So when I give
exercises, it's not just

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.910 align:middle line:90%
on a treadmill or a bike.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:10.210 align:middle line:84%
It's actually deconforming
the body cavity pressures.

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Using the breath properly
with the exercise,

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.190 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned before,
will help do that.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:17.980 align:middle line:84%
If you just do kind of
a workout and you just

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.640 align:middle line:84%
do like bicep curls and
the traditional things

00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:23.700 align:middle line:84%
a guy might do in the gym, or
for girls, it's on a machine,

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.350 align:middle line:84%
and it moves her legs
up and down, her arms.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:28.030 align:middle line:90%
It's not deconforming.

00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:30.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's not actually the
way we would normally

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:33.140 align:middle line:84%
exercise and move and hunt
and gather and go out and do

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:33.940 align:middle line:90%
things.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.850 align:middle line:84%
We need to actually move
and change our shape

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and use those posture muscles to
contribute to holding ourselves

00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:41.530 align:middle line:90%
in that shape.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.908 align:middle line:84%
So that's where I work on to get
them not reliant on a machine,

00:44:44.908 --> 00:44:47.200 align:middle line:84%
or going to fancy equipment,
but to be able to do stuff

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.810 align:middle line:84%
at home to be able to do
stuff in everyday life that

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:52.870 align:middle line:84%
correlates to efficient
movement patterns.

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:55.930 align:middle line:84%
So instead of the exercise,
focus on the movement

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:58.270 align:middle line:90%
strategies and improve that.

00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So with that, what one
takeaway could you give

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:05.980 align:middle line:84%
to perhaps an audience,
somebody within our audience

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:08.560 align:middle line:90%
who's suffering from anxiety?

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:11.530 align:middle line:84%
What simple work in, taking
the analogy of what we've

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:16.420 align:middle line:84%
spoken about around a work-in
movement, what takeaway could

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:19.850 align:middle line:84%
you give somebody to start today
in terms of a movement choice?

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the movement
strategies I use with all

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.330 align:middle line:84%
of my clients is-- and one of
my favorites is the Chi Squat,

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:26.740 align:middle line:90%
or it's an Energy Squat.

00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:29.015 align:middle line:84%
So before we do that,
I need to make sure

00:45:29.015 --> 00:45:30.140 align:middle line:90%
they're breathing properly.

00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:31.810 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing I ask
my client to do is just

00:45:31.810 --> 00:45:33.290 align:middle line:90%
stand up in a relaxed position.

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Put one hand on their
belly, one at their chest.

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:37.690 align:middle line:84%
When they take the
deep breath in,

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:41.680 align:middle line:84%
the belly should fill up
first, then the chest,

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.810 align:middle line:90%
and then breathe out.

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:47.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we do the squat, we
breathe out on the way down.

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you're coming up into
extension, you breathe in.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:54.460 align:middle line:84%
This will also work
around the pelvic area.

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.360 align:middle line:84%
It'll strengthen up the
muscles, but also it

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.190 align:middle line:84%
will feed blood flow, nutrition,
water into the adrenals,

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.840 align:middle line:84%
which are the glands
that work with stress.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.320 align:middle line:84%
So now we're helping
the body flush that out.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.260 align:middle line:84%
If we bring the
arms into supination

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:11.320 align:middle line:84%
and back down into pronation
as we go down in that squat,

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.536 align:middle line:84%
and then as we stand
up, we breathe in.

00:46:14.536 --> 00:46:15.970 align:middle line:90%
Get the belly to expand.

00:46:15.970 --> 00:46:17.050 align:middle line:90%
Breathing out.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Now we're also working
the communication

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:22.940 align:middle line:84%
in the thyroid, which is that
regulator of the metabolism.

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.760 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm also dealing
with the supersub

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:29.020 align:middle line:84%
I call the thyroid that gets
pulled in when the adrenals get

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:32.230 align:middle line:84%
overstressed, which your
immune system gets depressed.

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And now they get all sorts
of immune issues as well.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.160 align:middle line:90%
So breathing first.

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.300 align:middle line:84%
Doing a couple of breaths
to balance out your breaths.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Working at a pace that
doesn't make you sweat,

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.520 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make your
tongue dry out,

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and it should be comfortable to
do for about 5 to 10 minutes.

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.610 align:middle line:84%
And now, to be
realistic, most clients,

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:53.140 align:middle line:90%
they don't go all the way down.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:55.510 align:middle line:84%
It's nearly like just
sitting up, standing down.

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:57.430 align:middle line:84%
They can put a
chair behind them.

00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:59.590 align:middle line:84%
They can do it close
in between a doorframe.

00:46:59.590 --> 00:47:01.810 align:middle line:84%
I have people with bad
knees and bad backs.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:03.768 align:middle line:84%
And it may be a
very small movement.

00:47:03.768 --> 00:47:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Or someone that's got a healthy
knee, back, and hip structure

00:47:06.310 --> 00:47:09.820 align:middle line:84%
could go all the way down and
really deconform the system

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:14.440 align:middle line:84%
or pump the abdominal wall, and
expand and close out and use

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:18.400 align:middle line:84%
that movement to actually
really help them bring

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.170 align:middle line:90%
their metabolism back on line.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.610 align:middle line:90%
Deal with some of the stress.

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:25.360 align:middle line:84%
Bring all the delivery system of
the nutrients and the minerals.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.915 align:middle line:84%
Not only are you
exercising that area,

00:47:27.915 --> 00:47:29.665 align:middle line:84%
but you're putting
attention and awareness

00:47:29.665 --> 00:47:33.010 align:middle line:84%
to that area, which gives
your body an awareness

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:34.960 align:middle line:84%
to bring nutrients
and minerals in there.

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And this can help balance out
issues around safety, security.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So once I get my
clients safe and secure,

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.090 align:middle line:90%
a lot of anxiety issues--

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:44.920 align:middle line:84%
we need to work on
that safety security,

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.660 align:middle line:90%
grounding them, irking them.

00:47:46.660 --> 00:47:49.670 align:middle line:84%
So when they do this exercise--
best done out in nature,

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:51.970 align:middle line:84%
but you can just whip off
your shoes in the office

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:54.150 align:middle line:84%
and do it as well,
or at the kitchen.

00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you can get access to
nature, get out in the grass,

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:01.450 align:middle line:84%
the sand, a park, somewhere
local, even for lunchtime,

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and doing 5 or 10 minutes
of this working in strategy

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.700 align:middle line:90%
using breathing first.

00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.770 align:middle line:84%
And then once you've
got that balanced,

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:12.100 align:middle line:84%
now start to do 5 or 10 minutes,
and build that up to 20 minutes

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.270 align:middle line:90%
twice a day.

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And then we can start
doing some serious exercise

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.200 align:middle line:90%
to work on the other.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:19.705 align:middle line:90%
Breathing Squats.

00:48:19.705 --> 00:48:19.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.760 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.003 align:middle line:90%
We should all give them a go.

00:48:22.003 --> 00:48:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So Donal, I have one
last question for you.

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:27.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm asking this to all
of our wonderful speakers.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.460 align:middle line:84%
It's been said by all
great philosophers,

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and now validated
through neuroscience,

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:36.640 align:middle line:84%
that our brain literally
believes what we think,

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:38.830 align:middle line:90%
what we tell it.

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:42.560 align:middle line:84%
And our physiology and
biology responds accordingly.

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So if you had an
"I am" statement

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:48.160 align:middle line:84%
that you would tell
yourself every day

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:52.570 align:middle line:84%
to reinforce that belief
system into your software,

00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:55.750 align:middle line:84%
what would your "I
am" statement be?

00:48:55.750 --> 00:49:00.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've done a
lot of work around that.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.920 align:middle line:84%
And I totally agree
with your statement.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:03.170 align:middle line:90%
And I've seen that clinically.

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:05.390 align:middle line:84%
I didn't need to see the
research come out now.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:08.510 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing that for years,
and that power of the mind.

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:11.260 align:middle line:84%
And I really enjoyed Bruce
Lipton's work, "The Biology

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:13.640 align:middle line:84%
of Belief," and the
epigenetical factors

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.760 align:middle line:84%
about thought processes,
and "Molecules of Emotion"

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:18.320 align:middle line:90%
by Candace Pert.

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Your emotions are basically
your thought processes.

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:23.450 align:middle line:84%
If you have good
thinking, you'll resonate.

00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:28.790 align:middle line:90%
So the one I use is "I am safe.

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:30.140 align:middle line:90%
I am whole.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.440 align:middle line:90%
And I am home."

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.460 align:middle line:84%
So if I feel safe with
myself, and reaffirm myself

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:38.540 align:middle line:84%
that I'm safe, and that I'm
not under any stress now.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting here with you.

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm not under any
real threat as such.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And even when life happens and
you feel yourself in a position

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.560 align:middle line:90%
where you're manifesting.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.360 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my god.

00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:51.777 align:middle line:84%
This guy's going
to crash into me,

00:49:51.777 --> 00:49:55.160 align:middle line:84%
or my kids are going to do
this, or I'm going to lose this,

00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:57.710 align:middle line:84%
or the stock market
might crash, or whatever.

00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:59.120 align:middle line:90%
That's projections.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.380 align:middle line:90%
Am I safe now?

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about stuff that
you don't control and can't

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:04.970 align:middle line:90%
control in the future.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.460 align:middle line:84%
As Eckhart Tolle
says, live in the now.

00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:11.510 align:middle line:84%
Be present, and be aware
of what you're putting in,

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:13.940 align:middle line:84%
and what you're creating
in your own life,

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:16.590 align:middle line:84%
because you are the dictator
of your own thoughts.

00:50:16.590 --> 00:50:17.780 align:middle line:90%
So I am safe.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:18.860 align:middle line:90%
I am home.

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.280 align:middle line:90%
I am whole.

00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Any affirmation there for me,
I just resonate those three.

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I mix them
around, but that's the message

00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:28.550 align:middle line:90%
I use for my "I am."

00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:30.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful, wonderful.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Donal, thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:33.920 align:middle line:90%
Really appreciate it.

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.930 align:middle line:84%
A wealth of
knowledge and wisdom.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And our audience is only
going to be better for it.

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.070 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Jo.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:41.508 align:middle line:90%
It's always a pleasure.

00:50:41.508 --> 00:50:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And thank you for giving
me the opportunity.

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:49.000 align:middle line:90%
