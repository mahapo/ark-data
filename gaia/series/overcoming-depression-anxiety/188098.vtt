00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:16.010 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA RUSHTON: Cyndi, a
very warm welcome to you,

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.790 align:middle line:84%
and thank you so
much for joining us.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.810 align:middle line:90%
I know how busy you are.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm really very grateful.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.540 align:middle line:90%
Before we get started, what--

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:84%
I'd love just to connect with
our audience and a little bit

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.612 align:middle line:84%
about your background,
because I know that you've

00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:31.505 align:middle line:84%
had an interesting professional
career to finally get

00:00:31.505 --> 00:00:32.630 align:middle line:90%
to where you are right now.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.730 align:middle line:84%
Can you share a little
bit about that for us?

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.727 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI O'MEARA: Well, I
wanted to ski in Colorado,

00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:90%
and that's where it all started.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.477 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
well, I'm not going

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
to waste my year just skiing,
I'll go to university there.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the University
of Colorado and did premed.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And one of the
classes that I did

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.670 align:middle line:84%
that went for the
12-month period

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.070 align:middle line:84%
was cultural anthropology
and anthropology,

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.750 align:middle line:84%
and I got very excited
about how food helped

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
us evolve through hunter
gatherers, agriculturalists,

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.740 align:middle line:84%
through to herding society,
Industrial Revolution.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So I got very
excited about that.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.390 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, I'll come back
to Australia and I'll do my--

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.572 align:middle line:90%
I'll become a dietitian.

00:01:09.572 --> 00:01:11.780 align:middle line:84%
So I'm finishing off my
bachelor of science, majoring

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.850 align:middle line:84%
in nutrition, and
I'm looking at what

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm being taught
and looking at what

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to
say as a dietitian--

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.120 align:middle line:84%
because you're under
strict regulation

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:84%
of the diabetic diet, the heart
disease diet, the this diet

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.260 align:middle line:90%
and the that diet.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't agree
with any of it.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, I
can't be a dietitian.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, well, I'll
go back to university

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.120 align:middle line:90%
and I'll become a chiropractor.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So I did two years of
human anatomy, which

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.590 align:middle line:84%
is what that first
two years was about--

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.360 align:middle line:84%
so pathology,
histology, embryology,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.920 align:middle line:84%
every -ology you
could possibly do.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And at end of, you know,
nearly six years of study,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I just went, I don't
know if I really

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.800 align:middle line:90%
want to be a chiropractor.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.200 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I really
want to study anymore.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.040 align:middle line:90%
I love food.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.390 align:middle line:90%
I love nutrition.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.100 align:middle line:84%
Can I teach the
type of nutrition

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
that I learned in cultural
anthropology and the food

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.310 align:middle line:90%
that we ate then?

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:84%
And not be under the
registration of the Dietetics

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:90%
Association?

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.100 align:middle line:90%
And teach my own?

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.259 align:middle line:84%
And so I, at 24, said,
well, I'm going to do it.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.510 align:middle line:84%
And that was 31 years ago
that I started to do that.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.170 align:middle line:84%
And now I own a company
called Changing Habits.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
And that company is all
about foset foods, so

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.660 align:middle line:84%
foods that are organic,
sustainable, ethical,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.890 align:middle line:90%
and trusted.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.710 align:middle line:84%
People know they can trust
me when I bring a food out.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.040 align:middle line:84%
I have an education
program that is worldwide.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we have
programs and protocols.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So we've come a long way from
the days when I thought, can I

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.220 align:middle line:84%
teach this, to just
stepping outside the square

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
and teaching something
very different.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Although what I'm seeing now,
from 30 years ago to now,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.700 align:middle line:84%
is that everybody's
coming on board.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.010 align:middle line:84%
Everybody's realizing the
importance of nutrition.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.670 align:middle line:84%
Whereas before,
nobody realized it.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:54.470 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: I know.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm thinking to
myself, you know,

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.670 align:middle line:84%
you were light
years ahead of where

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.930 align:middle line:84%
the government recommendations
of diet, as you say, you know,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.060 align:middle line:90%
Heart Foundation, et cetera.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And you know, that's
why I love your work,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.860 align:middle line:84%
because in Changing Habits, you
really do push the boundaries.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you
knock up against what

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.600 align:middle line:84%
is considered the right
diet or the right choice.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And you really dispel some
myths and nutritional myths.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:84%
And I have an enormous amount
of respect for you for that,

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.310 align:middle line:84%
because it is challenging
in today's society,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and the information
out there isn't always

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.810 align:middle line:84%
easy to mull through and
know what is the right thing

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:84%
to follow and not the
right thing to follow.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.345 align:middle line:84%
And one of the subjects
that I'm wanting

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:41.720 align:middle line:84%
us to talk about
today, which I'm

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:90%
really, really excited about--

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.190 align:middle line:84%
because I think that
for our audience,

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
when they're looking to
overcome depression, anxiety,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.730 align:middle line:90%
and when looking at--

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.290 align:middle line:84%
for us in the
Healthy Me summits,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.480 align:middle line:84%
we've decided to look
through the lenses

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:90%
of seven pillars of health.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And today, you're talking
through the pillar

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:90%
of nutrition.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the sides of
nutrition that a lot of people

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.420 align:middle line:84%
aren't understanding is the
relationship between what

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:90%
we call the brain and gut axes.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm hoping that today
we can dispel some myths

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.880 align:middle line:84%
and also give some clearer
understanding about

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.400 align:middle line:84%
the relationship between
the gut and the brain,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
because, you know,
latest research

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.690 align:middle line:84%
is showing us that
things like Parkinson's

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.760 align:middle line:84%
that was thought to
be something as simple

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.240 align:middle line:84%
as just a dopamine deficiency
is now actually being looked at,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.720 align:middle line:84%
with the latest research,
as actually a gut issue.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So can you kind of just
set up for our audience

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.363 align:middle line:84%
a little bit more
clearer understanding

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:42.530 align:middle line:84%
of why it's so important
to look at the relationship

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:90%
between the two?

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.250 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Oh, wow.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:90%
Put it this way.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.502 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't
look at the fact

00:04:48.502 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that everything they
put into their mouth

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.750 align:middle line:84%
makes every part of their body,
from their eyes to their hair

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.800 align:middle line:84%
to their brain to the chemicals
that make the brain work to,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.660 align:middle line:90%
you know, the toenail.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.600 align:middle line:84%
And you put junk in,
you're going to get junk.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
You put good stuff
in, you are going

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.980 align:middle line:84%
to get good stuff
that comes out.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.920 align:middle line:84%
And the gut is a barrier to
what is good for the body

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and what's not
good for the body.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So we chew our food, we
put it through our stomach.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.570 align:middle line:84%
The stomach is high
in hydrogen chloride.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.780 align:middle line:84%
That kills any
bacterial parasites.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Then-- by rights, this is
what should be happening.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, we go into
the small intestine,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.170 align:middle line:90%
where everything's digested.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And anything that's not
digested goes into the gut.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And then bacteria work on that
and get more nutrition out

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.780 align:middle line:84%
of it, or extract
the water out of it,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.910 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it
needs to do in order

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:46.640 align:middle line:84%
to do biochemical reactions
for us to even survive more.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:90%
And to be healthy.

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.470 align:middle line:84%
So the gut bacteria, the
genetics of the gut bacteria

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.360 align:middle line:90%
is 90% us.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
We are only 10%
genetically human.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.750 align:middle line:84%
Whereas that bacteria
is 90% genetically us.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people have
a hard concept with this.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
So keeping the gut
healthy means that we have

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:90%
a barrier against any disease--

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.110 align:middle line:84%
any parasites, any
bacteria that shouldn't

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.300 align:middle line:84%
be there, any foods
that shouldn't be there.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.370 align:middle line:90%
So it's a protective mechanism.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a place where
we, our immune system,

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:84%
starts to act, where
digestion starts,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.700 align:middle line:84%
where absorption utilization,
where more vitamins

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.300 align:middle line:90%
and minerals are made.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So when you're
putting good foods in

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.630 align:middle line:84%
and foods that we have evolved
to eat, as opposed to just

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:90%
made by science--

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and science has said, this
is the best food for us--

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.590 align:middle line:84%
then we have a
disconnect with what

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:41.840 align:middle line:84%
is actually happening
with our physical body

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.670 align:middle line:90%
and our mental brain.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people
look here, and they go,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.540 align:middle line:84%
well, this is all
about the physical,

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.460 align:middle line:84%
and this is all
about the mental.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:56.780 align:middle line:84%
But what we're realizing is that
most of our serotonin, which

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
is our neurotransmitters,
and our dopamine

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.810 align:middle line:84%
and our noradrenaline,
is made in the gut.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:90%
And then stimulates the brain.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.560 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it's made in the brain,
as well, but a lot of it

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.440 align:middle line:90%
is made in the gut.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So there's this-- we're just
starting to understand this

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and we're starting
to learn this.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.570 align:middle line:90%
And look, I love the research.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:84%
We don't know
everything, by the way.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:90%
We're just learning this.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.270 align:middle line:84%
This is just a new
science that's happening.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: I know.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.880 align:middle line:84%
It's a very exciting
side of science

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.030 align:middle line:84%
that's really coming through
with some amazing research.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.580 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.660 align:middle line:84%
So what sort of
functions is the brain

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:84%
responsible for that influences
the gut and vice versa?

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: Well, they're always
influencing each other.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.240 align:middle line:90%
And when you think about--

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:84%
let's just take
the hypothalamus,

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
for instance, which
is part of the brain.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:54.260 align:middle line:84%
The hypothalamus produces
a hormone called TSH,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.480 align:middle line:90%
which stimulates the thyroid.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And from there, that
thyroid produces

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.840 align:middle line:84%
a hormone called T4,
which then converts

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.780 align:middle line:84%
to T3, which then affects
every single cell in the body,

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:90%
including the gut cells.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:84%
So that's just one little organ
in the brain that is affecting

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.150 align:middle line:90%
every cell in your body.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.210 align:middle line:84%
So if that's not
working properly--

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.270 align:middle line:84%
you're not producing the TSH,
you're not making enough T4

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.510 align:middle line:84%
to convert to T3, which
means the cells don't have

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.870 align:middle line:84%
any metabolism, then you
get very tired and sluggish

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:90%
and the gut doesn't work.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's these-- and there's
so much influence and so much

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.309 align:middle line:84%
feedback through
the two systems.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.179 align:middle line:84%
So, like, I'm just
talking about one thing.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:42.799 align:middle line:84%
There are so many
feedback loops.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:46.580 align:middle line:84%
So we now see the pineal
gland and the production

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:51.020 align:middle line:84%
of melatonin, what that
does with its opposition

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.430 align:middle line:90%
to serotonin.

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So all of these things,
you cannot separate them.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.787 align:middle line:84%
There is no way you
can separate them.

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:59.620 align:middle line:84%
You cannot separate the
brain from the body.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot separate
the body from the brain.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.400 align:middle line:84%
Even what you think,
we're finding,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.420 align:middle line:84%
influences epigenetically
what's happening in your body,

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.530 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think it's
the sole and only thing.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.730 align:middle line:84%
But it is one of the
factors that we now see.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
Bruce Lipton's work,

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:84%
you will see how
our thinking changes

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:84%
so much about our physical
and mental capacities.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.350 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: So what
sort of symptoms

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.930 align:middle line:84%
does an individuals
start to experience

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.890 align:middle line:84%
if there is an imbalance,
let's say, in the gut,

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:35.870 align:middle line:90%
perhaps around dysbiosis.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.630 align:middle line:84%
How does that start
to show up and affect

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
their mental and
emotional mood or state?

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.140 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: Well, one of the
things that has been indicated--

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and this is through work,
through many people that are

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:84%
looking at the
brain gut access--

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.410 align:middle line:84%
is that the nervous system is
the first thing to be affected.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.090 align:middle line:84%
If your gut isn't
working and you

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.390 align:middle line:84%
don't have any diarrhea or
constipation or dysbiosis

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
in any way, as far as
SIBO or inflammatory bowel

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.810 align:middle line:84%
disease, or ulcerative colitis,
or Crohn's, or celiac--

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:09.230 align:middle line:84%
if none of that is presenting,
then what may present

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.180 align:middle line:90%
is a nervous system problem.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And that can be with
Parkinson's, as you talked

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.300 align:middle line:90%
about, multiple sclerosis.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.930 align:middle line:84%
It also could be
the way we think.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And it could act on depression
and anxiety and psychosis

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:27.180 align:middle line:90%
or schizophrenia.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So we're actually
seeing that the--

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.530 align:middle line:84%
while you may not
feel it in the gut,

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.408 align:middle line:84%
it may be affecting
your nervous system.

00:10:35.408 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
And the nervous system is
attached to everything.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.050 align:middle line:84%
So it could even
be a skin problem.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So when you look at the
branches of the nervous system,

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.550 align:middle line:84%
it goes to every
part of the body.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.400 align:middle line:84%
So every system
of the body can be

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.400 align:middle line:84%
affected as a
result of dysbiosis

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
or a gut problem
that's happening.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: So what I'm
hearing there is, literally,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.280 align:middle line:84%
no matter what the unfavorable
symptoms or sign is that you're

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.890 align:middle line:84%
experiencing, we
mustn't rule out

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:84%
looking at the health of the gut
as being possibly problematic

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.780 align:middle line:84%
or contributing towards whatever
that sign or symptom is--

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that that individual
is experiencing?

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: Well, that's
what we're learning.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.843 align:middle line:84%
Once upon a time, we looked
at the symptom, and we said,

00:11:19.843 --> 00:11:22.580 align:middle line:84%
oh, well, this person's
got anxiety and depression.

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.960 align:middle line:84%
Let's, you know,
give them a drug

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:84%
that will help them with their
serotonin issues, you know.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:middle line:84%
There was a chemical
imbalance in the brain--

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.300 align:middle line:84%
that was always the thing that
we believed was happening.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Or if there was a skin issue,
then we would give a cream.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.450 align:middle line:90%
And so on and so on.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.130 align:middle line:84%
We were giving drugs
to the symptom,

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.170 align:middle line:84%
but we weren't
looking at the cause.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.880 align:middle line:84%
And when we start to
look at the cause,

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:48.770 align:middle line:84%
we have to start
looking at the gut.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.690 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there are other
things that we need to look at.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:84%
But that's where
we're realizing,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.910 align:middle line:84%
if we can get that
gut fixed, then

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:59.480 align:middle line:84%
perhaps we can help what's
happening throughout the body,

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.207 align:middle line:90%
whatever symptom that might be.

00:12:01.207 --> 00:12:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's the scary thing,
is that the gut is not

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.100 align:middle line:90%
that easy to fix.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.700 align:middle line:84%
Everyone says, oh,
it's easy to fix.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.300 align:middle line:90%
But for some people, it's not.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not easy to fix, because
there's so many issues.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:13.040 align:middle line:84%
So there could be--
they've been taking antacid

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:90%
so they don't have enough acid.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:84%
It could be their
pancreas is not working,

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.895 align:middle line:84%
so they're not getting enough
enzymes to digest food.

00:12:19.895 --> 00:12:21.770 align:middle line:84%
It could be that they
have a motility problem

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.187 align:middle line:84%
in the small
intestine, so they've

00:12:23.187 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
got a backup of bugs that are
coming from the large intestine

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.660 align:middle line:84%
into a fairly sterile
small intestine.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.920 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: So by motility, you
mean the movement of our feces?

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Of food.

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Of food?

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.207 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: Of food going
from the stomach,

00:12:37.207 --> 00:12:38.960 align:middle line:84%
like empties out of
the stomach, and then

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.960 align:middle line:84%
there's a motility problem
in the small intestine, which

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:84%
doesn't move the food
through fast enough,

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and some bacteria come
into the small intestine

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.863 align:middle line:84%
from the large intestine
that shouldn't be there.

00:12:50.863 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:84%
And we have something
called SIBO,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.060 align:middle line:84%
which is an
overgrowth of bacteria

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.280 align:middle line:90%
in the small intestine.

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're finding
people get bloated

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:03.770 align:middle line:90%
and they get very uncomfortable.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But then, what
they do is they eat

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
a food that feeds the bacteria
in the small intestine,

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and they become very irritable
and anxious about things

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.730 align:middle line:90%
and mad about things and angry.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So that then feeds up
into their brain, which

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.130 align:middle line:90%
then causes these problems.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:23.660 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a passing thing,
that they've eaten something,

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.240 align:middle line:84%
it's fed the bacteria,
the bacteria are

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.040 align:middle line:84%
going wild and
having a great time,

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.080 align:middle line:84%
because they're happy,
they're being fed,

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:84%
which then feeds
up to the brain.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've see-- I see
people when they eat a food

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.390 align:middle line:84%
and have that effect
and how irritated they

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.230 align:middle line:90%
get about things.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Like, you might do
something and they'll say,

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.335 align:middle line:90%
don't do that, you know?

00:13:43.335 --> 00:13:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And you'll know that
they never usually

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.370 align:middle line:90%
get irritated about that.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Wow.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost as
if the microbiome

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:84%
is reacting and causing us
to the change in the brain

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.320 align:middle line:90%
chemistry.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:84%
And then how we behave
as a result of that.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Definitely.

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:00.890 align:middle line:84%
How you behave, how you
tolerate people, how you--

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:90%
little things may irritate you.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So maybe the phone's
too loud, or you

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.290 align:middle line:84%
know-- it is actually
fascinating to watch when

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.810 align:middle line:84%
you actually know when
someone's on a really good diet

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.602 align:middle line:84%
and they've eliminated
the foods that they

00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:14.810 align:middle line:90%
know are causing the problem.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
This isn't still
fixing the problem.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
It's just not
feeding the bacteria

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.200 align:middle line:90%
that is causing the problem.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And you see them eat a
food, and in 30 minutes,

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.820 align:middle line:90%
you see them change.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.393 align:middle line:90%
It's just-- and then--

00:14:28.393 --> 00:14:29.810 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: I
experienced it myself.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:32.670 align:middle line:84%
I know-- I know exactly
what you're talking about.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:90%
And it is.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.460 align:middle line:84%
It's an amazing experience
to have, to actually

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.240 align:middle line:84%
be conscious enough to
notice and witness what

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.410 align:middle line:84%
certain foods and reactions
certain foods, you know,

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:46.880 align:middle line:90%
elicit within you.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:84%
And whether that's a
physical reaction, i.e.,

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
to feel more bloated
or heavy or more

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:84%
gas, or any of those
physical signs,

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.540 align:middle line:84%
versus the mental
and the emotional.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've experienced what
it's like to eat certain foods

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.230 align:middle line:84%
and actually increase my
levels of anxiety as a result.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:09.350 align:middle line:84%
So I guess what
I'd love to do is

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.350 align:middle line:84%
be able to go through
the sort of lifestyle

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.020 align:middle line:84%
choices, especially
around food, that

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.840 align:middle line:90%
start to impact this imbalance.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.280 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we talk a lot
about dysbiosis as the beginning

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.780 align:middle line:84%
point of that then
creating the opportunity

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:90%
for us to become a host to--

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.220 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a fungal
overgrowth or a parasite

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.290 align:middle line:84%
or the various other things
that you've mentioned

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.540 align:middle line:90%
that it can feed into.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.167 align:middle line:84%
What are the sort of choices,
the everyday choices,

00:15:37.167 --> 00:15:38.750 align:middle line:84%
that people are
making that they don't

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.850 align:middle line:84%
realize are actually
contributing

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.312 align:middle line:90%
to an imbalance in the gut?

00:15:43.312 --> 00:15:45.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: You've opened
up a can of worms.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.912 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Haven't I?

00:15:45.912 --> 00:15:47.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: Because it can
be the water you drink,

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:49.640 align:middle line:84%
because the water's
got chlorine in it.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.560 align:middle line:90%
Chlorine is there to kill bugs.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.540 align:middle line:84%
You put it into your body and
you start to kill the bugs.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: So we're killing
the good and the bad?

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Yes.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.180 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's a really,
a balance in the gut.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
And that balance is between
the good and the bad.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:07.250 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's
bacteria in the gut.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Like, a lot of people
think that H. pylori, which

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.440 align:middle line:84%
is what they've indicated
causes ulcers in the stomach,

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:90%
is a bad bacteria.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.770 align:middle line:90%
But most people have H. pylori.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.230 align:middle line:84%
It depends on whether
it's overwhelming

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.780 align:middle line:84%
the good bacteria as to
whether it causes disease.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's a nice balance
that's always happening.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And it's changing
on an hourly basis,

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.600 align:middle line:84%
depending on what you're eating,
drinking, exposed to, putting

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.000 align:middle line:90%
on your skin, breathing in.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.990 align:middle line:90%
So it's continuously changing--

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.790 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Adapting.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.210 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: It's adapting.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:42.050 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Yep.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.620 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: And my belief
is, genetically, we

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.660 align:middle line:84%
can't adapt as fast
as those guys can

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.240 align:middle line:90%
adapt to what we're consuming.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.162 align:middle line:84%
But do I believe that
the food that we're

00:16:52.162 --> 00:16:53.870 align:middle line:84%
consuming, the water
that we're drinking,

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.900 align:middle line:84%
the chemicals that
we're exposed to--

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.030 align:middle line:84%
do I believe that our
bacteria is adapting

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.830 align:middle line:90%
to this as fast as it should?

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.552 align:middle line:90%
And I don't think it is.

00:17:02.552 --> 00:17:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I
think we're seeing

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.109 align:middle line:84%
the rise in
gastrointestinal problems

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and the rise in
depression and anxiety

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:84%
and psychosis and
schizophrenia and bipolar

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
that we're now seeing,
is because culturally, we

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:84%
are driving our evolution,
but our anatomical evolution

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:84%
and our genetic
evolution is not adapting

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:25.190 align:middle line:90%
to that cultural drive.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:28.250 align:middle line:84%
So what are our
cultural drives that we

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:33.140 align:middle line:84%
seem to do on a regular
basis cause this dysbiosis

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.000 align:middle line:84%
and then cause all
sorts of other issues,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.360 align:middle line:90%
as we've already spoken about?

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.270 align:middle line:84%
So cultural drives
are the medications

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.970 align:middle line:84%
that we now take, all
the way from antibiotics

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.220 align:middle line:90%
to anti acids to the pill.

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.920 align:middle line:84%
So these are cultural
things that we think are OK.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.357 align:middle line:84%
And that's what everybody
does, so that's what we do.

00:17:51.357 --> 00:17:52.940 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: That we
literally introduced

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:84%
over the last 50
to 70, 80 years.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.880 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: And really
probably since the '40s,

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.680 align:middle line:90%
antibiotics really came in.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Anti acids then became
something that we were doing.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:04.940 align:middle line:90%
The pill in the '60s.

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And we did it, saying, hey,
we have this revolution.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:08.900 align:middle line:90%
We're now able to help things.

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think what happens
is that these things are

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:16.250 align:middle line:84%
important in our life,
but then what we're doing

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.370 align:middle line:84%
is we now have the consequences
of this cultural push.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're not adapting
to this cultural push.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So the medications,
I think, are one.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.720 align:middle line:90%
You know, sanitation.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.020 align:middle line:90%
Chlorinating of water.

00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
We did this so that we wouldn't
get diseases from water,

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.510 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
the plague came from,

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:38.870 align:middle line:84%
was it was being spread
because of the water had it.

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:40.380 align:middle line:84%
So we then
chlorinated our water.

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:84%
But has this been a good
thing for us to adapt to?

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:45.150 align:middle line:90%
And can we adapt to it?

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: And we now have
fluoride in our water, as well.

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Exactly.

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:84%
You know, and one
of the consequences

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.220 align:middle line:84%
of the fluoride in the water--
are they good and are they bad?

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're actually
seeing both now,

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:56.180 align:middle line:84%
because they're
now showing people

00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.470 align:middle line:84%
in fluoridated areas having
higher thyroid issues.

00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.320 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a look-- if
anybody's listening to this,

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:90%
they'll know that--

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.980 align:middle line:84%
they'll know someone
with a thyroid issue.

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:84%
20 years ago, we weren't
even talking about this.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.380 align:middle line:90%
So it's our water supply.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
It's medications
that we're taking.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:84%
What about the sprays that
we're spraying on our foods?

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.240 align:middle line:90%
So back in the '40s--

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.970 align:middle line:90%
my family's from Iowa, USA.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.540 align:middle line:90%
They were corn farmers.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.060 align:middle line:90%
There was DDT being sprayed.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.135 align:middle line:90%
There was arsenic being sprayed.

00:19:28.135 --> 00:19:29.510 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
things were being

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:33.650 align:middle line:84%
sprayed without even considering
the ramifications of it

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.890 align:middle line:84%
getting into the food and then
getting into the water supply.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And then that's more
in our water supply.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:90%
And now, there's Roundup.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:48.200 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge herbicide that
is sprayed on our sugarcane,

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.080 align:middle line:84%
on our wheat, or before
the wheat is planted,

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.870 align:middle line:84%
sometimes, it's used as
the desiccant on our wheat.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.670 align:middle line:84%
Many people eat
wheat all the time.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:57.320 align:middle line:90%
It's in most of our products.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.100 align:middle line:90%
It's on Roundup soybeans.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.910 align:middle line:90%
It's on Roundup corn, Bt-corn.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.750 align:middle line:84%
It's on any of the Roundup
ready, genetically modified

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:06.710 align:middle line:90%
foods.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And then what about
genetically modified foods?

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.730 align:middle line:84%
Not only is the
Roundup the problem,

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:13.230 align:middle line:90%
what about the Bt toxin in corn?

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So what that does is
when a little insect eats

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:22.410 align:middle line:84%
a bit of corn, it explodes its
stomach and the insect dies.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:26.700 align:middle line:84%
So when you eat Bt corn, no,
it's not affecting your cells,

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:31.260 align:middle line:84%
but what about the microbiome
that's in your gut?

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.170 align:middle line:90%
It explodes them, destroys them.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:38.330 align:middle line:84%
So you know, we haven't
even started on food,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:41.760 align:middle line:84%
where we're just looking at
water supply, medications,

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.440 align:middle line:90%
chemicals being sprayed.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:84%
All of these things are
affecting the microbiome.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:51.088 align:middle line:84%
Then we eat these foods that
may be chemically laden,

00:20:51.088 --> 00:20:53.130 align:middle line:84%
may have additives,
preservatives, and flavorings

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.950 align:middle line:84%
in them, may have hydrogenated
vegetable oil, which

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.460 align:middle line:84%
affects the cells of the human
body, which then, in turn,

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:84%
affects the cascade
effects of our body.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:10.350 align:middle line:84%
And I just feel that we are
destroying our body's ability

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:14.520 align:middle line:84%
to adapt and to be robust
by all of these things

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.320 align:middle line:90%
that we're doing to it.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.900 align:middle line:90%
And can we come back from this?

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:22.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, what I am
seeing now is I am

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:84%
seeing young women,
young men, babies

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.710 align:middle line:84%
that have such dysbiosis
in their microbiome

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:84%
that it's getting tougher and
tougher to fix these guys.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.325 align:middle line:84%
And when you listen to the
specialists-- so, you know,

00:21:34.325 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening to,
at the moment--

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.770 align:middle line:84%
I have new boyfriends
and new girlfriends.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.230 align:middle line:84%
So my husband always goes,
who are you listening to now?

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.313 align:middle line:84%
And so at the moment, I'm
listening to a gentleman

00:21:42.313 --> 00:21:44.520 align:middle line:84%
by the name of
Dr. Mark Pimentel.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:48.120 align:middle line:90%
And he's out of the US.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:54.630 align:middle line:84%
And he's a specialist on the
gut bacteria, more so dysbiosis

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:56.400 align:middle line:90%
in the small intestine.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.330 align:middle line:84%
And he's just showing
80% of the people,

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.020 align:middle line:84%
we might be able
to help with this.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.690 align:middle line:84%
45% we might be able
to help with this.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.630 align:middle line:84%
But is it continuing
and is it long-term?

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And I love these
people that are really

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:84%
looking at the microbiome and
understanding it and seeing

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.920 align:middle line:90%
how we can help it.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.650 align:middle line:90%
And can we get past this?

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.810 align:middle line:84%
Once we get rid of
the chlorinated water,

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:21.570 align:middle line:84%
once we get rid of all the
medications, once we change

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.950 align:middle line:84%
the diet, even if we
do all these things,

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.490 align:middle line:84%
are we still
getting them better?

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Have we gone past the
point of no return?

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.245 align:middle line:84%
That's the question that many
of these scientists are asking.

00:22:31.245 --> 00:22:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Well, that's big.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.050 align:middle line:90%
That's a very big question.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's a scary
one to contemplate.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
what's really important

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.070 align:middle line:84%
is that whilst we are
still here and that we

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.680 align:middle line:84%
are able to make
a choice that can

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.430 align:middle line:84%
be supportive in
the next moment,

00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:49.110 align:middle line:84%
you know, for ourselves
from a health perspective?

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.590 align:middle line:84%
Can we come back specifically
and look at food?

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And for the audience that--
you know, your everyday person,

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.470 align:middle line:84%
who probably still
shops at the likes

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.120 align:middle line:90%
of Kohl's or Woolworth's--

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.050 align:middle line:90%
if you're here in Australia--

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.060 align:middle line:84%
and how we can bring
awareness to how

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:09.000 align:middle line:84%
to educate ourselves
around reading labels

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:09.920 align:middle line:90%
more effectively?

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.380 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Yes.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.610 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: Or, you know--
because I always believed,

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.360 align:middle line:84%
as a health coach myself, one of
the things I'm always creating

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.910 align:middle line:84%
is a Rainbow Bridge
for my clients.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.890 align:middle line:84%
They're here and they
want to be over here.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.970 align:middle line:84%
But you know, that's
a massive step.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.742 align:middle line:84%
And we need to break
those steps down.

00:23:25.742 --> 00:23:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And it really depends
on where they're at

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.910 align:middle line:90%
and how far they need to go.

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.485 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, I say to
my clients, keep going shopping

00:23:33.485 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:84%
where you normally go, and
if it's the supermarket,

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.800 align:middle line:84%
start shopping on
the parameters.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Stop going down
the middle aisles.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:43.050 align:middle line:84%
But if we were to break it
down and give our audience

00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:48.270 align:middle line:84%
some really simple
go-tos around how

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.772 align:middle line:84%
to improve the quality
of their food, what would

00:23:51.772 --> 00:23:53.230 align:middle line:84%
some of-- what
would you tell them?

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.980 align:middle line:84%
What would the top
three things you'd tell

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.415 align:middle line:90%
them to stay away from?

00:23:56.415 --> 00:23:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And the top three
things that you

00:23:57.790 --> 00:24:00.750 align:middle line:90%
would ask them to have more of?

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:01.650 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Yeah.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:04.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, I love people
that are just starting out,

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:08.910 align:middle line:84%
because you can make leaps and
bounds just with one change.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.200 align:middle line:90%
You can make a huge leap.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the people that
have tried everything

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that are still struggling
that are the tough ones.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So this is exciting to be
here, where people are still

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:21.240 align:middle line:84%
eating breakfast cereals
and margarine and toast

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.948 align:middle line:84%
and Vegemite and Lean Cuisine
and all of those foods,

00:24:24.948 --> 00:24:26.490 align:middle line:84%
because you know
you're going to make

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.840 align:middle line:90%
a big difference in their life.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.740 align:middle line:90%
And it's like medication.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.970 align:middle line:84%
We know that antidepressants
work for the short-term.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.290 align:middle line:90%
They never work long-term.

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And in the end, they're
worse long-term.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So we know that food is going
to work in the beginning.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.560 align:middle line:90%
And it will work long-term.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And it will be the
batter choice in what

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:52.570 align:middle line:84%
we do if we take that as one
of the pillars of health.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:53.700 align:middle line:90%
And so, this is exciting.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:56.890 align:middle line:84%
So what would be my top
three things to avoid?

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's just do one.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:03.860 align:middle line:84%
And my top one would be stay
away from all packaged foods.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And once you understand that
most packaged foods are merely

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.480 align:middle line:90%
foods that have been--

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.700 align:middle line:90%
what would I call it--

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:21.460 align:middle line:84%
upgraded or upscaled to make
you think that a grain of wheat

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.570 align:middle line:84%
can taste better than
it actually does--

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:25.910 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, you
eat a grain of wheat,

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:26.740 align:middle line:90%
it's disastrous.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.698 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't taste good.

00:25:28.698 --> 00:25:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't chomp
on a grain of wheat.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But if we can look at
that grain of wheat

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:37.060 align:middle line:84%
and we can maybe
bake it or extrude it

00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.070 align:middle line:84%
as breakfast cereals
are, and we can

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.340 align:middle line:84%
add some flavors to it and
some colors and a bit of sugar

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:47.570 align:middle line:84%
and add a sultana to it, then
it becomes something worthwhile.

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So if I was to buy
wheat from the farmer,

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:53.020 align:middle line:84%
it might cost me
$1 a kilo for it.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.700 align:middle line:84%
But when I'm buying
a breakfast cereal

00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.340 align:middle line:84%
in a package, that has all
these additives, preservatives,

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:03.040 align:middle line:84%
and flavorings in it, they'll
charge me $7 for 250 grams.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So to me, people have to
realize that it was just

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:08.690 align:middle line:84%
a grain of wheat, and
this is what it is now.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:10.720 align:middle line:84%
So what they're adding
to it is what's scary.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Is that, they add a
preservative to it.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:14.217 align:middle line:84%
The reason they add
a preservative to it

00:26:14.217 --> 00:26:16.858 align:middle line:84%
is that they actually
don't want it to go off.

00:26:16.858 --> 00:26:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So when you consume
it, you're really

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.920 align:middle line:84%
adding a preservative
that stops bacteria.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Once again, you're
destroying the microbiome.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
So number one is, stay
away from packaged foods.

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:30.010 align:middle line:84%
If you do want to have
some packaged foods--

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.500 align:middle line:84%
because we have to buy
our sugar or our salt

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:84%
or our chia seeds or
our foods in packaging--

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.370 align:middle line:84%
read the ingredients, as opposed
to reading the nutritional

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:41.170 align:middle line:90%
labels.

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:42.962 align:middle line:84%
So most people look at
a label, and they'll

00:26:42.962 --> 00:26:44.240 align:middle line:90%
go, well, what's the fat?

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.040 align:middle line:90%
Protein?

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.012 align:middle line:90%
Carbohydrate?

00:26:46.012 --> 00:26:48.220 align:middle line:84%
What are the vitamins and
minerals, the salt content?

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.860 align:middle line:84%
They're more
concerned with that.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And a manufacturer can
manipulate anything they want

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.210 align:middle line:84%
and make it look like that,
by manipulating the food.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.800 align:middle line:84%
But what I want to
look at is, I want

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.600 align:middle line:84%
to know what are
the ingredients?

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.670 align:middle line:84%
What's the top
ingredient in there?

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And if it's sugar, and
it's white sugar or multi

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:09.280 align:middle line:84%
dextrose, which is made from
wheat or corn, which could have

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Roundup on it, then
I'm going to go,

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:15.520 align:middle line:84%
well, this isn't
good for my body,

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.930 align:middle line:90%
it's not good for my microbiome.

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:19.560 align:middle line:84%
And if I do have
dysbiosis, I'm going

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.370 align:middle line:84%
to be feeding the bad
ones, and I'm just

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:23.210 align:middle line:84%
going to get worse
and worse and worse.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.840 align:middle line:84%
So number one, stay away
from packaged foods.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.055 align:middle line:84%
If you are going to have
some packaged foods,

00:27:28.055 --> 00:27:28.930 align:middle line:90%
read the ingredients.

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:30.555 align:middle line:84%
If it looks like a
chemical laboratory,

00:27:30.555 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:90%
be a little bit careful.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.780 align:middle line:84%
And see if it looks
like the foods that

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:36.197 align:middle line:84%
was in your
grandmother's kitchen,

00:27:36.197 --> 00:27:38.197 align:middle line:84%
or your great grandmother's
kitchens, if there's

00:27:38.197 --> 00:27:40.180 align:middle line:84%
20-year-olds listening
to this, or 16-year-olds

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.380 align:middle line:90%
listening to this.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.340 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.740 align:middle line:84%
It's that-- that
would be number one.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:47.680 align:middle line:84%
Number two, read the
ingredients if you are.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.600 align:middle line:90%
Number three would be--

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.420 align:middle line:90%
what to stay away from?

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.230 align:middle line:90%
Your refined oils.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.853 align:middle line:84%
You know, look at the oils and
the fats that you're consuming.

00:27:55.853 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: So what
would-- what would you

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.810 align:middle line:90%
describe as a refined oil?

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: Number one,
margarine is a refined oil.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:07.370 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got canola oil,
you've got a rice bran oil.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.760 align:middle line:84%
I want people to really think
about rice bran oil, OK?

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.740 align:middle line:90%
So bran is a fiber.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.750 align:middle line:90%
The germ is the oil.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:84%
So how do you get
fat out of bran?

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:21.215 align:middle line:84%
So, like, I looked at that and
went, how can you have-- how

00:28:21.215 --> 00:28:22.940 align:middle line:90%
do you get fat out of rice bran?

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:25.120 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't-- it
just doesn't compute.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.110 align:middle line:90%
People don't think.

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: I totally get that.

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And I have the same sort
of questioning moment

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.600 align:middle line:84%
when I'm looking at getting
milk out of an almond or out

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.880 align:middle line:90%
of rice.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, I'm still not--

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:43.940 align:middle line:84%
I kind of sit on the fence
on that one, looking at--

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I've seen-- my problem with
those commercial almond

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:52.250 align:middle line:84%
or rice milks is that when
you look on the label,

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:55.000 align:middle line:90%
they've been extended with oils.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Often, the vegetable
oils or the canola oil

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:90%
that you're talking about.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:01.910 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: And the thickener
in it, guar gum, usually.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.423 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
put a sugar in it

00:29:03.423 --> 00:29:05.840 align:middle line:84%
or they'll put a flavor in it,
because it's got no flavor.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Really, rice milk has
no flavor whatsoever.

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Neither does soya, by the way.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.770 align:middle line:84%
If you get real soya milk, it's
a very woody, bland tasting

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:14.570 align:middle line:90%
thing.

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But we in the
Western world don't

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:20.480 align:middle line:84%
want to drink that
soya milk, so we add

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.147 align:middle line:90%
things to make it taste good.

00:29:23.147 --> 00:29:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: That's
just crazy, isn't it?

00:29:24.730 --> 00:29:25.010 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.100 align:middle line:90%
So I've got three--

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:84%
around what we're
talking about right now,

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.000 align:middle line:84%
there's three questions
that are coming to my mind.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.290 align:middle line:84%
One is to just help our
audience get really clear

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:38.270 align:middle line:84%
on the processed oils that
we want to stay away from,

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and giving them a little bit
of an understanding as to why.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:41.690 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.470 align:middle line:90%
That's one of them.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:47.720 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is, because I
brought up almond milk and rice

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:84%
milk, I'd love for you just
to give your opinion on,

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.940 align:middle line:84%
are they the healthy
dairy alternative?

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the third thing
is, we just bought up soya--

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and I think, again, there's
a lot of research that's

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:84%
coming out about soya
and extruded soya

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.510 align:middle line:90%
and how it's also a neurotoxin.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.760 align:middle line:84%
So you know, the fact that
we're talking about anxiety

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:84%
and depression, I think it's
really important that we just

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:15.380 align:middle line:90%
clarify for our audience.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:17.440 align:middle line:84%
So can we look at
those three in detail?

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.240 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Yea, sure.

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.670 align:middle line:90%
So first was the oils.

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:23.393 align:middle line:84%
So if I was to give a really
simple example of this,

00:30:23.393 --> 00:30:25.685 align:middle line:84%
what's the difference between
a good fat and a bad fat?

00:30:25.685 --> 00:30:28.190 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people think
saturated, monounsaturated,

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:32.000 align:middle line:84%
polyunsaturated, should have
omega-3, should have DHA, EPA--

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.440 align:middle line:90%
forget all of that.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Just forget all of that, because
you don't need to know that.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:40.310 align:middle line:84%
So to me, a good fat
is a fat that we've

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:42.120 align:middle line:84%
eaten for thousands
and thousands of years.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.320 align:middle line:90%
So there are animal fats.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.120 align:middle line:90%
There are butters.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:46.250 align:middle line:90%
And people will be like, what?

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:47.210 align:middle line:90%
Why is she saying this?

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I've been told I should be
eating margarine and vegetable

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:50.080 align:middle line:90%
oils.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.130 align:middle line:84%
So we didn't stop
making vegetable oils

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.560 align:middle line:90%
until the Industrial Revolution.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Before that, we ate it
in their real form--

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:59.420 align:middle line:84%
in nuts and seeds
and avocados and meat

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.160 align:middle line:90%
and butters and creams.

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.360 align:middle line:90%
That was how we did our fats.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.255 align:middle line:84%
So the good fats are
the fats from nature.

00:31:06.255 --> 00:31:08.630 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones that have
not been changed in a chemical

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:09.620 align:middle line:90%
laboratory.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:15.980 align:middle line:84%
So margarine started in the
1920s as wax for your candles

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.167 align:middle line:90%
and fat for your soap.

00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:19.250 align:middle line:84%
That was how margarine
started, if you really want

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.593 align:middle line:90%
to know the nitty gritty of it.

00:31:21.593 --> 00:31:23.510 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: Is it true
that it's like a molecule

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.920 align:middle line:90%
away from plastic?

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Well, it could be.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And I have done a
little test on this.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.520 align:middle line:84%
I got some margarine about 2009
and I put it in my cupboard

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.320 align:middle line:90%
and let it go.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.652 align:middle line:90%
Just let it be.

00:31:34.652 --> 00:31:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And you look at it
now, and there's

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.570 align:middle line:84%
this plastic layer
across it, quite

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.220 align:middle line:90%
hardy plastic layer of it.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.410 align:middle line:84%
It hasn't gone off,
nothing's eaten it.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.480 align:middle line:84%
None of the cockroaches
in Queensland want it.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.130 align:middle line:90%
No ants have gotten to it.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.318 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wants it.

00:31:47.318 --> 00:31:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: So it says
a lot in itself.

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Yeah.

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And whereas, when
we look at butter--

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:57.590 align:middle line:84%
butter, we've been eating
for maybe 10, 20,000 years,

00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:58.560 align:middle line:90%
where we--

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.268 align:middle line:84%
we used to rob an animal
that maybe had a baby on it,

00:32:03.268 --> 00:32:05.810 align:middle line:84%
and we might have thought, oh,
we can have some of that milk,

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.227 align:middle line:84%
and then they figured out how
to churn it and make butter.

00:32:08.227 --> 00:32:10.370 align:middle line:90%
So a good fat is a natural fat.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.830 align:middle line:84%
A bad fat, to me, is a
refined fat or a fat that's

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.730 align:middle line:90%
come manipulated in some way.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.230 align:middle line:84%
That could be hydrogenation,
interesterification,

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.150 align:middle line:90%
or fractionation.

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:23.360 align:middle line:84%
But don't be obsessed
with those terminologies.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.915 align:middle line:84%
Just look at it and go, like
canola oil, vegetable oil--

00:32:27.915 --> 00:32:29.540 align:middle line:84%
all of these will
either be genetically

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.120 align:middle line:84%
modified, have some
chemicals sprayed on it,

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:35.510 align:middle line:90%
extracted through solvents.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.525 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just very
wary of those oils.

00:32:37.525 --> 00:32:39.650 align:middle line:84%
And there's something we've
only eaten for probably

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:42.160 align:middle line:90%
about 150 years of those oils.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.630 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: And what are they--
because I hear the term a lot

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:46.910 align:middle line:90%
that they are oxidated.

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So they cause
cellular oxidation.

00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Can you just describe
what's happening

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.810 align:middle line:84%
at a cell level that is then
affecting the microbiome yet

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:55.610 align:middle line:90%
again?

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.410 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Yeah.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:33:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So oxidation means-- a saturated
fat means that all of the bonds

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.850 align:middle line:90%
are saturated.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:09.950 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't oxidize, because
oxygen can't go on a bond.

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Whereas a polyunsaturated can
oxidize, because it's poly,

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.690 align:middle line:90%
unsaturated.

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Means there's lots of
bonds that can be oxidized,

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:19.830 align:middle line:90%
so an oxygen molecule can go on.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:22.510 align:middle line:90%
So that's what oxidation is.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And the oxidation
requires antioxidants

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:32.400 align:middle line:84%
to take that oxygen molecule off
so it doesn't cause rancidity

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.800 align:middle line:84%
or it doesn't
cause free radicals

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:84%
in our body, which
then causes aging.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.170 align:middle line:84%
If we practically look at
what we're actually saying,

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:43.830 align:middle line:84%
like the antioxidant, the
oxidation-- so the antioxidant

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:44.940 align:middle line:90%
helps with the oxidation.

00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And oxidation is happening
all the time in your body.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And you're producing
antioxidants.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:52.020 align:middle line:84%
In actual fact, things
like turmeric, coffee,

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:57.570 align:middle line:84%
believe it or not,
ashwagandha, broccoli,

00:33:57.570 --> 00:34:01.860 align:middle line:84%
enhance the body's
or the cell's nucleus

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.430 align:middle line:84%
to start a pathway that
produces antioxidants.

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:06.820 align:middle line:84%
So we know how to
handle these things.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:09.159 align:middle line:84%
So if oxidation is
happening, it doesn't matter.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:11.159 align:middle line:84%
But if you have gone
over the extreme

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.739 align:middle line:84%
and you're having way too
much oxidation is happening

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:16.260 align:middle line:84%
because of the foods you're
consuming, the chemicals that

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.969 align:middle line:84%
are around, et
cetera, then that's

00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:20.100 align:middle line:90%
when we start to break down.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And that starts to break down
the cells, which not only break

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:25.350 align:middle line:84%
down the physical body,
but it breaks down

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:26.969 align:middle line:90%
the cells in the brain.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:29.909 align:middle line:84%
And remembering that
the brain is fat--

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:31.590 align:middle line:84%
so without the good
fats, your brain

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.400 align:middle line:84%
will not have the structure,
and then it won't function.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And many of the
neurotransmitters

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.270 align:middle line:84%
are produced from fats,
especially cholesterol.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:44.560 align:middle line:84%
So many of neurotransmitters
come from that.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:48.989 align:middle line:84%
So I'm-- because of my
anthropological love

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:51.900 align:middle line:84%
and my love of cultures-- and
that's where it all started

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.040 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:56.550 align:middle line:84%
is that I always go
back to these cultures.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.920 align:middle line:84%
But people have to realize
that there are cultures out

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:01.650 align:middle line:84%
there that ate all carbs,
and there are cultures out

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:03.840 align:middle line:84%
there that ate all fat,
and there are cultures out

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:05.610 align:middle line:90%
there that ate all protein.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So don't get hung up on
how much fat should I

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.320 align:middle line:90%
have, how much carbs?

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.530 align:middle line:84%
It's about going back
to the real foods.

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:17.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that-- that's probably
my number one thing, as far

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:19.900 align:middle line:90%
as what should we be doing?

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.240 align:middle line:90%
We should be eating real foods.

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.520 align:middle line:84%
That's where we
should be starting.

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Your second part to this
was, what about the milks

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:28.097 align:middle line:90%
that are out there?

00:35:28.097 --> 00:35:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, why are we having a
problem with dairy milk?

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:33.090 align:middle line:90%
That's my question.

00:35:33.090 --> 00:35:36.300 align:middle line:84%
There are cultures like
the Himbas in Namibia--

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.038 align:middle line:84%
there's another--
and they're still

00:35:38.038 --> 00:35:39.330 align:middle line:90%
living their traditional lives.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:41.760 align:middle line:84%
They eat nothing
but meat and dairy.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.490 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: And the Swedish,
up in the Alps in Sweden.

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:46.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Yeah.

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.890 align:middle line:84%
And there's a group
in the Panna--

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:50.430 align:middle line:84%
Panna, I think it
is, in Afghanistan--

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:52.410 align:middle line:90%
all they do is--

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:54.960 align:middle line:90%
they're pastoralists or herders.

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.110 align:middle line:84%
All they do is eat meat and
drink milk, or fermented milks.

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So we know there are cultures
that can handle milk.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.910 align:middle line:84%
Why, all of a sudden, was I
drinking milk in 1960 and 1970?

00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I had to, because
that was the playground

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.180 align:middle line:84%
thing that you
had to do, you had

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.600 align:middle line:84%
your first part of the morning,
everybody got some milk.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.310 align:middle line:90%
And everybody tolerated it.

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Why are we having a
problem with it now?

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's why these nut
milks and these have all

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:23.797 align:middle line:90%
come into vogue.

00:36:23.797 --> 00:36:25.380 align:middle line:84%
It's because people
can't handle milk.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:27.090 align:middle line:90%
And they want milk.

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.720 align:middle line:90%
So what do I think about them?

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.800 align:middle line:84%
Look, if you make them
yourself, that's cool.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, they're great,
because then you know

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.020 align:middle line:90%
what you're putting into them.

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:38.220 align:middle line:84%
But many of the Tetra Paks,
I look at the ingredients,

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.145 align:middle line:84%
and they've got the
refined oils in them.

00:36:40.145 --> 00:36:41.520 align:middle line:84%
They may have
white salt in them.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.550 align:middle line:84%
They may have
citric acid in them,

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.907 align:middle line:84%
which is made from a
genetically modified mold.

00:36:46.907 --> 00:36:48.990 align:middle line:84%
You know, these are the
things that people don't--

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.490 align:middle line:84%
they think it's just from
lemon juice, but it's not.

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:52.560 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Yep.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: And then the third
part of what you asked was--

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:58.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Looking at the soya.

00:36:58.820 --> 00:36:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Oh, soya.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.890 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, I don't have
a problem with soya.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I think the way the
Asians ate soya was OK.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:09.360 align:middle line:90%
4% of the diet, probably.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.760 align:middle line:84%
But they probably
had organic soya.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:12.660 align:middle line:90%
They fermented it.

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.760 align:middle line:84%
They knew how to get rid
of the anti-nutrients,

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.750 align:middle line:84%
because there are at least
five anti-nutrients in soya.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:22.920 align:middle line:84%
And they prepared it properly
via culture and tradition.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit like
the Aboriginals--

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:28.390 align:middle line:84%
they ate a lot of toxic foods
that many of us would die from.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:30.120 align:middle line:84%
In actual fact,
Burke and Wills did

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.400 align:middle line:90%
die from eating a toxic food.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.525 align:middle line:84%
They didn't die from lack
of water or lack of food.

00:37:35.525 --> 00:37:37.650 align:middle line:84%
They died because they had
a toxic food, because it

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.030 align:middle line:90%
wasn't prepared properly.

00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:42.870 align:middle line:84%
The Aboriginals were brilliant
at their cultural tradition

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.930 align:middle line:84%
and understanding food and
what they had to do to it.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.160 align:middle line:90%
We've lost that.

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:48.690 align:middle line:84%
We think we can
just make a food out

00:37:48.690 --> 00:37:50.550 align:middle line:84%
of additives,
preservatives, flavorings,

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:54.840 align:middle line:84%
refined oils, and fake foods,
and genetically modified foods,

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.450 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be OK for
us, and we can adapt to that.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:58.890 align:middle line:90%
And we can't.

00:37:58.890 --> 00:38:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So I stay away from soya because
of what they've done to it.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.710 align:middle line:90%
So is food the problem?

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:07.530 align:middle line:84%
Or is it what they've done to
it that's actually the problem?

00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And my belief is
it's what they've

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:12.510 align:middle line:84%
done to it that is the
biggest problem of all.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And if we can get back to our
real food-- so number one is,

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.070 align:middle line:90%
let's get back to real foods.

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:21.420 align:middle line:84%
And if you're just starting
out on this, as you said,

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.048 align:middle line:84%
you know, just go around the
outskirts of the supermarket.

00:38:25.048 --> 00:38:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Just get your fruits and
vegetables and your meat

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.580 align:middle line:90%
and your unadulterated dairies.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.100 align:middle line:90%
Maybe start there.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:35.460 align:middle line:84%
And then once you've done
that, what's your next step?

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, maybe go to
your farmer's markets.

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Start collecting,
hunting, and gathering

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:41.640 align:middle line:90%
at your farmers' markets.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.190 align:middle line:84%
And talk to your
farmers and talk

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.830 align:middle line:84%
to the people that are
getting that food in-- that

00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:48.690 align:middle line:84%
would probably be a
really good thing.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.700 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: To start to know where
your food's actually coming?

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:51.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Exactly.

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.545 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: What processes
it's going through?

00:38:53.545 --> 00:38:55.230 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: My belief
is if you are not

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:56.980 align:middle line:84%
interested in the
production of your food,

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:59.920 align:middle line:84%
you're not interested
in your health.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.930 align:middle line:84%
Really, that is a
big belief of mine,

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.020 align:middle line:84%
is that when you understand
where this food is coming from

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.900 align:middle line:84%
and the love that
farmer has for the land,

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and that he's not throwing
Roundup, killing the soil,

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.760 align:middle line:84%
killing the microbiota
of the soil,

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:18.910 align:middle line:84%
of our microbiome-- this is
our soil, we carry it with us.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:22.120 align:middle line:84%
The plants have to have
their soil, as well.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.150 align:middle line:84%
You kill the microorganisms
in that soil,

00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:29.590 align:middle line:84%
you kill the ability for
that plant to be healthy,

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.920 align:middle line:84%
just as you kill our soil,
you kill the ability for us

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.240 align:middle line:90%
to be healthy.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:35.800 align:middle line:84%
So I would say,
number two, start

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.900 align:middle line:90%
doing the farmers' markets.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Then you start to
eat seasonally.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And number three, what
would be my number--

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:49.930 align:middle line:84%
maybe make things from
scratch, because once you

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.180 align:middle line:84%
start to do those, you're
going to have to make things

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.203 align:middle line:90%
from scratch anyway.

00:39:53.203 --> 00:39:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And you knowing where
your food's coming from,

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.220 align:middle line:84%
so that's going
to happen anyway.

00:39:57.220 --> 00:40:00.370 align:middle line:84%
I think become educated
would be number three.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Understand what's
happening out there.

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.650 align:middle line:90%


00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Look at more of these summits.

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:08.560 align:middle line:90%
Listen to more of these summits.

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.640 align:middle line:90%
And become educated.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And don't be somebody who
has willful blindness.

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And willful blindness
is information

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.270 align:middle line:84%
that you should know,
that's out there,

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:21.603 align:middle line:84%
but somehow, you
manage not to know.

00:40:21.603 --> 00:40:23.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of willful
blindness happening out

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:27.430 align:middle line:84%
there at the moment in
our medical community,

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.370 align:middle line:90%
in our food industry.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Willful blindness is
actually a legal term.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:34.235 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:40:34.235 --> 00:40:34.960 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Wow.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about
taking accountability

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:37.937 align:middle line:90%
and responsibility.

00:40:37.937 --> 00:40:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Definitely.

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:40.687 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: And not sitting
in that, as you say,

00:40:40.687 --> 00:40:42.030 align:middle line:90%
willful blindness.

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.200 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of
the biggest messages

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.870 align:middle line:84%
is what we've spoken
about, is that there

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:51.310 align:middle line:84%
are some simple things that we
can start doing today to help

00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:55.210 align:middle line:84%
improve the diet, to
improve the microbiome,

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:58.510 align:middle line:84%
to help us therefore improve
and stabilize our mood,

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:01.450 align:middle line:84%
to manage our anxiety
levels more effectively.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And that it doesn't
have to be complicated.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And that there are
some simple things

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:07.765 align:middle line:90%
we can do to help ourselves.

00:41:07.765 --> 00:41:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: And I think
it's one step at a time.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:09.920 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Yep.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.050 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: So if
someone's feeling a bit

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:13.690 align:middle line:84%
overwhelmed right now, because
I've talked about water supply

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and where do we get our foods
from, all you have to do

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.840 align:middle line:84%
is go, OK, well, what
can I change right now?

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:21.100 align:middle line:90%
This week, what can I do?

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:24.460 align:middle line:84%
And it might be as simple as
throwing the white salt out

00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and bringing in some
salt that's unrefined,

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.110 align:middle line:84%
such as our beautiful
Himalayan sea salts.

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.810 align:middle line:84%
Or they're not sea, but they're
crystal salts, so rock salts.

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So bringing in
something like that.

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.075 align:middle line:84%
It may be as easy as
saying, hey, you know what?

00:41:36.075 --> 00:41:37.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to change
my breakfast.

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:42.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to have breakfast
cereals, which we know,

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.200 align:middle line:84%
actually, we know that it
increases our serotonin levels,

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.820 align:middle line:84%
which is the calming, I
really don't do too much, I

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.220 align:middle line:84%
can actually have a little
bit of a sleep right now,

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.570 align:middle line:90%
neurotransmitter.

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:55.900 align:middle line:84%
As opposed to proteins that
increase dopamine, which

00:41:55.900 --> 00:41:58.090 align:middle line:84%
is your get up and go,
I want to be motivated,

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.290 align:middle line:84%
I want to do things
neurotransmitter.

00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:04.080 align:middle line:84%
So when you say, well,
let me just start there.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:05.080 align:middle line:90%
That's all I need to do.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's change your salt,
or maybe change your breakfast.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.940 align:middle line:84%
Why don't I actually look at
the milk that I'm drinking?

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Is it pasteurized, homogenized,
skim trimmed, rev shaped,

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.010 align:middle line:84%
or can I buy a milk
that's less processed?

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:17.412 align:middle line:84%
Remember, it's not the
food that's the problem.

00:42:17.412 --> 00:42:19.120 align:middle line:84%
It's what they've done
to the food that's

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.330 align:middle line:90%
the biggest problem of all.

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Yeah.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Quality.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:22.190 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Quality.

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:24.220 align:middle line:84%
It's about quality,
not quantity.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Absolutely.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:29.050 align:middle line:84%
As I've learned myself, when
you really qualify the quality,

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.780 align:middle line:84%
you actually just don't
need as much, you know?

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: And you're
not counting calories.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.750 align:middle line:90%
You need to do all that stuff.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:36.550 align:middle line:90%
It's just quality.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: Yeah, that's another
really big one, as well,

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.650 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:41.740 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:43.930 align:middle line:84%
You know, so many
things I'd love

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:46.667 align:middle line:84%
to talk to you about
further, and we will.

00:42:46.667 --> 00:42:48.250 align:middle line:84%
We'll have other
opportunities that we

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:51.850 align:middle line:84%
can touch on other things that,
again, come back to, relate

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:55.580 align:middle line:84%
to, how we can manage our mood
and our state of well-being.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I do have one last
question to ask you.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're asking this of all
of our wonderful speakers.

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And the main reason for this is
because all of our philosophers

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:06.710 align:middle line:84%
over time have said the
same thing, and that is--

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.190 align:middle line:84%
and neuroscience is
now validating it--

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:13.840 align:middle line:84%
and that is that we come to
believe what we tell ourselves,

00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.330 align:middle line:84%
and our brain believes
what we tell it.

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:19.960 align:middle line:84%
And the-- I know what
a wonderful lover

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.790 align:middle line:84%
you are of Wayne Dyer, and
he lived by the statement of,

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:25.810 align:middle line:84%
"I am", and what
we tell ourselves

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and what we reaffirm
to ourselves.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And how through the power
of the "I am" statement,

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:34.330 align:middle line:84%
we are affecting the
epigenetics of ourselves.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So what would be
literally your "I am".

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:38.440 align:middle line:84%
If you woke up every
morning, and you

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:42.460 align:middle line:84%
had to program yourself, what
would the "I am" programming

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.620 align:middle line:90%
be?

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:46.840 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Wow.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:51.940 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was brought
up knowing this.

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.310 align:middle line:84%
My dad was teaching
me this at 15.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:56.710 align:middle line:84%
He introduced me to
Wayne Dyer in the '70s,

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:58.730 align:middle line:90%
when I was a teenager.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:02.900 align:middle line:84%
So I was brought up
doing this all the time.

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.900 align:middle line:84%
And I know I've tried to
teach my children that.

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But there are many
people out there

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.460 align:middle line:84%
that are brought up with
their parents yelling at them,

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:16.200 align:middle line:84%
or telling them you're no
good, or things like that.

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.380 align:middle line:90%
So for me, I just know.

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I know who I am
as a human being.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:27.570 align:middle line:90%
I know my capacity to be great.

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.010 align:middle line:84%
And I don't say
that egotistically.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I say that because who
are we to play small?

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:34.690 align:middle line:90%
We must play great.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:36.070 align:middle line:90%
And if we're not--

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:37.840 align:middle line:90%
if we have this thing--

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and Melissa Ambrosini
calls it the "mean girl."

00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's that girl that's
going, "you can't do that."

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.360 align:middle line:84%
In your own mind,
you're saying this.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.960 align:middle line:84%
Whereas I don't think that
way, because I've been

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.940 align:middle line:90%
trained to think differently.

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And to change that, I think
it's a matter of that you

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.898 align:middle line:84%
have to get up in
the morning and you

00:44:56.898 --> 00:44:57.940 align:middle line:90%
have to have a statement.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And maybe it's a written
statement, that you write down.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.430 align:middle line:90%
And I am great.

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:04.363 align:middle line:90%
Why not I am great?

00:45:04.363 --> 00:45:05.780 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: On your
bathroom mirror?

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Yeah, exactly.

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.260 align:middle line:90%
Why not?

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.620 align:middle line:90%
I am great.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's-- it
can be as simple as that.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:17.060 align:middle line:84%
My brother's very much into
the emotional part of health.

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And he did a documentary called
"What ate my mother and will

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:22.660 align:middle line:90%
it eat me?"

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.450 align:middle line:84%
And it was all about
the emotional health

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:28.180 align:middle line:84%
of our mother, who ate
beautifully, did everything

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.450 align:middle line:84%
right, yet died of lung cancer
without a smoke in her hand,

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:34.410 align:middle line:90%
ever, at the age of 69.

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.890 align:middle line:84%
And so he really gets
into that emotion.

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:39.130 align:middle line:84%
And whenever we're
having a discussion,

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the food,
he's talking about the emotion.

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:44.600 align:middle line:90%
So both are so, so important.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:49.780 align:middle line:84%
So to answer the question
succinctly now, "I am great".

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to
stop playing small,

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.725 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
serving the world

00:45:53.725 --> 00:45:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and we're not serving human
beings if we play small.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.270 align:middle line:90%
And I don't intend--

00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.910 align:middle line:84%
>>JOANNA: We're not
destined for small.

00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:59.618 align:middle line:84%
>>CYNDI: No, I don't
intend to play small

00:45:59.618 --> 00:46:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and I never wanted
to play small.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, I didn't know
whether I had that ability.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:05.770 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:09.770 align:middle line:84%
I don't have that
ability to do everything.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I have an
amazing team behind me.

00:46:12.370 --> 00:46:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Like, my husband is one of my
most amazing team behind me.

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.970 align:middle line:90%
And my girlfriends are there.

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And my team that I work
with are in my company.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.690 align:middle line:90%
My husband and my company--

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:28.510 align:middle line:84%
that's who are great
and who are amazing.

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And they're just-- we
prop each other up.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
thing I think is--

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.150 align:middle line:84%
make sure you're
being propped up.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.310 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of anything that's
not propping you up.

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:36.820 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Yeah.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:37.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:38.072 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Yeah.

00:46:38.072 --> 00:46:38.454 align:middle line:90%
>>JOANNA: Perfect.

00:46:38.454 --> 00:46:39.220 align:middle line:90%
Perfect.

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:40.020 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.020 align:middle line:90%
I am great.

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.100 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.778 align:middle line:84%
Cyndi, thank you so
much for joining us.

00:46:43.778 --> 00:46:45.070 align:middle line:90%
It's been an absolute pleasure.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your wealth
of knowledge and wisdom

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:50.930 align:middle line:84%
and for helping our audience
navigate through their path.

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:52.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CYNDI: Thank you.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:57.000 align:middle line:90%
