00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:04.980 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:13.970 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Therese, thank you so much.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.340 align:middle line:84%
Very warm welcome, and thank
you so much for joining us.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.393 align:middle line:84%
It's a pleasure
to have you here.

00:00:21.393 --> 00:00:23.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it's my
pleasure to be here.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm really excited to be here.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.213 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:27.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you're welcome.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.860 align:middle line:84%
You're a wealth of
knowledge, and the work

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.500 align:middle line:84%
that you're doing out
there in educating

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.770 align:middle line:84%
the young women and families
and mothers of today

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.200 align:middle line:84%
for what they need to
know is so important.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very excited
about our chat today.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, when we're looking
at depression and anxiety,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.940 align:middle line:84%
often we, perhaps,
more think towards what

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.080 align:middle line:84%
we put into our bodies,
first and foremostly.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.780 align:middle line:84%
But what we are now coming to
realize in research for quite

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:84%
some time is that what
we put on our bodies

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.030 align:middle line:84%
is as important as what
we put in our bodies

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
and that a good 60%
to 65% of our skin

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.230 align:middle line:90%
will absorb whatever we put on.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.280 align:middle line:90%
>> So I guess what I'd love to--

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.200 align:middle line:84%
before we get into
the nitty gritty,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.070 align:middle line:84%
because I know we're
going to do that--

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>> We will.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:17.770 align:middle line:90%
>> We will.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Can you just share a
little bit about what

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.850 align:middle line:84%
got you so passionate
about the journey

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.060 align:middle line:84%
into cosmetics and
the environment

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and how that's
affecting our health?

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.990 align:middle line:84%
In 2001, I had
tumors in my spleen

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and had to have
my spleen removed,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.250 align:middle line:84%
and that was a
turning point for me.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.070 align:middle line:84%
In 1995, I had endometriosis
so bad, which is so common now.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:84%
All of the endocrine-disrupting
disorders are so common.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.010 align:middle line:90%
I had it back in 1995.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
I always wanted
four children, but I

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:50.890 align:middle line:90%
couldn't have four children.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I could only have two, and I
have two beautiful children,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Maddie and Miranda, and
they are just my gift.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But when I had
tumors in my spleen,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.230 align:middle line:84%
I started questioning, well,
what have I done to my body?

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
What could I have
done to my body

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
to have my body react in
the way that it did to have

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.960 align:middle line:90%
me have tumors in my spleen?

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I started
searching what I was actually

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:84%
putting on my body and the
impact of that, what chemicals

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:90%
were in those products.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.320 align:middle line:84%
Also, I started looking at
the pesticides, insecticides,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.990 align:middle line:84%
and the impact of
those on my body,

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.360 align:middle line:84%
and my life has
never been the same.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So you sort of used yourself
as a science experiment,

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.840 align:middle line:84%
really, to really start looking
at what kind of products were

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.300 align:middle line:84%
in your home and your
environment that you were

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:90%
starting to use.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, definitely.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So first of all, when we
start to look at products that

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
we put on and we start to
categorize things as personal

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.940 align:middle line:84%
care, what kind of products
come under that kind of personal

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:90%
hygiene, personal care?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So personal care is your
deodorant, your toothpaste,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:84%
mouth rinse, hand sanitizer,
body wash, hand wash,

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.460 align:middle line:84%
hand and body lotion, foot
balm, basically any products,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:90%
even under your cosmetics.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.520 align:middle line:84%
So the cosmetics industry,
which is a broader--

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.080 align:middle line:84%
which the personal care
section comes under.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So the cosmetics is
a broader category,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.160 align:middle line:90%
and it covers basically candles.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.570 align:middle line:90%
It covers baby care.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.570 align:middle line:84%
It covers men's products,
women's products,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:90%
all those sorts of products.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.710 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
the cosmetics industry

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.860 align:middle line:84%
is self-regulating, and what
that means is the cosmetics

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
industry or the people who make
the products are the ones who

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.010 align:middle line:84%
determine whether or not
the products are safe,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.430 align:middle line:90%
which is ludicrous.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:90%
We have to change that.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.960 align:middle line:84%
So when I had
tumors in my spleen,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I reached out to
Bill Statham, who

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.980 align:middle line:84%
is the author of
"The Chemical Maze."

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
He's one of the world's
leading researchers in regard

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.100 align:middle line:84%
to chemicals and their
impacts, and we've

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.450 align:middle line:90%
been friends ever since.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.090 align:middle line:84%
And what I found and
what I've continued

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.110 align:middle line:84%
to find working with not only
Bill but with Professor Marc

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.990 align:middle line:84%
Cohen from the RMIT
University-- who is just

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.050 align:middle line:84%
the most amazing man and
he's a medical doctor,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.880 align:middle line:84%
a traditional Chinese medicine
doctor, a professor of wellness

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.080 align:middle line:90%
in Australia.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And working with those
two amazing men and also

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Sarah Lantz--

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.140 align:middle line:84%
her research and her book,
"Chemical Free Kids,"

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.990 align:middle line:90%
it's just amazing.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Her research that she did at
the University of Queensland

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.740 align:middle line:84%
was just phenomenal
on newborn babies

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.180 align:middle line:84%
and the chemicals in
their little bodies.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So that's why I started
this journey is--

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.800 align:middle line:84%
and when I actually had
tumors in my spleen,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't find personal
care or skincare, toothpaste

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.400 align:middle line:84%
that I really liked,
and there were

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.400 align:middle line:84%
very minimal certified
organic products out there.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that were,
I didn't actually like.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And my goal is to prevent
what happened to me

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.150 align:middle line:90%
from happening to other people.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we've released--
even though my goal, really,

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.930 align:middle line:84%
is to educate, we've
released products

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:84%
to provide or to fill
the need as such,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.990 align:middle line:84%
because if we don't
provide products,

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.340 align:middle line:90%
then the education is lost.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.420 align:middle line:84%
So if we start to
look at specifically--

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at depression
and anxiety and neurotoxins.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.000 align:middle line:84%
So if we started to look
at the various products

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.410 align:middle line:84%
out there, the
everyday products,

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.380 align:middle line:84%
whether they're shaving cream,
moisturizers, all the way down

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.870 align:middle line:84%
to cosmetics and
makeup, what are

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
the sort of key chemicals
within those products that are,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.390 align:middle line:84%
number one, highly neurotoxic
that could actually

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.370 align:middle line:84%
be contributing to someone's
experience of mood changes

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:84%
or coping with
anxiety, as an example?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.200 align:middle line:84%
So there's many, many
chemicals out there

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.110 align:middle line:84%
that are known neurotoxins
as well as immunotoxins

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and basigins and
endocrine disruptors

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and taratogens, which means
that they cause birth defects.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.820 align:middle line:84%
Neurotoxic chemicals
are in the majority

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:84%
of our skincare products and
our personal care products.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.120 align:middle line:84%
So propylene glycol
is a classic chemical

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:90%
that is known to be neurotoxic.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.190 align:middle line:84%
We have fluoride
in our toothpaste.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The studies that Professor
Grandjean and Dr. Landrigan

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:84%
have done in relation to autism
and the link between fluoride

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and, actually, another
10 chemicals in autism

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:25.990 align:middle line:90%
is just phenomenal.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And I recommend that
everybody actually

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.800 align:middle line:84%
gets a copy of that research,
and it's continued research.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
They've continued to
look at the neurotoxins.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:84%
So you also have the pesticides,
organophosphates in particular,

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:90%
that are neurotoxic.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.340 align:middle line:84%
You have sodium
benzoate, which is

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.680 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of our
everyday products.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.850 align:middle line:84%
You have, as I said,
fluoride as well.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.650 align:middle line:84%
There's many, many chemicals
that are known neurotoxins,

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.780 align:middle line:84%
and I could rattle on for
weeks in regard to that.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:59.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So for a mother, let's say,
at the supermarket and when you

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.970 align:middle line:84%
look at the backs
of the ingredients,

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.050 align:middle line:84%
many of them I can't
even pronounce.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.850 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Most people can't.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.727 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, that's an
indication straight away.

00:07:08.727 --> 00:07:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I can't pronounce it,
then best I don't ingest it.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Are there certain-- to
try and guide our audience

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
to the number one things
to stay away from,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:84%
because everything is a rainbow
bridge towards making healthier

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:90%
choice.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally.

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And as much as at
first it might be daunting

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:84%
an overwhelming to strip
your entire house of all

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.780 align:middle line:84%
the chemicals that you use or
all of your personal products,

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.050 align:middle line:84%
where can we start making some
steps in the right direction

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.180 align:middle line:90%
towards reducing those toxins?

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it really comes back
to the exposure level that

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:50.250 align:middle line:90%
you're placing on your body.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:84%
So you mentioned earlier
about the 60% absorption

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:90%
on your skin.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, our skin--
research is showing

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.550 align:middle line:84%
that our skin will absorb
chemicals up to 10 times

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.620 align:middle line:84%
faster than by way of
ingestion, and that's

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:84%
because our skin doesn't
have digestive enzymes

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.270 align:middle line:84%
available to break
the chemicals down,

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.670 align:middle line:84%
nor does it have the
further purification

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:90%
process of the liver.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.530 align:middle line:84%
So when you're putting
a chemical on your body

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.440 align:middle line:84%
or products on your body
that contain chemicals,

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.140 align:middle line:84%
you want to ensure
that you are minimizing

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.290 align:middle line:84%
that risk or that
chemical burden every day.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.760 align:middle line:84%
The different exposure levels--
for example, hand and body

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.560 align:middle line:90%
lotion.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.320 align:middle line:84%
Anything that you're leaving
on the exposure level is great.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Anything you're
putting in your mouth,

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.713 align:middle line:84%
the exposure level is great,
as well, because of the mucous

00:08:32.713 --> 00:08:35.130 align:middle line:84%
membranes under the tongue
will allow immediate absorption

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:84%
into the bloodstream
and into the organs.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Any product with the
word "fragrance" in it--

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:84%
now, fragrance is what we
call a cluster ingredient.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
these are chemicals--

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.570 align:middle line:84%
that one word, or that one
ingredient on the label,

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:53.880 align:middle line:84%
it falls under the
IP of a company.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.480 align:middle line:84%
So they can put any
chemical in that product

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and list it as that
one ingredient,

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.350 align:middle line:84%
and you never know
what's in it now--

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> --which is just crazy.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Now, Dr. Carol Hungerford states
that the number one gender

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:84%
bender in all of the
chemicals is fragrance.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Fragrance normally
consists of DMDM hydantoin,

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:15.210 align:middle line:84%
which is a
formaldehyde-releasing

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.350 align:middle line:90%
chemical.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.980 align:middle line:84%
Alcohol denatured is often
found in fragrance, as well.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And fragrances, also,
they contain phthalate.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
So every fragrance tested by the
EWG, the Environmental Working

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.410 align:middle line:84%
Group, was found to
contain phthalates.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, phthalates are potent
endocrine-disrupting chemicals,

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:37.560 align:middle line:84%
but they're also
highly neurotoxic.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what sort of disease
have they been either linked

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.970 align:middle line:90%
to or found associated to?

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, lots.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.940 align:middle line:84%
The World Health Organization
report in 2012 where they

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.560 align:middle line:84%
actually asked scientists from
around the world to identify

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
endocrine-disrupting
chemicals and their impacts--

00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
so they have created a 284-page
document, and I've read it,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and the summary of
that actual document

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:07.110 align:middle line:84%
is that male semen
quality has dropped 40%.

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Genital malformation in baby
boys has increased by 400%.

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:17.220 align:middle line:84%
That preterm and pregnancies
that aren't going full term are

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:21.030 align:middle line:84%
at an all-time high, as are our
everyday endocrine-disrupting

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:84%
disorders, which are
thyroid problem--

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.240 align:middle line:84%
everyone knows somebody
with a thyroid problem--

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.600 align:middle line:84%
PCOS, polycystic ovarian
syndrome, endometriosis.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Infertility is at
an all-time high.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.670 align:middle line:84%
Breast, ovarian,
testicular cancer

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:39.780 align:middle line:84%
falls under the
endocrine-disrupting disorders,

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and then we have
early onset puberty.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:84%
So young women, young girls
as young as seven and eight

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.700 align:middle line:90%
are now going through puberty.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
early onset menopause

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
where there are women-- and
I speak to them regularly--

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.010 align:middle line:84%
who are 26, 27, 28 going
through early onset menopause.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:84%
And I have a network of
wellness practitioners

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.200 align:middle line:90%
who see these people regularly.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.300 align:middle line:84%
So in answer to your
question, in relation

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:84%
to what type of disorders,
that's what they are.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.430 align:middle line:90%
And our endocrine system--

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.670 align:middle line:84%
why our endocrine system
is so important-- and first

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.470 align:middle line:84%
of all, what it
actually consists of

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
is our ovaries,
our testes in men,

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
our adrenals, our pancreas,
our thyroid, our parathyroid,

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:24.340 align:middle line:84%
our pineal, hypothalamus,
and pituitary glands.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So it is the tuning
fork for the body.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:84%
It basically sends signals
out to just about every cell

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:90%
in the body.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.590 align:middle line:84%
It regulates our hormones,
it regulates our metabolism,

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:37.170 align:middle line:84%
and it controls our
hormone development.

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So when you're putting
endocrine-disrupting chemicals,

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:84%
which are also known to be
neurotoxic, on your body

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and, therefore,
in your body, you

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.410 align:middle line:84%
are putting chemicals that
are mimicking your hormones

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
in your body, causing
your endocrine system

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:90%
to short circuit.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.160 align:middle line:90%
That's what's happening.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.580 align:middle line:84%
So you're having xenoestrogens
in your body sending forth

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.580 align:middle line:90%
signaling.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Now, the challenge is--

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:84%
you heard me mention genital
malformation in little baby

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.530 align:middle line:90%
boys.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
So that's alarming, the
fact that our baby boys are

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.540 align:middle line:84%
being feminized by the
xenoestrogens, the estrogen

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:90%
dominance of their mom.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And how that happens is that
most women don't understand

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:22.860 align:middle line:84%
that when we are pregnant, we
pass our fat-soluble chemicals

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.320 align:middle line:90%
down to our children in utero.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.968 align:middle line:84%
And another way that we pass
our fat-soluble chemicals

00:12:27.968 --> 00:12:29.760 align:middle line:84%
to our children is
through our breast milk.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.360 align:middle line:84%
And yes, breast milk is by
far the best thing for a baby.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.390 align:middle line:84%
However, we need
to clean our body

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and get our body
rid of the chemicals

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.220 align:middle line:84%
first before we pass them
down to our children.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.580 align:middle line:84%
And when babies are being
born estrogen dominant

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.610 align:middle line:84%
during critical
phase of development,

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.760 align:middle line:84%
their endocrine system
is being impacted

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.430 align:middle line:84%
by these endocrine-disrupting
chemicals

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.660 align:middle line:84%
and causing these challenges
in the genital malformation

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.860 align:middle line:90%
of these little baby boys.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that,
just so as I can explain it,

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.410 align:middle line:84%
is that the testes aren't
dropping in a little boy.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.210 align:middle line:84%
The penis isn't growing or the
tip of the penis, for example,

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.460 align:middle line:90%
isn't on the tip of the penis.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:09.870 align:middle line:90%
It's on a different section.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is becoming--

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.740 align:middle line:84%
as I said, the World
Health Organization report

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.590 align:middle line:84%
has said it has
increased by 400%.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.930 align:middle line:84%
We have to do
something about that.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.200 align:middle line:84%
And believe me, it's not just
little boys who are impacted.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.470 align:middle line:84%
You can't have estrogen
dominance in any child

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:30.600 align:middle line:84%
or any baby in utero
because there is an impact.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.070 align:middle line:84%
Over dominance in estrogen
will result in early onset

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:38.850 align:middle line:84%
puberty, PCOS, endometriosis,
all of these challenge

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:39.860 align:middle line:90%
that we're now seeing--

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:84%
infertility-- that
we're now seeing

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.330 align:middle line:90%
in our younger generation.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And we have allowed,
basically, untested chemicals

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to be used in our cosmetics
by a self-regulating cosmetics

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:middle line:84%
industry, and we are now
seeing the results of that.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So you said a moment ago,
the importance of-- and I just--

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:05.130 align:middle line:84%
to clarify for the audience
in terms of fat-soluble toxins

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:84%
and why it's so important
for us to understand

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.215 align:middle line:84%
the implication of
the fat-soluble toxins

00:14:10.215 --> 00:14:14.600 align:middle line:84%
is because the body actually
stores toxins in our fat cells.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.400 align:middle line:90%
Is that correct?

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:22.435 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is that our
bodies are becoming so toxic.

00:14:22.435 --> 00:14:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Marc Cohen, Professor Marc
Cohen, and I were on the radio

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.870 align:middle line:84%
recently speaking
about this, and he

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:31.860 align:middle line:84%
was sharing that our bodies have
become so toxic that our bodies

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.060 align:middle line:90%
can't get rid of--

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.460 align:middle line:84%
they can't physically
get rid of the toxins

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:84%
or the toxic exposure
within our bodies.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So as opposed to storing those
chemicals in our vital organs

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.390 align:middle line:84%
or, because these are
fat-soluble chemicals,

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:48.660 align:middle line:84%
in our brain, which is a
high percentage of fat, what

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.240 align:middle line:84%
our body will do
will actually cause

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:56.010 align:middle line:84%
us to put on fat to
store those chemicals in.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And then we have other
forms of chemicals,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.530 align:middle line:84%
which are, again,
endocrine-disrupting chemicals,

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.870 align:middle line:90%
but are also obesogenic.

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So they cause our fat
cells to multiply.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:12.270 align:middle line:84%
They reprogram our cells
to become fat cells.

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.205 align:middle line:84%
And we have babies
being born-- research

00:15:14.205 --> 00:15:15.930 align:middle line:84%
is showing we have
babies being born

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.880 align:middle line:84%
with more fat cells in their
little bodies than ever before.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:26.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so before we start talking
about some really doable

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.420 align:middle line:84%
solutions, I just want
to address the fact of,

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
as you say, we're
self-regulating.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:37.380 align:middle line:84%
We have these
companies out there,

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.010 align:middle line:84%
these cosmetic
companies, that literally

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:84%
can put whatever they
want into an ingredient,

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:47.700 align:middle line:84%
and until it's proven
otherwise, there's

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.620 align:middle line:84%
no legislation for pre-testing
of that chemical that

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.680 align:middle line:90%
goes into the ingredient.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
No pre-market testing, no
health testing in regard

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:00.600 align:middle line:84%
to those ingredients, as such,
and they can be inserted or put

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.150 align:middle line:84%
into any formulation
on the basis they're

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:04.830 align:middle line:90%
safe until proven otherwise.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, the REACH program in
Europe has been introduced.

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:11.130 align:middle line:84%
That was introduced
in around 2004.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's been around
for a little while.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And what they've done is they've
actually stopped that process.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:84%
They've actually
said, no, we are not

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.930 align:middle line:84%
going to allow cosmetic
companies to continue

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.750 align:middle line:84%
to put chemicals in
products on the basis

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.640 align:middle line:84%
that they're safe
until proven otherwise.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.040 align:middle line:84%
We are going to hold
them to account,

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and we are not allowing them to
put chemicals into the products

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:34.290 align:middle line:84%
unless they're
proven to be safe.

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:36.660 align:middle line:84%
My goal is to bring
that to this country,

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.330 align:middle line:84%
and we're creating a
petition around that,

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:90%
and it'll be a call for change.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.130 align:middle line:84%
As fate would have it, I sat
next to the Assistant Shadow

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Minister for Health,
Stephen Jones, on a flight,

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:84%
and he was my captive audience,
and we talked for a long time,

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.940 align:middle line:84%
and I'm working with him
to ban animal testing.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.000 align:middle line:84%
And also, I've been
speaking to him

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.420 align:middle line:84%
about bringing the REACH program
from Europe to Australia.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.880 align:middle line:84%
So we're in the process of
putting all of this together,

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.764 align:middle line:90%
which is very exciting.

00:17:05.764 --> 00:17:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It's--

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.589 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's so needed.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.660 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so-- that's exactly
what I was going to say.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.460 align:middle line:90%
It's exciting.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:84%
It's so needed, because
it's not like we

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:84%
need any further evidence that
these chemicals are actually

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.119 align:middle line:90%
impacting our health.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, I often wonder,
how far do we have to go

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:31.290 align:middle line:84%
in the proving of their
association or the cause before

00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
industry bodies are actually
prepared to intervene and put

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:84%
some sort of protocol in place
whereby these chemicals are

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.060 align:middle line:90%
tested?

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what we need to do.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I do a lot of work
with Professor Marc Cohen.

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And even so much as the
chemicals that are-- even

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.590 align:middle line:84%
though the incidence
of autism, you

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:54.960 align:middle line:84%
look at that, where
we're at today.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So Professor Marc
Cohen, who is my age,

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.490 align:middle line:90%
he qualified for med school.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.550 align:middle line:84%
At that time, there was one in
10,000 children in Australia

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:90%
had autism.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.150 align:middle line:90%
It's now one in 100.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So I'm an ambassador
for MIND Foundation,

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:13.080 align:middle line:84%
and MIND Foundation is the
treatment and prevention

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:84%
of autism and autistic
spectrum disorders.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:84%
In America, the official
rate of autism is one in 66.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:23.160 align:middle line:84%
We have professors who work
with the MIND Foundation who

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.080 align:middle line:84%
are saying, by 2025, if we
keep going the way we're going,

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:84%
it'll be one in two children
who will have autism.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that
don't will be the ones

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that remove the environmental
toxins from their lives.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's not just
about what we're putting--

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not just about what
we're putting on our skin.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:84%
It's about the organophosphates,
the glyphosates that

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.770 align:middle line:84%
are impacting our gut
health, and that's

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.830 align:middle line:84%
a big thing with children with
autism, as well, and autistic

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.090 align:middle line:90%
spectrum disorders.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.890 align:middle line:84%
We have to get their
gut health right.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.960 align:middle line:90%
And I take a holistic approach.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.450 align:middle line:84%
I live and breathe
certified organic.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And I just-- that's who I am
and sharing the benefits of that

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.020 align:middle line:84%
and educating as
to the benefits.

00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And the crazy thing is
that food never used

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:08.760 align:middle line:90%
to have to be called organic.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.560 align:middle line:90%
It just was.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:90%
>> It just was.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.550 align:middle line:84%
>> And now we are having to call
food organic because chemicals

00:19:14.550 --> 00:19:19.650 align:middle line:84%
have become so commonplace, and
we need to go back to nature,

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:84%
not only for the health
of ourselves, our kid,

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:25.710 align:middle line:84%
future generations, but
also for our planet.

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:29.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And I find that there are
some people out there today who

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:84%
look at organic and think
it's some sort of extreme way

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:84%
of sourcing our food, yet it
is the way we always have.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:40.930 align:middle line:90%
That's how it used to be.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle line:90%
That's how it is naturally.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yes.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Chemicals aren't natural.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.940 align:middle line:84%
They're petroleum derived
or pesticide ridden,

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.290 align:middle line:90%
and they're not natural.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Natural is organic, but there's
a huge misrepresentation

00:19:53.730 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:84%
in relation to the use
of the word "organic."

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.470 align:middle line:84%
So in this country and in most
countries around the world,

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:00.690 align:middle line:84%
a company can claim
something is organic

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:02.640 align:middle line:84%
if it has one
natural ingredient,

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.860 align:middle line:84%
but it may contain
hundreds of chemicals

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:06.870 align:middle line:90%
and still be classed as organic.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.480 align:middle line:84%
So for people, the
unsuspecting consumer

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.420 align:middle line:84%
will go looking for a
healthy alternative,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.000 align:middle line:84%
but, unfortunately,
they are misled

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.150 align:middle line:84%
by what we call greenwashing,
companies pretending

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
to create products
that are healthy when,

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.790 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the majority
of the products

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:84%
out there that are pretending
to be healthy and/or say organic

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.140 align:middle line:90%
are far from healthy.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are well
known in health food stores.

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I've had to educate
health food store

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:36.150 align:middle line:84%
owners as to what
certified organic really is

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.110 align:middle line:90%
or what organic really is.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
And there's companies that have
well-known brands out there

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:44.280 align:middle line:84%
that contain cocamidopropyl
betaine, phenoxyethanol,

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:48.690 align:middle line:84%
sodium benzoate, lots and
lots of nasty chemicals.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:84%
Yes, they may be a safer option
and it may be a transition,

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.780 align:middle line:84%
but they still
have the chemicals.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:58.650 align:middle line:84%
Phenoxyethanol, for example, is
known to cause liver and kidney

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.650 align:middle line:84%
damage, known to be
a reproductive toxin,

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:84%
known to be a neurotoxin,
known to be damaging

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.090 align:middle line:90%
to our entire endocrine system.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's in most of the
healthy products out there.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.140 align:middle line:84%
So the key is understanding
what organic really

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
is, and the only true
organic is certified organic.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And for a product to
be certified organic,

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
it has to say "certified
organic" on the front

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and it has to have a logo
of a reputable company.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.980 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
some companies

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.243 align:middle line:84%
will make up their own
logo, and it's not--

00:21:31.243 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Create their
own certification.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and when it says
"made with" or "contains,"

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.780 align:middle line:84%
it's also made with chemicals
or also contains chemicals.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.510 align:middle line:84%
It can only say "certified
organic," not "made with,"

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.890 align:middle line:90%
not "contains."

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're the ambassador for
Australian Organic Association.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:51.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you tell us a little
bit about the rigidity

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.990 align:middle line:90%
of their certification?

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So ACO, I believe,
are the most--

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.440 align:middle line:84%
well, we know they're the
most stringent in Australia

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and I believe fast
becoming recognized

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:02.340 align:middle line:90%
as that around the world.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.820 align:middle line:84%
With certification, it
requires pre-planting

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.800 align:middle line:84%
before any pre-planning
of the soil.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.760 align:middle line:84%
The soil cannot be used for
any ingredients or any farming

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.460 align:middle line:84%
for four years,
and it is tested.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.490 align:middle line:84%
They do random audits,
and every step of the way

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
has full traceability in
relation to chemicals.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have to keep the arduous
records in regard to it.

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing
is that it really--

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:33.320 align:middle line:84%
it has this stringent
strictness about it,

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:84%
but it is what we need because
it's a consumer's guarantee

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:84%
that the products don't
contain those nasty chemicals,

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:84%
that the products-- even
the manufacturing processes

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.650 align:middle line:84%
of some of the formulations
in relation to our cosmetics

00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:50.640 align:middle line:90%
are known to be carcinogenic.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So ethoxylation is linked
to carcinogenic activity.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So even everything to do with
the certification process

00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:59.480 align:middle line:84%
is managed, right
from pre-planning

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.750 align:middle line:84%
of the soil all the
way through to retail,

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.340 align:middle line:84%
and there's traceability
all the way through.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's a
consumer's guarantee.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:07.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.080 align:middle line:84%
OK, so that's one to
definitely look out for.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.760 align:middle line:84%
In answer to your previous
question about people

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:16.850 align:middle line:84%
making the switch,
toothpaste is definitely

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:84%
one area that people need
to switch, also deodorant,

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.710 align:middle line:84%
because what you put
under your arms, basically

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:24.740 align:middle line:84%
100% will be absorbed
into your body.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And any ingredient
or any product

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:31.130 align:middle line:84%
with fragrant, fragrance,
in it will be absorbed up

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.330 align:middle line:84%
to 100% within your body, and
that's because what we have is

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:36.830 align:middle line:84%
there are chemicals
that are known--

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.740 align:middle line:84%
penetration enhancers
or absorption enhancers.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.480 align:middle line:90%
Propylene glycol is one.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.570 align:middle line:84%
It's a neurotoxin, as
well, reproductive toxin,

00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:46.980 align:middle line:84%
and it is also a
penetration enhancer,

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:49.940 align:middle line:84%
which causes the other chemicals
to be absorbed quicker.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
understanding that if you

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.570 align:middle line:84%
have the word
"fragrance--" and not

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:84%
only just "fragrance"
in the word

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:01.820 align:middle line:84%
in the product but
also "perfume--"

00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:03.950 align:middle line:90%
is full of chemicals as such.

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Remove those from your life.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Professor Carol Hungerford--
Dr. Carol Hungerford-- sorry--

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.540 align:middle line:90%
states that the one thing--

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:13.310 align:middle line:84%
the very thing a
woman thinks makes

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:15.620 align:middle line:84%
her more feminine,
smelling beautiful,

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.070 align:middle line:84%
is the very thing that's
costing her her femininity.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:90%
What a powerful statement.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:20.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That is--

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:21.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And that's the same for men.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:22.220 align:middle line:84%
>> --an incredibly
powerful statement.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.095 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, men are
becoming more feminized.

00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:26.270 align:middle line:84%
They're getting
the rounded hips.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.220 align:middle line:84%
The increase of
male breast growth

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:32.300 align:middle line:84%
has increased dramatically, and
it's because of the deodorants

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:90%
that they're putting on.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.660 align:middle line:84%
With all of the
fragrance, with all

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.400 align:middle line:84%
of the endocrine-disrupting
chemicals,

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.860 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
immunotoxins, the majority

00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:42.350 align:middle line:84%
of products out
there on the shelf

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:46.190 align:middle line:84%
contain chemicals that are
toxic to the immune system

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:48.830 align:middle line:84%
and as well as
reproductive toxins,

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.720 align:middle line:90%
as well as all of these others.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Teratogens are known to cause
birth defects and embryo

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:54.650 align:middle line:90%
defects.

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:57.080 align:middle line:84%
And your hand
sanitizer that contains

00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:02.330 align:middle line:84%
alcohol denatured as the number
one ingredient is the worst.

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have created
a hand sanitizer

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:07.010 align:middle line:84%
that is lemon myrtle,
which is exactly

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:10.910 align:middle line:84%
the same antibacterial
quality or capability

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:13.640 align:middle line:84%
of any conventional product but
without the nasty chemicals.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.932 align:middle line:90%
>> Without the nasty chemicals.

00:25:14.932 --> 00:25:17.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And lemon myrtle is the
number one antibacterial,

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:20.848 align:middle line:84%
antimicrobial
ingredient of all time.

00:25:20.848 --> 00:25:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>> So do you think that--

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.710 align:middle line:90%
you know, I often wonder--

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
and I was a culprit
of this, as well,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.760 align:middle line:90%
before I educated myself and--

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:84%
>> As we all are-- and
it's the path of learning.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I was a walking,
talking perfume shop.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.630 align:middle line:90%
I used to wear perfume.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:84%
I used to wear concentrated
body wash and body oil and body

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:45.260 align:middle line:84%
lotion, highly fragranced, and
then put perfume all over me.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:48.967 align:middle line:84%
And now, if I've put perfume
near me, I get a headache,

00:25:48.967 --> 00:25:50.050 align:middle line:90%
and my body-- yeah, I've--

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Cleaned up so much--

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:51.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>> --that you realize how
sensitive you are to it.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:55.550 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't mean to cut you off.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, not at all.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:57.710 align:middle line:90%
So I was just--

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.020 align:middle line:84%
I remember back into kind
of how I used to think,

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.860 align:middle line:84%
and one of the
things I used to--

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.350 align:middle line:84%
as a way of denial all
of what I was doing,

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I'd just think to myself, well,
I'm not putting on that much.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.430 align:middle line:84%
It's only a little
bit of lippy or it's

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.750 align:middle line:90%
only one spray of deodorant.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:18.420 align:middle line:90%
It's hardly anything.

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:20.870 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a real challenge
with that because the dose--

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:24.350 align:middle line:84%
they now know-- scientists
now know the dose no longer

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:90%
determines the poison.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:30.380 align:middle line:84%
So it is dependent upon
an individual's body

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and how their endocrine system,
in particular in relation

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.140 align:middle line:84%
to the endocrine-disrupting
chemicals,

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:90%
how they react as such.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And in particular to the
endocrine-disrupting chemicals,

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:45.300 align:middle line:84%
the dose no longer
determines the poison.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.100 align:middle line:84%
So you can use a product
a couple of times or once

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and you can still
have a major challenge

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.760 align:middle line:90%
with your endocrine system.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.400 align:middle line:84%
You can also-- obviously,
if you use it more,

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.900 align:middle line:90%
you have a greater risk.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.290 align:middle line:84%
But the research is
showing it doesn't

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.210 align:middle line:90%
determine the poison anymore.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:03.720 align:middle line:90%
So it's a matter of switching--

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:10.590 align:middle line:84%
I say to people, if you remove
the products from your life--

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.460 align:middle line:84%
so if you don't want
chemicals in your body,

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:15.140 align:middle line:84%
if you don't want
these things that

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.400 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately we
take for granted--

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and I think the biggest
challenge I have as an educator

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and as a creator
and manufacturer

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.140 align:middle line:84%
of beautiful certified
organic products that

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:28.890 align:middle line:84%
remove the chemical burden
from the body every day--

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.200 align:middle line:84%
as an educator, the
biggest challenge

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.820 align:middle line:84%
we have is actually
having people

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.790 align:middle line:84%
believe that the products
on the shelf aren't safe.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:39.810 align:middle line:84%
They only need to get a copy of
"The Chemical Maze" or research

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:41.040 align:middle line:90%
and educate themselves.

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.340 align:middle line:84%
They'll soon see how
unsafe the chemicals are.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And the other challenge is--
with cosmetics, at least

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:84%
the ingredients are
listed on the labels.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.600 align:middle line:84%
With household cleaning
products, they aren't.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.400 align:middle line:90%
>> They're not.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So you never
know what's in them.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.000 align:middle line:84%
So at least with
the cosmetics you

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.170 align:middle line:84%
can actually go and have a
look, and you'll be mortified.

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:05.040 align:middle line:84%
I assumed, like most people,
that the products on the shelf

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:08.250 align:middle line:84%
were safe, and I
wish that I knew

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.290 align:middle line:84%
what I know now back when I
was younger because I would

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.390 align:middle line:90%
have done things differently.

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:14.880 align:middle line:90%
But we only know what we know.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.530 align:middle line:84%
We don't know what
we don't know.

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's the area when
I actually hold events,

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.560 align:middle line:84%
I work on, is that you don't
know what you don't know.

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:25.590 align:middle line:84%
Let me empower you,
because, with education, you

00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:27.330 align:middle line:90%
can make informed choices.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Without education,
you're just going

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.190 align:middle line:84%
along believing these
products are safe,

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.850 align:middle line:84%
believing that the pesticides,
insecticides, organophosphates,

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.520 align:middle line:84%
glyphosates that
are used every day

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.400 align:middle line:84%
on the food and the additives
and the other chemicals

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.500 align:middle line:90%
in your food, even, are safe.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.610 align:middle line:90%
Educate yourself.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Education is power.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you choose
what to do with it.

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.970 align:middle line:90%
Ultimately, it's your choice.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we really want
to know, in that case,

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.570 align:middle line:84%
is what are the sort of
ingredients that we can use

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:01.830 align:middle line:84%
that's going to do the same
job as all of these horrible

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.990 align:middle line:90%
chemicalized products out there?

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.080 align:middle line:84%
So again, switching to
safer certified organic,

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.200 align:middle line:84%
but if you can't do
that or if you can't

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.760 align:middle line:90%
afford certified organic--

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.370 align:middle line:84%
and really, the concentration
of certified organic

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:15.240 align:middle line:90%
is so much greater.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Like, our toothpaste will
last somebody three months,

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.290 align:middle line:90%
and it's $19.95.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.090 align:middle line:84%
But if you can't
afford that, use

00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:25.470 align:middle line:84%
bicarb soda, aluminum free,
bicarb soda, and lemon.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Squeeze lemon, but please
make it certified organic,

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.790 align:middle line:90%
and brush your teeth with that.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And we can also do apple
cider vinegar and bicarb soda.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:90%
So you can do that as well.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:38.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So what do you put in your
toothpaste that you produce?

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So our toothpaste has
parsley, sage, thyme,

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:46.290 align:middle line:84%
coconut oil, Celtic sea salt.
So why Celtic sea salt is used--

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:49.050 align:middle line:84%
so people put-- and we work
with holistic dentists in regard

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:50.670 align:middle line:90%
to our toothpaste.

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Sodium fluoride is
used in toothpaste

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:54.810 align:middle line:84%
to provide a mineral
base, because what

00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:58.020 align:middle line:84%
happens is what causes
cavities within the teeth--

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.260 align:middle line:84%
not just the sugar,
but it is a combination

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.760 align:middle line:90%
of sugar and bacteria.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.900 align:middle line:84%
So the sodium fluoride
actually mineralizes

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.310 align:middle line:90%
so that that doesn't happen.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:11.260 align:middle line:84%
You can use and what we
use is Celtic sea salt,

00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:13.140 align:middle line:84%
which provides the
same mineral base

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.560 align:middle line:84%
but without the nasty
chemical side effects.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.300 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride-- sodium
fluoride has been

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:23.040 align:middle line:84%
linked to bone cancer, bone
defects, dental fluorosis-- so

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.770 align:middle line:84%
the white spots on
kids' teeth, it's

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.740 align:middle line:84%
an over ingestion of fluoride,
having too much fluoride

00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.600 align:middle line:84%
through the water
supply, too much fluoride

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.010 align:middle line:90%
through the toothpaste.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride is also a
known neurotoxin.

00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Calcifies the pineal gland.

00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:37.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it does.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And we need not to have
our pineal gland calcified.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.743 align:middle line:84%
We need to have
that free of that.

00:30:44.743 --> 00:30:46.410 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that
toothpaste contains

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.530 align:middle line:84%
is triclosan, which is
a registered pesticide.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:51.540 align:middle line:84%
These things are in
our everyday products.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:55.830 align:middle line:84%
But we have parsley,
sage, thyme, coconut oil,

00:30:55.830 --> 00:31:01.350 align:middle line:84%
Celtic sea salt, aloe vera,
coconut oil, I said, spearmint,

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:05.940 align:middle line:84%
peppermint, lemon myrtle, all
of the beautiful ingredients

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.670 align:middle line:84%
that-- and our toothpaste
is called Tooth Mousse--

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:11.820 align:middle line:84%
because normal
toothpaste has fillers,

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.370 align:middle line:84%
tiny fillers that
you can't see that

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.490 align:middle line:90%
are microscopic plastic beads.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:19.800 align:middle line:84%
And do you know, Marc Cohen
states that there is not

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.200 align:middle line:84%
1 liter of the ocean
around the world

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.640 align:middle line:84%
now that doesn't contain tiny
microscopic plastic beads.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:27.600 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that scary?

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.060 align:middle line:84%
So our toothpaste
is a Tooth Mousse.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.850 align:middle line:84%
So it's a combination or it's
in between a paste and a mousse.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit
thicker than a mousse,

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.960 align:middle line:90%
but it's thinner than a paste.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's super,
super concentrated,

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and it leaves your
mouth so fresh.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm going to be trying that.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So in relation to our
hand and body lotion--

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:50.310 align:middle line:84%
again, you can just use
coconut oil-- again,

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:52.950 align:middle line:84%
certified organic because you're
guaranteed that it's not going

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.200 align:middle line:90%
to contain the nasty chemicals.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.600 align:middle line:84%
If you want something
even more beautiful,

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.100 align:middle line:84%
use our hand and
body lotion, which

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.880 align:middle line:84%
contains lemon myrtle,
cedarwood, rose geranium,

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:08.950 align:middle line:84%
avocado oil, macadamia oil, oh,
just all the amazing-- rooibos

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:09.930 align:middle line:90%
tea, rooibos.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:11.790 align:middle line:84%
All of our products
contain rooibos,

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.950 align:middle line:84%
which is 50 times
more antioxidant rich

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:15.540 align:middle line:90%
than green tea.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.610 align:middle line:84%
And our products are
about-- it's not just

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:20.010 align:middle line:84%
about what you're not
putting in the products

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.570 align:middle line:84%
or what's not in the products,
as in all the nasty chemicals.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:24.490 align:middle line:90%
It's what's in the products.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:28.180 align:middle line:84%
And they're high antioxidant,
nutrient-rich ingredients

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.813 align:middle line:90%
that are just amazing.

00:32:29.813 --> 00:32:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And the results that we've
been getting-- the testimonials

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:36.460 align:middle line:84%
that we've been getting in
relation to eczema, dermatitis,

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:40.610 align:middle line:84%
psoriasis, rosacea have
been absolutely incredible.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I had this little
boy called Andy Otto,

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:46.120 align:middle line:84%
and I was the CEO of
KORA for three years.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.450 align:middle line:84%
So as a family, we
have KORA Organics

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:84%
by Miranda, which is
certified organic skincare

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.390 align:middle line:90%
for the younger generation.

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:54.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we have Divine
by Therese Kerr, which

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.460 align:middle line:84%
is personal care-- so your
toothpaste, your deodorant,

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.490 align:middle line:84%
your hand sanitizer,
body wash, body lotion,

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:02.620 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of those
personal care products.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.630 align:middle line:84%
We have Divine Man
and Divine Baby

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:06.380 align:middle line:90%
now, which is very exciting.

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.190 align:middle line:84%
We even have opened
a restaurant as

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:11.800 align:middle line:84%
in certified organic
restaurant, as well.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And as a family, we're
dedicated to sharing the message

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and having every product
out there on the market that

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.760 align:middle line:84%
is there in a conventional
sense transformed

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.910 align:middle line:84%
to a certified organic
one as a healthier option.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So I mentioned earlier
about sunscreen.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Sunscreen is one of
the worst things,

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.640 align:middle line:90%
and yet people use it every day.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.640 align:middle line:84%
They need to look at and
research and educate themselves

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.050 align:middle line:90%
as to their chemicals.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So normal sunscreen-- that's
basically every sunscreen out

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:48.100 align:middle line:84%
there-- will contain
phenoxyethanol, octocrylene--

00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.390 align:middle line:84%
now, octocrylene has never been
tested for safety in cosmetics.

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:55.360 align:middle line:84%
Octocrylene produces
oxygen-reactive species

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:58.450 align:middle line:84%
upon exposure to sunlight,
which means, upon exposure

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.563 align:middle line:84%
to sunlight, it produces free
radicals that cause cancer.

00:34:01.563 --> 00:34:03.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're actually putting
something on your body

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:05.772 align:middle line:84%
to prevent cancer that's
actually causing cancer.

00:34:05.772 --> 00:34:08.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and what
an oxymoron that is.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.909 align:middle line:90%
Crazy, crazy.

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:11.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's also self-tanners.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.560 align:middle line:84%
So self-tanners contain
phenoxyethanol, propylene

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.350 align:middle line:84%
glycol, octocrylene, and a lot
of these chemicals-- in fact,

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.500 align:middle line:84%
the majority of chemicals
in our cosmetics

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:22.326 align:middle line:84%
have never been
tested for safety.

00:34:22.326 --> 00:34:24.159 align:middle line:84%
As I said, they're used
on the basis they're

00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:25.690 align:middle line:90%
safe until proven otherwise.

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:29.170 align:middle line:84%
If any have, they are
tested in isolation,

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:31.120 align:middle line:84%
and anyone who knows
anything about chemistry

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.850 align:middle line:84%
knows that if you test
a chemical by itself

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:36.360 align:middle line:84%
and you put just one
other chemical with it,

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:38.110 align:middle line:84%
you can have a totally
different reaction,

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:41.800 align:middle line:84%
let alone hundreds of different
chemicals going in there.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And over the last 39 years,
do you know how many chemicals

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.570 align:middle line:90%
have been banned in cosmetics?

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:47.590 align:middle line:90%
>> How many?

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:49.179 align:middle line:90%
>> 11.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.909 align:middle line:84%
Over 39 years, only
11 chemicals have

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:55.120 align:middle line:84%
been banned in cosmetics,
which is ludicrous.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And yet, what was
the latest study--

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.940 align:middle line:84%
how many chemicals were
found in a newborn?

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, gosh.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Professor Sarah Lantz from
Queensland University,

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:08.380 align:middle line:84%
she took newborn babies'
umbilical cords and found,

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:12.640 align:middle line:84%
on average, 200 chemicals in
their little umbilical cords.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:84%
She also worked on babies
with malformed genitalia.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And this study has
been replicated

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:20.350 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.780 align:middle line:84%
There are some
babies who have 287

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.530 align:middle line:84%
chemicals in their little
umbilical cords at birth.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:28.340 align:middle line:84%
>> 287 chemicals and
we're getting rid of 11.

00:35:28.340 --> 00:35:31.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, 11 over 39 years.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.807 align:middle line:90%
11 over 39 years, which is--

00:35:32.807 --> 00:35:34.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We seriously need
our heads tested.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:35.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It's crazy.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.230 align:middle line:84%
And one day, we will look
back, I believe-- one day,

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.330 align:middle line:84%
we will look back in the
not too distant future

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:43.000 align:middle line:84%
and we'll say, what on
earth were we thinking?

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.530 align:middle line:90%
And clearly, we weren't.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:46.240 align:middle line:90%
And we have allowed this.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So this won't change through
me doing this or other people

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.520 align:middle line:90%
standing up and saying this.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.740 align:middle line:84%
This will change when it
changes at the ground roots,

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.960 align:middle line:84%
because every time
we spend money,

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.200 align:middle line:84%
we are voting with our
dollar for that to continue.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And what happened in America
with the BPA-free baby

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.610 align:middle line:84%
bottles-- and please don't think
BPS is any safer, because BPS--

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:09.400 align:middle line:84%
the research that's coming
out in relation to BPS

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.520 align:middle line:84%
is showing it's just as
endocrine disrupting as BPA.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And BPAs, bisphenols,
are some of the worst

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.550 align:middle line:84%
endocrine-disrupting chemicals
that you can actually

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:22.870 align:middle line:84%
put in your body-- in your
Glad Wrap, your Teflon,

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:27.790 align:middle line:84%
the pans that you use,
your plastic containers.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:29.830 align:middle line:90%
They all contain BPA.

00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:32.620 align:middle line:84%
So it's really about removing
and switching to glass.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Switching to safer glass
is by far the safest thing.

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So with moms in America,
they actually said,

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:42.225 align:middle line:84%
we're not going to buy
BPA baby bottles anymore.

00:36:42.225 --> 00:36:43.600 align:middle line:84%
So they just
stopped buying them.

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:45.050 align:middle line:90%
So the companies had to stop.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.850 align:middle line:90%
They had to--

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Stop making them.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:46.750 align:middle line:90%
>> --stop making them.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:47.290 align:middle line:90%
>> You got to stop buying

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:48.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.830 align:middle line:84%
If the demand isn't there,
the supply will stop.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:51.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I am
so proud about--

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:55.590 align:middle line:90%
I get really excited about this.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.850 align:middle line:84%
What I'm so proud
of Australia about

00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:03.460 align:middle line:84%
is that we have the largest land
mass of certified organic land

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:04.840 align:middle line:90%
anywhere in the world now.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So we've gone from
12 million hectares

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.360 align:middle line:84%
to now 22 million hectares,
and it's growing and--

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.530 align:middle line:90%
>> That's fantastic.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:15.130 align:middle line:84%
>> The more we have,
the cheaper the supply,

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:18.850 align:middle line:84%
the cheaper the products are
going to be because we're going

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:21.645 align:middle line:84%
to have the supply there to
meet the demand, which is--

00:37:21.645 --> 00:37:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>> That is fantastic.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so exciting.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And I acknowledge all of
the Australian farmers--

00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:29.060 align:middle line:84%
you know, I get
emotional about this--

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:31.310 align:middle line:84%
all of the Australian
farmers who are actually

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.070 align:middle line:84%
doing this and anyone
in certified organic

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:35.145 align:middle line:90%
who is doing this.

00:37:35.145 --> 00:37:35.945 align:middle line:90%
It's hard work.

00:37:35.945 --> 00:37:36.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not easy creating
certified organic and trying

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:43.850 align:middle line:84%
to make the shift
and educate people,

00:37:43.850 --> 00:37:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and that's what
farmers are doing.

00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And they are doing it
with love, you know?

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're doing it
and with the intent

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.900 align:middle line:84%
of really making a
difference to our kids

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:55.700 align:middle line:90%
and future generations.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And my goal, my
personal goal, is

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
to have mums actually educate
their daughters to stop

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.980 align:middle line:90%
putting chemicals, makeups--

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:06.350 align:middle line:84%
we're going to be
releasing makeup next year.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:09.260 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
releasing anti-aging skin

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.660 align:middle line:90%
care for the more mature woman.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:15.570 align:middle line:84%
So we'll cover every
area of health.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:18.290 align:middle line:84%
But my goal is to have
mums have their daughters

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:21.140 align:middle line:84%
and their sons not
using the products that

00:38:21.140 --> 00:38:24.740 align:middle line:84%
contain the chemicals so that
when they go to have babies,

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.530 align:middle line:84%
they're not passing they're
fat-soluble chemicals

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:30.570 align:middle line:84%
onto their children
and in utero.

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So their babies are being
born free of chemicals,

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.580 align:middle line:84%
and then we have a baby range so
that then, when you're actually

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:39.830 align:middle line:84%
putting products on
your baby, you're

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.140 align:middle line:84%
putting products
as nature intended

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.750 align:middle line:84%
that actually
support their bodies,

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.010 align:middle line:84%
that give their
bodies nutrition.

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:50.015 align:middle line:84%
And that's what our
Divine Baby range does.

00:38:50.015 --> 00:38:52.410 align:middle line:90%
So it's very exciting.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Therese, fantastic
information.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.290 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely mind blowing.

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:01.790 align:middle line:84%
How you cover and articulate
the information is just amazing.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:03.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm very passionate
about it, as you can see.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.810 align:middle line:84%
>> And I so understand that
when you are passionate about

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:12.890 align:middle line:84%
something, then the barriers
are just knocked down

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:15.740 align:middle line:84%
because the passion is always
enough to overcome what those

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.090 align:middle line:90%
barriers are.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:19.730 align:middle line:84%
So if we were to
give, let's say,

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:23.490 align:middle line:84%
three alternatives
to our audience--

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:28.850 align:middle line:84%
let's say, right now, what
could be a simple deodorant

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:33.110 align:middle line:84%
alternative that perhaps
could even be made at home?

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.260 align:middle line:90%
>> So coconut oil.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Coconut oil?

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Anything in it?

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:37.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Coconut oil--
antibacterial, antimicrobial.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Just use coconut oil.

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:43.230 align:middle line:84%
My husband, before
we released out--

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:46.730 align:middle line:84%
because we have Divine Men
Deodorant and our other Divine

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:48.230 align:middle line:90%
by Therese Kerr Deodorant.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:49.640 align:middle line:90%
He used to use coconut oil.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:50.975 align:middle line:90%
You know what I used to use?

00:39:50.975 --> 00:39:51.290 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:53.150 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd get lemon,
certified organic lemon.

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:56.410 align:middle line:84%
I'd get a wedge of lemon, and
I'd just wipe it under my arm.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, totally antibacterial.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.380 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So if you can't
afford deodorant,

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.890 align:middle line:84%
if you can't afford
certified organic,

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:08.930 align:middle line:84%
buy the certified
organic fruit and do that

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:12.050 align:middle line:84%
or buy the certified
organic coconut oil.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:17.510 align:middle line:84%
>> What would be your number
one recommendation of a washing

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:19.970 align:middle line:90%
detergent alternative?

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:23.900 align:middle line:84%
>> With washing detergent,
there's amazing companies.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:28.220 align:middle line:84%
So Eco Home and Abode
are beautiful products

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:33.470 align:middle line:84%
that are really environmentally
friendly and safe for you.

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:36.155 align:middle line:84%
Nicole Bijlsma from
Abode, she's just amazing.

00:40:36.155 --> 00:40:37.280 align:middle line:90%
She's a building biologist.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.730 align:middle line:84%
She's currently doing a
PhD with Professor Marc

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Cohen, who I speak with
just about every day.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:48.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're amazing
products-- so definitely that.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And for a body lotion, if you
can't afford a body lotion,

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:54.170 align:middle line:90%
use coconut oil.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:56.510 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the best things--
again, certified organic.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.580 align:middle line:84%
And it's a medium
chain fatty acid,

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:02.030 align:middle line:84%
so even though you're putting
it on your body, again,

00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:04.700 align:middle line:84%
60%, on average, is
going into your body.

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.750 align:middle line:84%
You want it to convert
to energy, not to fat.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:08.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, beautiful.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:10.008 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's what
coconut oil does.

00:41:10.008 --> 00:41:11.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, perfect.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And what we do with our
company and with Divine

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:15.740 align:middle line:90%
and as a family--

00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:19.490 align:middle line:84%
I've just had this event down
at Nanna Kerr's Kitchen, which

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.460 align:middle line:84%
is our restaurant in the Hunter
Valley, or my son's restaurant.

00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:25.780 align:middle line:84%
We've just had this event where
it's an Educated, Empowered,

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.030 align:middle line:84%
and Chemical Free event, and
it's all about organic living,

00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:32.660 align:middle line:84%
celebrating organic
living, celebrating, also,

00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:34.580 align:middle line:90%
women coming together because--

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.980 align:middle line:84%
and no disrespect to
men, but Western women

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:38.540 align:middle line:90%
will transform this world.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:40.220 align:middle line:84%
We are the purchasing
powerhouse.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:44.630 align:middle line:84%
We have the ability to transform
this, and it starts with us.

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:48.830 align:middle line:84%
And we had this amazing event
down at Nanna Kerr's, and

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:51.350 align:middle line:90%
the people didn't want to leave.

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:53.960 align:middle line:84%
We ended up sitting around
and having lunch together

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:57.080 align:middle line:84%
and talking about
how can we really get

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.560 align:middle line:84%
those people to
actively participate

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.620 align:middle line:84%
in this transformation, because
it won't happen with me.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And I say to people,
don't be my champion.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.320 align:middle line:90%
Be your champion.

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.900 align:middle line:90%
Be your children's champion.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.910 align:middle line:84%
Be your children's
children's champion

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.220 align:middle line:90%
and be our planet's champion.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And you-- and one of
my favorite sayings--

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:16.260 align:middle line:90%
I know I talk a lot.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.440 align:middle line:84%
One of my favorite
sayings is, I always

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:21.680 align:middle line:84%
wondered why somebody didn't
do something about that,

00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.660 align:middle line:84%
and then I realized
I am somebody.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:25.310 align:middle line:90%
We're all somebody.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.010 align:middle line:84%
And as a family, we
have a public profile,

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:29.670 align:middle line:90%
and we're going to use it.

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:30.470 align:middle line:90%
Damn right.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:32.840 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use it
to make the most of what

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.940 align:middle line:84%
we can to make a
difference in this world

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:37.340 align:middle line:84%
because I want to leave
this world a better place.

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:39.710 align:middle line:84%
One day, Flynn--
every child to me

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:middle line:84%
is our responsibility,
because one day Flynn

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:45.230 align:middle line:84%
may want to get married, and
he may want to have children,

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.690 align:middle line:84%
and I want him to have
healthier children.

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, I've got
to ensure every child

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.590 align:middle line:84%
is healthy because I don't
know who he's going to choose.

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:56.725 align:middle line:84%
And same with my nephews and
nieces and all of the kids

00:42:56.725 --> 00:42:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that are going to
be having kids.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I want to make sure
they're healthy.

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And we have the
ability to do that.

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:05.480 align:middle line:84%
We just have to get back to
nature as nature intended

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:09.890 align:middle line:84%
and not all this chemical
garbage that has become so much

00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:13.160 align:middle line:84%
a part, a big part of our
lives, and it's really

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.170 align:middle line:84%
about switching to
safer-- removing

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:17.180 align:middle line:84%
that chemical burden
from your life

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.350 align:middle line:90%
that you place on yourself.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And it is so beautiful
when you're actually

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.960 align:middle line:84%
at home and everything in
your home is supporting,

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.912 align:middle line:84%
not hindering, your body and
supporting, not hindering,

00:43:26.912 --> 00:43:28.370 align:middle line:84%
the planet, because
when we realize

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:31.760 align:middle line:84%
what we do to our planet, we
do to ourselves, that's when

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.080 align:middle line:90%
we'll get a transformation.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.000 align:middle line:84%
>> That's when the
light bulb is on.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.630 align:middle line:90%
>> One last question.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:43.950 align:middle line:84%
You're such a joy to talk to and
so inspiring and so passionate.

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:45.200 align:middle line:90%
>> And so are you, my darling.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.890 align:middle line:90%
What you're doing is amazing.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:47.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:48.490 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:50.820 align:middle line:90%
>> It's absolutely incredible.

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:55.400 align:middle line:84%
>> The "I am" statement,
the very last question--

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking the same of all
of our wonderful speakers--

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:02.540 align:middle line:84%
simply that the power to change
our mind and to use mindfulness

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.960 align:middle line:84%
and how we speak to
ourselves to really transform

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.710 align:middle line:84%
what we create every day
and shift our perspective.

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:10.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, totally.

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.610 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your "I am" that you
wake up to and remind yourself?

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:17.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I am the awareness
behind my thoughts.

00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.480 align:middle line:90%
That's who I am.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I am not my thoughts.

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:23.180 align:middle line:84%
I am the awareness
behind my thoughts,

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:26.660 align:middle line:84%
consistently, so that I
can always consistently

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.180 align:middle line:84%
be who I need to
be in this world

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:31.300 align:middle line:90%
to hopefully make a difference.

00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:33.010 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:35.270 align:middle line:84%

much for being with us.

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:36.780 align:middle line:84%

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.150 align:middle line:90%

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:42.360 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for having me.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:42.660 align:middle line:90%
