00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.888 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.888 --> 00:00:15.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Maria, very warm
welcome to you.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
taking the time to join us.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>> That's wonderful.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.256 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for inviting me here
to the Healthy Me Summits.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Maria, again, I'm in a place
where I get to sit and listen

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.460 align:middle line:84%
to the most amazing stories and
to learn how these individuals

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:84%
have come from a place
of trauma, adversity,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.810 align:middle line:84%
and pull themselves out of what
I honestly cannot even relate

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:90%
to on so many levels.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm just-- I sit in awe.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.570 align:middle line:84%
And what it gives
me is the confidence

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.430 align:middle line:84%
that when I listen
to these stories,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.580 align:middle line:84%
that I know that there is
a way, no matter how dark

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.910 align:middle line:84%
we feel the times and
experiences can be,

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:84%
that there is a
way out of those.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:84%
And you're somebody who has come
from nothing, from addiction,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:11.680 align:middle line:84%
prostitution, to bipolar,
to now where you are,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.490 align:middle line:84%
which is the founder
of an amazing charity,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.542 align:middle line:84%
"Coaching with Substance,"
that won 2014 Best Charity.

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:22.375 align:middle line:90%
It's not for profit.

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:23.175 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:01:23.175 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is an unbelievable
feat in itself.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So would you share a little
bit about your journey with us

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:90%
and just where it began?

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, sure.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm almost 40 and I
was born in the Philippines.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.890 align:middle line:84%
At 11 years old, I came
from the Philippines

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:84%
to Australia on my own because
my mother and father separated,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:84%
and my mother couldn't
come to pick me up

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.260 align:middle line:84%
in the Philippines
because of papers that

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:90%
just wasn't happening yet.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.950 align:middle line:84%
My-- her husband at that
time that's Australian died.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.830 align:middle line:84%
So I had to come
from the Philippines

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.280 align:middle line:84%
on the plane for nine
hours on my own at 11.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.780 align:middle line:90%
It was petrifying.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.445 align:middle line:84%
And then I came to Australia
and it wasn't the best childhood

00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
because my mother was going
through a lot of issues

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.130 align:middle line:90%
back at that time.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And there you have it, at
13-year-old I was already

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.620 align:middle line:84%
taking meth and hanging with
the wrong crowd, drinking and--

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:90%
yeah.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So it just kind of went
downhill from there.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.200 align:middle line:84%
And at 14 years old I was
sent back to the Philippines

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.507 align:middle line:84%
and I was getting heavier and
heavier into my shabu, or meth

00:02:39.507 --> 00:02:45.050 align:middle line:84%
use, and somehow when I
was in the Philippines,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.700 align:middle line:84%
my dad had a friend that
owned a travel agency.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So he got me working
there at 14 years old.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And because I was so
bubbly and personable,

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
I sold the most
travels to Australia

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:84%
because I just came
from Australia.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:90%
And

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.330 align:middle line:84%
I was able to save for
my ticket from Manila

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.870 align:middle line:84%
to Australia by the
time I turned 15.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Because at 15 years old,
it was 75% off the ticket

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.070 align:middle line:84%
because I worked
in a travel agency.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.250 align:middle line:84%
So next thing you know, I was on
the plane back from Australia--

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:84%
from Philippines back
to Australia on my own.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Because at that time, my mother
just won't talk to me anymore

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.753 align:middle line:84%
and Philippines is just too poor
a country for me to really make

00:03:29.753 --> 00:03:30.670 align:middle line:90%
something of it there.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
Because we just-- we'll
give you an example.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
We lived in a place where
we're paying about $100 a month

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.550 align:middle line:84%
and there were eight
people living there.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine what type
of a place it is in Makati.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:84%
So that wasn't a future for
me, so I came to Australia.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And it just-- it's like
one of those things

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
that just keeps getting
worse and worse and worse.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.220 align:middle line:84%
Even if I was in Australia,
I had no parents.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:84%
No one telling me
not to do anything.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.915 align:middle line:84%
No one telling me what
right and wrong is.

00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:02.715 align:middle line:90%
>> No boundaries.

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:04.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, god, no.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And have-- having my mom
rejected me at that time.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.030 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine in our teens
we had such low self-esteem

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:90%
issues, right?

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, mine was like 20 times
lower self-esteem than most.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't long
before I was 18

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:84%
and I was already
working in an agency,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.590 align:middle line:84%
selling my body for the
drugs that I was using.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, so got involved
with many Yakuza and Triad,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:90%
those types of people.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.880 align:middle line:84%
And I went to Japan to
hostess is what you call that.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.650 align:middle line:84%
But actually, I went
there as a model.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And then when I got there, I
decided that all the models

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:84%
there would do work
at night, which

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:90%
is what the hostess thing was.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.760 align:middle line:84%
So I did that for
a long time and got

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.940 align:middle line:84%
involved with the
Yakuza and Triad people.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
And just for a good 10
years I was using meth

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.810 align:middle line:90%
and Coke and all the drugs.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And anxiety issues,
I was always so--

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:07.780 align:middle line:90%
just the palpitations.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.698 align:middle line:84%
I was so scared
because I didn't know

00:05:09.698 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:90%
who's going to take care of me.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.532 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know how
I was going to eat.

00:05:12.532 --> 00:05:13.570 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.210 align:middle line:90%
I lived no where.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Just off the-- the
clothes off my back.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:90%
And at 23 got bipolar.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:84%
My mom wanted to speak
to me, so she invited

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:90%
me to go back to Australia.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:90%
When I first saw her, all the--

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.320 align:middle line:84%
gosh, all the fear and all
the kind of feeling of,

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.050 align:middle line:84%
you didn't take care of me,
just smacked me in the face

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.010 align:middle line:90%
and I got ill.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:84%
I got psychotic and I went
to Toowoomba Base Hospital

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.660 align:middle line:84%
and I was institutionalized
for three whole months.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Maria, when you spent
time in the institution,

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.760 align:middle line:84%
when you were institutionalized
for that three month period,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:84%
was that your first time
that you had actually weaned

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.430 align:middle line:84%
yourself off the various
substances over the seven years

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.360 align:middle line:90%
that you had been addicted to?

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Gosh, that's a
question and a half.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.830 align:middle line:90%
It-- my addiction is--

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
it's just a constant
underlying current

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.330 align:middle line:90%
that happened in my life.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.150 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't-- well, I'd like to
say it didn't really ruin me.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:90%
But looking back, it really did.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.060 align:middle line:84%
When I would take Coke,
it'll be for a whole weekend.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.710 align:middle line:84%
If I got on the methamphetamine,
it'll be for weeks at a time.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:90%
If I go clubbing--

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.200 align:middle line:84%
I was a nightclub girl, so
Thursday, Friday, Saturday

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.120 align:middle line:84%
night we'd just be
drinking all night.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.900 align:middle line:84%
So I haven't really
thought to myself

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.170 align:middle line:84%
prior to getting sick
or institutionalized

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.760 align:middle line:90%
that I need to stop.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.600 align:middle line:84%
It was still too new,
even if it started at 13.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I just didn't
think it was problematic.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.540 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, it really was the
first time that I stopped.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So you spent
three months in a--

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.390 align:middle line:90%
being in an asylum.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>> What occurred then?

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:01.891 align:middle line:84%
What followed after
those three months?

00:07:01.891 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:84%
>> You wouldn't believe
it, but that was--

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.270 align:middle line:84%
after I was released, I actually
had my first suicide attempt,

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:15.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's a crippling
feeling when you're young

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.430 align:middle line:84%
and you think you've got
your whole life ahead of you

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.100 align:middle line:84%
and you think you're
pretty and you think you've

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.630 align:middle line:84%
got a control on
men, that you're now

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.930 align:middle line:84%
bipolar or
schizophreniform disorder

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.400 align:middle line:90%
is what they called it.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And they say you can
see if you can do drugs.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I don't recommend
it, but because

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:42.670 align:middle line:84%
of your systems in your head,
you get high quite easily.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.080 align:middle line:90%
It's really detrimental to you.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.880 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, that's it.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.020 align:middle line:84%
If I can't escape from the pain
of being rejected and being

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.360 align:middle line:84%
alone and really having
no one to go back to,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.330 align:middle line:84%
then I really don't
want this life anymore.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:59.560 align:middle line:84%
And so I was on so many
pills so I drank it all.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.900 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, my mom
came home from shopping

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.700 align:middle line:84%
because she was
doing her shopping

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.680 align:middle line:90%
and she just had a really--

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.710 align:middle line:84%
feeling inside her so she
went home straight away,

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.280 align:middle line:84%
found me overdosed, and
went and got hospitalized.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.822 align:middle line:84%
So it's funny how you picked
up like, you were saying what

00:08:15.822 --> 00:08:17.030 align:middle line:90%
happened straight after that?

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:18.600 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's what happened.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.400 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And so was it the one attempt,
or did you try multiple times?

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:27.820 align:middle line:84%
>> There were a few
more times after that.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.510 align:middle line:84%
One other time was
when I was at Uni.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.590 align:middle line:90%
I was trying so hard.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, I just
felt like I was different.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was getting
disability support pension

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of things.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.580 align:middle line:90%
And it just felt weird.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, because I really
had a taste of it once

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and my mom was around,
I thought, well--

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.445 align:middle line:84%
this time I was at a dorm
at Griffith Uni in Brisbane,

00:08:53.445 --> 00:08:55.820 align:middle line:84%
and I thought, well, this time
no one's going to be home.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:90%
No one's going to save me.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:57.580 align:middle line:90%
This is going to be it.

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.250 align:middle line:84%
But somehow someone
found me again

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:84%
and I was back to the hospital
and still survived that one.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:07.733 align:middle line:84%
So come to think of it, I
guess whoever is up there,

00:09:07.733 --> 00:09:09.400 align:middle line:84%
really didn't want
me to go because I've

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.960 align:middle line:84%
got this great mission
that I'm living right now.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably
why I didn't go then

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.050 align:middle line:90%
no matter how hard I tried.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what's also
interesting is is what

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.900 align:middle line:90%
I've read of your story.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:29.170 align:middle line:84%
It's as if-- it was as if
there was a changing moment.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:84%
But for you the changing
moment was very, very clear.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And this is as if
it was just one day

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.253 align:middle line:84%
you decided I'm no longer
going to live this life.

00:09:37.253 --> 00:09:38.053 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:09:38.053 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Was it that kind
of black and white?

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems that way probably
because when I wrote my book I

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.470 align:middle line:90%
was in a good place.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So when I wrote it, it was
almost like when I wrote it in,

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.040 align:middle line:84%
it was like, this is the
moment that I pre-picked

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.170 align:middle line:84%
because I was in a good
place as opposed to I

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.460 align:middle line:90%
wasn't in a good place then.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.900 align:middle line:90%
But it was that way.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:00.010 align:middle line:84%
It was a culmination of one
mistake after the other.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And when a mistake
happens, it's like, gosh, I

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:90%
better learn from this.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.492 align:middle line:84%
And another mistake happens
and learn from this one.

00:10:07.492 --> 00:10:08.950 align:middle line:84%
I haven't done this
mistake before.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And this one, I've got
to learn from this.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.430 align:middle line:90%
So, no, it wasn't immediate.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Although, three-- around three
years ago, I was with this man

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.200 align:middle line:90%
that wasn't a nice guy at all.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, that was kind
of like the moment when I said,

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.960 align:middle line:84%
oh, my gosh, because I fell back
in to meth use for five months.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.450 align:middle line:84%
And I already had the
charity built by then.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, my god, how can
I be your solution to addiction?

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.870 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why
that happened was I

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.870 align:middle line:84%
was in a very good
relationship but it fell apart.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:49.220 align:middle line:84%
And he, being the pastor's
son, came into my life.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.100 align:middle line:84%
And he was using meth
and he was injecting me.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:55.150 align:middle line:84%
And also-- he knew my
history because we--

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I knew him when I
was 19 years old.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And he knew that if
he could inject me,

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:02.220 align:middle line:84%
then I'll be back
in my old ways.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:08.500 align:middle line:84%
So-- yeah, after that time
when I fell and I went back

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.680 align:middle line:84%
into the hospital to psychiatric
ward in the Philippines,

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.820 align:middle line:84%
and then I came to Australia,
also went in in Australia.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, wow, 10 times.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I think I better stop now.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.770 align:middle line:90%
And I met a monk after that.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:84%
And that was really
the pivotal moment

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:29.045 align:middle line:84%
where I took the right turn and
it was right from there on in.

00:11:29.045 --> 00:11:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>> So you met a monk
here in Australia.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Yes, yes, yes.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:36.670 align:middle line:84%
So I came from my very
sad and sordid experience,

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:39.460 align:middle line:84%
and I went to domestic
violence court, him

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:90%
and his gangs were all look--

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.590 align:middle line:84%
trying to look for
me and threatening me

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.080 align:middle line:84%
and really trying to
get me back into what

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.520 align:middle line:90%
they were trying to do.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.540 align:middle line:84%
And I approached a
friend and I said,

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:84%
do you know anyone
that can help me?

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
He goes-- and he's
telling me-- you've

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.130 align:middle line:84%
been telling me about this
monk that knows Kung Fu.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.480 align:middle line:84%
He sounds like he
can protect me.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Can you call him and tell him
that I'm coming to see him?

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.920 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he can help me out.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.980 align:middle line:90%
And so she did.

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And now when I saw him, it was
a pretty immediate connection.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And we knew that there
was something there.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.480 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, I
was too traumatized.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And he's good not
to do anything then.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But many months
later, it came to

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
that this was the
right thing to do

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.690 align:middle line:84%
for both of our kind of
goals, spiritual goals.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what did
transpire with the monk?

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:37.330 align:middle line:84%
>> What happened was he helped
me through that moment where

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.610 align:middle line:90%
all these people were after me.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:41.980 align:middle line:90%
He trained me body wise.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:46.810 align:middle line:84%
So he taught me Qigong, which is
a breathing exercise, Tai Chi.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:50.350 align:middle line:84%
And, yeah, it's just pretty
much training every day.

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Because he said if
your body is good,

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.040 align:middle line:84%
if you can put down
a person that's

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.700 align:middle line:84%
trying to-- like self-defense,
if someone's trying to come

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.680 align:middle line:84%
at you from behind or
there's people with guns,

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.160 align:middle line:90%
this is what you do.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And I started training
my body in that way.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course, he taught
me stillness, as well.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.450 align:middle line:84%
So with the stillness practices
and the Kung Fu practices

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and the Qigong and the Tai
Chi, and the constant spiritual

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:18.037 align:middle line:84%
insights that he
would impart upon me--

00:13:18.037 --> 00:13:19.120 align:middle line:90%
because we lived together.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.010 align:middle line:90%
It was like a 24/7--

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:84%
having the Dalai Lama beside you
and asking him all the deepest

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.530 align:middle line:90%
questions in the world.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Having that really opened
my mind and my heart

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.775 align:middle line:84%
and got me on the
road to healing.

00:13:33.775 --> 00:13:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.220 align:middle line:90%
Wow, it's amazing.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.500 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a happy ending.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is the beauty of
the sharing is with so many

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.520 align:middle line:84%
of the people that have
volunteered to share

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.440 align:middle line:90%
their stories.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:53.110 align:middle line:84%
It is-- we call it a happy
ending but a lot of suffering

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:54.355 align:middle line:90%
and heartache along the way.

00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:55.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Sure, it is like a
metamorphosis, isn't it?

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:58.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I think you need to be--

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.570 align:middle line:90%
and before they turn into a--

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:06.280 align:middle line:84%
from the caterpillar to the
butterfly they are broken down.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.590 align:middle line:84%
Every single cell
is broken down.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's definitely
what happened to me.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.320 align:middle line:84%
I was broken down and
had so many experiences.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, well,
why is this needed?

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that was going to be
my next question is, literally,

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:84%
you coming to a
realization of, well,

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.210 align:middle line:84%
what's all this
experiencing been for?

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.130 align:middle line:90%
Why have I experienced this.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:31.380 align:middle line:90%
Why have I made these choices?

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It's crystal clear now why.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:36.530 align:middle line:84%
It's because I coach people with
addiction and mental illness

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.330 align:middle line:90%
issues.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:40.150 align:middle line:84%
And they come to me
with their stories

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:43.138 align:middle line:84%
and it's almost like
"Slumdog Millionaire."

00:14:43.138 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:84%
They'll come with
this story and I'll

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.280 align:middle line:84%
have an experience
exactly the parallel

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.960 align:middle line:90%
or the same as that experience.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So if they come at me with
a domestic violence story,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:56.080 align:middle line:84%
I can say, I know exactly
where you're coming from.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:59.270 align:middle line:84%
And they will feel in their
heart that I really know.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:84%
And then that deep kind of
connection will be built.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.237 align:middle line:84%
And then from my experience,
I'll tell a couple of tips

00:15:07.237 --> 00:15:09.070 align:middle line:84%
and they'll take it and
they'll run with it.

00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Because they know
that I've been there.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a sex
work experience,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.940 align:middle line:84%
is it a stripping in
a club experience,

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.390 align:middle line:84%
is it a hostessing experience,
or is it a sexual abuse

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:84%
experience, is it ostracized by
parents and family experience?

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Is it a night clubbing
and binging experience?

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.150 align:middle line:84%
So many experiences,
all of that was

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.200 align:middle line:84%
being made seen by
me-- or I saw them

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.850 align:middle line:84%
so that when people
are presenting

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:84%
those types of issues with
me, nothing beats experience.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:43.480 align:middle line:84%
If someone probably
came to you and said

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.330 align:middle line:84%
I've been on methamphetamine
and all sorts of things,

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.300 align:middle line:84%
you probably will just be
going, oh, what can I say?

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:52.900 align:middle line:84%
It's hard when you're not coming
from a place of experience.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard when
you're not coming

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.100 align:middle line:84%
from a place of experience
and successfully turned away

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.060 align:middle line:90%
from it.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.712 align:middle line:84%
So having that story
and hearing and saying,

00:16:01.712 --> 00:16:02.920 align:middle line:90%
I know exactly what you mean.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
That kind of
happened to me, too.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:09.640 align:middle line:84%
It just makes them like,
she's not judging me.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And, my gosh, she's
doing her PhD.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.100 align:middle line:90%
She runs a charity.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.920 align:middle line:84%
She's finished her
masters and, look,

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:90%
she's so loving and personable.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.020 align:middle line:84%
If she's not broken by
what I'm going through now,

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.400 align:middle line:90%
there is a hope.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly
why it's beautiful

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:25.030 align:middle line:90%
what I've been through.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.820 align:middle line:84%
Because now, I can impart
that hope and that inspiration

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:28.630 align:middle line:90%
to other people.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So Maria, one of the things
that you said which I think is

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.930 align:middle line:84%
so prevalent is not
only have you recovered,

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:36.560 align:middle line:90%
but you haven't gone back.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.360 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a miracle.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Which is the greatest challenge
is an addiction and it's word.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So what sort of lifestyle
changes and disciplines have

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:53.000 align:middle line:84%
you had to commit to in order
to ensure that there hasn't been

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.800 align:middle line:90%
a turnaround?

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:58.692 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to clarify
because depression and anxiety

00:16:58.692 --> 00:17:00.400 align:middle line:84%
was a big part of my
life, because I just

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.520 align:middle line:84%
don't want to alienate
maybe some of the audiences

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.470 align:middle line:84%
with depression
and anxiety issues,

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.970 align:middle line:84%
very much a part of what
was happening to me.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I was very scared
to talk to people.

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.940 align:middle line:84%
And no energy to
go into anything.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And what-- why I'm saying that
is because the reason why I

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:84%
haven't gone back there
is because of yoga,

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:24.910 align:middle line:84%
stillness or meditation,
eating well, really raw--

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.950 align:middle line:90%
raw food.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:31.180 align:middle line:84%
And just-- I just cut out
anything that is in a can,

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.110 align:middle line:90%
in a--

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.900 align:middle line:84%
anything that wasn't pulled
from the roots off the ground.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So if I ate everything
fresh fruits and veggies

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and then everyday I
find the time to stretch

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
my body with yoga, whichever
one that I can pick up

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.470 align:middle line:84%
on YouTube, and also 20 minutes
in the morning, 20 minutes at

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.890 align:middle line:84%
night, I do what you call
transcendental meditation.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And saying my mantra and
doing TM also helps me.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.940 align:middle line:84%
And those are the reasons
why I haven't gone back.

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So TM being the
transcendental meditation?

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>> So a few people do it.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.170 align:middle line:84%
Oprah and her crew,
they do that--

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.950 align:middle line:90%
they did that at Harpo Studios.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:14.080 align:middle line:84%
Russell Brand, Cameron
Diaz, Liv Tyler, you know,

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:14.880 align:middle line:90%
Ellen DeGeneres.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.750 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
have picked up

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:90%
that technique of meditation.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:21.560 align:middle line:84%
Although, any meditation
technique will do.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.340 align:middle line:84%
It's just that with
transcendental meditation,

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:84%
you get cognized
a mantra that is

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.870 align:middle line:84%
the essence of your vibration,
and it gets whispered

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:90%
to you by a Yogic monk,

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:37.600 align:middle line:90%
one of Maharishi's teachers--

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.577 align:middle line:84%
and it takes them two,
three years to study--

00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:42.160 align:middle line:84%
and just before they
become a teacher,

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.550 align:middle line:84%
they need to go into
seclusion for five months.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.490 align:middle line:84%
So they're really--
they can really

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.670 align:middle line:84%
go into and cognize
your vibration

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.410 align:middle line:84%
and tell you what
your mantra is.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And the virtue of saying
that twice a day, 20 minutes,

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.600 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes, really
enlivens your cells

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:05.080 align:middle line:84%
and gets you going
deep into the source--

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.600 align:middle line:84%
or what they call
the unified field--

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.770 align:middle line:84%
where all of the
information lays

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:15.580 align:middle line:84%
for us to just pick at
and take back out with us

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.060 align:middle line:90%
in the real life.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.435 align:middle line:84%
So it's probably
a bit weary there.

00:19:19.435 --> 00:19:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I-- well, for me
I completely resonate

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.930 align:middle line:84%
and the audience, I believe,
that those that are ready

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.970 align:middle line:84%
to hear that will
take it on board.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:28.945 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:19:28.945 --> 00:19:32.980 align:middle line:84%
>> And part of Healthy Me
Summit is about delivering

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:84%
information, education,
and solutions.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And hoping that the minds
and hearts of people

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:43.620 align:middle line:84%
are open enough to take
what they're ready to hear.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:44.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:49.570 align:middle line:84%
>> So I have a few questions
around, first of all,

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:54.190 align:middle line:84%
is there any research out
there that shows the relevance

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:84%
to addictions, be it drug
addictions or addictions

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.980 align:middle line:84%
themselves, being the precursor
to depression, anxiety,

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.535 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety and depression being
the precursor to then falling

00:20:07.535 --> 00:20:08.335 align:middle line:90%
into an addiction?

00:20:08.335 --> 00:20:09.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:13.100 align:middle line:84%
I did a bit of research on
that, because we were talking

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.290 align:middle line:90%
about maybe this could be us.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:18.108 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't find anything--

00:20:18.108 --> 00:20:19.400 align:middle line:90%
because I didn't have the time.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.810 align:middle line:84%
But what I really wanted
to say to you is my PhD,

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.745 align:middle line:90%
which will be coming out soon--

00:20:25.745 --> 00:20:27.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is on?

00:20:27.095 --> 00:20:32.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The efficacy of recovery
coaching on people with poly

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:37.190 align:middle line:84%
drug use issues, comorbid,
with depression and anxiety.

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.290 align:middle line:84%
In real word-- or in
real terms, people

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.070 align:middle line:84%
with depression and
anxiety and using drugs.

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:90%
How is coaching impacting that?

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.810 align:middle line:90%
On full level-- on full streams.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:90%
One is mental clarity.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.470 align:middle line:90%
One is emotional stability.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.170 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
recovery capital.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And then obviously,
the lessening

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.740 align:middle line:84%
of the alcohol and
the drug usage.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:84%
So I'll be definitely
looking into that question

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.180 align:middle line:90%
of depression and anxiety.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Does it lead into addiction,
or the other way around?

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:84%
Does addiction lead to
depression and anxiety issues?

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Because I'll be getting
them to fill out some forms.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.352 align:middle line:84%
So I'll definitely be
getting to the bottom

00:21:14.352 --> 00:21:16.520 align:middle line:90%
of that particular answer.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:17.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Awesome.

00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And with your Foundation
and the nature of your work,

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:28.400 align:middle line:84%
you would certainly have
some stats and some dollars

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.430 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the
kind of resources

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:36.580 align:middle line:84%
that is going towards
the drain on our society.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.090 align:middle line:84%
What does that look
like these days?

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:40.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That doesn't look too good.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.690 align:middle line:84%
$26 billion was
spent specifically

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:47.090 align:middle line:84%
in just one year
on tobacco smoking,

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:53.992 align:middle line:84%
because it's the number one
drug kind of burden of disease,

00:21:53.992 --> 00:21:54.950 align:middle line:90%
if you want to call it.

00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Legalized burden of disease.

00:21:56.535 --> 00:21:57.335 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:57.335 --> 00:22:01.190 align:middle line:84%
And It's $26 billion in one year
that they spent on prevention

00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and treatment and
hospitalization,

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.010 align:middle line:84%
and all sorts of
things, assurances.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:84%
Another figure is with alcohol
use, they say one in six--

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.750 align:middle line:84%
well, they say Queenslanders
are at the top of the binge

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:19.550 align:middle line:90%
drinking.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Oh, sorry, number two.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And one in six drink at the
riskiest levels, or a binge

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:90%
drink, at the riskiest level.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.710 align:middle line:84%
So one in six is
a hell of a lot.

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:32.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
Queenslanders drink at.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.960 align:middle line:84%
And out of the one
in six, one in four--

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.720 align:middle line:90%


00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.100 align:middle line:84%
one in four has been a victim
of alcohol related violence

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.270 align:middle line:90%
or abuse.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.600 align:middle line:90%
So that's really massive.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Another step that I was reading
about is on the weekends,

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:59.300 align:middle line:84%
there's about 60,000
emergency admissions

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.580 align:middle line:90%
for alcohol kind of issues.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.670 align:middle line:84%
So again, alcohol is
the biggest issue.

00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:08.370 align:middle line:84%
So alcohol and smoking
are actually the top two.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.560 align:middle line:90%
And then illicit drugs--

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.910 align:middle line:90%
marijuana is the top--

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:13.260 align:middle line:90%
11.2% prevalence.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:19.760 align:middle line:84%
So 11.2% of the population
smoke marijuana adversely.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And heroin and all that
actually less than 1%.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.170 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a big thing.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.520 align:middle line:90%
But it's still a big issue.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.010 align:middle line:84%
Marijuana is right--
sorry, methamphetamine

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:34.750 align:middle line:84%
is rising, coming
up to almost 3%.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:38.390 align:middle line:84%
And I guess with
the heavy effects

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.630 align:middle line:84%
that methamphetamine
has, 3% is a lot.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Because if 3% of the population
are rendered incapable

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.130 align:middle line:84%
by methamphetamine, they
really don't amount to much.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:84%
Because out of 612,000 are
disability support recipients.

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:58.730 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:06.170 align:middle line:84%
And out of the 612,000, 42%
have psychiatric disorders,

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:08.860 align:middle line:90%
comorbid with addiction issues.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's almost half
of the recipients.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And they're saying the job
service providers have put out

00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:84%
this research that 27%
of these set of people

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.950 align:middle line:84%
with psychiatric
disorders, they actually

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.800 align:middle line:84%
have very low employment
participation.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.370 align:middle line:84%
So they're one of the
lowest of even people

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:32.930 align:middle line:90%
with intellectual disabilities.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And out of all the
disability stream,

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.425 align:middle line:84%
27% are at the
lowest of not wanting

00:24:37.425 --> 00:24:39.050 align:middle line:84%
to go back to work
because they're just

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.530 align:middle line:84%
not capable with their
mental illness issues.

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So it really is
costing us a lot,

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.390 align:middle line:90%
as if we don't already know.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And those are just some of the
statistics that prove that.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:55.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Maria, you are the
author of four bestsellers.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you just tell us a little
bit about each of those?

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:01.130 align:middle line:84%
So the first one is what
we've talked about today,

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.160 align:middle line:84%
it's called, "Kill Your
Addiction Before it Kills You."

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.850 align:middle line:84%
How I transformed my life
of addictions, bipolar,

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:08.790 align:middle line:90%
and suicide.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:11.400 align:middle line:84%
So it goes through
my experiences

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:84%
in addiction, my psychiatric
institutionalizations,

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.280 align:middle line:84%
and my suicide attempts, in
the hope of getting someone

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:84%
to go and change their
life with me as I

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:90%
go to the end of that story.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
The second book is
"Kill Their Addiction

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.500 align:middle line:90%
Before it Kills All of You."

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's specifically written
for the parent, the loved one,

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.280 align:middle line:84%
the spouse, the brother,
the sister, the husband,

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.440 align:middle line:90%
the boyfriend.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.520 align:middle line:84%
What they can do to support the
recovery of their loved one.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.200 align:middle line:84%
The third book is probably the
most monumental book for me.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:84%
It is "SIT With Monk Xu,
Modern Day Special Insights--

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.950 align:middle line:84%
Special Insights Training with
a Modern Day Taoist Monk."

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:57.470 align:middle line:84%
Because my partner, the one
I was telling you before,

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:58.940 align:middle line:90%
is a Taoist Monk.

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.750 align:middle line:84%
And it just goes through
my spiritual insights,

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.590 align:middle line:84%
that light bulb moments that
helped me turn my life around.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:09.980 align:middle line:84%
So I documented those
in that third book.

00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:15.500 align:middle line:84%
And the last book is "From Rock
Bottom to Sky's the Limit."

00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.450 align:middle line:84%
How to become a recovery
coach in six months or less.

00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:20.840 align:middle line:84%
And that just walks
someone through--

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.310 align:middle line:90%
they're in recovery.

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.170 align:middle line:84%
They're going-- looking
back at their life.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:90%
What a bit of a train wreck.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.760 align:middle line:84%
Is there anything there that
I can use to help people.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yes, become
a recovery coach.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:33.290 align:middle line:84%
Because as a recovery
coach, you can

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.300 align:middle line:84%
use every single one
of those experiences

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.880 align:middle line:90%
because someone out there--

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.200 align:middle line:84%
100 people out there are going
to have those experiences.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.096 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually walk
them through as a coach.

00:26:44.096 --> 00:26:47.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So in regards to the
actual coaching component,

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:53.090 align:middle line:84%
so you run a Foundation called,
"Coaching with Substance."

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.580 align:middle line:84%
>> What are some of the key
components that you actually

00:26:58.580 --> 00:26:59.835 align:middle line:90%
coach within that model?

00:26:59.835 --> 00:27:00.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.540 align:middle line:90%
We-- I use a 12 session series.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Because there is research
that's been done.

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:84%
Takes 21 days to break down
a habit, and another couple

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.630 align:middle line:84%
of months to kind of put
it together and give them

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.420 align:middle line:84%
a new strong habit
to replace that.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.580 align:middle line:90%
So it's a 12 session system.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest
component about it

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.840 align:middle line:84%
is, is the sitting down
in the first session.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And I really get
down to their values,

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.100 align:middle line:84%
getting them to the
core of their being.

00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.140 align:middle line:84%
Reviewing all
areas of their life

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:84%
and letting them pick
three specific areas

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:39.470 align:middle line:84%
that they want to work with me
on for the next 11 sessions.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:43.430 align:middle line:84%
So that we can write down
some tangible, inspirational

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:45.530 align:middle line:84%
challenging goals
and we make sure

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:49.170 align:middle line:84%
it happens at a predetermined
period of time in the future.

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.660 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I usually do.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.750 align:middle line:84%
We do a lot of vision
board exercises.

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.940 align:middle line:90%
We do a lot of visualization.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest thing that
I do with them is I actually

00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.740 align:middle line:90%
go and meditate with them.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:01.370 align:middle line:90%
I do yoga with them.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:04.177 align:middle line:90%
I do-- I cook foods for them.

00:28:04.177 --> 00:28:06.260 align:middle line:84%
I might go to their place,
look at their cupboard,

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.140 align:middle line:84%
and take out things
which is probably

00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:84%
everything in the cupboard
that's got sugar and not

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:12.640 align:middle line:90%
healthy for you.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.600 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very practical and hands
on in my approach as a coach.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.930 align:middle line:84%
And also-- I do use
NLP, but I'm not

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.650 align:middle line:84%
very big on what you
call the modalities.

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:84%
So I'm sorry, because I just
naturally practice them.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll hear from other
coaches EFT, and I'm like,

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.480 align:middle line:90%
I do that.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So definitely NLP,
I'm trained in that.

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:90%
But because my training--

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I've got my master's
in public health.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And they've got a lot of
mental health kind of tools

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.860 align:middle line:84%
that they've given us through
my master's coursework.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:47.840 align:middle line:90%
So I use a lot of those things.

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And because I also
am ongoing with

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:54.410 align:middle line:84%
my peer reciprocal coaching
in international coaching

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.170 align:middle line:84%
federation, you've got what
you call reciprocal coaching.

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So I always get coached
by other coaches.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I have
to coach someone.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:03.060 align:middle line:90%
So it's a reciprocal.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.140 align:middle line:84%
So I learn about other
people's techniques

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:84%
through other coaches
that are better than me

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.330 align:middle line:84%
and incorporate
whatever those things

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:12.650 align:middle line:90%
are in my coaching practice.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's forever,
forever evolving.

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.340 align:middle line:84%
I know that as
myself as a coach.

00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:20.780 align:middle line:84%
We're always picking
up new ways of relating

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:25.310 align:middle line:84%
the information and new ways
of teaching a particular tool--

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:26.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
>> --in the hope that somebody
is going to resonate with--

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.900 align:middle line:84%
they might not resonate with it
one way, but said another way,

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:33.900 align:middle line:90%
or shown another way--

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:90%
>> --they'll resonate.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:36.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.020 align:middle line:84%
And the greatest thing
about what I do with clients

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.480 align:middle line:84%
is we've got thousands and
thousands of video logs,

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:45.270 align:middle line:84%
because I videotape
every single interaction

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:46.520 align:middle line:90%
and give them a copy so that--

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, that's powerful.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>> It is very, very, very.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.327 align:middle line:84%
As you know with
actors and actresses,

00:29:51.327 --> 00:29:52.910 align:middle line:84%
they look at themselves
in the mirror.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So this is their way of
looking at themselves

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and hearing the
lies or the denials

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that they might still
be in ensconced in

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.940 align:middle line:84%
or in that they don't see it
until they look at the tape.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, remember that
in the session 2, you said,

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.160 align:middle line:90%
oh, yeah, I've stopped.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.758 align:middle line:84%
And in session 6,
you still haven't.

00:30:12.758 --> 00:30:14.300 align:middle line:84%
But you're telling
me you've stopped.

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.120 align:middle line:90%
See how believable you were.

00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.080 align:middle line:90%
So it really helps them.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:24.080 align:middle line:84%
It helps me as a coach because I
show that tape to my supervisor

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.360 align:middle line:84%
and to my mentor and
they listen to it

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.210 align:middle line:84%
and they give me very,
very detailed feedback

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.500 align:middle line:90%
about my coaching practice.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:32.300 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:33.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Wonderful.

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.530 align:middle line:84%
Maria, again, very
inspirational.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:37.940 align:middle line:90%
I have one last question.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:42.940 align:middle line:84%
>> One last question that we're
asking all of our speakers.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's around-- it's
around the I am statement,

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.530 align:middle line:90%
around the power of I am.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:53.900 align:middle line:84%
And we know that with any mental
health depression or anxiety,

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:57.820 align:middle line:84%
or any form of
mental health issue,

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.080 align:middle line:84%
the reframing of
who we are and how

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.045 align:middle line:84%
we see ourselves is so important
on that healing journey.

00:31:03.045 --> 00:31:03.845 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:03.845 --> 00:31:06.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And the power of I am
has been said through--

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.710 align:middle line:84%
throughout time by
philosophers and now

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:11.460 align:middle line:90%
validated through neuroscience.

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.510 align:middle line:84%
So the real question is, what do
you wake up reminding yourself

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:16.310 align:middle line:90%
of every morning?

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:17.210 align:middle line:90%
What is your I am?

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:22.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, power is a
big thing for me.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.380 align:middle line:90%
So I am powerful.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.210 align:middle line:90%
I am full.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:29.750 align:middle line:84%
I am strong, and
that type of thing.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Because working with people
with addiction issues,

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:38.650 align:middle line:84%
they will do everything in
their power to manipulate.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And it's al-- it's also
kind of in the subconscious.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So I really have to
be strong and very--

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.370 align:middle line:84%
really something that
they can lean on.

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, powerful
is something that I

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:84%
would say I am every
time I take on my day.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:58.590 align:middle line:84%
