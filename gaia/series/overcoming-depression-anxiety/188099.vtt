00:00:07.776 --> 00:00:14.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Demartini, thank
you so much for joining us.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.460 align:middle line:84%
It's an absolute pleasure
to have you here.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.260 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Before we get started, I
was wondering if you could--

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.500 align:middle line:84%
for the viewers that maybe
haven't yet come across

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.950 align:middle line:84%
your work, if you can just give
us a little bit of a journey

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:84%
of how you've come from a
chiropractor to now being one

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.700 align:middle line:84%
of the world's renowned
specialists in human behavior.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was just fascinated
by anything that maximized

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.630 align:middle line:84%
human awareness and potential
in healing since I was 17.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.120 align:middle line:84%
So I've been teaching
now for 43 years.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was involved in the
studying of psychology,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.420 align:middle line:84%
and biology, and
health care since way

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.310 align:middle line:90%
back in the beginning.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:90%
And I was practicing.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But I noticed--
even in practice,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I was noticing the
relationship between psychology

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:84%
and physiology and the mind-body
connection-- that was my focus.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.990 align:middle line:84%
I've written many
books in that area.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And so I've just
been doing that.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And I was lecturing even while
I was in school-- before school,

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.003 align:middle line:90%
during school, after school.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.420 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
got into practice,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:84%
I've been speaking, and
traveling, and doing this.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.720 align:middle line:90%
So I've been doing it all along.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that I just
transitioned from one

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.740 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:90%
I just kept expanding it.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Expanding the body of work.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.010 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things
that I love that I read--

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:84%
that you don't look at
depression as a disease.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.855 align:middle line:84%
You actually look at it
as a healing process.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Can you explain
a little bit more

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.262 align:middle line:90%
about what you mean by that?

00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would say this
depression is a comparison

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
of our current reality to
a unrealistic expectation,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.040 align:middle line:84%
fantasy, or delusion
that we're addicted to.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:90%
Many people are depressed.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.435 align:middle line:84%
And when I asked them, so what
are you expecting it to be?

00:01:48.435 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
And they go, well, it
should be this way.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Life should be this way
or this aspect of life

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.260 align:middle line:90%
should be this way.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.375 align:middle line:84%
When I asked them, so
if it was that way,

00:01:56.375 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:84%
what would be the
drawback to that?

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.318 align:middle line:90%
They have no drawbacks.

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:84%
So they have a
fantasy and a delusion

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
because everything in
life has two sides.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.172 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, their
reality is unfulfilling

00:02:05.172 --> 00:02:07.130 align:middle line:84%
because they're comparing
it to this thing that

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.439 align:middle line:90%
has no downsides.

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:10.550 align:middle line:84%
And so when life has
a balance, compared

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.370 align:middle line:84%
to something that has no
downside, they are depressed.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So I would say depression is a
feedback mechanism to awaken us

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.200 align:middle line:84%
consciously to the delusions,
and unrealistic expectations,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
and fancies that
we get addicted to,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and to give us an opportunity to
break that-- to associate pain

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.700 align:middle line:84%
with that fantasy pleasure
to help us stabilize

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:90%
ourselves and get in order.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.948 align:middle line:84%
But we keep having
this hedonic treadmill

00:02:31.948 --> 00:02:33.740 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to get on
one side of the world

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.825 align:middle line:84%
instead of embracing the
two sides of life, which

00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:90%
helps us stabilize ourself.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.340 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm seeing
there is, there

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
is a massive lesson around
honoring the law of polarity.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when we have objective
reasoning and we have a more

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.050 align:middle line:84%
balanced mind, we
are more stable--

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.630 align:middle line:84%
when we have some sort of a
subjective bias where we're

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.370 align:middle line:90%
striving for a one-sided world.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.410 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, there was
a teaching that said,

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.298 align:middle line:84%
the desire for that
which is unavailable

00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:01.340 align:middle line:84%
and the desire to avoid
that which is unavoidable

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:90%
is a source of human suffering.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And many people are striving
for a one-sided world instead

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.373 align:middle line:84%
of embracing the two sides
that life has to offer.

00:03:09.373 --> 00:03:11.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And how they can actually
complement one another.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:12.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You need both.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I asked a lady the
other day in one

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.250 align:middle line:84%
of my seminars, "The
Breakthrough Experience--"

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:90%
I said, if I gave you a magnet--

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and I said, I'm going to give
you $1 billion worth of cash

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.745 align:middle line:84%
if you can give me one
pole of the magnet back.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give
you the whole magnet.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.740 align:middle line:84%
Give me just the
positive pole back.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're ignorant, you
try to cut the magnet in half

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.940 align:middle line:90%
and try to get--

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.020 align:middle line:84%
but what happens when
you cut it in half?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.353 align:middle line:84%
You get two, little magnets
with positive and negative--

00:03:35.353 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:84%
or, if you cut it
again, four magnets.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.172 align:middle line:84%
You can't really
separate the two.

00:03:39.172 --> 00:03:40.880 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to separate
the inseparables,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:84%
and divide the indivisibles, and
try to label the unlabelables,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.700 align:middle line:84%
and name the ineffables, and
polarize the unpolarizables,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
and not embrace
both sides of life.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
So a person striving
for a one-sided magnet

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.570 align:middle line:90%
will be futile.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.500 align:middle line:90%
And this is what people feel.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.458 align:middle line:84%
They feel futile and
depressed because they are

00:03:56.458 --> 00:03:59.360 align:middle line:90%
striving for a one-sided world.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.360 align:middle line:90%
>> So the Demartini Method--

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.500 align:middle line:84%
when we're looking at overcoming
depression and anxiety as one

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.430 align:middle line:84%
particular area, you have a
very simple, three-step process.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.347 align:middle line:84%
Can you share what that
three-step process is?

00:04:12.347 --> 00:04:13.147 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:13.147 --> 00:04:15.230 align:middle line:84%
What are you specifically
comparing your life to,

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
the way you wish it would be,
which is sort of the delusion

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.100 align:middle line:90%
and fantasy?

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.410 align:middle line:90%
What's the drawbacks of that?

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.762 align:middle line:84%
And what's the
benefit of reality?

00:04:23.762 --> 00:04:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're comparing
yourself and your reality

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.250 align:middle line:84%
to something that's not
there, there's no way

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.780 align:middle line:84%
you can win because
that's not real.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.220 align:middle line:90%
What's real is what's real.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:84%
So what's the benefit
of what's real?

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.665 align:middle line:84%
And what's the drawback of the
fantasy you wish it would be?

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:38.540 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, you
can hold onto the idea

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.290 align:middle line:84%
that thing is supposed
to be a certain way

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.770 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be all
peachy keen when it's that way.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:90%
I have to share a story.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I had a gentleman that
was bitter and really

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.210 align:middle line:84%
resentful to his father, and
depressed because his father

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.010 align:middle line:90%
never showed affection for him.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And I asked him a simple
question in "The Breakthrough

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:84%
Experience--" so if your father
had done that in your life

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.190 align:middle line:84%
when you were 16,
before you left home

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.197 align:middle line:90%
when he kicked you out--

00:05:01.197 --> 00:05:03.530 align:middle line:84%
if he had been this affectionate
person like you wanted,

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.380 align:middle line:90%
what would've been the drawback?

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:84%
He goes, there would
be no drawback.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:90%
I'd have been happy.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.080 align:middle line:90%
What would be the drawback?

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.460 align:middle line:90%
He goes, I can't see any.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.990 align:middle line:84%
I said, did you have any
brothers and sisters?

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:90%
He goes, well, yeah.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.850 align:middle line:90%
I had a brother.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.433 align:middle line:84%
And did your father
give the affection

00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:84%
that you wished that you'd
gotten to the brother?

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:18.490 align:middle line:90%
He said, yeah.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.873 align:middle line:90%
He got all the affection.

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:21.790 align:middle line:84%
I said, would you trade
places with him today?

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:90%
He goes, no.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.270 align:middle line:90%
He's still living at home.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:90%
He's never growing up.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.710 align:middle line:84%
He's never even gone on
his own and has a job,

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.377 align:middle line:84%
but he's waiting for
the parents to die.

00:05:27.377 --> 00:05:30.778 align:middle line:84%
He's basically dependent,
an enabled disabled person.

00:05:30.778 --> 00:05:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I said, so you'd rather
have had that life?

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:84%
He goes, I would
have until I just

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:90%
realized what you just said.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.900 align:middle line:84%
I said, so what you got is
your father believed in you,

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.503 align:middle line:84%
and challenged
you, and said, go.

00:05:40.503 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:90%
You stand on your own.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't have done
that if he didn't believe

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.693 align:middle line:90%
you could do it.

00:05:43.693 --> 00:05:45.110 align:middle line:84%
And you're an
entrepreneur today--

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:90%
a very successful entrepreneur.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And your brother, who you
thought you wanted the life of,

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.760 align:middle line:90%
you wouldn't trade places today.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.052 align:middle line:84%
So what's the drawback of if
it would've been that way?

00:05:53.052 --> 00:05:55.400 align:middle line:84%
And he broke down in
tears and had affection

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.560 align:middle line:84%
for his father for the
first time since he was 16.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.210 align:middle line:90%
He was 42.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:84%
So he was comparing his
life, all those years,

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.137 align:middle line:84%
to what he thought it
should have been instead

00:06:03.137 --> 00:06:04.440 align:middle line:90%
of embracing the way it is.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And so many people are not
embracing life and being

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:84%
grateful for life the
way it is, and keep

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:84%
comparing it to something
that doesn't exist.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're starting to answer
my next question, which is,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.260 align:middle line:84%
the Demartini Method has got
some very specific underlining

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.760 align:middle line:84%
values and teachings that a lot
of the more traditional methods

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.540 align:middle line:84%
of psychology and
psychiatry don't have.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.010 align:middle line:84%
And from my observation, it's
what stands the Demartini

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Method as being
far more effective

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.082 align:middle line:84%
than perhaps some of the older,
more traditional methods.

00:06:40.082 --> 00:06:41.540 align:middle line:84%
Can you elaborate
a little bit more

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:43.100 align:middle line:84%
as to how you
would differentiate

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.240 align:middle line:90%
between those methods?

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.364 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:45.364 --> 00:06:49.730 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.730 align:middle line:84%
A century or so ago, there was
a guy named Jeremy Bentham, who

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.633 align:middle line:84%
created kind of a utilitarian
model of hedonism,

00:06:56.633 --> 00:06:59.300 align:middle line:84%
that we're supposed to be happy,
and supposed to be pleasureful,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.610 align:middle line:84%
and it's our birthright
to always be up, always

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.770 align:middle line:90%
be positive, always be happy.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.910 align:middle line:84%
And even your grandmother
said, be nice.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.710 align:middle line:90%
Don't be mean.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Be kind.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Don't be cruel.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:90%
Be positive.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Don't be negative.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.680 align:middle line:90%
Be giving.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Don't be taking.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:90%
And it's all one-sided.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And yet, she ends up going
and bitching at Grandpa

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.340 align:middle line:90%
and stealing from Grandpa.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.348 align:middle line:84%
So she has a
hypocrisy, in a sense.

00:07:19.348 --> 00:07:21.890 align:middle line:84%
And we have this fantasy where
it's supposed to be one-sided.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
And the foundation
of psychology--

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:90%
not all of it, but a lot of it--

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:90%
is animal psychology.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.577 align:middle line:84%
It's avoiding the predator
and seeking the prey--

00:07:30.577 --> 00:07:31.910 align:middle line:90%
avoiding pain, seeking pleasure.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.890 align:middle line:90%
It's very hedonistic.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.320 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with that model
is, if we were to do that,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:84%
and we would just eat sugar
and have sex all day long,

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.260 align:middle line:84%
and we'd have diabetics
and sexual problems.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom is embracing both sides
and more objective reasoning.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.870 align:middle line:84%
And when we live by
our highest values,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.347 align:middle line:84%
we have more
objective reasoning.

00:07:49.347 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
When we're unfulfilled in
life, we look, like an animal,

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.360 align:middle line:90%
for a one-sided world.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.120 align:middle line:84%
And I always say that addictive
behavior to a one-sided world

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.065 align:middle line:84%
is a compensation for
unfulfilled highest values.

00:07:59.065 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So when people
don't find meaning

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and don't find fulfillment doing
something that's meaningful,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.998 align:middle line:84%
and prioritizing their life,
and doing what really inspires

00:08:04.998 --> 00:08:07.580 align:middle line:84%
them, they'll be vulnerable
for avoiding pain and seeking

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.380 align:middle line:90%
pleasure.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.830 align:middle line:84%
An entire psychological
movement--

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.020 align:middle line:84%
which are called shrinks,
which shrink people,

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.810 align:middle line:84%
instead of stretchers,
who would stretch people--

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.660 align:middle line:84%
are basically promoting that
whole animalistic model.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm offering
in the Demartini Method

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.318 align:middle line:84%
is something more
transcendent than that,

00:08:21.318 --> 00:08:23.776 align:middle line:84%
something that allows people
to embrace both sides in life.

00:08:23.776 --> 00:08:25.151 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
get rid of half

00:08:25.151 --> 00:08:26.480 align:middle line:90%
of your life to love yourself.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.688 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to get rid
of half of the other people

00:08:28.688 --> 00:08:29.850 align:middle line:90%
in your life to love them.

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:31.750 align:middle line:84%
You just need to be
realistic about life.

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.312 align:middle line:84%
Because it has
pain and pleasure.

00:08:33.312 --> 00:08:34.520 align:middle line:90%
It has support and challenge.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:90%
It has both sides of life.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.164 align:middle line:84%
Even the marriage ceremonies,
when you look at it,

00:08:38.164 --> 00:08:40.280 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of, for richer, for
poor, for this or for that.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.129 align:middle line:90%
It's both.

00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:41.929 align:middle line:90%
But we forget that.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And we then want it to only
support us without challenge--

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.160 align:middle line:90%
ease without difficulty.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to ground
people and realize

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.750 align:middle line:84%
that life has both sides
and embrace both sides.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Because both are needed.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.520 align:middle line:84%
We don't grow if we
are only supported.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.270 align:middle line:84%
We stay juvenilely
dependent all our life.

00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:84%
If we get challenged, and
we get responsibilities,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:84%
we become precocious,
independent, and grow.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.040 align:middle line:90%
We need both.

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Maximum growth and
development occurs

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.570 align:middle line:84%
at the border of support and
challenge, ease and difficulty.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.375 align:middle line:84%
And real leaders are not trying
to shrink from challenge.

00:09:08.375 --> 00:09:10.750 align:middle line:84%
They go after challenges--
fill their day with challenges

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.200 align:middle line:90%
that inspire them.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.010 align:middle line:84%
Because that way, their life
doesn't fill up with challenges

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:14.810 align:middle line:90%
that don't.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
So embracing both
sides of life is

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:18.380 align:middle line:84%
the difference in
my model and the way

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.380 align:middle line:90%
that I work with people.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.005 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
it, we can transform

00:09:21.005 --> 00:09:23.120 align:middle line:84%
people that have depression
very quickly compared

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.962 align:middle line:90%
to what's being used out there.

00:09:24.962 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:84%
Because they're trying to
feed this fantasy in people

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:90%
and polarizing people from.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So something you mentioned
in that was the importance

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:84%
of getting really clear on
what your core values are.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.220 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:84%
First of all, how
can our audience,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:84%
who may right now be stuck
in a place of overwhelment,

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.100 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety, or in
a deep depression--

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.220 align:middle line:84%
what kind of simple
exercise can they

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.220 align:middle line:84%
start to do to start to
create some clearer core

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.460 align:middle line:84%
values that they can then
start to work on in order

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.843 align:middle line:84%
to take them closer to
understanding what creates

00:09:58.843 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:84%
meaning and purpose
in their life,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:84%
so they can start to make
choices that feed that?

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they don't need to
find values that do that.

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:90%
They already have them.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.530 align:middle line:84%
Every human being lives by a set
of priorities, a set of values

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.540 align:middle line:90%
already.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.315 align:middle line:84%
And we have this idea
that we're supposed

00:10:13.315 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:84%
to pick them up
from our parents,

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.695 align:middle line:84%
or get it from
society, or whatever.

00:10:16.695 --> 00:10:19.070 align:middle line:84%
But the people that really
made a difference in the world

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.020 align:middle line:84%
are not the people
that fit into society.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.395 align:middle line:84%
The people that
make a difference

00:10:22.395 --> 00:10:24.618 align:middle line:84%
are the people that are
transcending the implications

00:10:24.618 --> 00:10:26.660 align:middle line:84%
that society is always
imposing-- traditionalism,

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:90%
conventionalism.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the people
that do something

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.140 align:middle line:84%
beyond that that
actually contribute

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.980 align:middle line:90%
to the growth of society.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's not about trying
to get them into this

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:35.930 align:middle line:90%
or try to find them that way.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:37.565 align:middle line:84%
It's looking at our
life and looking

00:10:37.565 --> 00:10:38.815 align:middle line:90%
at what our life demonstrates.

00:10:38.815 --> 00:10:41.780 align:middle line:84%
Because our life demonstrates
our values already, right now.

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:84%
So you look at how
you fill your space.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.410 align:middle line:84%
You look at how you
spend your time.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.900 align:middle line:84%
You look at what
you're energized by.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
You look at what you
spend your money on.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.170 align:middle line:84%
You look at where
you're organized.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.790 align:middle line:84%
You look at where you're
disciplined, and reliable,

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:90%
and focused.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.270 align:middle line:84%
You look at what you think
about, and visualize, and talk

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.850 align:middle line:84%
to yourself about most that's
coming true in your life.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:00.590 align:middle line:84%
You look at what you want to
converse with other people

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:01.490 align:middle line:90%
about.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And you look also at
the goals that you

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.965 align:middle line:84%
have that are consistent and
persistent that you achieve.

00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:08.465 align:middle line:84%
And then look at what it is you
love learning, and studying,

00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:09.680 align:middle line:90%
and reading about most.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.722 align:middle line:90%
Those are the indicators.

00:11:10.722 --> 00:11:12.263 align:middle line:84%
Those are the value
determinants that

00:11:12.263 --> 00:11:14.180 align:middle line:84%
reveal to you what's
really important to you.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.555 align:middle line:84%
And the second
you set goals that

00:11:15.555 --> 00:11:18.140 align:middle line:84%
are aligned with that highest
value, the things that

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:84%
are really important,
you're more objective,

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.895 align:middle line:84%
you're more realistic, you're
more resilient and adaptable.

00:11:22.895 --> 00:11:24.020 align:middle line:90%
You tend to achieve things.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.810 align:middle line:84%
You tend to set goals
that are more manageable.

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.183 align:middle line:90%
You have your self governance.

00:11:28.183 --> 00:11:30.350 align:middle line:84%
The executive center in the
brain, the telencephalon

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:33.590 align:middle line:84%
comes online, and self-governs
you, and makes you strategic,

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:37.247 align:middle line:84%
and visionary, and really
go out there and execute.

00:11:37.247 --> 00:11:39.080 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't live
by the highest values,

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:41.275 align:middle line:84%
the unfulfilled activates
the amygdala area

00:11:41.275 --> 00:11:43.650 align:middle line:84%
of the brain which wants to
avoid pain and seek pleasure.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.912 align:middle line:90%
It's the animal brain.

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
most psychology is.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's where most
people are trapped.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.330 align:middle line:84%
They're looking for
a one-sided world,

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.260 align:middle line:90%
trying to avoid the other side.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And they're running around
this anxiety and fear

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:53.890 align:middle line:84%
all the time because
they're holding

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.640 align:middle line:84%
onto a fantasy
about how life is.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.827 align:middle line:90%
And the other side's there.

00:11:56.827 --> 00:11:58.660 align:middle line:84%
It's like trying to
have a two-sided magnet.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:84%
And they're wanting
to get one side

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and then the other side
keeps following you around.

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
expecting to get

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.210 align:middle line:84%
rid of the other
side of the magnet.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.790 align:middle line:84%
And the other side's there,
and I don't want that.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.415 align:middle line:84%
So they're fearful
of that other magnet

00:12:07.415 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:90%
side coming, when they need it.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.640 align:middle line:90%
They need it to grow.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm interested in helping
people find their own values,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.420 align:middle line:90%
their highest values.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.383 align:middle line:84%
On my website, I
have a tool on there

00:12:17.383 --> 00:12:18.550 align:middle line:90%
that they can follow simply.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.630 align:middle line:90%
It's free.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:20.650 align:middle line:90%
Drdemartini.com.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.273 align:middle line:84%
They can go on there, and
learn how to find their values,

00:12:23.273 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
and start orchestrating, and
prioritizing, and structuring

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:26.920 align:middle line:90%
their life accordingly.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.600 align:middle line:84%
When they do, they're
more resilient.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.580 align:middle line:84%
They're more realistic
in their expectations.

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:31.398 align:middle line:90%
They achieve more.

00:12:31.398 --> 00:12:32.440 align:middle line:90%
Their self worth goes up.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Their internal dialogue changes.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:36.220 align:middle line:84%
They are saying thank
you for life instead

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:39.250 align:middle line:90%
of the other things in life.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So in your experience--
and I know how many hundreds

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of people that
you've helped transform

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.350 align:middle line:90%
their lives--

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.800 align:middle line:84%
have you observed a
certain belief system

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.170 align:middle line:84%
that is common amongst
those that suffer

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:54.850 align:middle line:90%
from depression or anxiety?

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.410 align:middle line:84%
They're expecting to live
in other people's values

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.745 align:middle line:84%
and they're trying to live
outside their own values.

00:13:01.745 --> 00:13:04.120 align:middle line:84%
Or they're expecting other
people to live in their values

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.980 align:middle line:90%
or outside their values.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.650 align:middle line:84%
Or they're expecting the world
to be a one-sided world, which

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:90%
is not possible.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Or they're expecting
mechanical objects

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.800 align:middle line:84%
to work in a way that
matches their fantasy.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.550 align:middle line:84%
So they have unrealistic
expectations.

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.410 align:middle line:84%
There's 15 most
common ones that I

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.620 align:middle line:90%
found that lead to depression.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.130 align:middle line:84%
The unrealistic expectation
that the people around them

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.653 align:middle line:90%
are supposed to be one-sided.

00:13:25.653 --> 00:13:28.070 align:middle line:84%
They're always supposed to be
nice, not mean, always kind,

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:30.040 align:middle line:90%
not cruel, giving, not taking.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.130 align:middle line:90%
Nobody's that way.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not nice.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.520 align:middle line:90%
I'm nice and mean.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm kind and cruel.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm generous and stingy.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.610 align:middle line:90%
I'm everything.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.010 align:middle line:84%
I've learned that I
have all 4,628 traits

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:41.370 align:middle line:84%
that I've ever found in
the "Oxford Dictionary."

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you expect
somebody to be one-sided,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.050 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have what I
call the ABCDs of negativity--

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:84%
Anger and Aggression, Blame
and Betrayal, Criticism

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and Challenge, Despair
and Depression.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Add E-- Exit and Escape.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.720 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
want escape life.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Those ABCDEs of
negativity are a byproduct

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.860 align:middle line:84%
of having unrealistic
expectations.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Then, you're expecting other
people to live in your values

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:03.850 align:middle line:90%
or outside their own values.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.530 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be angry now
for that because that's not

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:06.430 align:middle line:90%
going to happen.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they make decisions
based on their values.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.700 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going
to expect yourself

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.682 align:middle line:84%
to live outside your values
or in a one-sided world.

00:14:12.682 --> 00:14:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Or you're expecting
the world to be

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.110 align:middle line:84%
that way, or live in your
values-- the whole world's

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:17.360 align:middle line:90%
supposed to match your values.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.630 align:middle line:90%
These are delusions.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Or you're expecting
objects, mechanical things,

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.240 align:middle line:84%
to work the way you
fantasize instead

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:90%
of the way they're designed.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:84%
So anytime you have all these
unrealistic expectations,

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.090 align:middle line:84%
depression is a
feedback mechanism

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.800 align:middle line:84%
to let you know that
you're projecting

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.630 align:middle line:84%
unrealistic expectations
onto the world,

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and onto people,
and onto yourself.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And the second you stop that,
and set realistic expectations,

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:84%
you're depression
doesn't have to be there.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:39.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not a disease.

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a normal,
biological response

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:43.960 align:middle line:90%
to unrealistic expectations.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm
hearing there, then--

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:50.860 align:middle line:84%
that part of the pivotal point
of change is to choose to no

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.990 align:middle line:84%
longer be of victim
consciousness

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.610 align:middle line:90%
of your circumstances.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've never seen a
victim consciousness who blames

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.550 align:middle line:84%
People who blame
things on the outside

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:00.883 align:middle line:90%
look for saviors on the outside.

00:15:00.883 --> 00:15:03.383 align:middle line:84%
They look for things
out there to save them.

00:15:03.383 --> 00:15:05.050 align:middle line:84%
And they become
addicted to those things

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.050 align:middle line:84%
they think is going to
save them from this thing

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:08.170 align:middle line:90%
that they're blaming.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:09.953 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen that
make empowerment.

00:15:09.953 --> 00:15:11.620 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people take
on accountability,

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:84%
and take on their own
cause and their own effect,

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.300 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden,
transform their perception.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.770 align:middle line:84%
William James basically said
that the greatest discovery

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.520 align:middle line:84%
of his generation is
that human beings can

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.520 align:middle line:84%
alter their lives by
alternating the perceptions

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.520 align:middle line:90%
and attitudes of mind.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.640 align:middle line:90%
I find that to be true.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.590 align:middle line:90%
You can change your perception.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
Every weekend in "The
Breakthrough Experience,"

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.340 align:middle line:84%
I have people with the
most horrendous stuff

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.560 align:middle line:90%
that they've had in life.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And yet, they're willing
to run stories over,

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.190 align:middle line:84%
and they want to
be victims of it,

00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and they want to just go
on, and on, and on about it.

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:37.900 align:middle line:84%
And I stopped the story
because it validates the brain

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.987 align:middle line:90%
and keeps them stuck.

00:15:38.987 --> 00:15:41.320 align:middle line:84%
And I say, let's look at it
from a different perspective

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.150 align:middle line:90%
and ask, how does it serve you?

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.920 align:middle line:84%
And if it had not happened,
what would've been the drawback?

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.212 align:middle line:90%
And ask a new set of questions.

00:15:46.212 --> 00:15:48.023 align:middle line:84%
I have 48 questions
that I ask people.

00:15:48.023 --> 00:15:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And when, all of a
sudden, they're done,

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.820 align:middle line:84%
they're in tears of gratitude
from the same event.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.320 align:middle line:84%
It had nothing to
do with the event.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:84%
It's all about the
perception of the event.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:56.170 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of
a sudden, instead

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:84%
of blaming the
environment or whatever

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.860 align:middle line:84%
that had caused their
problem, or they're

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:84%
blaming their parents, or
their family dynamics--

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I hear this all the time.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:04.050 align:middle line:90%
They change it.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:84%
And then they're
thankful for that.

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.380 align:middle line:84%
Anything you can't say
thank you for is baggage.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:84%
Anything you can say
thank you for is fuel.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:10.880 align:middle line:90%
That's powerful.

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.190 align:middle line:90%
>> That's really powerful.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:14.732 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm very grateful to be able
to work with people and watch

00:16:14.732 --> 00:16:15.800 align:middle line:90%
this happen--

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.823 align:middle line:84%
very inspiring to watch
the light bulbs go on,

00:16:17.823 --> 00:16:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and people all of
a sudden realize

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.740 align:middle line:84%
that there's nothing
wrong with them

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.198 align:middle line:84%
and there's nothing wrong with
what happened in their life.

00:16:23.198 --> 00:16:24.370 align:middle line:90%
It's just an experience.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:25.180 align:middle line:90%
It's an event.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the other thing
that I love about your work,

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:32.950 align:middle line:84%
is that it just completely takes
the stigma out of there being

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.110 align:middle line:90%
a mental health problem.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:84%
When you look at it as
a feedback mechanism,

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.837 align:middle line:84%
to give you feedback as
to basically, what you do

00:16:39.837 --> 00:16:41.170 align:middle line:90%
want versus what you don't want.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:43.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I really believe that all
of the signs and symptoms

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.940 align:middle line:84%
of our body are feedback
mechanisms to guide us to live

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:47.070 align:middle line:90%
authentically.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.650 align:middle line:84%
And that sounds kind
of broad, but really

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.050 align:middle line:84%
going into the depth of what
that means is very significant.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:56.180 align:middle line:84%
Very commonly, I have people
come to me in "The Breakthrough

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.980 align:middle line:84%
Experience" and they say, well,
I have a biochemical imbalance.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.712 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I have
bipolar, or schizoid behavior,

00:17:01.712 --> 00:17:03.420 align:middle line:84%
or dissociative
disorder-- all this stuff

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:05.900 align:middle line:84%
is because I have a biochemical
imbalance in the brain.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.700 align:middle line:90%
And I go, OK.

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.500 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.579 align:middle line:90%
But I explained to them.

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I said, imagine
being in this room.

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.310 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
I open up the door.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.069 align:middle line:84%
And a giant tiger jumps in,
and leaps across the room,

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.069 align:middle line:90%
and is going toward you.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's got its fangs out, and
it's about to eat your head.

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.422 align:middle line:90%
And you turn, and you look.

00:17:21.422 --> 00:17:22.380 align:middle line:90%
And you go, oh my god--

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.180 align:middle line:90%
tiger!

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.450 align:middle line:90%
And you protect yourself.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.970 align:middle line:84%
If we stop and got a
"Men in Black" pen--

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:84%
stopped everything, and all
of a sudden say, all right,

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.550 align:middle line:84%
let's go and do a
biochemistry on their brain,

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.960 align:middle line:84%
we would find that
the dopamine is low,

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:84%
the enkephalins are down,
serotonin has dropped.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.780 align:middle line:84%
Vasopressin, oxytocin,
estrogen are all dropped.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.075 align:middle line:84%
And epinephrine, norepinephrine,
testosterone, histamine,

00:17:46.075 --> 00:17:48.450 align:middle line:84%
substance P, and all these
other chemistries in the brain

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:49.950 align:middle line:90%
are all skyrocketing.

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:52.080 align:middle line:84%
Right there, on the spot,
from that perception,

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:90%
change chemistry.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So if we freeze
frame it, we'd find

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.968 align:middle line:90%
that biochemical imbalance, see?

00:17:56.968 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Because they're imagining
being eaten by a tiger.

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.042 align:middle line:84%
So their perception has
lied, thinking they're

00:18:01.042 --> 00:18:02.250 align:middle line:90%
going to be eaten by a tiger.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:84%
Then, if I take the pen and
stop, and let the tiger come,

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:09.150 align:middle line:84%
and it jumps, and it licks them,
and it tells them it's Tony

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Tiger, and it hugs
them, all of a sudden,

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:15.450 align:middle line:84%
the person then-- we stop,
freeze frame it again,

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:84%
and actually, they
go, oh my god--

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.450 align:middle line:90%
a little, beautiful tiger.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:19.763 align:middle line:90%
It's my little, pet tiger.

00:18:19.763 --> 00:18:21.930 align:middle line:84%
And we go and we see the
complete opposite chemistry

00:18:21.930 --> 00:18:23.010 align:middle line:90%
occur.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.230 align:middle line:84%
So if it is
biochemistry by itself,

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:27.632 align:middle line:90%
how can it change that quick?

00:18:27.632 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, everybody has
had this experience

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.820 align:middle line:90%
where they're sitting at home.

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:31.620 align:middle line:90%
It's a weekend.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.310 align:middle line:84%
The husband and
wife are fighting.

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:34.950 align:middle line:90%
They're having this quarrel.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.297 align:middle line:84%
And they're really
at each other.

00:18:37.297 --> 00:18:38.880 align:middle line:84%
They're really going
after each other.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of the
sudden, the doorbell rings.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.700 align:middle line:84%
And a friend they
haven't seen in 20 years

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:90%
goes in the doorbell.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:84%
Just happened to be
the neighborhood!

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And they stop the
fighting and go, hi!

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.050 align:middle line:84%
They put on a facade,
and they suppress that.

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.930 align:middle line:84%
And it goes now unconscious
and subconscious.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And then for two hours and
hang out with their friends.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.700 align:middle line:84%
And they never get back
to complete the fight,

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.830 align:middle line:84%
but they've still got
memories and stored

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:84%
secondary and
tertiary associations

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:90%
to that original event.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:05.032 align:middle line:84%
And so now, what happens
is all that's subconscious.

00:19:05.032 --> 00:19:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And they go about their
business and everything else.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And now, almost anything can
trigger that original memory

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.800 align:middle line:90%
that's never been balanced.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And so, those things drive
biochemistries and leave

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.620 align:middle line:84%
people in biochemical
imbalance, not

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.860 align:middle line:84%
because it's just randomly
there-- the biochemistry

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.157 align:middle line:90%
in the brain is not working.

00:19:20.157 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:84%
It's because we've
accumulated a whole bunch

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.168 align:middle line:84%
of unconscious and
subconscious stuff

00:19:24.168 --> 00:19:26.460 align:middle line:84%
that we've never neutralized,
and balanced in our life,

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.268 align:middle line:84%
and seen in a
balanced perspective.

00:19:29.268 --> 00:19:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And so it's sitting there,
running our chemistry.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:35.760 align:middle line:84%
And we don't have a way of
testing that real mind state.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.370 align:middle line:84%
All we're looking
at is chemistry.

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's the problem with
some of the psychiatric work.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:84%
They find that there's
a zebra in the bathtub,

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.468 align:middle line:90%
but they don't ask why.

00:19:44.468 --> 00:19:45.510 align:middle line:90%
They measure the stripes.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.340 align:middle line:90%
They measure the dung.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.040 align:middle line:84%
They might measure the length of
the zebra, but they don't ask,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:84%
why is there a zebra
in the bathtub?

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.665 align:middle line:84%
Why is there a
biochemistry imbalance?

00:19:51.665 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:84%
It's because of
those imbalances,

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.120 align:middle line:84%
and they've never
been addressed.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:55.662 align:middle line:84%
Because we go in
there and neutralize

00:19:55.662 --> 00:19:58.410 align:middle line:84%
those with the Demartini Method,
and we change chemistries.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:19:59.910 align:middle line:84%
They go, well,
something's happened.

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:00.750 align:middle line:90%
Your brain changed.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:05.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So I was just about to ask,
what in the Demartini Method

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:08.040 align:middle line:84%
enables you to help
somebody who's in a place

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:84%
of subconscious or unaware of
the past emotional experiences

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
that they are still
biochemically responding

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.390 align:middle line:90%
to by other triggers?

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:84%
What's the process that you
take people through that--

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> You've got a number
of ways of doing it.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:84%
You can actually go back
and peel the onion back,

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:26.550 align:middle line:84%
layer by layer, and eventually
get to these core issues that

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:27.392 align:middle line:90%
are back there.

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
You can ask them their history,
and sometimes their history

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.010 align:middle line:84%
can reveal what this
thing was triggered by.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.840 align:middle line:84%
You can look at
anxieties because anxiety

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
is secondary and tertiary
compounding of original events

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.583 align:middle line:90%
that have never been balanced.

00:20:38.583 --> 00:20:40.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, things are reminding
you of those events,

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.320 align:middle line:84%
and they're not even aware that
those things are associated

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:90%
with the original event.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.560 align:middle line:90%
We had a young boy that--

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.480 align:middle line:84%
his mother and
father were fighting.

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And the father was
wearing a white shirt,

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.940 align:middle line:84%
had brown hair, brown
mustache, blue jeans.

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And they they're fighting,
and he got really aggressive

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.040 align:middle line:90%
to the mother.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.457 align:middle line:84%
The child didn't
want to see that,

00:20:57.457 --> 00:21:00.360 align:middle line:84%
and it went and crawled into
its room, and covered its ears,

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.850 align:middle line:84%
and closed its eyes,
and hid under the bed.

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.380 align:middle line:90%
So it was associated--

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.070 align:middle line:84%
that image with pain,
seeing Mommy get hurt.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.810 align:middle line:84%
So the next day, Daddy
went off to work,

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and Mommy took the boy
to the grocery store.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.820 align:middle line:84%
But now, at the grocery store,
there's a man with blue jeans

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and a white shirt with
brown hair and a mustache.

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.870 align:middle line:84%
The second he came
down the aisle,

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:22.080 align:middle line:84%
the baby got in front of the
mother to protect the mother,

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.090 align:middle line:84%
and turned around, and
started making a tantrum

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:25.230 align:middle line:90%
to get the mother away.

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So this was a
secondary association

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.470 align:middle line:90%
with the primary event.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And these things
can go tertiary,

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and quaternary, and they
can just keep compounding,

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.780 align:middle line:84%
and now, all of a sudden,
a guy with blue jeans

00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:35.280 align:middle line:84%
and a yellow shirt
with brown hair,

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.310 align:middle line:84%
or now a guy with a white shirt,
blond hair, and blue jeans.

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:39.685 align:middle line:84%
There's different
things that can

00:21:39.685 --> 00:21:40.950 align:middle line:90%
make secondary associations.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:42.408 align:middle line:84%
After a while, we
don't even know

00:21:42.408 --> 00:21:43.950 align:middle line:84%
all of the things
that are triggering

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:45.992 align:middle line:84%
the original event that's
making us feel anxious,

00:21:45.992 --> 00:21:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and it's raising
our blood pressure,

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's causing these
changes and chemistry changes.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And then, we go to
the psychiatrist.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:53.740 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well, you have a
biochemical imbalance again.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And you have these
imbalanced things.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.557 align:middle line:84%
We've got to change
your chemistry

00:21:56.557 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:90%
and give this anti-anxiety pill.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:21:59.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's fine.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.340 align:middle line:90%
That's a quick pill, for real.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.525 align:middle line:84%
But the reality is, you
have command over your life.

00:22:03.525 --> 00:22:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to give
it away, that's fine.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to take
command, there's work involved.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
want to do the work.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:84%
But if they do the work,
they can give themselves

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:11.917 align:middle line:90%
their power back.

00:22:11.917 --> 00:22:13.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'd rather work there.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather help people
reclaim their power

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:19.100 align:middle line:84%
than give them blame on the
outside and a magic pill

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:20.600 align:middle line:90%
from the outside.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I've seen, and
experienced as well from

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:25.460 align:middle line:84%
participating in some
of your workshops,

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:32.650 align:middle line:84%
is that in five days, you can
transform what psychiatrists,

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:37.010 align:middle line:84%
psychologists can spend a number
of years working on the same

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.428 align:middle line:84%
thing with people by
using these methods.

00:22:39.428 --> 00:22:41.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in "The Breakthrough
Experience," which is two days,

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:84%
which I do almost every
city-- every weekend,

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm doing it somewhere
in the world--

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.350 align:middle line:90%
we don't do it in five days.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.450 align:middle line:84%
We do it in a matter
of hours sometimes.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of these conditions
are resolved in hours.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.100 align:middle line:90%
It's quite amazing.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:59.420 align:middle line:84%
But I don't label
disease as a condition.

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:02.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't say, well, we're
treating it, or, I'm curing it.

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.160 align:middle line:90%
I don't like that stamp.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.008 align:middle line:84%
I think that's creating
a label on people.

00:23:06.008 --> 00:23:07.550 align:middle line:84%
I just say that
you're a human being.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:08.520 align:middle line:90%
You have physiology.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.905 align:middle line:90%
It's doing its job.

00:23:09.905 --> 00:23:12.840 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're having
an unrealistic expectation

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and life's not
matching it, you're

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.500 align:middle line:90%
going to change your chemistry.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.417 align:middle line:84%
And your chemistry is
doing what it's designed

00:23:17.417 --> 00:23:19.350 align:middle line:90%
to do in those perceptions.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:21.110 align:middle line:84%
So instead of seeing
it as illness,

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:84%
why not see it as what your
body is designed to do,

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.070 align:middle line:90%
and it's giving you a feedback?

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.510 align:middle line:90%
I use the analogy--

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:84%
if you went out and ate a
pizza, and then a steak,

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and then a bowl of sauerkraut,
and then a cheesecake, and then

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.300 align:middle line:84%
a chocolate cake, and
then a bunch of prunes,

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and then some tomatoes,
and then went out

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.830 align:middle line:90%
and had some beans, and--

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:41.517 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm already
feeling the feedback.

00:23:41.517 --> 00:23:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The next morning,
when you wake up,

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.280 align:middle line:90%
you're going to be puffy eyes.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.613 align:middle line:90%
You're going to have a headache.

00:23:45.613 --> 00:23:48.785 align:middle line:84%
You're to have bloat, and
cramps, and gas, and diarrhea,

00:23:48.785 --> 00:23:51.920 align:middle line:84%
and stomach cramps, and
nauseas, and oily skin,

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.755 align:middle line:90%
and all that stuff.

00:23:52.755 --> 00:23:54.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you go to
some medical doctor,

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.440 align:middle line:84%
he'd probably say, well,
you need an anti-flatulent,

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.460 align:middle line:90%
an anti-histamine.

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.770 align:middle line:90%
You need anti-cramp.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:01.750 align:middle line:90%
You need anti-this.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And he's giving you a
symptom because he's

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:04.917 align:middle line:84%
trying to get rid
of your symptoms

00:24:04.917 --> 00:24:07.520 align:middle line:90%
so you can feel positive, happy.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:84%
That model is still like
the psychology model,

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.050 align:middle line:84%
still trying to avoid
pain and seek pleasure.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.570 align:middle line:84%
But if you go to another
health professional that's

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:84%
thinking more of a feedback
mechanism, he says,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.483 align:middle line:84%
your history shows
that you pigged out,

00:24:19.483 --> 00:24:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and your symptoms
in your body are

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.530 align:middle line:90%
trying to wake you up to that.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't regulate that,
and you keep taking medication,

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.080 align:middle line:84%
and you don't get the lesson,
you'll keep taking medication,

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:28.900 align:middle line:90%
keep pigging out.

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:29.900 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of the symptoms.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Keep pigging out,
and never grow up

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:34.430 align:middle line:84%
and get the feedback that your
body's trying to offer you.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:36.888 align:middle line:84%
So I really believe that a lot
of the symptoms that we have

00:24:36.888 --> 00:24:39.590 align:middle line:84%
that we think are illness
are actually wellness,

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.800 align:middle line:84%
trying to guide us back to
balanced and authentic living,

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:84%
to live by our highest
values, to live fulfilled.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.690 align:middle line:84%
So it's wise to
ask those questions

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.910 align:middle line:84%
and find meaning in
the disease instead

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.680 align:middle line:90%
of label of the disease.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.140 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.010 align:middle line:84%
So can we talk
about environment?

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:01.040 align:middle line:84%
In my experience, often
when I'm helping people

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.380 align:middle line:84%
with depression or
anxiety, because

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:84%
of their mental
state at that time,

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.360 align:middle line:84%
they often are not looking
after their environment.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.570 align:middle line:84%
That has a massive influence,
again, in their perception.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.590 align:middle line:84%
So what advice
can we give people

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:20.900 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how to look
after their environment

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.150 align:middle line:84%
more effectively to support
their mental and emotional

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:24.950 align:middle line:90%
state?

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:29.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a, "grant me
the wisdom to know when I can

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.390 align:middle line:84%
control things and not
control things," as they say.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.307 align:middle line:84%
There's some things you
may be able to control

00:25:34.307 --> 00:25:36.800 align:middle line:84%
in your environment,
and it's wise to do so.

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.900 align:middle line:84%
It's wise to bring in
order and organization,

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.013 align:middle line:84%
and help you
accomplish your goals.

00:25:42.013 --> 00:25:44.555 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, if there's
nothing you can do about it,

00:25:44.555 --> 00:25:45.410 align:middle line:84%
and it's somebody
else's environment,

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:47.877 align:middle line:84%
and you happen to be there,
you could change, and say,

00:25:47.877 --> 00:25:48.710 align:middle line:90%
thank you very much.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:49.918 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to stay in a hotel.

00:25:49.918 --> 00:25:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm going to grow and
become entrepreneur-like

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and so I can pay
for my own life.

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.720 align:middle line:84%
You could go and empower
yourself, and go and create

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.063 align:middle line:90%
another environment.

00:25:58.063 --> 00:26:00.230 align:middle line:84%
Or you could go in there
and change your perception.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:01.710 align:middle line:84%
I always say you have
two things you can do.

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:04.280 align:middle line:84%
You can change your actions, and
prioritize them, and delegate

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:05.988 align:middle line:84%
lower-priority things,
and get onto doing

00:26:05.988 --> 00:26:07.340 align:middle line:90%
what's more meaningful to you.

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.960 align:middle line:84%
Or you can change
your perceptions

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:90%
of what's happening.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's
wise to master both.

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:13.260 align:middle line:84%
I think it's wise to
go in and take whatever

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.240 align:middle line:84%
is happening in
your environment,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.920 align:middle line:90%
and find out how you can use it.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.660 align:middle line:84%
Because no matter
what happens, there's

00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
a way of using it
to your advantage.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:21.860 align:middle line:84%
I had a gentleman
that was basically

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.600 align:middle line:84%
bitching about his family and
how they are this and that.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
And I said, so let's look at how
we can use it to our advantage.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.460 align:middle line:84%
He goes, well, there
is no advantage to it.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.480 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm a dysfunctional family.

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:31.550 align:middle line:90%
That's where I come from.

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:33.633 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, if you want
to label that and follow

00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:34.910 align:middle line:90%
that pathway, that's fine.

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:84%
That's started by John Bradshaw,
who I knew a long time ago,

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:38.735 align:middle line:90%
and that whole model.

00:26:38.735 --> 00:26:40.110 align:middle line:84%
I said, but you
could go in there

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:41.570 align:middle line:90%
and say, how can you use it?

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And we sat down
for about two hours

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.555 align:middle line:84%
and took everything
that he despised

00:26:45.555 --> 00:26:47.180 align:middle line:84%
and hated about his
environment, and we

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:49.010 align:middle line:84%
asked how he could
use it to help him

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:90%
fulfill what's most valuable.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.160 align:middle line:84%
We found out what was
valuable to his life, what

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.990 align:middle line:84%
his life demonstrated
was important to him.

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And we asked, how is that
experience helping him?

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.390 align:middle line:90%
At first, he said, no, nothing.

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:00.200 align:middle line:90%
Look again.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
has two sides.

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So what is the
benefit side to it?

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:05.110 align:middle line:90%
And we looked for it.

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.140 align:middle line:90%
And we found it.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, his
anxiety, and his stress,

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and his fear about those
doing it-- because fear

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:12.590 align:middle line:84%
is an assumption that
you're about to experience

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.870 align:middle line:84%
more pain and pleasure,
more loss and gain.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.870 align:middle line:84%
But that's your perception
that's creating that.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.995 align:middle line:84%
You can change your perception
and all of a sudden,

00:27:18.995 --> 00:27:20.150 align:middle line:90%
change that whole feeling.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:21.350 align:middle line:90%
>> And change the biochemistry.

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.387 align:middle line:90%
Change your chemistry.

00:27:22.387 --> 00:27:24.560 align:middle line:84%
If I was to take your
thumb, put it on the table,

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.450 align:middle line:84%
and take a hammer and
slam it, you'd think,

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:27.492 align:middle line:90%
what the hell's going on?

00:27:27.492 --> 00:27:28.420 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong with you?

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.690 align:middle line:90%
And you'd go, ow!

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:30.950 align:middle line:90%
That's crazy.

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:84%
But if I told you I'm going
to give you $1 billion cash

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:35.302 align:middle line:90%
if I slam your thumb on it--

00:27:35.302 --> 00:27:37.260 align:middle line:84%
>> How many people put
their thumb right there?

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:39.550 align:middle line:84%
>> You just say, that's
$1 billion, cash.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.360 align:middle line:90%
You go, woo!

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.415 align:middle line:84%
Slam my thumb and for
$5,000, I can repair it.

00:27:44.415 --> 00:27:46.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, they take it, and
they go put it out there.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.350 align:middle line:84%
They'd actually be looking
forward to it because there's

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.700 align:middle line:90%
enough reward for it.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.530 align:middle line:84%
So instead of waiting
for the rewards

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.543 align:middle line:84%
out there to come
to you mysteriously,

00:27:53.543 --> 00:27:54.710 align:middle line:90%
why don't you look for them?

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.127 align:middle line:84%
Why not take the
same environment,

00:27:56.127 --> 00:27:58.669 align:middle line:84%
and find out how it serves you,
and use it to your advantage?

00:27:58.669 --> 00:28:00.919 align:middle line:84%
If you can move on and say
goodbye to the environment,

00:28:00.919 --> 00:28:01.760 align:middle line:90%
great.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.990 align:middle line:84%
But if you're in
that environment

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:05.198 align:middle line:84%
and you're not ready to move
on because you're young,

00:28:05.198 --> 00:28:06.980 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, and you're
not as empowered,

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.355 align:middle line:84%
either it will
catalyze you to go

00:28:08.355 --> 00:28:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and empower you to go create
your own environment the way

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.800 align:middle line:84%
you want it or you'll
find out how it serves you

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.140 align:middle line:90%
and use it to your advantage.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.890 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
a victim of anything.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.570 align:middle line:84%
You're just asking
yourself questions.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm hearing
there is that there's really

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:22.310 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity in every
moment to see the gift

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:middle line:90%
in the struggle.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I really believe that the
wisdom is the instantaneous

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:29.870 align:middle line:84%
recognition that
crisis is blessing,

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.740 align:middle line:84%
that tragedy is ecstasy,
that terrible is terrific,

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.887 align:middle line:84%
and all pairs of opposites
are actually one thing.

00:28:36.887 --> 00:28:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't see
it, it's because you've

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.980 align:middle line:90%
chosen not to look.

00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:41.090 align:middle line:90%
It's always there.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:43.550 align:middle line:84%
I've yet to find somebody in
"The Breakthrough Experience"

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.425 align:middle line:84%
that have had traumatic
events, or whatever--

00:28:45.425 --> 00:28:46.483 align:middle line:90%
challenging events--

00:28:46.483 --> 00:28:48.150 align:middle line:84%
that we can't find
the other side to it.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:49.190 align:middle line:90%
And we just keep living.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.030 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to
ruin their story.

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:50.690 align:middle line:90%
It's not there.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to look.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:52.040 align:middle line:90%
They don't want to look.

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.623 align:middle line:84%
But when they actually pin them
down, and get there, and look,

00:28:54.623 --> 00:28:55.630 align:middle line:90%
they find it.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:57.218 align:middle line:90%
So it was there the whole time.

00:28:57.218 --> 00:28:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And I always say,
why have the wisdom

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.230 align:middle line:84%
of the ages with
the aging process

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.580 align:middle line:84%
when you can have the wisdom
of the ages without it?

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.320 align:middle line:84%
The quality of your life's based
on the quality of the questions

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.120 align:middle line:90%
you ask.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.850 align:middle line:84%
If you ask questions and reveal
to you both sides of an event,

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:10.280 align:middle line:84%
you liberate yourself
from the emotional baggage

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:12.850 align:middle line:90%
of one-sided thinking.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.850 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:15.650 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do,
just for a moment,

00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:20.540 align:middle line:84%
is to step more into
the corporate world

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.440 align:middle line:84%
and have a look at the challenge
of corporate mental health

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and the stress within
the working environment.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:31.280 align:middle line:84%
In your opinion, how could
corporate environments

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.160 align:middle line:84%
and corporate working
ethics improve

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:36.830 align:middle line:84%
to actually help
support and reduce

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.950 align:middle line:84%
the work-related mental
health and stress?

00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:43.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, every human being
lives by a set of priorities,

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.510 align:middle line:90%
a set of values.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:47.900 align:middle line:84%
And they don't go to work
for the sake of the company.

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:50.840 align:middle line:84%
They go to work to fulfill
what's most meaningful to them,

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.550 align:middle line:90%
their highest values.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:55.160 align:middle line:84%
So when you're hiring
somebody, in my opinion,

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.480 align:middle line:90%
I think it's wise--

00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.340 align:middle line:90%
and I train companies on that--

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.760 align:middle line:84%
to identify what's truly
their values first.

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.223 align:middle line:84%
Because if every
decision they make

00:30:03.223 --> 00:30:05.390 align:middle line:84%
is based on what they believe
will give the greatest

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.310 align:middle line:84%
advantage over disadvantage,
greatest reward over risk

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.388 align:middle line:90%
to their highest values.

00:30:08.388 --> 00:30:10.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't know what
their highest value is,

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:11.960 align:middle line:84%
you really don't
who the person is.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.692 align:middle line:84%
Because their highest value,
their life revolves around.

00:30:14.692 --> 00:30:16.400 align:middle line:84%
So first, identify
what their values are.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.740 align:middle line:84%
That takes 30 minutes on
the value determination

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:20.745 align:middle line:90%
process on the website.

00:30:20.745 --> 00:30:22.120 align:middle line:84%
Once they've done
that, then it's

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.980 align:middle line:84%
wise to go and take the job
description and the mission,

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.040 align:middle line:84%
vision, and primary
objectives of the company

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.190 align:middle line:84%
and to see how congruent
they are with those values.

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're
about to hire somebody

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.705 align:middle line:84%
and they can't see how their
job description is going

00:30:33.705 --> 00:30:35.463 align:middle line:84%
to help fulfill
their highest values,

00:30:35.463 --> 00:30:36.880 align:middle line:84%
they're not going
to be fulfilled.

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:37.600 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to engaged.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.040 align:middle line:84%
They're not going
to be inspired.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:41.332 align:middle line:84%
You're going to need to
motivate them from the outside,

00:30:41.332 --> 00:30:43.360 align:middle line:84%
incentivize them with
rewards and punishments.

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.208 align:middle line:84%
And they're not going
to be productive.

00:30:45.208 --> 00:30:47.500 align:middle line:84%
But if they can see how what
they're doing in their job

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.150 align:middle line:84%
is fulfilling
their highest value

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.983 align:middle line:84%
and they can see how
the mission the company

00:30:50.983 --> 00:30:52.720 align:middle line:84%
is helping them
fulfill their dreams,

00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.860 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to be
engaged because they're

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.630 align:middle line:84%
going to feel like, I've got
an opportunity of a lifetime

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:56.672 align:middle line:90%
to work for this company.

00:30:56.672 --> 00:30:58.180 align:middle line:90%
It's helping me get what I want.

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Because they're going
to fulfill their values.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you hire
somebody, I recommend

00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:05.320 align:middle line:84%
hiring people and looking,
and screening them

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.313 align:middle line:90%
according to values.

00:31:06.313 --> 00:31:08.230 align:middle line:84%
If they're already there
and they're maybe not

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.840 align:middle line:84%
as productive and as
inspired as they could be,

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
then I show people, H.R.
departments and managers,

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.890 align:middle line:84%
how to link their job
descriptions to their values

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.080 align:middle line:84%
so they can see how what
they're doing serves them.

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.770 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's there.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:21.770 align:middle line:90%
It just hasn't become apparent.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:22.840 align:middle line:84%
>> They just haven't
been aware of it.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:23.923 align:middle line:90%
And I show them the links.

00:31:23.923 --> 00:31:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And the skilled manager
knows how to do that.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:29.740 align:middle line:84%
They know how to communicate
in the values of the people,

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.220 align:middle line:84%
allocate job descriptions that
match the values of the people

00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:35.708 align:middle line:84%
and/or link the job
descriptions to the values

00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:84%
so they're engaged, and
inspired, and productive.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.030 align:middle line:84%
Because otherwise, you're going
to have to micromanage people.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:40.960 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
have to incentivize

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.840 align:middle line:90%
them and all this other stuff.

00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And it weighs you
down as a company

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:47.150 align:middle line:84%
and causes the overheads to
go up and profits to go down.

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:49.990 align:middle line:84%
And when you're a leader, you're
living by a set of values.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:52.977 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to project
those values onto your people.

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:55.060 align:middle line:84%
If you're an autocrat,
you'll project onto and not

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.682 align:middle line:90%
care about the people's values.

00:31:56.682 --> 00:31:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Just like a person
going out and selling,

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:00.473 align:middle line:84%
if they're not caring about
the customers' values,

00:32:00.473 --> 00:32:01.440 align:middle line:90%
they don't sell well.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.850 align:middle line:84%
They're looking down and
caring less about the customer

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:05.050 align:middle line:90%
than themselves.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:06.640 align:middle line:84%
So the leader has
a responsibility

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:84%
to communicate what
they value and what

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.330 align:middle line:84%
they're wanting for
the company in terms

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:11.950 align:middle line:90%
of the people's values.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:12.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's a skill.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.338 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't
learn to do that,

00:32:14.338 --> 00:32:16.390 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes
autocratic and it ends up

00:32:16.390 --> 00:32:19.720 align:middle line:84%
being controlled with rules
and regulations which bog down

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.600 align:middle line:90%
companies and bureaucracies.

00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So caring enough about
another human being

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.650 align:middle line:84%
to help them fulfill
their highest values

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.130 align:middle line:84%
is the secret of achievement,
customer sales, negotiation,

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.230 align:middle line:84%
leadership,
management, all areas.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.370 align:middle line:90%
So I'm interested in that.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.412 align:middle line:84%
I've developed methods
for that, implemented them

00:32:35.412 --> 00:32:38.200 align:middle line:84%
into companies, and increased
the productivity and profit

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.640 align:middle line:90%
line of the company--

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:41.985 align:middle line:84%
not because they're
focused on more money.

00:32:41.985 --> 00:32:43.610 align:middle line:84%
They're focused on
caring about people.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And when people are doing
what they love, they produce.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.147 align:middle line:84%
When people can't wait to get
up in the morning and serve,

00:32:48.147 --> 00:32:49.868 align:middle line:84%
people can't wait to
get their service.

00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:51.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm hearing
there is that there's even

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.460 align:middle line:84%
an appropriate way
of creating KPIs,

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.990 align:middle line:84%
relevant to someone's
core value--

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:58.787 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the KPI, if it's
not matching their values,

00:32:58.787 --> 00:33:01.120 align:middle line:84%
they're going to procrastinate,
hesitate, and frustrate.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's low
on a person's values,

00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:04.952 align:middle line:84%
they're going to need
to be reminded to do.

00:33:04.952 --> 00:33:06.160 align:middle line:90%
My highest value is teaching.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.510 align:middle line:90%
I do it every day.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.728 align:middle line:84%
My lower values are
cooking and driving.

00:33:09.728 --> 00:33:11.270 align:middle line:84%
I haven't driven in
2005 years, and I

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:12.970 align:middle line:90%
haven't cooked since I was 24.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So the probability of me going
out and cooking and driving

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:16.802 align:middle line:90%
is like a zero.

00:33:16.802 --> 00:33:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But the probably of me
researching and teaching

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.240 align:middle line:90%
is like 100%.

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So if I was in a job description
that had to cook and drive,

00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:25.990 align:middle line:84%
I'd probably need punishments,
and rewards, and incentives,

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:27.603 align:middle line:90%
and I'd probably be fired.

00:33:27.603 --> 00:33:29.020 align:middle line:84%
But you put me in
a position where

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.420 align:middle line:84%
I get to research and
teach, and you don't ever

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:33.130 align:middle line:90%
have to remind me again.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.382 align:middle line:90%
I'm in my zone.

00:33:34.382 --> 00:33:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
make sure that you

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.798 align:middle line:84%
get the right person on
the bus, as Jim Collins

00:33:37.798 --> 00:33:40.797 align:middle line:84%
says, and allocate appropriately
to their value systems.

00:33:40.797 --> 00:33:42.130 align:middle line:90%
But the key-- that's management.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:45.670 align:middle line:84%
As Drucker says, management
is responsible for all that.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not that people
are not working.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.360 align:middle line:84%
I always people
watch managers that

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.090 align:middle line:84%
aren't affected hire people that
are less affected than them,

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:55.050 align:middle line:84%
that they can control, that
they hire, that are not engaged.

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:56.425 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
selecting wisely,

00:33:56.425 --> 00:33:58.300 align:middle line:90%
and then they blame people.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.030 align:middle line:84%
As Drucker said, it's
management's responsibility

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.655 align:middle line:84%
to care enough about
people to find out

00:34:02.655 --> 00:34:05.155 align:middle line:84%
what their needs are to make
sure that their positions match

00:34:05.155 --> 00:34:06.160 align:middle line:90%
those needs.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.952 align:middle line:84%
And it may take longer
to find that person,

00:34:07.952 --> 00:34:10.077 align:middle line:84%
but once you find them,
you've got the right person

00:34:10.077 --> 00:34:11.040 align:middle line:90%
on the bus.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.440 align:middle line:84%
>> So if teaching is your
very first core value,

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.170 align:middle line:90%
what is your second and third?

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:17.409 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, mine is researching.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:18.790 align:middle line:90%
Love teaching is number one.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.110 align:middle line:84%
Researching and
writing is number two.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.027 align:middle line:84%
Because I research and
write every single day.

00:34:22.027 --> 00:34:23.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm always writing books.

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And then, I obviously love to
travel because my life shows.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm at 17 million
miles of travel.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, probably the
next one is economics.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:34.820 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to get paid handsomely
to do what I love because I

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.070 align:middle line:90%
wanted financial independence.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.540 align:middle line:84%
Because I didn't want
to have to do what

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.159 align:middle line:84%
I did for the sake of
having to make money.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:41.742 align:middle line:84%
I want my money working for me
instead of me working for that.

00:34:41.742 --> 00:34:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And then, probably next is
relationships and family

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.250 align:middle line:90%
dynamics.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And everybody judges
different people.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm always amazed how people
subordinate to other people's

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.719 align:middle line:84%
expectations because they're
putting their values on you.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:55.060 align:middle line:84%
The key is not to subordinate
to anybody else's values,

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:56.560 align:middle line:90%
but to live true to your own.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And I've had people
come up to me

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and said, Dr. Demartini,
you hardly see your kids.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:02.670 align:middle line:90%
And I said, really?

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.420 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, you're
a terrible father.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.530 align:middle line:90%
I said, how come?

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:06.800 align:middle line:84%
They said, well, because
you don't see your kids.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.630 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, why would you
want a terrible father seeing

00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:09.430 align:middle line:90%
his kids?

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:10.508 align:middle line:90%
I joke with them.

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:12.550 align:middle line:84%
I said, because I have a
different set of values.

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:13.990 align:middle line:84%
My kids and I have
spent a lot of time.

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.075 align:middle line:84%
I was just with one in
Honolulu, and I was just

00:35:16.075 --> 00:35:18.730 align:middle line:84%
with the other one in Houston
and-- both of them in Houston,

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:19.780 align:middle line:90%
actually-- the other two.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:20.860 align:middle line:90%
They're all grown up now.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have that
as my highest value.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:24.910 align:middle line:90%
And I'm grateful for that.

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:25.720 align:middle line:90%
I have great kids.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.200 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.742 align:middle line:84%
I'm inspired by
them, but they've not

00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:29.500 align:middle line:90%
been always my highest value.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And they don't have me
as their highest value.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:34.180 align:middle line:84%
So you've just got to be honest
with who you are and not try

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.997 align:middle line:90%
to set goals that aren't you.

00:35:35.997 --> 00:35:38.080 align:middle line:84%
If you set a goal that's
not matching your values,

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.830 align:middle line:84%
you're going to end up with
the ABCDs of negativity.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.163 align:middle line:90%
You're going to feel depressed.

00:35:41.163 --> 00:35:42.580 align:middle line:84%
And you're going
to get a feedback

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.260 align:middle line:84%
to say you're not
being authentic.

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.978 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather be able to say I
love me for who I am, and go

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:48.520 align:middle line:84%
and do what I love,
and inspire them.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.290 align:middle line:84%
Because then, I teach my
kids to go and be authentic.

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And all three my kids have their
missions today because of it.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:55.190 align:middle line:84%
They know what
they're wanting to do.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.148 align:middle line:90%
They're going after it.

00:35:56.148 --> 00:35:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And they've been
succeeding at it.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Does exercise, sit
anywhere on a value for you?

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Instead of "Ab Magazine,"
I'm on "Blab Magazine."

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:08.770 align:middle line:84%
I got ripples on the side
of my masseter muscle

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:10.000 align:middle line:90%
because I speak so much.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.033 align:middle line:90%
No, I work out.

00:36:11.033 --> 00:36:13.200 align:middle line:84%
And I have wires to my jaw
to all the other muscles.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.992 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I speak,
it's using my muscles.

00:36:14.992 --> 00:36:16.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Just everything.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I do push-ups, and sit-ups,
and stretch, and some yoga,

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and some swimming, and then
some surfing occasionally.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:26.290 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not this gym fanatic.

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:27.705 align:middle line:90%
I workout and I'm doing good.

00:36:27.705 --> 00:36:29.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm 61 and I'm
doing pretty good.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, 61.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.920 align:middle line:90%
Oh my goodness.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.920 align:middle line:90%
You look amazing for 61.

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.380 align:middle line:90%
>> I've been blessed.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:37.570 align:middle line:84%
I had a young
woman come up to me

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:39.820 align:middle line:84%
one time in a
Cheesecake Factory.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:84%
I was in kind of a darkened
Cheesecake Factory restaurant

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.820 align:middle line:84%
and I was slurping
some soup really quick.

00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:47.037 align:middle line:84%
And this girl came up
to me and she said, sir,

00:36:47.037 --> 00:36:49.120 align:middle line:84%
would you like to join me
and this other lady over

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.140 align:middle line:90%
at the table?

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:50.973 align:middle line:90%
I looked over there.

00:36:50.973 --> 00:36:53.290 align:middle line:84%
There was another girl over
there about half my age.

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And I thought,
this is ridiculous.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, do you
mind if I ask you

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:57.710 align:middle line:90%
what made you come over here?

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.335 align:middle line:84%
She says, well, you
looked interesting.

00:36:59.335 --> 00:37:00.800 align:middle line:90%
You looked successful.

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And we thought it would
be entertaining to have

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.210 align:middle line:90%
you come and join us.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, well,
thank you for that.

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I said, do you mind if I
ask you another question?

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.540 align:middle line:90%
She says, no.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I said, how old
do you think I am?

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, I
thought you were maybe

00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.980 align:middle line:90%
mid-40s or something like that.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:14.362 align:middle line:84%
And I said, if I told you
I was more the 60 mark,

00:37:14.362 --> 00:37:15.820 align:middle line:84%
would you still
want me over there?

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.630 align:middle line:90%
She says, well, if you're busy--

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.906 align:middle line:90%
>> Gone.

00:37:19.906 --> 00:37:21.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I thought that was so funny.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Very funny.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:24.680 align:middle line:84%
>> But she was in
a dark environment.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.530 align:middle line:84%
It helped me look
a little younger.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:31.390 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so I have to ask
because of my love of food

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:33.640 align:middle line:84%
and nutrition--
what's your diet?

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.290 align:middle line:90%
>> My diet?

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:36.880 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
I'm a water freak.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't drink
anything but water--

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:41.960 align:middle line:84%
so no sweets, no
coffees, no teas.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I've had three cups of
coffee in my entire life.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.190 align:middle line:84%
I don't drink
anything but water.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:46.023 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:37:46.023 --> 00:37:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And is there a type
of quality of water?

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've investigated
bottled waters,

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and not all bottled waters
are really that great.

00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So I try to get the
best water I can.

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:56.950 align:middle line:84%
And filtered water is probably
one of the better ones today--

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:58.760 align:middle line:90%
some bottled water.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.450 align:middle line:84%
But in the morning, I have
fresh fruit-- usually grapes--

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:03.280 align:middle line:84%
but usually fresh
fruit-- mango, something

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.170 align:middle line:84%
like that, yogurt or cottage
cheese, and multigrain toast.

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:09.490 align:middle line:90%
That's a typical breakfast.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:12.730 align:middle line:84%
At lunch, I'll usually have
a soup, a salad, a sandwich,

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:15.150 align:middle line:90%
sushi, or salmon.

00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.130 align:middle line:84%
And most of time, it's
a sandwich or a salad.

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And at dinner, I usually have
some salmon or some fish,

00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.330 align:middle line:84%
some carrots, some spinach,
and some multigrain bread.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:24.130 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:25.248 align:middle line:90%
I'm a really simple guy.

00:38:25.248 --> 00:38:27.790 align:middle line:84%
And people always want to take
me to these fancy restaurants.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.408 align:middle line:84%
I said, can I get
a bowl of soup?

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:32.950 align:middle line:84%
And they go, we're taking you
to the best restaurant in town.

00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I go, I'd like a bowl
of soup, thank you.

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want all the
creamy, cheesy stuff.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.608 align:middle line:84%
I don't like oily, boiling,
limping, wimpy foods.

00:38:39.608 --> 00:38:41.650 align:middle line:84%
I like something that has
substance and something

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:42.450 align:middle line:90%
that's--

00:38:44.267 --> 00:38:45.100 align:middle line:90%
I don't live to eat.

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:45.900 align:middle line:90%
I eat to live.

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.442 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to put something
in my body that's not really

00:38:48.442 --> 00:38:50.560 align:middle line:84%
going to help me perform
and help me accomplish

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.660 align:middle line:90%
what I want to accomplish.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it's too important--
my life's too important.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:54.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you choose
organically for that--

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> If I can.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, I'm
traveling counseling.

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.830 align:middle line:84%
So I don't just go,
organic in first class,

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.690 align:middle line:90%
thank you-- organic.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:02.490 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:03.490 align:middle line:90%
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:04.833 align:middle line:90%
>> --I try to do the best I can.

00:39:04.833 --> 00:39:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm in
certain locations,

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:07.300 align:middle line:90%
I can get really quality food.

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.390 align:middle line:90%
In some areas, I can't.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:11.650 align:middle line:84%
So I don't sit there and
ram my head about it.

00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:12.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm grateful for it.

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:15.100 align:middle line:84%
I realize that we can get
so neurotic about what

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.740 align:middle line:84%
we eat that we can
make the anxiety

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.115 align:middle line:84%
and cause the
problems from that.

00:39:19.115 --> 00:39:21.448 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm in an environment
where I can get the greatest

00:39:21.448 --> 00:39:22.460 align:middle line:90%
food, I get it.

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.510 align:middle line:84%
If I'm not, I'd be grateful for
what I get, and I eat wisely.

00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:27.160 align:middle line:84%
And I can always
find those things,

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.080 align:middle line:90%
wherever I go around the world.

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:28.880 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:33.370 align:middle line:84%
Two last questions-- we've taken
the stigma out of mental health

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:34.490 align:middle line:90%
as being an illness.

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:38.050 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't, here today,
call mental health an illness,

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.700 align:middle line:90%
what do we call it?

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I call mental illness as a
feedback mechanism to help us

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.480 align:middle line:84%
live more authentically and
guide us to live by our highest

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.350 align:middle line:90%
values.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:50.680 align:middle line:84%
Because when people do, their
entire psychology changes.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.660 align:middle line:84%
When people start to
prioritize their life--

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.350 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking in Dallas, Texas
at the Anatole for Mary Kay

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:57.550 align:middle line:90%
Cosmetics.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And Mary Kay Ash
was an amazing lady.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.320 align:middle line:90%
She's impacted a lot of women.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And I walked up to Mary Kay
after I spoke, and I said,

00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:06.310 align:middle line:84%
what advice can you give a
young, aspiring speaker that's

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.858 align:middle line:90%
traveling the world speaking?

00:40:08.858 --> 00:40:10.150 align:middle line:90%
She had her hair all like this.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:13.090 align:middle line:84%
She said, every day, write
down the six or seven highest

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.190 align:middle line:84%
priority actions
that you can do today

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.670 align:middle line:84%
that can help you fulfill your
dreams, and go and do them.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:19.920 align:middle line:84%
They're just daily actions,
not projects-- daily

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.780 align:middle line:90%
acts you can get done that day.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:22.812 align:middle line:90%
And go get them done.

00:40:22.812 --> 00:40:24.770 align:middle line:84%
And then reward yourself
at the end of the day.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And when you prioritize your
life, you live by the ABCs,

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:28.912 align:middle line:90%
you grow and so forth.

00:40:28.912 --> 00:40:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And you're growing
accomplishments.

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And little, baby steps build
momentum into big dreams.

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you set big goals
that are overwhelming,

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:39.040 align:middle line:84%
and they're not yours,
and they're expectations,

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:42.460 align:middle line:84%
and they're subordinate from
other people's projections,

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:43.540 align:middle line:90%
you beat yourself up.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.510 align:middle line:84%
So you when you do that,
and you strategize your life

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:50.890 align:middle line:84%
effectively, you're grateful,
you feel love for life,

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:52.105 align:middle line:90%
and you achieve.

00:40:52.105 --> 00:40:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So I always say that anything
you can't say thank you for

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.480 align:middle line:90%
is baggage.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And mental health is trying
to get you to live that way.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.860 align:middle line:84%
Mental health is attempting
to get you authentically.

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And you keep holding
onto fantasies.

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.888 align:middle line:84%
You keep subordinating to
other people's expectation.

00:41:04.888 --> 00:41:06.888 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to live
in the shadows of anyone.

00:41:06.888 --> 00:41:08.882 align:middle line:84%
We're here to stand on
the shoulders of giants.

00:41:08.882 --> 00:41:10.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:14.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's a beautiful
segue to my last question.

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:16.510 align:middle line:84%
We're a great believer
at Healthy ME Summits

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:19.780 align:middle line:84%
on the "I am" statement,
and that neuroscience

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:22.780 align:middle line:84%
has done a wonderful job
at validating finally

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.390 align:middle line:84%
what philosophers of all
time have always said--

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.270 align:middle line:90%
we are what we think.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.830 align:middle line:84%
What is your "I am"
statement every morning?

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it was Descartes,
the French philosopher

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:37.480 align:middle line:84%
and mathematician, who basically
said, I think, therefore I am.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.000 align:middle line:90%


00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.250 align:middle line:90%
My statement, my affirmation--

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.410 align:middle line:84%
my first affirmation
that I ever got

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:46.900 align:middle line:84%
was from my fourth
grade teacher.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:48.190 align:middle line:90%
I am quiet.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.180 align:middle line:90%
I sit in my chair.

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.440 align:middle line:90%
And I do my homework.

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.960 align:middle line:90%
And that worked, actually.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.850 align:middle line:90%
I stopped talking.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.470 align:middle line:84%
My second affirmation
was given to me

00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:00.400 align:middle line:84%
by Paul Bragg when I
had learning problems.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:04.240 align:middle line:84%
He said, to overcome, say, I am
a genius and I apply my wisdom.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And that had an
impact on my life.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And I still say that every
single day of my life.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:11.950 align:middle line:84%
But I would say
that I'm just me.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:12.850 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm just me.

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.480 align:middle line:84%
People want to be something
other than who they are.

00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:18.190 align:middle line:84%
I was asked by "Vogue
Magazine" one time,

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:19.660 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Demartini, if
there's anybody

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.100 align:middle line:84%
in the world you could be
in the world, who could

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:21.900 align:middle line:90%
you want to be?

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.170 align:middle line:90%
I go, me.

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:24.230 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't want to
be anybody but me.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Everyone else is taken.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:25.530 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Everybody else was
taken and I can't

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:28.903 align:middle line:84%
think of anybody else
I'd rather be than me.

00:42:28.903 --> 00:42:31.450 align:middle line:84%
So I love myself,
and that's great.

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:33.250 align:middle line:84%
So many people have
difficulty doing that.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Dr. Demartini, thank you
so much for joining us--

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:36.850 align:middle line:84%
it's been an absolute
pleasure-- for--

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:37.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:38.525 align:middle line:84%
>> --your wisdom,
your knowledge,

00:42:38.525 --> 00:42:39.680 align:middle line:90%
and your time and energy.

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you for bringing
this message to the world.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:42.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:44.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.000 align:middle line:90%
