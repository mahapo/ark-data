[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.804 --> 00:00:14.094 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.094 --> 00:00:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Jeremy, a very warm welcome.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.600 align:middle line:90%
It's great to be here.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.320 align:middle line:84%
>> For our Australian audience,
you're probably most celebrated

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:84%
as one of the best Australian
didgeridoo players.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we were
outside, we were

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.910 align:middle line:84%
talking about how
busy you've been

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.410 align:middle line:84%
this year-- over 200
airplanes you've taken so far

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
and the many stages
that you've spoken on.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.387 align:middle line:84%
And life today is very
different to what it used to be.

00:00:42.387 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering
if you could start

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.540 align:middle line:84%
by sharing with
us what life used

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.710 align:middle line:90%
to be in comparison to now.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think life is
definitely a journey.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I
sort of know that.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And it's a fairly
individual journey as well.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.730 align:middle line:84%
We obviously have influences
that come in and shape,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:84%
or mold, or sort of try and
turn us into different things

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:90%
or whatnot.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:90%
But it is a journey.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And I think I like to look
at my life a bit like a book.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.150 align:middle line:90%
It's got many chapters.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are really
tough to read and painful.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:90%
And others are incredible.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:41.420 align:middle line:84%
My late grandfather-- he was the
person who really first tabled

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.260 align:middle line:84%
that notion of like, look at
your life like it's a book.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.300 align:middle line:84%
And he kind of
confused me a bit,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
because I knew that old man
had never probably read a book.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.930 align:middle line:90%
Because he could barely read.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I remember reading
the newspaper to him.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.100 align:middle line:90%
And so I was--

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.240 align:middle line:90%
I really pondered that.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Well, how do you
know what a book

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.535 align:middle line:90%
is if you've never read it?

00:02:03.535 --> 00:02:06.340 align:middle line:84%
But my grandfather
said that there

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.960 align:middle line:84%
are going to be chapters in
your story that you don't like.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you tear chapters out of
a book, all the pages around it

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.430 align:middle line:90%
start to fall out.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.170 align:middle line:84%
And before you know it, there's
no story or no book left,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.970 align:middle line:90%
just a spine or an empty cover.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And so it has been a journey,
one that I certainly--

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:90%
I love.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And I think a majority
part of the journey

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:84%
started not too far from here on
the northern beaches of Sydney

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.000 align:middle line:84%
and growing up in a fairly,
sort of in a normal world.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And as a young, young
kid, you don't really

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.400 align:middle line:90%
see anything that's not normal.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Or you don't have maybe
the intellectual ability

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.240 align:middle line:84%
to have the conversation about
how a family is different,

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.150 align:middle line:84%
or why they're
different, or whatnot.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.650 align:middle line:84%
And so it was fairly
apparent that life

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.086 align:middle line:84%
was sort of normal for
me as a kid growing up.

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:14.470 align:middle line:84%
But I certainly have memories
of being a bit raised here

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.080 align:middle line:84%
and being with mom
and my sisters.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.390 align:middle line:90%
And we went to Wingham mall.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And mom would stop
and talk to someone.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.260 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, are
these your daughters?

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.110 align:middle line:90%
And mom would say, yeah.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And then people would ask,
well, who is this boy?

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:90%
Mom is a beautiful white lady.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:84%
My sisters are
beautiful white girls.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.382 align:middle line:84%
And I have sort of a
different background to them.

00:03:42.382 --> 00:03:44.350 align:middle line:84%
And I always sort of
looked like the next door

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.080 align:middle line:84%
neighbor on holidays
with mom and my sisters.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.340 align:middle line:84%
But you don't think of
anything differently.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:84%
As a kid, I know that
I had an affinity,

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:90%
sort of at Manly Public School.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.740 align:middle line:84%
There were a few Pacific
Island families--

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:90%
Samoan, Tongan, Maori.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Because I always had an affinity
with that island culture.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.010 align:middle line:84%
It felt very good for me
that my best friends were

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Pacific Islanders growing up.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:84%
I played rugby in a predominant
Pacific Island team.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I was
12, I basically moved

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.390 align:middle line:84%
from mom's and was living in
with the best friend's family,

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.190 align:middle line:90%
with their mom.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Their mom was Samoan.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.360 align:middle line:90%
That Maori.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And so it was the culture
that really shaped me.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.750 align:middle line:84%
Because I was in sort of
deep searching and trying

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.145 align:middle line:90%
to understand who I was.

00:04:38.145 --> 00:04:39.020 align:middle line:90%
Where do I come from?

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.603 align:middle line:84%
And there was sort
of a lot of mystery

00:04:40.603 --> 00:04:42.890 align:middle line:84%
around that and
something that was sort

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.980 align:middle line:84%
of not hidden, but just sort
of not really spoken about.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.283 align:middle line:84%
And on the Northern
Beaches in the '80s,

00:04:51.283 --> 00:04:53.075 align:middle line:84%
there weren't a lot of
Aboriginal families.

00:04:53.075 --> 00:04:55.580 align:middle line:90%


00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:57.620 align:middle line:84%
I certainly don't
have any memory

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.070 align:middle line:84%
of meeting an Aboriginal person
as a young boy growing up.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:84%
And so when I found
out the identity of who

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.030 align:middle line:84%
my biological father was--
and it was pretty challenging

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.830 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I was confronted
with the stereotypes.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being part
of the playground jokes.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
well, those jokes were me.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:84%
And I became pretty
confused and pretty lost.

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
And I realized an identity
that I was searching for,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.090 align:middle line:90%
like I just--

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.880 align:middle line:90%
I had no answers to.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you go through
bullying at school?

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.940 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.460 align:middle line:90%
I was always a big kid.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:90%
I was always a popular kid.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:84%
I was good at sport,
not good at school.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember
ever being bullied.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
But I certainly know that I
was probably a bully at times.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.138 align:middle line:84%
It's my-- in the last couple
of weeks, I've reflected on it.

00:06:01.138 --> 00:06:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But this is something I've
known for a long time,

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.070 align:middle line:84%
is that bullying has been one of
those things that probably got

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:84%
me in the most trouble
as a young person,

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:11.850 align:middle line:90%
because I hated it so much.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:22.980 align:middle line:84%
From a very young age, defending
those that were getting bullied

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:84%
was always what I wanted to
do, that I hated seeing it.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.470 align:middle line:90%
It infuriated me, in fact.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:84%
One of-- I remember being in
grade eight in high school

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.260 align:middle line:90%
just up the road.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
And there was a young
boy that had grown up

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.660 align:middle line:84%
in the housing commission, down
near the Manly swimming pools.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never spoken to him,
but he was a younger boy

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.080 align:middle line:90%
that I'd seen.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.400 align:middle line:90%
I knew where he lived.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.890 align:middle line:84%
And we arrived down at Manly
Wharf at the bus stops.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And as I got off the
bus, it was early.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:01.500 align:middle line:84%
And he was being bullied
by a couple of boys

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.880 align:middle line:84%
from the college, up
the hill at St. Pauls.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.280 align:middle line:84%
I instantly-- like I
lost my mind over that

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.810 align:middle line:90%
and attacked those two boys.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And then a gentleman
stopped the car.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.390 align:middle line:90%
And I attacked him as well.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:19.280 align:middle line:90%
And this young boy--

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.080 align:middle line:90%
he was fine.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.010 align:middle line:90%
And I took him on the bus.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.093 align:middle line:84%
But I remember getting on
the bus to go to school.

00:07:23.093 --> 00:07:25.510 align:middle line:90%
And everyone was dead quiet.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.360 align:middle line:90%
No one looked at me.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:84%
No one talked at me and
then sitting in period one.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:90%
And the police came.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And I was arrested
in the classroom

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.190 align:middle line:90%
and walked across the school.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.810 align:middle line:84%
But you sort of got a hero
status for that sort of thing,

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.250 align:middle line:90%
like being arrested.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:48.150 align:middle line:84%
But the fact is that people
missed the narrative.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.140 align:middle line:84%
I was protecting someone
from being bullied.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:84%
But in doing so, I
became the bully, right?

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:59.300 align:middle line:84%
Which is something that has
happened a lot through life.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.680 align:middle line:84%
I hate-- I really-- it hurts
me when I see people being

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.090 align:middle line:90%
disempowered by someone else.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.140 align:middle line:90%
I was a good football--

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:12.980 align:middle line:84%
I was a good sportsperson,
a really good artist,

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:90%
a good musician.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm all self-taught.

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.930 align:middle line:84%
But music and art
were two of the things

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:84%
that I sort of was
probably forbidden from,

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.050 align:middle line:90%
sort of in thriving at school.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Because geez, I haven't
found the answer to this yet.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:42.360 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know why
year seven music teachers

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.490 align:middle line:84%
think it's appropriate
to teach a recorder.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.310 align:middle line:84%
Because it's the dumbest
instrument in the world,

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:49.860 align:middle line:84%
that we're restless
little boys, right?

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.910 align:middle line:90%
We need drums.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.130 align:middle line:90%
We need to make noise.

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.380 align:middle line:84%
And I knew instantly
that if I blew

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.740 align:middle line:84%
the recorder as hard as I could,
it would piss the teacher off.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And I would get
sent out of class.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:84%
And I could go back to
kicking the football.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.670 align:middle line:84%
But the reality was like in
reflection of those times,

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:10.900 align:middle line:84%
is I just wanted to be seen,
like I was desperate for it.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Jeremy, can you share
with our audience to give them

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.750 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of context, the
sort of struggles that you went

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
through as a child into
your teenage years?

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:25.710 align:middle line:84%
Because it wasn't always
easy by any means.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And I just want to
share with our audience

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:84%
the sort of things that
you've had to endure.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.240 align:middle line:90%
I think it really--

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.960 align:middle line:84%
the majority struggle
started as a teenager,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.840 align:middle line:90%
like so many people do.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:45.210 align:middle line:84%
But once you become a teenager,
you become more aware, right?

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And you're seeing
things beyond just sort

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.550 align:middle line:84%
of what lives inside the home
or what lives inside the family.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that
time that I found out

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I was, in fact,
Aboriginal and probably

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:84%
the foundations
of all my identity

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:84%
that had sort of shaped
my life until 13.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.140 align:middle line:84%
You sort of were just taken
away, almost in an instant.

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And so this place of
trying to understand.

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, what does that mean?

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Because looking around on
the Northern Beaches is,

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.100 align:middle line:90%
you don't see Aboriginal people.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
I don't have any memory of
meeting an Aboriginal person.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.850 align:middle line:90%
And so you get told.

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:90%
You find the truth.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And it was pretty challenging,
because of those stereotypes

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.210 align:middle line:84%
that I'd heard,
the conversations,

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.480 align:middle line:90%
the derogatory comments.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.190 align:middle line:90%
And I'd been part of them.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:84%
And all of a
sudden, that was me.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was really painful
trying to work that out.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.540 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't long.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.220 align:middle line:90%
I think 13 was--

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.790 align:middle line:84%
probably just shy
of 13 that when

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:84%
you start experimenting
with drugs and alcohol.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
And you start looking
for your tribe as a kid.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.140 align:middle line:90%
Where do I fit in?

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:16.685 align:middle line:84%
And football was the place
where I got the most praise.

00:11:16.685 --> 00:11:20.120 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of that
place that I got seen.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.390 align:middle line:90%
And then everything else wasn't.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.660 align:middle line:84%
And sort of down at
Manly as a young boy,

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.370 align:middle line:90%
that was a billiards hall.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.640 align:middle line:84%
And that was sort of
where we formed our tribe.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.350 align:middle line:90%
And call it a gang.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.950 align:middle line:84%
Call it a tribe,
whatever it was.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.573 align:middle line:84%
But there was a tight knit,
sort of group of young people

00:11:40.573 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:84%
that were all going
through similar struggles.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And so you found your tribe
of totally different stories,

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:84%
but there was an understanding
of what was going on.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:54.750 align:middle line:84%
But in that place as
well is that we didn't

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.380 align:middle line:84%
have the leadership or the
mentorship to talk to us about,

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:90%
how do we address the pain?

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore,
you self-medicate

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.868 align:middle line:84%
with drugs and alcohol
without the wisdom

00:12:05.868 --> 00:12:07.410 align:middle line:84%
to know that that's
just suppressing.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.687 align:middle line:84%
And it's not taking
away or not healing it,

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:10.770 align:middle line:90%
but it's just suppressing.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Or it gives it
permission to come out.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized was that
my behavior was becoming more

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:24.030 align:middle line:84%
and more volatile, and
angry, aggressive, upset,

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:27.722 align:middle line:90%
and confused, lost, hurt.

00:12:27.722 --> 00:12:30.110 align:middle line:90%
I remember being--

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:33.660 align:middle line:84%
I think my first arrest
was for graffiti.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:38.840 align:middle line:84%
It was for-- and the thing
with this first arrest

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.680 align:middle line:84%
was probably the catalyst
for my hatred towards police.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I was arrested for
not doing anything wrong.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.040 align:middle line:84%
We were walking
to Kangaroo Rock.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:84%
It was pretty popular for young
people in the Northern Beaches.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Silverchair were playing
there that night.

00:12:58.370 --> 00:13:02.045 align:middle line:84%
And me and two Pacific Island
boys were walking up the hill.

00:13:02.045 --> 00:13:04.610 align:middle line:90%
This was in the peak of summer.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And two police officers
stopped the three

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:10.420 align:middle line:90%
of us walking up the hill.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.300 align:middle line:84%
And I was charged with
graffiti, because I had graffiti

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:90%
drawn on my backpack.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:21.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
arrested, taken to--

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.735 align:middle line:84%
and then the statement
came through that

00:13:23.735 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:84%
the reason why
the police stopped

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:28.640 align:middle line:84%
us was because we were
drinking alcohol in the street.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And none of us were
drinking alcohol.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.810 align:middle line:90%
None of us had taken any drugs.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:33.810 align:middle line:90%
None of us were smoking.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Us three boys were completely
just walking up the hill,

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.960 align:middle line:90%
going to the concert.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.220 align:middle line:90%
And the police were horrible.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.670 align:middle line:90%
They treated us disgracefully.

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.120 align:middle line:84%
And I remember at one
point, a young fella

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.760 align:middle line:84%
called Eddie Lay-- he saw us
being harassed by this police.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.170 align:middle line:90%
And he came over.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:53.970 align:middle line:90%
And he was of Filipino descent.

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.513 align:middle line:84%
And the copper said, how about
you mind your own business?

00:13:57.513 --> 00:13:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're
going to find yourself

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:02.147 align:middle line:84%
in the same place as
your other black mates.

00:14:02.147 --> 00:14:04.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So you found it was a very
racial attack at the time?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>> It was completely
racially motivated--

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:90%
that arrest was.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And the statement that they put
through that I was charged with

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:14.570 align:middle line:90%
was just full of lies.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.390 align:middle line:90%
And the disbelief.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.530 align:middle line:90%
So I went home.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:90%
And I pleaded--

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.870 align:middle line:90%
I always like to mom.

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't-- no
one believed me, really,

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:30.560 align:middle line:84%
that they thought that
police not like that.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.470 align:middle line:84%
You have to be doing something
wrong, otherwise they--

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:37.060 align:middle line:84%
because inherently, you
don't understand racism

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.030 align:middle line:90%
until you feel it every day.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.910 align:middle line:84%
You're targeted, the
prejudice and whatnot.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:90%
And I went before the courts.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.310 align:middle line:84%
And it was really at that
time, sitting in the jury--

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:90%
children's court over in Glebe.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:54.840 align:middle line:90%
It was just before my hearing.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And I sat down on
the toilet, just

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:90%
sat down to take a few breaths.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.570 align:middle line:84%
I was pretty nervous
about being in there.

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at the door.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And there was an Aboriginal
flag drawn, graffitied

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.900 align:middle line:90%
on the back of the door.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, Aboriginal
people have been here.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And it was pretty
much from that period

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.210 align:middle line:84%
that I spent far more
time in courtrooms

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.930 align:middle line:90%
than I did in classrooms.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So life continued to
spiral out of control?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because
from that incident,

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.065 align:middle line:84%
I'd been arrested for doing
something, doing nothing wrong.

00:15:27.065 --> 00:15:28.460 align:middle line:90%
I hated police.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I hated them with just such
anger, and hatred, and fear,

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.820 align:middle line:90%
because of how we were treated.

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:43.480 align:middle line:84%
And the no trust
still exists today.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.110 align:middle line:84%
Even through success
and everything,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:51.430 align:middle line:84%
I sort of feel
uncomfortable around police.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Because I just don't trust
them, still from this day.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:59.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So what would you have
described as the lowest point

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:00.670 align:middle line:90%
of your life?

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:03.640 align:middle line:84%
What was happening
around you at that time?

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Were you still living at home?

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
No, I was staying with
friends all the time,

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:17.490 align:middle line:84%
just wherever I could stay
where we had free rein.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:84%
Discipline was not something
that I coped very well with.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And being told what
to do wasn't something

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:23.020 align:middle line:90%
that I coped very well with.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.940 align:middle line:90%
And I was just--

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.120 align:middle line:84%
I knew at home, like
with mom and my sisters,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.320 align:middle line:84%
it was a different
world, all of a sudden.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:90%
The love didn't change.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.760 align:middle line:84%
But it was just
different for me.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.530 align:middle line:90%
And they couldn't understand it.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:43.820 align:middle line:84%
And I found that,
sort of the tribe

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
that I was searching
for, down in Manly.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, that
came with trouble, too.

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Because young kids with too
much time and no discipline--

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.060 align:middle line:90%
you get in trouble.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And the older boys
teach us how to--

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:84%
their mentorship was based
around probably the best

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.609 align:middle line:84%
intention, but it sort of
led us down the wrong way.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And sort of the theft started.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:14.630 align:middle line:84%
The violence sort of
more and more as I

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:19.447 align:middle line:84%
became-- so more and
more times in court.

00:17:19.447 --> 00:17:20.998 align:middle line:84%
And then there
became a yearning,

00:17:20.998 --> 00:17:22.790 align:middle line:84%
that I realized every
time I went to court,

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.367 align:middle line:90%
I met Aboriginal people.

00:17:25.367 --> 00:17:27.450 align:middle line:84%
And so there was this place
in me that said, well,

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:84%
if I want to find my identity,
I've got to go to court

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:90%
or I've got to go to jail.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it was, sort
of the pathway to prison

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.950 align:middle line:84%
as a young boy,
as so incarcerated

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.170 align:middle line:84%
in multiple correction centers
around New South Wales.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the blemishes
that this nation has,

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.300 align:middle line:84%
that we are-- as
Aboriginal people,

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.400 align:middle line:84%
we're 3% of the
total population,

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:56.800 align:middle line:84%
yet make up 70-plus percent
of the population in juvenile

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.710 align:middle line:84%
correction centers,
that there is--

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.630 align:middle line:90%
something needs to be done.

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:84%
And police in prison
is not supporting this.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.180 align:middle line:84%
But this yearning to
want to know my culture,

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:14.290 align:middle line:84%
want to know who I am
sort of really came.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And I started defining my
Aboriginality or my identity

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:84%
based on going to prison and
defining it by the crimes

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:90%
that I would commit or whatnot.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So what was the turning
point in that case?

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Because your life is
very, very different now.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And so from in and out of
jail, and too many drugs,

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.425 align:middle line:84%
drink, and all the
rest of it, what

00:18:39.425 --> 00:18:41.050 align:middle line:84%
was the catalyst to
your turning point?

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:45.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So there was a major
incident that happened.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.220 align:middle line:84%
I think it was '93,
'94, New Year's Eve.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.820 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting down
at Manly Beach.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And I was sitting with one
of the older boys, Matt,

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:56.020 align:middle line:90%
who really mentored us.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And he had an
identical twin brother.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:02.075 align:middle line:84%
And he really was the one
who nurtured my artwork.

00:19:02.075 --> 00:19:03.800 align:middle line:90%
And I really took care of--

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:84%
taught me how to spray paint as
murals and not just vandalism.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Not just work, but create
murals and create art.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And he had an identical
twin brother who'd been up,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.640 align:middle line:90%
the other end of the corso.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.617 align:middle line:84%
And had got into an
altercation, I believe,

00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:22.700 align:middle line:84%
with some Pacific Island
boys that had come across

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.350 align:middle line:90%
from Western Sydney.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:27.050 align:middle line:90%
And it dispersed.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.130 align:middle line:90%
And the night went on.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:84%
And the boys kept drinking
as they walked up the corso.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And by the time they
got to the beach end,

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.430 align:middle line:90%
they saw all of us sitting down.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And they saw Matt,
thinking it was Dave

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:90%
that they'd had the fight with.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And before we knew it,
someone smashed a bottle

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:90%
and stabbed Matt.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.200 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.530 align:middle line:84%
At 14, when you watch
someone bleed to death,

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:54.550 align:middle line:90%
it never leaves you.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:20:02.360 align:middle line:84%
Like it-- no human should
have to see it, be part of it.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.720 align:middle line:90%
And it haunts you forever.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.420 align:middle line:84%
And that was one of the
catalysts for change.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Because at that point,
you cried so many tears,

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.920 align:middle line:84%
that you decided you're
never going to cry again.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:19.220 align:middle line:84%
And you lost empathy and
compassion for the world.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And so the bad behavior
became more and more volatile.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:28.430 align:middle line:84%
The circuit breaker for
me was a beautiful lady

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:84%
called Pauline Dickson, an
Aboriginal liaison officer,

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.010 align:middle line:84%
who was the first
person that ever tabled

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:84%
a conversation with me, that
your identity will never

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:90%
be found in prison.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And she spoke to me in a way
that no one else spoke to me.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:84%
She spoke to me in a way
that was so nurturing.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And she spoke to me in
a way that said that--

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.470 align:middle line:84%
she taught me
about what she knew

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
about culture as an Aboriginal
woman and what she could share.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And she said that our culture
existed for 60,000 years.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And it was based on dreams,
and freedom, and this capacity

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.490 align:middle line:84%
to move wherever
you needed to move.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you're in
prison, you can't dream.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.500 align:middle line:90%
And you can't be free.

00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was Pauline that really
initiated this connection--

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.150 align:middle line:84%
reconnection back
with my family,

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.730 align:middle line:84%
back up in North Queensland,
and meeting my grandfather

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.290 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather is my biggest
idol, my hero, my savior,

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.620 align:middle line:90%
my teacher.

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:46.330 align:middle line:84%
And most of all, my
grandfather and dad.

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:48.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And he's still
with you today?

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.170 align:middle line:84%
>> No, he passed away, but,
yeah, he's still with me.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was speaking
to someone earlier today.

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said that, literally,
if I sat down and told people

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.230 align:middle line:84%
how close I feel
to my grandfather,

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.320 align:middle line:84%
even though he's passed,
they'll put me in the East Wing

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.440 align:middle line:90%
up on the hill.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:09.560 align:middle line:90%
Because it's not my imagination.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.240 align:middle line:90%
I can smell him with me.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.810 align:middle line:90%
I hear him.

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:15.460 align:middle line:90%
And it's very nurturing.

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.600 align:middle line:90%
It's very guiding.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:84%
It's really-- he became
such an important figure.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.310 align:middle line:90%
And he was the first person.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:27.795 align:middle line:84%
He said to me on our very first
meeting when we first met--

00:22:27.795 --> 00:22:28.920 align:middle line:90%
one, he walked in the room.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.900 align:middle line:90%
I was shocked.

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen an Aboriginal
man look like my grandfather,

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.440 align:middle line:90%
except in a picture book.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.310 align:middle line:90%
I was confused.

00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Because I was trying to base
Aboriginality on color, still.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.980 align:middle line:90%
He was a black man.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:47.960 align:middle line:90%
How are you my grandfather?

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.060 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather said to me
nothing, except that he said,

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.770 align:middle line:90%
son, what do you want to be?

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Like, you can either be another
Aboriginal kid in prison.

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:90%
And you'll just be a statistic.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:84%
Or you can dream
to become somebody.

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.320 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.483 align:middle line:90%
He left.

00:23:06.483 --> 00:23:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
day, he came in.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And he only spoke Kuku-Yalanji
to me, like he sat there.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:84%
Which as a city kid, I'd never
heard an Aboriginal person

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.310 align:middle line:90%
speaking Aboriginal language.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:19.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't even remember
even seeing a documentary.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Instead, I have a man
sit across the table

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:25.030 align:middle line:90%
and just speak to you.

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.390 align:middle line:90%
It was haunting.

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:27.240 align:middle line:90%
It was confusing.

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:90%
It was confronting.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But it was so
mysterious as well.

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I
was 16 and 9 months,

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:39.710 align:middle line:84%
I was sort of taken
back to North Queensland

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:41.460 align:middle line:84%
on a conditional
sentence, that if I

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:84%
was-- stay with my
grandparents, that I

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:48.240 align:middle line:84%
could sort of serve the rest
of my sentences out there.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.250 align:middle line:90%
And so I took that thing.

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:90%
It was the easy option.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And it took me about
three days to realize

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
that I'd made a
pretty silly choice,

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that pool tables and pizzas
in prison were pretty--

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.730 align:middle line:90%
it was pretty easy.

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:00.690 align:middle line:90%
We were safe in there.

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:02.190 align:middle line:90%
We had our crew.

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:06.030 align:middle line:90%
We had our sort of--

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:07.410 align:middle line:90%
it wasn't that tough.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.190 align:middle line:84%
The screws were the
toughest, because they just--

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.850 align:middle line:90%
there was no rehabilitation.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:15.680 align:middle line:84%
It was basically they
drilled into you every day.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Like you're a dog, like you're
never going to be nothing.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:23.200 align:middle line:84%
That was-- you heard it over
and over and over again.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.110 align:middle line:90%
>> But you chose otherwise.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, I think I didn't--

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.872 align:middle line:84%
I made this crazy decision to
go back with my grandparents

00:24:30.872 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:90%
up to North Queensland.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
getting off the plane

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:38.160 align:middle line:84%
and driving to Mossman Gorge,
and then up through Cape

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.260 align:middle line:84%
Tribulation, and then
through Woodville,

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:43.800 align:middle line:84%
another Aboriginal community,
and up to Shiptons Flats, which

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.030 align:middle line:84%
was our traditional western
(speaking Kuku Yalanji)

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:48.560 align:middle line:90%
Youghal country.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And this sense of
being very confused,

00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:56.030 align:middle line:90%
because it felt like home.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.610 align:middle line:90%
I knew I'd never been there.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.930 align:middle line:90%
And it was making me cry.

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't cried
since Matt died, really.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And that was pretty
tough for me.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:10.440 align:middle line:84%
It was probably my
first cultural lesson

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.690 align:middle line:84%
that I ever got with my
grandfather, is when he saw me

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:14.540 align:middle line:90%
cry.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:90%
We went to a place--

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Twin Bridges-- which is a
very special place to us.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.340 align:middle line:90%
And I got out of the car.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:22.140 align:middle line:90%
And I began to cry.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:26.110 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather--
because our Western culture

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.690 align:middle line:90%
teaches it, like that's weak.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And there's-- you wipe
your tears away as quick

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.620 align:middle line:90%
as your eyes well.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather whacked
me when-- he whacked me.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.380 align:middle line:90%
He said, why?

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Don't wipe your tears away.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.660 align:middle line:90%
I asked him, what do you mean?

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.135 align:middle line:90%
He said just let them fall.

00:25:48.135 --> 00:25:50.010 align:middle line:84%
Like, you wouldn't have
been given tear ducts

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.177 align:middle line:90%
if you weren't meant to cry.

00:25:51.177 --> 00:25:55.860 align:middle line:84%
And then he told me a
pretty powerful story of--

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:59.130 align:middle line:84%
one of our dreaming stories
about the rainbow serpent,

00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:02.520 align:middle line:84%
and the connection to
the lightning brothers,

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.330 align:middle line:84%
and the story about
this beautiful serpent

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:11.700 align:middle line:84%
that carved, over a
long period of time,

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.040 align:middle line:90%
this incredible landscape.

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And from the skies,
these lightning brothers

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.060 align:middle line:84%
had watched her
carve this journey.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.140 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
this time of credit,

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:27.780 align:middle line:84%
she looked back across all
the land, and the mountains,

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.310 align:middle line:90%
the beds, or the canyons.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.860 align:middle line:84%
And she started to cry,
because there was still

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:90%
no life or color in it.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And she was yelling
and screaming.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And the brothers came
down from the sky.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I want you to
strike me with lightning.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:84%
And the boys were-- they
didn't want to do that.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Because they were just in
awe of what she created

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:47.880 align:middle line:90%
and her beauty.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.100 align:middle line:90%
And so they returned.

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.872 align:middle line:84%
And she kept
wailing and wailing,

00:26:51.872 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:90%
until they finally came back.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And they struck
her with lightning.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.450 align:middle line:84%
And at that point,
the boys were worried

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.490 align:middle line:90%
that it was going to kill her.

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:01.570 align:middle line:90%
But she began to cry.

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:03.310 align:middle line:90%
And her tears dropped.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:07.080 align:middle line:84%
And they were massive tears,
that the more she cried,

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.260 align:middle line:90%
the rivers filled.

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:11.270 align:middle line:90%
And the lands started to grow.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:13.740 align:middle line:90%
And the boys returned.

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.660 align:middle line:90%
And life was created at that.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And so my grandfather
always said

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:22.050 align:middle line:84%
that if she had wiped away her
tears, there would be no life.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.170 align:middle line:84%
There would be no
land and no love.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of
gave me permission

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.420 align:middle line:84%
to cry again, which I did
a lot, and for the time

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.780 align:middle line:84%
that I was with my grandfather
and from those several years

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.580 align:middle line:90%
up there.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Those several
years that you've--

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:84%
from what I've read and the
sense that I've received

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:46.470 align:middle line:84%
is that time with
your grandfather

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.560 align:middle line:84%
really started to
change your perspective,

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.820 align:middle line:90%
your sense of who you were.

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.520 align:middle line:84%
You connected back
into your roots.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And from that, you
have really taken

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:03.450 align:middle line:84%
the culture, and the
history, and the teachings

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.670 align:middle line:90%
of your elders.

00:28:05.670 --> 00:28:07.630 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with us
how you use that now?

00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it really is like--

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.100 align:middle line:90%
I just was with my grandfather.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.510 align:middle line:90%
I was with the old people.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.590 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to mix with any of
the young people, young family

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.550 align:middle line:90%
members.

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.420 align:middle line:84%
I was just with my grandfather,
my grandfather's brothers.

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.580 align:middle line:90%
I was in such a foreign world.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.900 align:middle line:84%
But my grandfather and my
family that were there--

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:28.830 align:middle line:90%
they rebuilt me.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.420 align:middle line:90%
It wasn't about recovery.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.340 align:middle line:90%
It was about rebuilding.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And then they taught me about
traditional healing and all

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:38.490 align:middle line:84%
about the wisdom and
the spirituality.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:43.650 align:middle line:90%
And it really became my freedom.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the introduction of
the yigi, or the didgeridoo sort

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.310 align:middle line:90%
of came when I was about--

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:90%
not long after arriving 17.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And it was just so natural, the
moment I got that instrument.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.790 align:middle line:90%
It felt so real.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:04.310 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, was
that I was able to play it.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And when I couldn't talk about
things that were hurting me,

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.600 align:middle line:84%
I was able to play it
with it in my mind,

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:13.950 align:middle line:90%
the feelings, the emotions.

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.970 align:middle line:84%
But then I was able to hear
the beauty of this instrument.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:22.290 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to transfer
pain into beauty.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:27.008 align:middle line:84%
And it really became a
great sort of wholer hope.

00:29:27.008 --> 00:29:28.550 align:middle line:84%
The didgeridoo was
wholer hope for me

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:84%
that it became an
instrument that--

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:33.540 align:middle line:90%
it was-- it grabbed me.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.280 align:middle line:90%
It was natural.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.050 align:middle line:84%
And before I knew
it, I was playing it.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And I remember being
with my grandfather

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:40.560 align:middle line:90%
and driving out to Laura.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.730 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
old man, that's it.

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:47.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to be a
didgeridoo player.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:50.520 align:middle line:84%
I want to play didgeridoo
in every state of Australia.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:53.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was my
lifelong ambition.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.160 align:middle line:90%
And I went to Cairns.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was playing didgeridoo
in a shop in Cairns.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.635 align:middle line:84%
And then from there,
got the opportunity

00:30:02.635 --> 00:30:06.330 align:middle line:84%
to go to-- to come to
Sydney-- back to Sydney.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.110 align:middle line:90%
And there was a cultural center.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:12.790 align:middle line:84%
Or it was the Northern
Territory Tourism Commission.

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:16.350 align:middle line:84%
It was sort of a half
tourist booking center.

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest was sort
of cultural and souvenirs.

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:20.850 align:middle line:90%
But there was a theater there.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:84%
And I got the
opportunity to perform,

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:24.970 align:middle line:90%
to start playing didgeridoo.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:84%
I initially was just
selling didgeridoos.

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.993 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized
were that more people

00:30:28.993 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:84%
were sitting in my
show out at the front

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.480 align:middle line:84%
than going to the
show in the theater.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And before I knew it, I
had that theater to myself.

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:40.350 align:middle line:84%
And I was so ashamed talking
on stage in front of people.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:41.880 align:middle line:90%
But it was--

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:49.101 align:middle line:84%
I had to do it and three shows
a day, seven days a week.

00:30:49.101 --> 00:30:52.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So your art and your
music has been absolutely

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.380 align:middle line:84%
instrumental in your
own healing journey?

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.852 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather--
like with my art,

00:30:56.852 --> 00:30:58.310 align:middle line:84%
he said, you're a
beautiful artist,

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.000 align:middle line:90%
but it's getting you in trouble.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.440 align:middle line:84%
So turn your art into something
that people can love, wisdom.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Paint the stories.

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.010 align:middle line:84%
You will always
remember a picture,

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.270 align:middle line:84%
but you might not
remember the words.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.700 align:middle line:84%
My natural instinct
going back home

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:16.090 align:middle line:84%
was to write down everything
that I was learning.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:18.100 align:middle line:84%
And my grandfather
took a book from me

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.538 align:middle line:90%
and threw it in the fire.

00:31:19.538 --> 00:31:20.830 align:middle line:90%
He said, what have you learned?

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.870 align:middle line:90%


00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.323 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't remember pretty
much what I had written.

00:31:26.323 --> 00:31:28.240 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been so
focused on trying to take

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.438 align:middle line:84%
notes, that I'd
forgotten everything.

00:31:30.438 --> 00:31:32.980 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather said, so if you
spend the next couple of years

00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:35.290 align:middle line:84%
up here writing
everything down, you'll

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:36.520 align:middle line:90%
go home and lose those books.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.978 align:middle line:84%
And you'll lose
everything with it.

00:31:37.978 --> 00:31:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And so that realization that
our culture survived, because we

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.670 align:middle line:90%
just kept telling stories.

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And you repeat stories, but
that's how you remember them.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.330 align:middle line:90%
And our stories change.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And they evolve with the
country, and the landscape,

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:52.470 align:middle line:90%
and the time.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:55.510 align:middle line:90%
And it has been.

00:31:55.510 --> 00:32:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Music and art has been so
instrumental in healing myself.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.250 align:middle line:90%
But I had no--

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have the
awareness that that's

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:04.327 align:middle line:90%
what it was doing to myself.

00:32:04.327 --> 00:32:05.410 align:middle line:90%
>> It was just a natural--

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:06.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It was an outlet.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.530 align:middle line:90%
It was a natural--

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:15.160 align:middle line:84%
playing music was very
natural to me, and I loved it.

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And getting that job out
in the performance hall

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.920 align:middle line:90%
at the tourist commission--

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.042 align:middle line:90%
someone then saw me.

00:32:26.042 --> 00:32:28.000 align:middle line:84%
I think it was the
commissioner of the Northern

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.740 align:middle line:84%
Territory of
Government and asked me

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.410 align:middle line:84%
if I would go on the
Territory Master, which

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:34.330 align:middle line:84%
was this promotion of
the Northern Territory

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Government, that was
running to promote

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Northern Territory as
a holiday destination.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.820 align:middle line:90%
And I said yes.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And so as the didgeridoo player,
we jumped in a motor home.

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:46.930 align:middle line:84%
And we went to every regional
town and then every city.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.300 align:middle line:84%
And about nine months
later, I was speaking

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.750 align:middle line:90%
to my grandfather, an old man.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:53.350 align:middle line:90%


00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:57.640 align:middle line:84%
I've played didgeridoo in
every state of Australia.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.660 align:middle line:90%
What do I do now?

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:03.430 align:middle line:84%
Because it was supposed to
take me my whole life, and it

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:05.900 align:middle line:90%
was done.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And then I got the
opportunity to play and dance

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:12.460 align:middle line:90%
at the Sydney Olympic Games.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:84%
And performance
became my outlet.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.840 align:middle line:84%
It became my passion,
my expression, my voice.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.480 align:middle line:90%


00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.653 align:middle line:84%
And then I said to my
grandfather on this same

00:33:25.653 --> 00:33:28.070 align:middle line:84%
conversation, when I told him
I don't know what to do now,

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and he's-- boy, don't
ever stop dreaming.

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:34.450 align:middle line:90%
Promise me that.

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:38.130 align:middle line:90%
You dream whatever you want.

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:40.200 align:middle line:90%
Have those dreams.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.060 align:middle line:84%
Old man, I'm going
to play didgeridoo

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:84%
in every country
around the world.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:50.750 align:middle line:90%
And that became my dream.

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.960 align:middle line:84%
And my girlfriend at
the time, who is now

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:59.850 align:middle line:90%
my wife, 16 years later--

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:84%
we bought a flat map of the
world and some red tacks.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.625 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
2000, I was invited

00:34:06.625 --> 00:34:08.250 align:middle line:84%
to go to Switzerland
for the first time

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.960 align:middle line:84%
to play didgeridoo
over in Switzerland.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.760 align:middle line:90%
I came home.

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.786 align:middle line:84%
And I put a red
tack on Switzerland.

00:34:12.786 --> 00:34:15.510 align:middle line:84%
>> How many red tacks
are on the map so far?

00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.760 align:middle line:90%
>> The map fell apart.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Too many tacks.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Too many tacks.

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I've had this incredibly
blessed life where

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.100 align:middle line:90%
I've seen the entire world.

00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:30.530 align:middle line:84%
I've been to some of the most
remote, exclusive places.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I've played in
Buckingham Palace.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.940 align:middle line:84%
I've played with the symphony
orchestras in America,

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.250 align:middle line:90%
and England, and Germany.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.170 align:middle line:84%
I've played in Dharamsala
for the Dalai Lama.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I was the Dalai Lama's
ambassador here in Australia.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.049 align:middle line:84%
I had my own show at the
Paris Casino in Las Vegas.

00:34:50.049 --> 00:34:52.810 align:middle line:90%


00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:56.040 align:middle line:84%
I had open shows
for Neil Diamond.

00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:59.020 align:middle line:90%
>> So a very, blessed life.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at from where you've

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:04.530 align:middle line:84%
come from to where you are now
and what you've experienced

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:08.770 align:middle line:84%
along the way, in the process of
rebuilding your self-confidence

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and the process of
finding who you really

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:15.210 align:middle line:84%
were and your self-identity
again, what would

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:19.080 align:middle line:84%
you say is the most profound
teaching from your culture

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.155 align:middle line:84%
or from the elders that
really helped you re-establish

00:35:22.155 --> 00:35:23.363 align:middle line:90%
your self-confidence?

00:35:23.363 --> 00:35:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I know
that you work a lot

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.000 align:middle line:84%
now with the youth and
the youth communities.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.230 align:middle line:84%
And so you go in
and you teach them.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it was
permission to cry,

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:37.880 align:middle line:90%
was probably one of the most--

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.980 align:middle line:84%
the biggest foundation of
this out-- not being afraid

00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.140 align:middle line:90%
of the emotions.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And that was very
liberating to be

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:53.660 align:middle line:84%
able to cry and to wail, to
actually wail with the grief

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.370 align:middle line:84%
and not be ashamed
of making a sound

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.840 align:middle line:84%
or sobbing and not having
to wipe my nose when

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.640 align:middle line:90%
it was running.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And although, I have to
remind myself still today

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:06.050 align:middle line:84%
that you have to wipe your
nose when you've been crying,

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:09.030 align:middle line:84%
because you end up with a
snotty mouth or whatnot.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:14.210 align:middle line:90%
But it really is--

00:36:14.210 --> 00:36:15.860 align:middle line:84%
there were some
several foundation.

00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:18.620 align:middle line:90%
My grandfather taught me to--

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.170 align:middle line:90%
he asked me about light.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.750 align:middle line:84%
He asked me the
question of, what's

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:26.720 align:middle line:84%
the brightest thing
you've ever seen?

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And my natural answer was
the sun as most people.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:35.610 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather said
"kija", the moon,

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.130 align:middle line:84%
because it lights
up the darkness.

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:39.840 align:middle line:90%
And he said that's that place.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:47.520 align:middle line:84%
He said [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
is to understand your shadows.

00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:50.980 align:middle line:84%
You have to sit in your
shadows to find the moon.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And if you can sit in
that place of darkness

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:56.922 align:middle line:84%
and still find light,
you'll always have hope.

00:36:56.922 --> 00:36:58.130 align:middle line:90%
It's when the light goes out.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:01.350 align:middle line:90%


00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.770 align:middle line:84%
And the light goes out when
you stop fighting the shadows

00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.510 align:middle line:90%
and you can accept the shadows.

00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Shadows exist.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.210 align:middle line:90%
There's things that--

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.502 align:middle line:90%
I don't live with any regret.

00:37:11.502 --> 00:37:12.960 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
things that I wish

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.910 align:middle line:84%
I could do to say sorry
to people that I hurt.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:16.440 align:middle line:90%
But they're not regrets.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.350 align:middle line:84%
It's more-- I just
wish I could say sorry.

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:23.700 align:middle line:84%
Because I now have the capacity
to understand the trauma

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.330 align:middle line:84%
that maybe I created to the
lady that was home alone

00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:31.050 align:middle line:84%
when I was robbing her
house or when I was--

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.560 align:middle line:84%
and she-- the fear that
maybe she'll never get over

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.510 align:middle line:84%
or the hurt when
you assault someone,

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.770 align:middle line:84%
is that I would love to be able
to say sorry to every person.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.160 align:middle line:90%
But I know that's not possible.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a regret, because
it's taught me so much.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think the thing is that
my grandfather taught me.

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:57.810 align:middle line:84%
He said, don't ever define
your life on the pain.

00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Pain can be a really
great foundation.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And it can be a great fuel
for overcoming everything.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:10.530 align:middle line:84%
But it's sort of like-- it's
a bit like petrol and fire,

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.380 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:17.400 align:middle line:84%
So my grandfather said
the fire is so sacred.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you put wood
on the fire, it burns.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.560 align:middle line:90%
And it'll keep you warm.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.103 align:middle line:84%
You put petrol on
it, it will burn you.

00:38:23.103 --> 00:38:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So you have to be careful
what you take to the fire,

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:27.540 align:middle line:90%
but take the goodness.

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.900 align:middle line:84%
But it was really that notion
of embracing all of the shadow

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.850 align:middle line:90%
side, the darkness.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said something
very different

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:36.910 align:middle line:84%
to me that all the
psychologists and counselors

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:39.905 align:middle line:84%
I had sat with that
said, you know that rage?

00:38:39.905 --> 00:38:40.780 align:middle line:90%
You got to let it go.

00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.510 align:middle line:90%
You got to get over it.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.677 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get past it.

00:38:42.677 --> 00:38:43.890 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:45.540 align:middle line:84%
My grandfather
said, see that rage?

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.810 align:middle line:90%
Never let it go.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Just don't ever
let it hurt anyone.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:55.070 align:middle line:84%
He said let it be
the thing that drives

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:58.100 align:middle line:84%
your ambitions, your hope,
your success, your dreams.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:38:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost as
if you're saying,

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:04.030 align:middle line:84%
let it become your friend
and use it to direct you.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And it did.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.580 align:middle line:84%
It became-- there's two things
when I stand up on stage just

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.380 align:middle line:90%
before.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.547 align:middle line:84%
Because I've never written
a speech, because reading

00:39:11.547 --> 00:39:16.970 align:middle line:84%
is something that I'm not
very comfortable with.

00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:17.960 align:middle line:90%
I get nervous reading.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's a year six
trauma from the teacher

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:25.070 align:middle line:84%
that used to make you stand
up behind your seat and read.

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And all the kids
would laugh at you,

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.560 align:middle line:84%
because you're
not a good reader.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:28.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I know it well.

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:28.615 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:28.615 --> 00:39:29.415 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:29.415 --> 00:39:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And it still lives
with me today.

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So I've never written a
speech, and I never will.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But there's two things
before I walk up the stairs,

00:39:38.090 --> 00:39:42.710 align:middle line:90%
is that I remember first.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And I connect to the
emotions of the people that

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:47.920 align:middle line:90%
said you'll never be nothing.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.340 align:middle line:84%
And then I remember-- the
voice of my grandfather said,

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:53.860 align:middle line:84%
you can become
anything if you're

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.680 align:middle line:84%
willing to dream
and work for it.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.540 align:middle line:90%
And then I take to the stage.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And it has been the thing
that's driven my life.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.250 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I've
been able to achieve

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:07.760 align:middle line:84%
has been based on dreams,
has been based on work hard,

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:13.820 align:middle line:84%
and have these powerful dreams,
and be bold, courageous.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And never forget sort
of the part of you

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:24.970 align:middle line:84%
that has been broken,
is that I think

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:27.980 align:middle line:84%
just because the
scars are there,

00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:30.970 align:middle line:84%
like scars are sometimes
a bit of a reminder,

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:34.360 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't
make us who we are.

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.320 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.250 align:middle line:90%
And it's interesting.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Because as I was saying
right at the beginning,

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.570 align:middle line:90%
we were talking outside.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And what you just said
there around never let

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.220 align:middle line:90%
go of your dream.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:48.005 align:middle line:84%
And it's what's driven
you all of the way.

00:40:48.005 --> 00:40:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And outside you said it's
been both my greatest

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:55.750 align:middle line:84%
gift and my greatest
enemy in the respect

00:40:55.750 --> 00:41:01.930 align:middle line:84%
that you shared outside that
you've recently experienced

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:05.110 align:middle line:84%
again a very deep
depression that's

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.920 align:middle line:84%
come over you in
the last four weeks.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.120 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it couldn't have
come at a more fitting time.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:15.610 align:middle line:84%
Sort of five weeks ago
now, life just crumbled.

00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:17.210 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:21.763 align:middle line:84%
I was back up in northeast
Arnhem Land with family.

00:41:21.763 --> 00:41:23.180 align:middle line:84%
There was a big
cultural festival,

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:27.840 align:middle line:84%
but it's sort of like a
political, cultural agenda.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was sort of just
listening to the political side

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.350 align:middle line:90%
of things.

00:41:31.350 --> 00:41:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was part of my
responsibility with work.

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And then I went back
to camp with family

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.770 align:middle line:84%
and then danced for (speaking
Kuku-Yalanji) for a ceremony.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And I laid back in
a tent that night.

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been invited
to a few campfire yurts

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.057 align:middle line:90%
to tell my personal story.

00:41:48.057 --> 00:41:49.390 align:middle line:90%
So a lady in my tent that night.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:50.940 align:middle line:90%
And I just burst into tears.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:54.100 align:middle line:84%
And it was like a great mirror
being held up against me.

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:56.110 align:middle line:90%
I was like, who have I become?

00:41:56.110 --> 00:42:03.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm now the CEO of a business,
like of an organization.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I
achieved that status.

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:09.760 align:middle line:90%
Well, hard work.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But it was inspired by
two people that told me

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.260 align:middle line:90%
I could never do it, because--

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:23.060 align:middle line:90%
and one lady said to me after--

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:25.610 align:middle line:84%
I think she probably had one
glass of red wine too many

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:28.638 align:middle line:84%
and said, it's like you're
just a spokesperson.

00:42:28.638 --> 00:42:30.555 align:middle line:84%
It's not like you're
ever going to be the CEO.

00:42:30.555 --> 00:42:33.350 align:middle line:90%


00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And another person
said to me, what

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:39.170 align:middle line:84%
do you think this is
like a social experiment?

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:42.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't know the first thing
about running a business.

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Well, did you
leave school again?

00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:50.955 align:middle line:84%
And that thing that drives
my success sort of--

00:42:50.955 --> 00:42:54.110 align:middle line:84%
and the ego and
everything that's-- well,

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.620 align:middle line:84%
it became this
attitude of like, well,

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.160 align:middle line:84%
I turned my fingers
up to the world.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:42:59.190 align:middle line:90%
Those two people.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:00.020 align:middle line:90%
Well, watch me.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.230 align:middle line:90%
I'll prove you all wrong.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:05.210 align:middle line:90%
And then I become the CEO.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And this realization is that
it probably wasn't my dream.

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.580 align:middle line:84%
It was me proving to people
that I can achieve anything

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:22.130 align:middle line:84%
if I put my mind to it, that
the limitations of someone else

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:25.040 align:middle line:84%
should never be the
limitations of ourself.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:29.140 align:middle line:84%
And sort of the ego wanted
to prove those people wrong.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.240 align:middle line:90%


00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.087 align:middle line:90%
But the realization was that--

00:43:34.087 --> 00:43:35.420 align:middle line:90%
and so world came crashing down.

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.130 align:middle line:90%
I did two things.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I sent an email to work
and said that there

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:42.470 align:middle line:84%
had been a tragedy
in the family,

00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:45.900 align:middle line:90%
probably not far from the truth.

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And then I sent an email to
my wife-- or I called my wife,

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:50.920 align:middle line:90%
but in a text message.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said that work
wanted me to go away,

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.140 align:middle line:90%
which it wasn't uncommon for--

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:58.390 align:middle line:84%
and I said, oh, we've got
to go away for China--

00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:59.740 align:middle line:90%
to China for a business meeting.

00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:02.540 align:middle line:90%
And it's not unusual.

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.110 align:middle line:84%
So my wife said
yeah, no problem.

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:05.910 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And what I thought
in my mind was

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.370 align:middle line:90%
that I'd go away for a week.

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:15.310 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that there
was a couple of triggers.

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:18.840 align:middle line:84%
So that whole thing
about hating bullies--

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:22.380 align:middle line:90%
it surfaced at Canberra Airport.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.200 align:middle line:90%
I walked to the business lounge.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.563 align:middle line:90%
And there was like a young guy.

00:44:28.563 --> 00:44:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And he was completely
bullying this young girl

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.980 align:middle line:90%
behind the counter.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:34.900 align:middle line:84%
Because he wanted to get
on the earlier flight,

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.620 align:middle line:84%
but he bought a fare
that couldn't be changed.

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:38.760 align:middle line:90%
And he was demanding it.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.360 align:middle line:84%
And he was being horrible and
making this young girl feel.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him,
I said bud, look,

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:48.570 align:middle line:84%
if she can't change the ticket,
she can't change the ticket.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:50.910 align:middle line:84%
There's no point making
her feel horrible.

00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And he's said to me, it's
none of your business.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, the moment I
heard you abusing this woman,

00:44:57.810 --> 00:44:59.610 align:middle line:90%
it became my business.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.360 align:middle line:84%
And he said to me,
mind your own business.

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.683 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him
at that point--

00:45:03.683 --> 00:45:05.100 align:middle line:84%
and there was a
few people around,

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:10.800 align:middle line:84%
but I'd already locked my
intent on don't bully people.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.810 align:middle line:90%
And now, I'm going to bully you.

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:16.920 align:middle line:84%
And I said to him, I said
people like you end up

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.190 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom of those
stairs in a pool of blood

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:22.830 align:middle line:84%
with ambulance officers asking
questions on how the hell

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:25.760 align:middle line:90%
he landed there.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And it was that
steely look, that

00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:35.363 align:middle line:84%
deathly look of hatred, like
don't disempower this woman.

00:45:35.363 --> 00:45:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And I want to make
you feel like--

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make you
feel right now how

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.340 align:middle line:90%
you're making this lady feel.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:44.150 align:middle line:90%
And that was at a point.

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
that rage, that anger

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:50.990 align:middle line:84%
was starting to
come back to life.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:52.040 align:middle line:90%
But I sort of ignored it.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.800 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, let it go.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:56.430 align:middle line:90%


00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:00.990 align:middle line:84%
But really, the truth was
that I was struggling.

00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:02.238 align:middle line:90%
I moved from Sydney.

00:46:02.238 --> 00:46:03.780 align:middle line:84%
I moved from Queensland
two years ago

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.540 align:middle line:84%
to pursue this job with
my wife and our kids.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And I've, everyday, almost
woken up and said I hate Sydney.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And I blamed Sydney
for the turmoil that

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.080 align:middle line:84%
was going on inside,
because I didn't really

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:16.880 align:middle line:90%
want to dig inside.

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.180 align:middle line:90%
Because I didn't have time.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:27.800 align:middle line:84%
Work, work, work, work,
achieve this thing, chase this.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, my
paints stay in the box.

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:33.130 align:middle line:90%
My music barely comes out.

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So what you'd found over
those two years is that you

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.390 align:middle line:84%
literally hadn't picked up
a didgeridoo, hadn't drawn--

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:40.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, no.

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:41.410 align:middle line:84%
>> --hadn't done
any other things.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:42.243 align:middle line:90%
>> Still didgeridoo.

00:46:42.243 --> 00:46:43.600 align:middle line:90%
But had I played for myself?

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.070 align:middle line:84%
No, I'd only played
for an audience,

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:47.880 align:middle line:90%
which was very different.

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:49.390 align:middle line:90%
>> You found you were losing--

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:50.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:52.300 align:middle line:84%
>> --contact with the
very things that--

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That made me.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:54.098 align:middle line:90%
>> --kept you grounded.

00:46:54.098 --> 00:46:59.410 align:middle line:84%
>> That healed me
as a wounded man.

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I realized was that
I was giving to everyone,

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:04.300 align:middle line:90%
but not giving back to myself.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm a classic case of
the wounded healer, that

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:12.070 align:middle line:84%
I want to fix everyone, is
that the traditional healing is

00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:13.960 align:middle line:90%
a big part of my life.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate to
sit with those old men

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:19.583 align:middle line:84%
and have that
knowledge taught to me.

00:47:19.583 --> 00:47:20.500 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't doing it.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:21.490 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't practicing it.

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, my
spirit suffocated.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.150 align:middle line:90%
And I cracked, so turmoil.

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.200 align:middle line:90%
So as I said, let my wife--

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.450 align:middle line:84%
I just thought, I'd
go away for seven days

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:35.620 align:middle line:90%
and come back until work.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:37.690 align:middle line:90%
Family is right.

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:38.620 align:middle line:90%
We'll get through it.

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:40.720 align:middle line:90%
We go through this a lot.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd go home
to my wife and kids

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.290 align:middle line:90%
and say China is just all right.

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:45.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm tired.

00:47:45.090 --> 00:47:46.990 align:middle line:90%
And you know what it's like.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:49.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm happy to be home.

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.630 align:middle line:84%
But on day four, two of
my children got sick.

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.390 align:middle line:90%
One got like a croup.

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:58.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the other one
got impetigo cold sores.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And my wife started texting me,
saying, like, I need some help.

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:03.740 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.600 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't responding.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.020 align:middle line:90%
And then her mom called her.

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.910 align:middle line:84%
And said, have
you seen the news?

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:10.910 align:middle line:90%
And she was like, no.

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:12.035 align:middle line:90%
And she's like. turn it on.

00:48:12.035 --> 00:48:16.060 align:middle line:84%
And a typhoon was developing
off the coast of China.

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And so my wife panicked
and called work.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:23.520 align:middle line:90%
And work said, what do you mean?

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> He's at home.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.160 align:middle line:90%
>> He's with you.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.910 align:middle line:90%
And, so you know.

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:32.450 align:middle line:84%
But what I'd done was
I'd flown back to Sydney

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:35.090 align:middle line:90%
from Darwin on Sunday morning--

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:38.900 align:middle line:84%
from Arnhem Land to Darwin,
red eyed in, and then jumped

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.900 align:middle line:84%
on a plane to Santiago, and
then flew to Lima, and then

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.600 align:middle line:84%
from Lima to Iquitos,
and then four hours

00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:47.690 align:middle line:84%
on a dinghy up the
Amazon to the Ugwa people

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:49.820 align:middle line:90%
who I met nine years ago.

00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:51.290 align:middle line:90%
There was only 22 of them.

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:52.890 align:middle line:90%
No one spoke a word of English.

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:56.205 align:middle line:84%
And I knew that I could sit
there and play didgeridoo.

00:48:56.205 --> 00:48:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And no one would ask me
questions, because we couldn't

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.420 align:middle line:90%
speak each other's language.

00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.890 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:05.850 align:middle line:84%
I sat in the Amazon
for a week and thought

00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:07.967 align:middle line:90%
everything was going to be--

00:49:07.967 --> 00:49:10.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you get a gut
instinct that things weren't?

00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:18.160 align:middle line:84%
On the exact day, I was like
something's not quite right.

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.060 align:middle line:84%
This intuitive-- it was
coming back to life,

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.600 align:middle line:90%
because I was healing myself.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.550 align:middle line:84%
But I knew I had to
have time to myself.

00:49:26.550 --> 00:49:28.440 align:middle line:84%
Because I knew my wife
would say, come on.

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:30.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about it.

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.630 align:middle line:90%
Let's get through it.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:32.832 align:middle line:90%
But I needed stillness.

00:49:32.832 --> 00:49:34.290 align:middle line:84%
And that was
something that my mind

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:37.120 align:middle line:90%
hadn't been for a long time.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.138 align:middle line:84%
And so when I got back to
reception, it was at Lima.

00:49:41.138 --> 00:49:42.180 align:middle line:90%
And I turned my phone on.

00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.430 align:middle line:84%
It was like, beep, beep,
beep, beep, beep. beep, beep.

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:46.230 align:middle line:84%
All these messages,
people panicking.

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:48.900 align:middle line:90%
Where are you?

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:50.580 align:middle line:84%
Because my wife
had called Qantas.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:51.650 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't give
her any details,

00:49:51.650 --> 00:49:53.130 align:middle line:84%
so she had to report
to the police.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And so what actually unfolded
was that I had to come to terms

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:02.660 align:middle line:84%
and face the reality that now
the world knew that I was in--

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.050 align:middle line:84%
my brother has been my
best friend in this.

00:50:06.050 --> 00:50:08.660 align:middle line:84%
My brother did work for
the Black Dog Institute.

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.300 align:middle line:90%


00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:13.700 align:middle line:84%
But he's so blatantly
honest, right?

00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:17.420 align:middle line:84%
So when my wife called him
at midnight and said like--

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.137 align:middle line:90%
he tells you everything.

00:50:19.137 --> 00:50:19.970 align:middle line:90%
Where have you been?

00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And he said, he told
me he's going to China.

00:50:22.690 --> 00:50:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And he said to my wife,
listen, there's two things.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.170 align:middle line:84%
He's either having an affair
or he's had a breakdown.

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:32.238 align:middle line:90%
He's taken off bush.

00:50:32.238 --> 00:50:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I wish he hadn't have
said the affair part,

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:37.750 align:middle line:84%
because that freaks
your wife out a bit.

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.690 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of it
was I'd just taken off.

00:50:40.690 --> 00:50:43.330 align:middle line:84%
That I realized that the
rage was coming back.

00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:46.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was going to hurt
somebody or myself.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And I needed to heal
that part of me.

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.600 align:middle line:90%
And so I did.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:54.120 align:middle line:84%
But coming home, I confronted
by the reality of the world

00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:54.920 align:middle line:90%
knew now.

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.250 align:middle line:90%
The work and everyone knew.

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:58.270 align:middle line:90%
And it was pretty dark.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:50:59.420 align:middle line:90%
It was it was painful.

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:02.690 align:middle line:90%
But this is only five weeks ago.

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:03.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting here.

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:06.860 align:middle line:90%
And you know again.

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:07.660 align:middle line:90%
I went.

00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:10.902 align:middle line:84%
It's part of protocol
for work and support.

00:51:10.902 --> 00:51:12.610 align:middle line:84%
I went to a psychologist
in North Sydney,

00:51:12.610 --> 00:51:14.380 align:middle line:84%
and it drove me
absolutely insane.

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Because it was a
white room that--

00:51:17.110 --> 00:51:18.790 align:middle line:84%
and she asked me
these questions.

00:51:18.790 --> 00:51:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And it had nothing to do with it
being a woman, but I was like--

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:26.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Feeling for you is a
very different experience.

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:27.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And so I called
Clinton Schultz who's

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.090 align:middle line:90%
an Aboriginal psychologist.

00:51:33.090 --> 00:51:35.127 align:middle line:90%
And he flew down to Sydney.

00:51:35.127 --> 00:51:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And we just-- he said well,
just meet in the park.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we sat in the
park and we just yearned.

00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:41.470 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:44.932 align:middle line:84%
We just-- I unpacked
this conversation

00:51:44.932 --> 00:51:47.140 align:middle line:84%
and realized that I had
abandoned all the things that

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:51.310 align:middle line:84%
made me strong in
pursuit of success

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:57.280 align:middle line:84%
in a corporate world or to
be seen as I achieved it

00:51:57.280 --> 00:51:58.210 align:middle line:90%
for someone else.

00:51:58.210 --> 00:52:00.800 align:middle line:90%
And the last four weeks that--

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:01.600 align:middle line:90%
I've sat at home.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:06.760 align:middle line:84%
I've had my kids for longer,
love my wife more, and just

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:08.830 align:middle line:90%
fed my spirit.

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:13.780 align:middle line:84%
And in five weeks,
I've lost 13 kilos.

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't done
anything different

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:18.640 align:middle line:84%
except in the morning,
I make my coffee hot

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:21.230 align:middle line:90%
so I can drink it slowly.

00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And I sit down and
eat my breakfast.

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:26.570 align:middle line:90%
And I chew it, not swallow.

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:29.290 align:middle line:90%
And I enjoy the food.

00:52:29.290 --> 00:52:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't talk on the phone
while I'm eating anymore.

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:34.027 align:middle line:84%
Because I want to enjoy the
food that's nurturing my body.

00:52:34.027 --> 00:52:37.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've sort of
unpacked everything.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:39.530 align:middle line:84%
And I've dusted off
the paint brushes,

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:41.670 align:middle line:84%
and started painting
again, and playing music,

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:45.300 align:middle line:90%
or my instruments are out.

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.298 align:middle line:84%
We spent time
walking in the bush.

00:52:47.298 --> 00:52:48.590 align:middle line:90%
I live on a beautiful property.

00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:50.210 align:middle line:84%
It had nothing to
do with Sydney.

00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:51.882 align:middle line:90%
Where I live is incredible.

00:52:51.882 --> 00:52:54.215 align:middle line:84%
My property backs onto the
Blue Mountains National Park.

00:52:54.215 --> 00:52:56.840 align:middle line:90%


00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:02.090 align:middle line:84%
it's just that I was so
busy trying to achieve this,

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:04.550 align:middle line:90%
that I forgot to feed this.

00:53:04.550 --> 00:53:08.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So, Jeremy, that leads me
to a question if you could just

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:14.150 align:middle line:84%
put literally, I guess the one
top thing that you would want

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:19.730 align:middle line:84%
to remind any young child
or teenager that is off

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.350 align:middle line:90%
their path.

00:53:21.350 --> 00:53:26.030 align:middle line:84%
What what's the one thing that
you would want them to remember

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:29.390 align:middle line:90%
to help them get back on path.

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:31.790 align:middle line:84%
In the night of the
dark soul, what's

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:36.950 align:middle line:84%
the one thing that you
would remind somebody?

00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:41.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that dreams
are so critical.

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:43.120 align:middle line:90%
Dreams are not--

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.510 align:middle line:84%
I always thought dreams
were for the privileged.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:48.890 align:middle line:90%
But dreams are free.

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:50.970 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is that you
can have as many dreams

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:51.770 align:middle line:90%
as you like.

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And always found that my dreams
have been my red balloon,

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:55.360 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.960 align:middle line:84%
Because I fall
every now and then.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.490 align:middle line:90%
I stumble.

00:53:58.490 --> 00:54:01.880 align:middle line:84%
But as long as I hold onto that
balloon, it lifts my hand up.

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:05.510 align:middle line:84%
So it makes it a bit easier
to get back off the ground.

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:06.920 align:middle line:90%
We all stumble.

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.880 align:middle line:84%
Anyone that says
they don't is denying

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:11.330 align:middle line:90%
know of an emotional path.

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:14.050 align:middle line:84%
So to any of those young
people, have dreams

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.760 align:middle line:90%
and feed your dreams.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Dreams are like plants, right?

00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:19.760 align:middle line:90%
They won't grow with no water.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:24.870 align:middle line:84%
And dreams grow with
love and action.

00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And don't let anyone
else define your dreams.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Like I said earlier, the
limitations of someone else

00:54:31.350 --> 00:54:32.150 align:middle line:90%
is their own.

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:33.150 align:middle line:90%
It's not yours.

00:54:33.150 --> 00:54:35.150 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
invest into that.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.370 align:middle line:90%
So I'd always say that.

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:36.740 align:middle line:90%
Dream.

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:37.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Dreams.

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And hold your dreams
and feed your dreams.

00:54:39.770 --> 00:54:40.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:54:40.570 --> 00:54:41.480 align:middle line:90%
And tell your dreams.

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.190 align:middle line:90%
Because dreams are like--

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:45.603 align:middle line:84%
and I know this is a bit
challenging for some people,

00:54:45.603 --> 00:54:47.270 align:middle line:84%
because people hear
the infectious part.

00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:48.870 align:middle line:90%
And they go, oh, infection.

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.150 align:middle line:90%
That's bad.

00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:51.800 align:middle line:90%
But dreams are infectious.

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So when you tell your
dream to somebody

00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:59.218 align:middle line:84%
and they see it in your eyes,
that that's what you dream,

00:54:59.218 --> 00:55:00.510 align:middle line:90%
they fall in love with it, too.

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:03.030 align:middle line:84%
And so your dream
just got bigger.

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:05.100 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:07.840 align:middle line:90%
So I have one more question.

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:11.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is something we're
asking all of our speakers.

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:16.200 align:middle line:84%
And that is through all of time,
the philosophers have always

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:21.180 align:middle line:84%
said, we are what we think
and what we tell our brains,

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.670 align:middle line:90%
our minds, we come to believe.

00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
the "I am" statement

00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:28.500 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most powerful
statements we can ever

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.430 align:middle line:90%
speak to ourselves.

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:33.570 align:middle line:84%
So if there was an "I am"
that you would wake up

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:38.330 align:middle line:84%
to remind yourself of every
day, what would your "I am" be?

00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>> See, this is not a
short answer, really.

00:55:41.850 --> 00:55:43.920 align:middle line:84%
But like in our
culture, we believe

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:47.230 align:middle line:84%
there are three brains
in the human body.

00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:50.450 align:middle line:84%
We believe like
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:51.250 align:middle line:90%
in our language.

00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And [NON-ENGLISH]
is that instinct,

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:57.090 align:middle line:84%
that intuitive mind
that is the biggest one.

00:55:57.090 --> 00:56:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It sits in the stomach,
the gut instinct.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.080 align:middle line:84%
But the next one
is [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.850 align:middle line:90%
so the heart where you feel.

00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:06.220 align:middle line:90%
And then the interesting part--

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:09.247 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] means-- the only
time you use that word is when

00:56:09.247 --> 00:56:10.580 align:middle line:90%
you're fishing net gets tangled.

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:11.980 align:middle line:90%
It means it's no good.

00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:17.300 align:middle line:84%
And so if you drive your life
with this, it'll be tangled.

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:20.360 align:middle line:84%
When a young child is
born into the world,

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:24.520 align:middle line:84%
if they choose to live amongst
us in the physical world,

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:27.020 align:middle line:84%
they take [NON-ENGLISH],, that
first conscious breath a baby

00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:28.448 align:middle line:90%
takes, that gasp.

00:56:28.448 --> 00:56:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they need to be
smacked by the doctor to take

00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:34.290 align:middle line:84%
it, but it happens
or it doesn't.

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:37.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the last
thing anyone does,

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:39.840 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a traumatic
accident, or just old age,

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.440 align:middle line:90%
or you gasp.

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's the way
in, the way out.

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.490 align:middle line:84%
It's that sacred
breath of the spirit.

00:56:46.490 --> 00:56:51.290 align:middle line:84%
And we don't-- as humans,
we've become a bit anxious.

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we don't breathe,
our shallow breathing.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.250 align:middle line:84%
So we never give
life to our stomach.

00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:58.200 align:middle line:90%
And so that diaphragm breath.

00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the first thing
the last five weeks.

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:04.010 align:middle line:84%
I lay in bed and
fill my diaphragm up

00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:05.510 align:middle line:90%
with life and breath and truth.

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
that's here then

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.790 align:middle line:90%
has to pass over the heart.

00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:11.090 align:middle line:84%
So I know what's
real and what's not.

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:12.360 align:middle line:90%
And then the mind--

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:16.380 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH],, which means
tangled or no good actually

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:17.180 align:middle line:90%
comes to life.

00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Because it has the
processing ability

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.500 align:middle line:90%
to translate the emotions.

00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And that is-- my "I am"
is to breathe, right?

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I am breath.

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:32.106 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:57:32.106 --> 00:57:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Jeremy, thank you
so much for sharing

00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:37.510 align:middle line:84%
your amazing story,
and your wisdom,

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:39.310 align:middle line:90%
and the wisdom of your elders.

00:57:39.310 --> 00:57:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's just been
an absolute pleasure.

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And thank you so
much for your time.

00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:44.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:50.000 align:middle line:90%
