00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:07.760 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Pam, a very warm welcome.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.790 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.490 align:middle line:84%
You know, again, I have the
pleasure of introducing you

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:84%
as a personal
friend and a mentor,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.460 align:middle line:84%
because you've actually helped
me get my first book out there.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And it became a
number one bestseller.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And I'm speaking to you as
a 10-times Amazon number one

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:90%
bestseller.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.760 align:middle line:84%
You're a true go-getter,
a true entrepreneur

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.240 align:middle line:84%
in the absolute
trueness of the word.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
You're very inspiring to women
from all walks that are really

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:84%
trying to get out there
and do what they love.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And you've just
recently spent some time

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:84%
with Sir Richard Branson
on his private island.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:90%
That was amazing.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.710 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Jo, for having me.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean you got me a bit
teary there for a minute--

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.250 align:middle line:84%
so much that we've
done together.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.460 align:middle line:90%
It's been a wild ride.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.880 align:middle line:84%
>> It really has, and you know,
I guess the very first thing

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.750 align:middle line:84%
that I want to ask, because, you
know, you're highly successful,

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.340 align:middle line:84%
and you have been for the
majority of your life.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.330 align:middle line:84%
But there was one segment
in your life some time ago,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.798 align:middle line:90%
where it wasn't always that way.

00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was wondering
if you could just

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
start by sharing
with us what occurred

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.890 align:middle line:84%
in your life at that time when
things were running so well,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.830 align:middle line:84%
and you're at the height of
your success in your career.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And what took a
turn the other way?

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, no, that's a good--
really great question, Jo,

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.090 align:middle line:84%
because it seems
like so long ago now.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.240 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes it
seems like just yesterday.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.115 align:middle line:84%
I was really
successful on my own.

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:49.120 align:middle line:84%
I bought two properties
by the age of 35,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.700 align:middle line:84%
doubled my money every
time, had the share market.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.150 align:middle line:90%
Everything was going smooth.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I met my husband later in
life, had my beautiful son,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.790 align:middle line:90%
and life was just awesome.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.270 align:middle line:84%
And then I was just
given an opportunity.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.320 align:middle line:90%
I was a really savvy woman.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
I was given an opportunity to
buy our first million dollar

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.510 align:middle line:90%
home.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And my husband just
thought-- we'd just

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle line:90%
given birth to our son.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:90%
He was only 10 months old.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.800 align:middle line:84%
He said, this is sort of not
the time to be taking on,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:90%
we're on one's salary.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.600 align:middle line:84%
But me, I was the gung ho
woman, said, we could do it,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.080 align:middle line:90%
we could do it.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.370 align:middle line:90%
And so we went ahead and did it.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:84%
And it was the worst
financial decision of my life.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.220 align:middle line:84%
And six months after
we bought that house,

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.010 align:middle line:90%
we lost it and lost everything.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So just one decision in your
life went from being the best

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.670 align:middle line:90%
ever to--

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It just flatlined.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Flatlined, so financially, an
enormous loss down to nothing.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Huge, huge.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.910 align:middle line:84%
We had to borrow a lot of
money from family and friends

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:90%
to keep our head above water.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.010 align:middle line:84%
So I got a $30,000
credit card debt,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and I had to borrow
money off my family

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:84%
just to keep a
roof over our head.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.590 align:middle line:84%
And we just had to go and
move into this little horrible

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.130 align:middle line:90%
red brick unit and survive.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So you know, coming from
somebody who's so high energy,

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.520 align:middle line:84%
so positively minded,
and, you know, today,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.670 align:middle line:84%
we're looking really through
the lenses of mindset

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and mindfulness to really
understand how we can overcome

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.160 align:middle line:90%
depression and anxiety.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.860 align:middle line:84%
So coming from that place of
being always so positive to,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.580 align:middle line:84%
you know, this happening
and financial loss

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.930 align:middle line:84%
that, you know, we know can
trigger the depths of safety

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.630 align:middle line:90%
and security within us, what--

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:90%
how did you feel at the time?

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.310 align:middle line:84%
What was-- what
were you aware of?

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> When it happened, I just
spiraled out of control.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
I just had never
dealt with this ever.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to
deal with the guilt,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:84%
because my husband, who'd been
an entrepreneur all his life,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.530 align:middle line:90%
had to start paying the bills.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So he had to go
and get a job doing

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.980 align:middle line:90%
something he absolutely hated.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So not only was I having
to deal with the fact

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:84%
that we were living on
the breadline, basically.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.760 align:middle line:84%
He'd come home every
day and look at me,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and all he wanted to do
was be with his little boy,

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.760 align:middle line:90%
and I put him in this position.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:90%
So the guilt was huge.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:90%
And so for the next four years.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
I just pretty much
became a shell

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:84%
of who I was and was just
living Groundhog Day.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.640 align:middle line:84%
I'd just wake up, feed
my child, go to bed,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.030 align:middle line:90%
and that was my life.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And so you experiencing,
at that time, you know,

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.120 align:middle line:84%
difficulty in even leaving
the property to go out during

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:84%
the day or, you know,
just to function normally.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.900 align:middle line:84%
Even just the normal day to day
tasks were an effort for you.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't--

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:90%
I went through a stage, where--

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.970 align:middle line:84%
we live in a beautiful area, and
my son had just started school.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.760 align:middle line:84%
So I was in this
position for four years.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.470 align:middle line:84%
I didn't snap out of
it for four years.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And then my son
started getting invited

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.695 align:middle line:84%
to all these
beautiful homes, and I

00:04:57.695 --> 00:04:58.820 align:middle line:90%
went to go and pick him up.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And then he'd always
say to me, Mommy,

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.480 align:middle line:84%
can people come and
play at our house?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'd say no, because
I was too embarrassed

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.190 align:middle line:90%
to bring people there.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And that just made it get deeper
and deeper, spiraling down.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:84%
What sort of mom am I
to not let people come

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:90%
and play with their children?

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So it all just became
about this whole life

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.320 align:middle line:84%
I had created that I
was too embarrassed

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:90%
to share with the world.

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.340 align:middle line:90%
So that just made it worse.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
>> So can I ask, over
that-- you know, that time,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:84%
those four years, did
you find yourself relying

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.890 align:middle line:84%
on anti-depressants
or medication?

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.180 align:middle line:90%
Did you seek help?

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.290 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I'm one of these people
who I'm very independent.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:90%
I just stay within myself.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
I talked to my mom a
lot, and my mom helped me

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.170 align:middle line:90%
through a lot of times.

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And I got to a comfort
place, where I just wasn't

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.000 align:middle line:90%
a successful person anymore.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.417 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
you know what?

00:05:52.417 --> 00:05:54.130 align:middle line:84%
Maybe this is as
good as it gets.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I just lived
every day with,

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:84%
you know, wake up, do what
I do, look after my kid,

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.040 align:middle line:84%
take him to school, bring him
home, and that was my life,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.990 align:middle line:84%
whereas before this happened,
I could conquer anything.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.585 align:middle line:84%
You know, I strived to
be somebody in my life

00:06:10.585 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:84%
and make a bigger
impact in everything,

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.043 align:middle line:90%
but I lost all that.

00:06:13.043 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:90%
It was gone.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.000 align:middle line:84%
So I just sat there
and did nothing really.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.706 align:middle line:84%
>> So you described
to me before--

00:06:20.706 --> 00:06:23.820 align:middle line:84%
before we started chatting,
you were saying to me

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that that four-year period,
as you described it,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.490 align:middle line:84%
was Groundhog Day, and also a
feeling of complete numbness

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that you just-- you
know, you really

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:40.080 align:middle line:84%
couldn't feel any real emotion
or motivation to do anything.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And did you realize at the
time that you were depressed?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.330 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I didn't realize until
I looked back at that time.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.460 align:middle line:84%
My husband and I went
through a really bad time,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:90%
where I was just angry.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And I was angry that I
made the wrong decision,

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.220 align:middle line:84%
and I was angry that
we were stuck here.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And so it caused a
lot of angst at home,

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and then I kind of realized
that it wasn't even him.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.410 align:middle line:90%
It was just me imploding.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was just sitting
there going, well, great,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.320 align:middle line:90%
this is Pam Brossman's life.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Is this all I'm going
to amount to in life?

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:90%
And I just was miserable.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.100 align:middle line:84%
I was unhappy, so much so that
I was just walking around.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.003 align:middle line:90%
As you said, I was numb.

00:07:25.003 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:90%
I didn't really just--

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I just existed.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So in that numbness, did you
did you also find that you felt

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.650 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of the victim
and self-pity, you know,

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:90%
because in that place--

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and it's so hard to pick
yourself out of it--

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.630 align:middle line:84%
you sit in a place of
just blaming yourself

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and those around you
and the situation.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:90%
Was that true for you?

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.065 align:middle line:90%
>> I-- Jo, I was angry.

00:07:52.065 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:84%
I blamed somebody else for the
situation for those four years.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
And I used that anger
to stay where I was.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, I
realized that if I

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
don't take responsibility
for making that decision that

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.890 align:middle line:84%
put me in this
place, then I'm not

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:84%
going to get out
of this hellhole.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And so I then had to
take responsibility

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.840 align:middle line:84%
for, I made a mistake, and
then one day, my mom said

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:84%
to me on the phone-- she said,
Pam, you got to the top once.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.580 align:middle line:90%
You can do it again.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, you know what?

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.419 align:middle line:90%
My son deserves a better life.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:35.100 align:middle line:90%
She's right.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.086 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I flicked
my switch back on.

00:08:37.086 --> 00:08:39.419 align:middle line:84%
>> So was that-- that was the
light bulb moment for you.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> That was it for me.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.210 align:middle line:84%
My son came home crying one
day, and he just looked at me

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and said, Mommy, I want children
to be able to play with me.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.060 align:middle line:90%
Why can't I bring them home?

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And I just thought,
this hole that I'm in,

00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:58.080 align:middle line:84%
how can I inspire
my own son to be

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.740 align:middle line:84%
the best person he can be in
life when his mom's given up?

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.700 align:middle line:84%
And I did it for the
love of my child.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.500 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:04.980 align:middle line:90%
>>I did it.

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.813 align:middle line:90%
>> I did it for him.

00:09:05.813 --> 00:09:08.620 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Take a breath.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.483 align:middle line:90%
It takes courage.

00:09:12.483 --> 00:09:13.400 align:middle line:90%
It takes real courage.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I just go back in time.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:19.320 align:middle line:84%
It was a really, really
sad time in my life.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So in that time leading
up to that light bulb moment,

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.320 align:middle line:90%
where everything changed--

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:30.020 align:middle line:84%
>> --do you have any day to
day tools that helped you get

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:84%
through, or literally until that
light bulb moment that almost,

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:37.690 align:middle line:90%
you know, slap, the--

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.730 align:middle line:84%
were beautiful words
from your mother.

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:40.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Were you-- what were your
coping strategies up until that

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:90%
point?

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Or you feel you didn't
really have any,

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.980 align:middle line:90%
that you were just existing?

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I wasn't--

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I didn't have any skills.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.690 align:middle line:84%
All I was doing was my
husband was providing for us,

00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:00.160 align:middle line:84%
even though he was miserable,
and I was providing for my son.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.525 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:10:01.525 --> 00:10:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I didn't do anything
outside my comfort zone.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:04.442 align:middle line:90%
I didn't spend any money.

00:10:04.442 --> 00:10:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Every cent that my
husband made, I just

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:84%
kept it towards
paying the bills.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:84%
So there was no coping, because
I didn't know how to cope.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so then
with the, you know,

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:22.030 align:middle line:84%
changing of the tides and the
inspirational words of wisdom

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.270 align:middle line:84%
from your mom, what, then--
what was the transition?

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.050 align:middle line:84%
What kind of tools did you
start to go out and seek

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.810 align:middle line:84%
that helped you put
yourself out of that rut?

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:36.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the first thing
I said to my husband,

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.350 align:middle line:84%
he came home from work one
day after I spoke to my mom,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.480 align:middle line:84%
and I just said, this isn't
the life I want for me,

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.270 align:middle line:84%
and this is not the
life I want for my son.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.180 align:middle line:84%
We did have a little bit
of money in the unit,

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.620 align:middle line:90%
because we bought the unit.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:84%
But we pretty much--
the bank owned the unit.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.200 align:middle line:90%
We didn't have much in it.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.410 align:middle line:84%
But I said, with what we've
got left in this unit, I said,

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.440 align:middle line:90%
I want you to be happy.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So I-- we agreed to sell
it, and we rented it back.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And he quit his job, and
in that moment, we decided,

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:10.820 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:13.670 align:middle line:84%
We're going to get back out
there and do what we do best,

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's Pam and Steve
Brossman success story.

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
So we took a little
bit of that money,

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and we invested it in us.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.730 align:middle line:84%
And we went on a
millionaire cruise

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
with 100 other millionaire
mindset people.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.827 align:middle line:84%
And that was a game
changer for us.

00:11:33.827 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And so that's when
everything changed.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:90%
It was like, you know what?

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Mom's right.

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.940 align:middle line:84%
I can get back out
there and do it again.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:45.220 align:middle line:84%
So I took responsibility
for it, and then I

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:90%
decided it was time to change.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.610 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
everything changed.

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:90%
>> So over the--

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.170 align:middle line:84%
you know, over those
changing landscape,

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:00.480 align:middle line:84%
you know, from going on the
cruise to a whole change

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.540 align:middle line:84%
in mindset, which I want
to come to in a moment,

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:84%
because, you know, this is a
big subject around the capacity

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.000 align:middle line:84%
to really use our minds
and direct our focus

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:84%
to create the reality
that we want to create.

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:84%
But there's also
healing along the way.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:17.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.960 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, emotional healing
along the way for what's been

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.310 align:middle line:90%
experienced and what comes up.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And you mentioned before that
there was a lot of anger,

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.160 align:middle line:84%
a lot of guilt,
and a lot of shame.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.450 align:middle line:84%
Can you share with us how you've
managed, just for yourself--

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.030 align:middle line:84%
because everyone's
different-- but how have you

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.750 align:middle line:84%
managed to make peace with
those thoughts and feelings?

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.390 align:middle line:84%
>> There was somebody who was
involved in the fact that we

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.800 align:middle line:90%
lost our home.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And he happened to live
a couple of streets away.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And for those four years, I
used to see him every day.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:57.490 align:middle line:84%
And when I saw him, I
felt sick, because he just

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.270 align:middle line:84%
represented what he put me and
my child and my family through.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.960 align:middle line:84%
So I did blame him, and
I used to get the shakes.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:84%
I felt physically
not coping, and then

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.520 align:middle line:84%
when we made that decision that
I had to take responsibility

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:18.350 align:middle line:84%
for what had happened, I
started seeing him and smiling.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized
that until I let

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.770 align:middle line:84%
it go and let go of
the blame, my world

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.140 align:middle line:90%
is not going to change.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.710 align:middle line:84%
It was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do,

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:35.670 align:middle line:84%
but when I did that,
I could let it go.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.950 align:middle line:90%
And all these doors opened.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.690 align:middle line:84%
It was like the
darkness had lifted.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.715 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm hearing almost
is like the power of forgiveness

00:13:42.715 --> 00:13:43.515 align:middle line:90%
towards this man--

00:13:43.515 --> 00:13:43.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:90%
>> --released you.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep, without a doubt.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:52.720 align:middle line:84%
The hatred that I had for
him was just killing my soul.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.690 align:middle line:84%
It was no-- I had never
experienced as much hatred

00:13:55.690 --> 00:14:02.170 align:middle line:84%
as I had to this one person for
putting my family through this.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I started
reading some books

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and realizing that,
you know what?

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:13.560 align:middle line:84%
I made the ultimate decision
to go ahead with it.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:90%
He just gave me the opportunity.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And then when I took
responsibility for it

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:24.880 align:middle line:84%
and let him go, then doors
started opening for us.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.930 align:middle line:90%
And we got success so fast.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.800 align:middle line:90%
It was crazy.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.555 align:middle line:90%
So really, I had to let it go.

00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.965 align:middle line:84%
So in the letting go, there was
also a shift in your mindset.

00:14:36.965 --> 00:14:38.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And so did you have--
were there any sort of daily

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.890 align:middle line:84%
practices that once you started
to realize and become mindful

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that it was very much about
what you focused on and how you

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:84%
focused on it, that changed
the flow of energy and what you

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:57.200 align:middle line:90%
could attract into your life?

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Did you have daily
practices in that respect

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:90%
to keep you focused?

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm the sort of person who
doesn't like to have debt.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm really good with money,
which is why this floored me.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And so we had this
$30k debt that we

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.250 align:middle line:84%
incurred having to get ourselves
out of this financial mess.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.458 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, you know what?

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:19.083 align:middle line:84%
I don't want this
hanging over my head,

00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:21.080 align:middle line:84%
because this is what
gets people in trouble.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.760 align:middle line:84%
They took forever just
paying off the interest.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:90%
So I went in search--

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:31.340 align:middle line:84%
being the solution person, I
went in search for a solution.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And I found a way to
get rid of that 30k debt

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:38.120 align:middle line:90%
interest-free in six months.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And that was an
achievement for me.

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I just saw all these
people in the same position

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:50.300 align:middle line:84%
as me financially struggling,
and I just thought,

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:90%
I can help these people.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:59.340 align:middle line:84%
So I wanted to get out there,
specifically women, help them

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.730 align:middle line:84%
if they got themselves
into a financial mess.

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.080 align:middle line:90%
And that inspired me.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I had that energy
that it was no longer about me,

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:09.300 align:middle line:84%
it was about helping
other people overcome

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.960 align:middle line:84%
what I'd just been through,
that was a huge shift for me.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's like you found an
even greater motive bigger than

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:18.380 align:middle line:90%
yourself.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.170 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> And a real purpose to connect
to and to give you some meaning

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:26.140 align:middle line:90%
and purpose.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:31.342 align:middle line:84%
And that became your drive to
continue to bring you back up.

00:16:31.342 --> 00:16:32.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because
what happened, Jo,

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.050 align:middle line:84%
is I never told
anybody what happened.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:38.830 align:middle line:90%
It was like that secret.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And as we started becoming
more and more successful,

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.580 align:middle line:84%
I swept it further and
further under the carpet.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:84%
I thought, what impact will
this have on me and my business

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
my brand if people
know of my failure?

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.050 align:middle line:84%
So I just let people believe
I was this successful woman

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.330 align:middle line:90%
all along.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And then-- but I felt
like I was living a lie.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:05.170 align:middle line:84%
It was eating at me,
because I'm a very--

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:08.777 align:middle line:84%
integrity and truth is
really important to me.

00:17:08.777 --> 00:17:10.569 align:middle line:84%
And then one day at an
event I was running,

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.420 align:middle line:84%
a woman came up to me, and
I was on stage presenting.

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And in the break, she came up
to me, and she started crying.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her
why she was crying,

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:20.760 align:middle line:84%
and she said to me, Pam, I
just want to be like you.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've been
successful all your life.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment,
I just thought,

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.845 align:middle line:90%
I can't hide this anymore.

00:17:27.845 --> 00:17:29.970 align:middle line:84%
You know, these women are
putting me on a pedestal,

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.180 align:middle line:90%
when two years ago, I was them.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:35.942 align:middle line:84%
And that was a huge
shift for me just

00:17:35.942 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
wanting to help people
and say, you know,

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.980 align:middle line:90%
anybody can flick the switch.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Don't spend four years
like I did figuring it out.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the fact that you
became open and vulnerable

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and shared your story,
how did you then find that

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:57.360 align:middle line:84%
that's impacted your career
and your ability to connect

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.980 align:middle line:90%
and engage with people?

00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I created a--

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.490 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book about
what happened to me,

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:90%
and I created a movie about it.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
It was kind of like
this situation here.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.830 align:middle line:84%
I had a film for the
launch of the book,

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.250 align:middle line:90%
and I cried in that story.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.330 align:middle line:84%
I was reliving it
like I cried before.

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:18.550 align:middle line:90%
It's just so real for me.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was hesitant
about putting that out.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.730 align:middle line:84%
I thought, should I
just tell it in the book

00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.700 align:middle line:84%
and not get real
and raw about it?

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And the producer said to me,
no, Pam, that's the story.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:90%
You've got to put it out.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And the feedback that I had from
women from seeing that video

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.500 align:middle line:84%
and saying, Pam, you
know, you changed my life.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:84%
You made me realize that
it's OK to fall down,

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:90%
and you can get back up again.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it really
was a life-changing

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and put me on the path that
I'm on now, which is awesome.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.260 align:middle line:84%
I love it, changing women's
lives for the better.

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So if-- can we go just back
for a second when you spoke

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:09.300 align:middle line:84%
about using money and getting
out of debt as a motivator?

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So obviously,
through your experience,

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:15.480 align:middle line:84%
you've had an enormous amount
of anxiety that would have come

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.280 align:middle line:84%
out of the financial loss
that you went through.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you formed a
strategy to actually get

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.900 align:middle line:90%
yourself out of debt.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:26.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So along the way,
you know, if we have,

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.290 align:middle line:84%
in our audience
today, listening,

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:33.120 align:middle line:84%
people who are either in
a position of depression

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.450 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety because of
their financial situation,

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.300 align:middle line:84%
what kind of tips and tools
could you start directing them

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
in to help manage that
situation for themselves?

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>> You have to give
yourself small quick wins.

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.080 align:middle line:84%
You have to work
your way back up,

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and I just kept stretching
myself a little bit more

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:90%
and a little bit more.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.630 align:middle line:90%
So I'll give you an example.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:84%
I promised my child that
he could have a puppy when

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:90%
he was six years old, and--

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:84%
actually, it was
when he was five.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.440 align:middle line:84%
And I broke that promise,
and I didn't like that.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.857 align:middle line:84%
And so I said to my husband,
Hunter's a six years old,

00:20:07.857 --> 00:20:09.940 align:middle line:84%
and this is after we'd
been on the mindset cruise.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.120 align:middle line:90%
So we'd shifted.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And I said, it's time
for him to have a yard,

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.430 align:middle line:84%
and it's time for us
to move into a house.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But we were paying a rent that
was so comfortable for us.

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And once again, we had to
get over that mindset of,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.200 align:middle line:90%
we're comfortable now.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Shall we just stay here?

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.320 align:middle line:84%
And I said to Steve,
we're not stretching.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So we found a house that
was four times what we were

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:40.122 align:middle line:90%
paying where we were living.

00:20:40.122 --> 00:20:41.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, that's
stretching yourself.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.470 align:middle line:90%
>> That was a huge stretch.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%
But I said to Steve-- we
went-- walked down there,

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.262 align:middle line:84%
and we went and
looked at this house,

00:20:48.262 --> 00:20:50.380 align:middle line:84%
and I walked in the door,
and I said, this is it.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:84%
This is the house I want
to bring up my child.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And Steve looked at me,
and he just freaked out.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.200 align:middle line:84%
And I looked at him, and in
that moment, I said to him,

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.720 align:middle line:90%
we can do this.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:90%
It was a belief thing.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.813 align:middle line:90%
I said, we can do this.

00:21:05.813 --> 00:21:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at
me, and he looked

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.230 align:middle line:84%
at Hunter, who was just
running around the backyard,

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.680 align:middle line:90%
and he said, let's do it.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:18.820 align:middle line:84%
That shift of just taking
a stretch of self-belief,

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:24.310 align:middle line:84%
we made four, five,
six times what

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:28.610 align:middle line:84%
we needed to live there
in the first six months.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So do you remember anything
specific on the millionaire

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.040 align:middle line:90%
mindset cruise that you went on?

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you-- so give me something
specific that you remember from

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.940 align:middle line:84%
that cruise that you brought
home and you put into action

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:41.050 align:middle line:90%
straight away.

00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:42.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when we
were on the cruise,

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:84%
we were given the opportunity
to have a hot seat.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And for those people
who don't know

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.920 align:middle line:84%
what a hot seat is, it's where
you get to speak to someone

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.730 align:middle line:84%
who's really successful,
tell them about your idea

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
or what you're
planning on doing,

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:84%
and they will tell you
whether to [BLUBBERS] it,

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.850 align:middle line:84%
it's a waste of
time, or it's a goer.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.000 align:middle line:84%
And so Steve I thought this
is an awesome opportunity,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.770 align:middle line:84%
so we planned this
whole business

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:04.840 align:middle line:84%
that we thought was
going to be fantastic.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.790 align:middle line:90%
We were still in the unit.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.570 align:middle line:84%
And we went on this cruise, and
we were so excited about it.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I had the whole business
plan ready to launch,

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.560 align:middle line:84%
running an event, all as
soon as we got off the boat.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:19.440 align:middle line:84%
We had this hot seat, and
they said, don't do it.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> And seriously, it was like--

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.510 align:middle line:90%
I was so deflated.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I really thought
it was a good idea.

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:35.300 align:middle line:84%
But I'm a very intuitive person,
and my gut said he was wrong.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:40.350 align:middle line:84%
So I said to Steve,
I don't care.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I said, I have to
do this for me.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.500 align:middle line:90%
And he said, let's do it.

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So six weeks after
we got off that boat,

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:52.190 align:middle line:90%
we ran that first event.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.830 align:middle line:90%
And we made $70,000 in one day.

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:00.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And we bumped into that man
who gave us that advice a year

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:04.400 align:middle line:84%
and a half later, and he
came up to us, and he said,

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:90%
I was so not on the money.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.830 align:middle line:84%
He said, congratulations
for not listening to me.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was going to say,
there were so many messages

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:13.170 align:middle line:90%
right there.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Because from where you'd
come from to being on that boat,

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.700 align:middle line:84%
and for somebody just to
have blanked you right there

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.540 align:middle line:84%
and said, forget it, that
could have been enough to--

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:26.870 align:middle line:84%
for a lot of people, just to
send them straight back down

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:31.040 align:middle line:84%
into the depression of
helplessness and, you know,

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.610 align:middle line:84%
disempowerment that you were
in all of a few months ago.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:36.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:39.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But you had something extra
that stopped you from going

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.340 align:middle line:90%
back there.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean just the message to
tune into your own intuition

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.460 align:middle line:84%
and be a believer
within yourself.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> And reconnected to that.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:53.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, same thing happened
with the books, you know.

00:23:53.450 --> 00:23:55.170 align:middle line:90%
Or even my dad-- he's my dad.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.540 align:middle line:90%
I've always had that thing.

00:23:56.540 --> 00:23:58.230 align:middle line:90%
My dad said to me--

00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:59.970 align:middle line:90%
it was before I met my husband.

00:23:59.970 --> 00:24:00.890 align:middle line:90%
I was going to sell--

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.810 align:middle line:90%
I had these shares.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said to Dad, I want
to buy this townhouse.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:08.180 align:middle line:84%
And he said, you
never sell shares.

00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.200 align:middle line:90%
I said, Dad, I just--

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.950 align:middle line:90%
I can't buy this townhouse.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.680 align:middle line:84%
I knew it was a good
property to buy.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:15.930 align:middle line:84%
I said, I can't buy this
townhouse without the shares,

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:16.915 align:middle line:90%
selling the shares.

00:24:16.915 --> 00:24:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And he said, don't
sell the shares.

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he lived in Canada,
and that was over the phone.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, I just
thought, I want this townhouse.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:28.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to listen.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:90%
So I sold the shares.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Four days later, the
share crashed hard.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:45.410 align:middle line:84%
So I bought this townhouse,
tripled my money,

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:84%
and once again, it was just
me, just in my gut knowing.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:90%
I listened to the advice.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.840 align:middle line:90%
I assessed the risk.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:54.230 align:middle line:90%
So that's another thing.

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:59.270 align:middle line:84%
What is the worst case
scenario if this goes belly up?

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And if you can live with
the worst case scenario,

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.060 align:middle line:90%
then I say, don't die wondering.

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.700 align:middle line:90%
You've got to have a go.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:10.392 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
live my life now.

00:25:10.392 --> 00:25:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I really love that advice.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:13.890 align:middle line:84%
>> If you can live with
the worst case scenario,

00:25:13.890 --> 00:25:15.270 align:middle line:90%
then go and give it a go.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:16.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:17.180 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
happened with the books.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.048 align:middle line:84%
I never knew how
to write a book.

00:25:21.048 --> 00:25:22.340 align:middle line:90%
I never wanted to write a book.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.810 align:middle line:84%
I failed English,
for crying out loud.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:29.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And look at the success that
you have made out of mentoring

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.950 align:middle line:90%
others, I included, in writing.

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:36.350 align:middle line:84%
You know, leaving their
message, their story,

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:40.860 align:middle line:84%
their footprint has been
absolutely phenomenal.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:45.350 align:middle line:84%
And you know, in doing so,
the gift of giving people

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:51.140 align:middle line:84%
their own voice has helped
so many people either bring

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.710 align:middle line:84%
themselves back into themselves
and lift themselves out

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:56.520 align:middle line:84%
of places of anxiety
and depression--

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:57.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>> --to the ability of just
being able to share your story.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:00.980 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:90%
Look at Maria Powell.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean here's this woman on
the streets at the age of 11

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:10.520 align:middle line:84%
selling her body just to
stay alive, drugs, bipolar.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And now she has her own
not for profit, speaking

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.570 align:middle line:90%
on stages around the world.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:18.110 align:middle line:84%
She's got four number
one bestselling books,

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:20.240 align:middle line:90%
and she's changing lives.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.380 align:middle line:84%
That never happened until
she wrote that book.

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.500 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to speak to her.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.610 align:middle line:90%
She's amazing.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:26.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:28.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Another amazing inspiration.

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's why I
do it, because books

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:32.080 align:middle line:84%
and people's stories
change lives.

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And lots of people's books
have impacted my life.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you share with
us one of your favorite,

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.340 align:middle line:84%
most inspirational
changing books?

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:44.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm reading a
book at the moment,

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:46.780 align:middle line:84%
which is a little
bit left of field.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.765 align:middle line:84%
And it's about this
guy who's talking

00:26:48.765 --> 00:26:50.140 align:middle line:84%
about-- see, a
lot of people talk

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:51.807 align:middle line:84%
about the law of
attraction, and I'm not

00:26:51.807 --> 00:26:54.320 align:middle line:84%
really into this law
of attraction thing.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:27:00.070 align:middle line:90%
I believe in the love action.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.725 align:middle line:84%
His name's Richard Dotson,
and I, for some reason,

00:27:02.725 --> 00:27:04.850 align:middle line:84%
fell on this book when I
was doing market research.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.220 align:middle line:84%
I'd never seen or heard
of this guy before.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.755 align:middle line:84%
And he started talking
about the energy.

00:27:10.755 --> 00:27:15.630 align:middle line:84%
He said, the reason why
people don't get results

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.580 align:middle line:84%
is not because
you're not trying.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:84%
It's the energy
behind how they try.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:24.270 align:middle line:84%
So he started saying,
if you go and set

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:32.220 align:middle line:84%
a goal that, inside, you feel is
not really achievable, that is

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.620 align:middle line:84%
the energy that
you're putting out,

00:27:34.620 --> 00:27:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and you're not
going to achieve it.

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.690 align:middle line:84%
So you can like goals
until the cows come home,

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:41.520 align:middle line:90%
if the energy inside--

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.720 align:middle line:90%
he said, so you--

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.380 align:middle line:84%
he's all about setting
intentions and entirely

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.880 align:middle line:90%
forgetting about it.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.297 align:middle line:84%
He said, because if you
focus on trying to get

00:27:50.297 --> 00:27:52.380 align:middle line:84%
and trying to get, what
are you putting out there?

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.000 align:middle line:90%
It's lack.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you just
attract more lack.

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.637 align:middle line:84%
So he made me start
shifting my whole mindset.

00:27:58.637 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:84%
And so he said, the way you do
it is you put an intention out,

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.400 align:middle line:90%
and he said, test it.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:05.070 align:middle line:84%
So he said-- so I put an
intention in this little book,

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.720 align:middle line:90%
so $100.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.150 align:middle line:84%
He said, just do something,
and see if it happens.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:12.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, that afternoon,
I found $100.

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:16.150 align:middle line:84%
I had like all my million
dollar notes that I collect.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was sifting through
my million dollar notes,

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.830 align:middle line:84%
and I went, and I was about
to go and get some cash out.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's this $100 note that
I didn't know was in my wallet.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.578 align:middle line:90%
So that was the first one.

00:28:27.578 --> 00:28:28.870 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, oh, this is good.

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.860 align:middle line:90%
I want to do 1,000.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if this
works, because I just--

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.960 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.060 align:middle line:84%
So I did 1,000,
put it in my thing.

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Seven days later,
out of the blue,

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:41.290 align:middle line:84%
I get a phone call from
this woman, who says, Pam,

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.190 align:middle line:90%
I need your help.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.660 align:middle line:84%
And you said it was going
to cost-- two-hour session,

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:90%
here's $1,000.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.800 align:middle line:90%
Put it in my account.

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I had not planned this,
totally out of the blue.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So of course, what
am I doing now?

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.730 align:middle line:90%
$100,000.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'm about
to make it in the next--

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.750 align:middle line:84%
so what I decided
to do was I thought,

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I'll do a document,
this guy what he tells

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:05.130 align:middle line:90%
you to do, and see if it works.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.020 align:middle line:84%
So I've been doing it
for eight weeks now.

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing it for 12.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.570 align:middle line:90%
And my third one was 100.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:12.540 align:middle line:90%
I put 100,000.

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.040 align:middle line:84%
I want to make
$100,000, and I think

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.267 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to nail that
in about two more days.

00:29:16.267 --> 00:29:18.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think probably our
audience really wants to know

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:19.767 align:middle line:90%
the name of that book again.

00:29:19.767 --> 00:29:21.270 align:middle line:90%
It's the--

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>> His name is Richard--

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:27.120 align:middle line:84%
no, it's actually--
he's got about 12 books.

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.028 align:middle line:84%
So he goes into the
different things,

00:29:29.028 --> 00:29:31.320 align:middle line:84%
and it-- and the thing that's
so awesome about it is he

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.420 align:middle line:90%
gives you action steps to test.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.850 align:middle line:90%
He says, don't leave me.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Just go and do it.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.570 align:middle line:84%
You know, and the thing that
made me think differently--

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:40.730 align:middle line:90%
Steve has been do it.

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:45.370 align:middle line:84%
And my husband is so not
into this love woo-woo stuff.

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.420 align:middle line:84%
He loves it,
absolutely loves it.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.380 align:middle line:84%
And so he's been
doing the same thing.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:52.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's all about
the energy that you

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:55.110 align:middle line:84%
put behind what you're
doing shifts where the way

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:58.930 align:middle line:84%
your head thinks, shifts
about what comes and happens

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.890 align:middle line:84%
to you, because I'm a
little bit of a pessimist.

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And so I was really struggling
with this happy book stuff

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.750 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But he made it shift
just to be about putting

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.265 align:middle line:84%
the energy behind it,
and then teaches you

00:30:13.265 --> 00:30:14.390 align:middle line:90%
how to do different things.

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So I highly recommend that,
you know, if you want it,

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.190 align:middle line:90%
just give it a go.

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.975 align:middle line:90%
You know, try you know.

00:30:19.975 --> 00:30:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's
really interesting,

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:23.142 align:middle line:84%
because what you're
talking about, I think,

00:30:23.142 --> 00:30:27.250 align:middle line:84%
is a really important point
to share with our audience,

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:29.290 align:middle line:84%
because we're
talking about energy,

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and we're talking
about intention.

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:34.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's one thing
to have a thought,

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:38.200 align:middle line:84%
but it's another thing to
actually be able to believe

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:39.650 align:middle line:90%
that thought is possible.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:40.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.390 align:middle line:84%
>> And so the energy you're
talking about is actually

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:46.750 align:middle line:84%
the belief that we hold
essentially in our hearts.

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:51.310 align:middle line:84%
We talk about intuition,
or we talk about feeling.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And unless we can meet that
thought with enough belief

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that that thought is
possible, then thought alone

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.820 align:middle line:90%
is never going to be enough.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.620 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:06.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, I think
there's a famous quote.

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, you get what you
think about most of the time.

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Or Henry Ford's,
if you think you can,

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.730 align:middle line:84%
or whether you think
you can't, it's true,

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.680 align:middle line:90%
because thinking makes it so.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But the other side of
that is the believing,

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:24.010 align:middle line:84%
so one of my favorite
quotes is, what

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.490 align:middle line:84%
the man-- what the mind
of man can conceive,

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.480 align:middle line:84%
i.e. his thought, but
bring himself to believe,

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.400 align:middle line:84%
which is meeting that thought
with enough energy and emotion.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.330 align:middle line:90%
Then he can achieve it.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:40.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I wrote a book just
a couple of weeks ago.

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:42.702 align:middle line:84%
I'm making gift
books at the moment,

00:31:42.702 --> 00:31:44.660 align:middle line:84%
so they're empowering
books, but they're short.

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:49.720 align:middle line:84%
So instead of giving someone
a birthday card or a card,

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.830 align:middle line:84%
you can actually send
them these gift books,

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.130 align:middle line:84%
and they have inspirational
messages in them.

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.285 align:middle line:84%
And I came across an
anonymous quote the other day,

00:31:57.285 --> 00:31:58.660 align:middle line:84%
and I'm using it
in all my books,

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:84%
because it just
jumped out at me.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's, she believed
she could, so she did.

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's just what I'm about.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:12.630 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, when I believed
I could again, I did.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
I want to empower

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.222 align:middle line:84%
people to do-- take
inspired action,

00:32:16.222 --> 00:32:17.430 align:middle line:90%
because you don't believe it.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's what he
talks about, too,

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:21.060 align:middle line:84%
in the book about
becoming a millionaire.

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:23.250 align:middle line:84%
Everybody says, I want
to become a millionaire,

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:84%
but they actually don't
believe they can achieve it.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So I know that, you know,
speaking to anybody who has

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:34.740 align:middle line:84%
come from adversity and come
through that and really come

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:38.130 align:middle line:84%
out the other side, I haven't
come across one person yet who

00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:43.600 align:middle line:84%
hasn't been able to share a gift
of learning from the adversity.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> What would you say would be
your number one learning from

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:51.410 align:middle line:84%
the hardship that you've
endured and come through?

00:32:51.410 --> 00:32:54.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Get over it a lot faster.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.000 align:middle line:84%
I look back now,
and I just thought,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.970 align:middle line:84%
I wallowed in self-pity
for four years.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:04.160 align:middle line:84%
What I could have done
in that four years--

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:08.120 align:middle line:84%
don't dwell on
yesterday, seriously.

00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.620 align:middle line:90%
I had a bad day yesterday.

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.600 align:middle line:90%
It was a really bad day.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, I didn't sleep
all night last night

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.690 align:middle line:90%
thinking how bad it was.

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.420 align:middle line:90%
But then this Dot--

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Steve calls him Richard
Dotstick, Dotsy calls him.

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:24.190 align:middle line:90%
He just says, it's gone.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.150 align:middle line:90%
Don't dwell.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you're holding
onto something that's

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.830 align:middle line:84%
happened in your
childhood or your life

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:36.110 align:middle line:84%
or a mistake you made,
it's done and dusted.

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:39.680 align:middle line:84%
Let's make today-- he's
all about being present.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.610 align:middle line:84%
He said, let's make
today a different chapter

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:46.510 align:middle line:84%
in how that life
story is going to end.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the
biggest one for me.

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:49.770 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Let it go.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:51.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Let it go.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Realize that you are
more than your situation.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:55.600 align:middle line:90%
>> More than your circumstance.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.880 align:middle line:90%
Stop hating people.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Stop blaming people.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:01.570 align:middle line:90%
Just make an awesome life.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Step out of
victim consciousness.

00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:04.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:05.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Become victorious.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And your world will change.

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Your world will change once
you just say, you know what?

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.700 align:middle line:90%
That was yesterday.

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:13.239 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.614 align:middle line:84%
>> Pam, it's been an absolute
pleasure, but before we go,

00:34:15.614 --> 00:34:21.310 align:middle line:84%
I have one more question that
I'm asking all of our speakers,

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.980 align:middle line:84%
and the main reason being
because throughout time,

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:28.719 align:middle line:84%
philosophers have always said
that we get what we think

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:32.810 align:middle line:84%
and that our brain
believes what we tell it.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And now neuroscience had brought
the evidence to prove that.

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.190 align:middle line:84%
So the "I am" is a very
strong, powerful statement

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.230 align:middle line:84%
to use in realigning
your mindset

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:49.090 align:middle line:84%
and creating intention
with the right energy.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So what would be
your "I am" that you

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.179 align:middle line:84%
would say to yourself
every day to reinforce

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:59.790 align:middle line:90%
what it is you want to believe?

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:03.010 align:middle line:90%
>> I am my own success story.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:04.730 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:08.430 align:middle line:84%
If it's going to
be, it's up to me.

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:09.390 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for your wisdom
and sharing your journey,

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:18.300 align:middle line:84%
and with that,
inspiring our audience.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:19.450 align:middle line:90%
It's been fantastic.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:25.000 align:middle line:90%
