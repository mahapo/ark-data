00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome, Luke.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, you are one of Australia's
leading health and lifestyle

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.770 align:middle line:90%
personalities.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.470 align:middle line:84%
You've been a finalist
on "My Kitchen Rules."

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.800 align:middle line:90%
You're now the CEO of Paleo Way.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.480 align:middle line:84%
You're a passionate lover of
good food and clean living,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.500 align:middle line:84%
and you're also the ambassador
of the Black Dog Institute.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.780 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
can you just tell us

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.540 align:middle line:84%
what made you get involved
with the Black Dog Institute.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>> For me, it was simple.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.440 align:middle line:84%
I haven't always
felt amazing myself,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.530 align:middle line:84%
and I've struggled from
depression and anxiety

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.610 align:middle line:90%
personally.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.518 align:middle line:84%
So with my profile on
"My Kitchen Rules,"

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
a lot of different charities
would approach me and say,

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.590 align:middle line:84%
would you like to
be the ambassador?

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.775 align:middle line:84%
And when Black Dog
Institute approached me,

00:00:57.775 --> 00:00:59.650 align:middle line:84%
it was a no brainer,
because it was something

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.540 align:middle line:84%
that had touched me
personally, but it was

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:90%
something I really believed in.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.590 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm going to stand
up and talk about something,

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:84%
I want to believe
in it deep within.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.010 align:middle line:90%
So it was a great opportunity.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.100 align:middle line:84%
What I love about
Black Dog Institute is

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.810 align:middle line:84%
that they're a
non-profit organization,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.420 align:middle line:84%
and one of their
biggest key message

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.890 align:middle line:84%
points that they try to get out
there is exercise your mood.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, my background is
as a personal trainer.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.230 align:middle line:84%
For the last 15 years, I've
been teaching people boxing down

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:90%
on Bondi Beach.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that exercise has
such a massive dramatic part

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.040 align:middle line:84%
to play in your mood just felt
like a really, really good fit

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.940 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And then with the combination
of "My Kitchen Rules"

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.770 align:middle line:90%
that whole food and fitness--

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.700 align:middle line:90%
they just go hand in hand.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.900 align:middle line:84%
So the more I realized I
was in a perfect position

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.350 align:middle line:84%
to talk about exercise
lifting your mood,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.370 align:middle line:84%
but also foods that
boost your mood.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.350 align:middle line:90%
So it just made sense.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.700 align:middle line:90%
So I'm wrapped.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I know you've shared
with me that you also have

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.870 align:middle line:84%
experienced
depression and anxiety

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you just share a little
bit with us what that was like

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.500 align:middle line:90%
for you?

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.667 align:middle line:84%
>> Look, I struggled to be
honest going through high

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:05.890 align:middle line:90%
school.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.639 align:middle line:84%
I was having issues
with my self-confidence,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.000 align:middle line:84%
who I was as a person,
and where I was heading.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:84%
And that sent me down
a pretty dark place.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.690 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't eating the
right type of foods,

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.730 align:middle line:90%
so I put on a lot of weight.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:84%
My nickname was actually
Buddha in high school.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.860 align:middle line:90%
People wouldn't believe it now.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
I felt really a lot of anxiety
about group sport and group

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.630 align:middle line:90%
activities.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was only once
I left high school

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:84%
that I started to really
work out who I was

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and what I wanted
out of my life.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I took it into
my own hands and going, well,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.877 align:middle line:90%
this is me.

00:02:39.877 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And this is who I'm
going to be, and this is

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.580 align:middle line:90%
how I'm going to live my life.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.130 align:middle line:90%
But I really, really struggled.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's times where
stress will get on top of me.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:84%
My emotions will
get on top of me,

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and I can go through
really dark places.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.620 align:middle line:84%
I think when you do suffer
from depression or anxiety--

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.450 align:middle line:84%
I think it can
sometimes be something

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.760 align:middle line:84%
that you may live
with long term,

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.760 align:middle line:84%
but it's about managing
it and understanding

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.060 align:middle line:84%
what it is that can trigger it,
and how to probably be the best

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.390 align:middle line:84%
version of yourself to
put yourself in a position

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.650 align:middle line:90%
that you live your best life.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So you've come to learn how
to manage it through movement

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.190 align:middle line:84%
and, of course,
through great eating.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.700 align:middle line:84%
So step one was becoming a
personal trainer for a career--

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.710 align:middle line:84%
was a massive
turning point for me,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.020 align:middle line:84%
because not only was I
interacting with people

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
on a one to one level, which
I absolutely love, but I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.100 align:middle line:84%
was taking something that
I'm really passionate about,

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.190 align:middle line:84%
which is looking after
yourself, and helping others.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it kind
of boosted my mood,

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
because I'm helping
others, and I'm outdoors.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's a win-win.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.890 align:middle line:84%
But then I did "My
Kitchen Rules,"

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.300 align:middle line:90%
and that was incredible.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
understand so much more

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
about what healthy food
can do for your mood.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:84%
So instead of just
cooking any old recipe,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I would try and
put a meal together

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.130 align:middle line:84%
that actually made sense
not only for how it tasted,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:84%
but for what it
did to our bodies.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And so today you're actually
going to take us through a dish

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.190 align:middle line:84%
that you've chosen, and you've
chosen particular ingredients

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:90%
for that very reason.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.980 align:middle line:90%
I certainly have.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I think when you
make food, whatever

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
it is, you should think really
mindfully about what you're

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.730 align:middle line:90%
putting together.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, mindfulness
is something which

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.529 align:middle line:84%
I think is vitally important
in our day to day lives.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.290 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes to
food, it plays a big part.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
So in today's dish, which is
like a raw chocolate bark,

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.230 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be mindful
that all of the ingredients

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.450 align:middle line:84%
had a positive
effect on our mood.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's two
major key points,

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.620 align:middle line:84%
which I want to talk about
with what we've got here.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.360 align:middle line:84%
One is antioxidants,
and two is healthy fats.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Now, antioxidants I've got here.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.830 align:middle line:90%
I've got blueberries, raw cacao.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:84%
They're really pumped
high full of antioxidants.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, apart from fighting
free radicals, which

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.400 align:middle line:84%
make us healthier and
happier, antioxidants actually

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.410 align:middle line:90%
give us healthy brain function.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.420 align:middle line:84%
And what does healthy
brain function do?

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:90%
It boosts our mood.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Our mood.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.530 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's a
major player here.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.350 align:middle line:84%
Now secondly, I've got
good fats in the form

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:90%
of nut butter and coconut oil.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, our brain thrives on
fat as an energy source.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, a lot of people
wouldn't realize that.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.390 align:middle line:90%
>> No, they don't.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's made
up mostly of fat.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So it actually thrives
off it when we eat it.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.980 align:middle line:84%
So I want people to
understand, I guess,

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.640 align:middle line:84%
that processed foods
and high sugar foods

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.050 align:middle line:90%
aren't great for the brain.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.750 align:middle line:84%
They're the things that
start playing with our mood.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Whereas when you look
at good fats, like nut

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.060 align:middle line:84%
butter and coconut oil, you
are on to such a good thing,

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.270 align:middle line:84%
because they give you a level
sustained form of energy.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So what would some of
the not so good fats be when

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:84%
we're needing to really
differentiate between a good

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:84%
fat and a bad fat, especially
for brain function.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> So trans fats are the fats
that we really want to be

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.990 align:middle line:90%
avoiding.

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So don't just say, OK, cool
I can eat healthy fats.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.590 align:middle line:90%
That's not deep fried food.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.410 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of not
where we're going here.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.200 align:middle line:84%
We're going for real
natural fats from products

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.210 align:middle line:84%
such as coconut oil, or
avocado, nuts, seeds,

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
or animal fats, the fats
that, as humans, we're

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.240 align:middle line:84%
actually designed to eat
on a day to day level.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.180 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps steer away from
things that are manufactured,

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.820 align:middle line:84%
and you know you're onto a
good fat, like olive oils,

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.070 align:middle line:90%
and avocado oil is fantastic.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, beautiful.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.935 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, look, shall I get
started while we have a bit

00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:22.010 align:middle line:90%
of a chat.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it together.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:24.590 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's pretty simple.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.020 align:middle line:84%
The first steps I'm going
to do is just melt down

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:84%
the coconut oil
and the nut butter,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.280 align:middle line:84%
and mix it with some
natural sweetener,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.150 align:middle line:90%
and today we've got raw honey.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, the reason
I'm using raw honey

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.700 align:middle line:84%
is because it's got
antibacterial benefits

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:90%
in there, as well.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So if we're talking
about health,

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.040 align:middle line:84%
this is one hell of a
chocolate healthy bar.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.537 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:06:46.537 --> 00:06:47.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll put that in.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm going to put about a
cup of coconut oil in there.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, coconut oil is actually
firm at room temperature,

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.722 align:middle line:84%
unless you live
up in Queensland.

00:06:56.722 --> 00:06:59.690 align:middle line:84%
>> And what are some of the
other benefits of coconut oil,

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:02.030 align:middle line:84%
other than it being
a really healthy fat?

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:84%
I've heard that it's also
great for fighting bacteria,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.230 align:middle line:90%
antifungal.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that right?

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.270 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.660 align:middle line:84%
It does fight bacteria
and antifungal.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's got what's
called MCT oils.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:18.932 align:middle line:84%
Now, MCTs have been proven
to increase your metabolism.

00:07:18.932 --> 00:07:20.390 align:middle line:84%
We'd all like a
little bit of that.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>> That's too bad.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.090 align:middle line:84%
If you can have a
chocolate bar that actually

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
increases your
metabolism, you're

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.748 align:middle line:90%
onto a very, very good thing.

00:07:27.748 --> 00:07:28.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm liking it already.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Now look, I've put
the coconut oil in there.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.600 align:middle line:84%
Now that's going to
melt down, and then

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:84%
what I'm going to put in
here is the nut butter.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm using
almond butter today,

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.950 align:middle line:84%
which I think gives it a
really beautiful taste.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.687 align:middle line:84%
And that's another
form of good fat

00:07:42.687 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to
get in there, too.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So Luke, can you use any
other nut butter other than

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.590 align:middle line:90%
almond.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you could use
almond, hazelnut, Brazil,

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.680 align:middle line:84%
or even tahini, which is
ground up sesame seeds.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.320 align:middle line:90%
So you can be quite flexible.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:84%
My whole philosophy
with cooking is

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.922 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't feel
constrained or restricted

00:07:58.922 --> 00:07:59.880 align:middle line:90%
with what you're doing.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.130 align:middle line:84%
You should be able
to get in the kitchen

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.040 align:middle line:84%
and have a little bit of a play,
because cooking should be fun.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And too many people associate
cooking with being stressful,

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:09.420 align:middle line:84%
and it shouldn't be
stressful at all.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:11.930 align:middle line:84%
So as you can see
in there, we've

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.550 align:middle line:84%
got the coconut oil
and the nut butter

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.470 align:middle line:90%
starting to come together.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
So this is coming
together beautifully.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:21.140 align:middle line:84%
So now it's time to add in
the raw honey, the raw cacao,

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:90%
and the maca.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So I've got a
question about the honey.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:90%
You said raw.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And from what I've
read and been told,

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.230 align:middle line:84%
that's really important,
because the moment we pasteurize

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:36.059 align:middle line:84%
the honey, we actually lose
all the healthy ingredients.

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:36.990 align:middle line:90%
And is that right?

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:38.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.573 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want to heat
anything to high temperatures.

00:08:40.573 --> 00:08:42.770 align:middle line:84%
You don't manufacture
anything too much.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.800 align:middle line:84%
You want it as natural
and as nature intended.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.630 align:middle line:84%
That's why I go
with the raw honey,

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.990 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it does have
those antibacterial benefits

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:90%
in it, as well.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.530 align:middle line:84%
They haven't been kind of
cooked out or processed out,

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.860 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.435 align:middle line:84%
>> And so what's so
great about maca.

00:08:57.435 --> 00:08:59.090 align:middle line:84%
It's considered a
superfood, isn't it?

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, now maca is
considered a superfood.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.480 align:middle line:84%
It's considered like a really
healthy form of energy.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:90%
It's like the Peruvian ginseng.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> But what it also has
is very powerful adaptogen

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.060 align:middle line:90%
capabilities.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So what that means is it
levels out your hormones.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:19.710 align:middle line:84%
It's actually very,
very powerful.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
So I do recommend to anyone
who uses maca to make sure

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that they start off slowly,
because it can actually

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.417 align:middle line:84%
change their whole
mood and how they feel.

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:90%
>> So small amounts.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Be mindful with maca.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, introduce
it in small doses.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.500 align:middle line:84%
But it's about leveling
out your whole system,

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.340 align:middle line:84%
so you're back in
calibration, so to speak.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So your hormonal balance
throughout the day becomes just

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.380 align:middle line:90%
nice, and smooth, consistent.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.120 align:middle line:90%
>> That is exactly right.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, what you see in
here is I'm melting

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:84%
down so that all
that cacao breaks up,

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have
any large chunks.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Not that there'd be
anything wrong with that.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.990 align:middle line:90%
I do love a bit of chocolate.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:90%
That's for sure.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
But I figure if you're
going to eat chocolate,

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to have a treat,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:05.480 align:middle line:84%
make sure it's actually doing
something positive for you,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.190 align:middle line:84%
because I don't think
people understand

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:90%
when they hone into--

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.120 align:middle line:84%
say you're feeling down,
or you're feeling sad.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.980 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
common things to do

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
is to maybe eat your
feelings or emotions.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.680 align:middle line:84%
Now, when people
reach for bad food,

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.130 align:middle line:84%
it actually feeds how they're
feeling, and they feel worse.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Not only do they have
maybe poor self body

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.740 align:middle line:84%
image because of the
food that they're eating,

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.640 align:middle line:84%
but that food actually
harms how we think and feel.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.900 align:middle line:84%
You want to go as
natural as possible.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.280 align:middle line:84%
That's why I absolutely
love this recipe.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And what I'm loving
about this is that,

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:44.670 align:middle line:84%
when we are feeling down, or
more stressed than we want

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:49.380 align:middle line:84%
to be, or emotionally down, we
do tend to go for those kind

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:84%
of more comfort foods,
which tend to be sweeter.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And so what I'm seeing here is
a really healthy alternative

00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
to kind of fulfill that
sweet comfort need that we're

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
craving, but in a way
that's actually not

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:05.730 align:middle line:84%
going to do the damage to
our brain, and our mood,

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.310 align:middle line:84%
and our hormones that other
processed foods would.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.150 align:middle line:84%
>> That is exactly right, and
that's why I love using raw

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:15.120 align:middle line:84%
cacao, because chocolate is
known as an age old remedy

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:84%
for not feeling your best,
because raw cacao actually does

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.890 align:middle line:84%
boost your mood with its
high antioxidant value.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.800 align:middle line:84%
But people don't understand
that it's the raw cacao, not all

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.247 align:middle line:84%
the sugar and the other
crap that's in that stuff

00:11:28.247 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:90%
that they're buying.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.982 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's exactly
what I wanted to ask.

00:11:30.982 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day,
there's a big difference

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.420 align:middle line:84%
between this raw cocoa
powder than the bought

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.220 align:middle line:90%
solid block of chocolate--

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:39.220 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.540 align:middle line:84%
>> --with all the milk
powder, and the added sugars.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that is exactly right.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.160 align:middle line:84%
Raw cacao is unprocessed
organic chocolate

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.477 align:middle line:84%
before it's had
anything done to it.

00:11:49.477 --> 00:11:50.310 align:middle line:90%
So it's pretty cool.

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's cool.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's great to
be cooking with it.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.785 align:middle line:84%
So what we've got
here-- it's all

00:11:53.785 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:84%
melted down and
looking fantastic,

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:57.740 align:middle line:84%
so it's time to pour
it out onto our tray.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:03.470 align:middle line:90%


00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, that is
looking beautiful.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.230 align:middle line:90%
Silky, smooth, delicious.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I know, right?

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.070 align:middle line:90%
I absolutely love this recipe.

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And a tip for anyone
out there who does

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.710 align:middle line:84%
love their exercise, steer
clear of any of those processed

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:84%
and packaged pre-workout
type substances

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.150 align:middle line:84%
where you can't even
pronounce the ingredients.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>> This is perfect.

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:26.500 align:middle line:90%
Boosts your energy.

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Boosts your mood.

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:32.500 align:middle line:84%
Gives you a sustained release
of feel good kind of endorphins

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.910 align:middle line:90%
rushing through your body.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.680 align:middle line:90%
That's my type of workout.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm thinking pre
and post workout.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.795 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm thinking when you
wake up, when you go to bed.

00:12:40.795 --> 00:12:41.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Constant good mood, huh?

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Look, I absolutely love it.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, we are almost
done with this recipe.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:49.840 align:middle line:84%
All we need to do is top it
with our favorite ingredients.

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And today we're going to do
shredded coconut, blueberries,

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.520 align:middle line:90%
and some crushed up hazelnuts.

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.320 align:middle line:90%
Shall we?

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, let's do it.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I might
actually get your help.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So I'm going to do
some shredded coconut,

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.120 align:middle line:84%
which I'm going to run
across the top here.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, while I do this, I'll
give you some blueberries.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And then can you come behind me
and just get some blueberries

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:90%
across the top, as well.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Just wherever.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.587 align:middle line:90%
That it's absolutely perfect.

00:13:21.587 --> 00:13:23.670 align:middle line:84%
And now we just need the
hazelnuts, which I'm just

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:90%
going to chop up on top.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, any particular reason
why you chose hazelnuts?

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:32.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm a big fan
of a Ferrero Rocher.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Now we're hearing
all of your secrets.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess when putting this
recipe together I was trying

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
to get my favorite flavors
and taste combinations,

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.900 align:middle line:90%
and put them into one dish.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's why the hazelnuts
get a bit of a Guernsey.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:46.950 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly why.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Now just be quite
rough with them.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:84%
They don't have to be
perfect, and we're just

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.090 align:middle line:90%
going to sprinkle them on top.

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Beautiful.

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.428 align:middle line:90%
Look at that, all that texture.

00:13:56.428 --> 00:13:57.720 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get the crunch.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:84%
The chocolate will
be nice and smooth.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.370 align:middle line:90%
The softness of the blueberries.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:03.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So all we need to do now
is put this in the fridge

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.600 align:middle line:84%
or freezer for about 15 to 20
minutes, and you're good to go.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So Luke, while our beautiful
chocolate slice is cooling down

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.440 align:middle line:84%
in the fridge, I've just
got some more questions

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.035 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to ask you about
overcoming depression

00:14:31.035 --> 00:14:31.840 align:middle line:90%
and anxiety.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, I know, as
you've mentioned,

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.040 align:middle line:84%
it's been something
you've suffered from.

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really intrigued
to find out whether or not

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.030 align:middle line:84%
you had a mentor that
helped you through the more

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.730 align:middle line:84%
difficult times, but also
some of the tools, some

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
of the daily rituals
that you taught yourself

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.670 align:middle line:84%
to commit to in order to
help manage, as you say,

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:52.140 align:middle line:90%
something that is--

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.685 align:middle line:84%
can stay with us for
quite a long time.

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a great question, and
one which I'm happy to talk

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.510 align:middle line:84%
about, because I think reaching
out and being open to help is

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.730 align:middle line:84%
one of the most important
things you can do.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the past, I have gone
and seen a lady to help me

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:06.930 align:middle line:90%
with being mindful.

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Now, once a week we'd
have an appointment,

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and it would be going
through different scenarios

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
that I was struggling
with in my life,

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:84%
and working out how to be at
peace with them naturally,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.520 align:middle line:84%
allowing the thoughts
and feelings to come in,

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.330 align:middle line:84%
but to not let them consume
me, and allow them to flow in,

00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.150 align:middle line:84%
and flow out freely
without feeling like I have

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.180 align:middle line:90%
to control what's going on.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Just, I guess, more being--

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.132 align:middle line:84%
being me and being confident
in what's going on.

00:15:36.132 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And then the second
thing is, apart

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.480 align:middle line:84%
from being comfortable
to reach out for help,

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.330 align:middle line:84%
the second thing is to
learn how to help yourself.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So work out what
could be bad triggers.

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:48.180 align:middle line:84%
What could trigger
you to maybe go down

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:50.700 align:middle line:90%
to a less than ideal path?

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.160 align:middle line:84%
And eliminate those kind
of stresses from your life.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing is to
set a really good routine where

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.520 align:middle line:90%
you do positive things for you.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.130 align:middle line:84%
So things which I
struggled with was stress.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, I realized that as soon as
I minimized screen online time,

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.420 align:middle line:90%
my stress levels really reduced.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.970 align:middle line:84%
In this day and age,
we are so switched on.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.430 align:middle line:84%
Anyone can contact
us at any time,

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:84%
and we've got TV,
smart phones, tablets.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Everything is constantly
switched on around us.

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I
pushed that away

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:28.210 align:middle line:84%
and had designated outdoor
downtime, beach time, dog time,

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
my life completely
changed, because my mind

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.010 align:middle line:84%
had time to completely
switch off and kind of relax

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:37.740 align:middle line:84%
a little bit from this modern
day life that we live in.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:84%
So I put myself through a
little weekly structure,

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.790 align:middle line:84%
where I made time, and
committed to exercise.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
I made time and committed to
making the healthiest food

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.420 align:middle line:90%
I possibly could.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And I made time and
committed to having time

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.580 align:middle line:90%
away from technology.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.975 align:middle line:90%
And for me, that was everything.

00:16:55.975 --> 00:16:58.350 align:middle line:84%
>> So it was really about
prioritizing what was important

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.690 align:middle line:84%
to you, working
out what that was,

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:02.940 align:middle line:84%
working out what sort of
things were going to give you

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.037 align:middle line:84%
the greatest gain in helping
you to manage your stress.

00:17:06.037 --> 00:17:07.079 align:middle line:90%
>> That is exactly right.

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:10.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And then prioritizing those
and really committing to doing

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.220 align:middle line:90%
them on a daily basis.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's about being
accountable to yourself

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:17.280 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that we can't
expect other people to do things

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.150 align:middle line:90%
for us.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.430 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing
to go, you know what?

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:24.900 align:middle line:84%
I may get help, but if I
don't, can I help myself?

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And the power is being
able to help yourself

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:29.370 align:middle line:90%
no matter how hard it is.

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:32.040 align:middle line:84%
And trust me, I'm
not saying it's easy.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.873 align:middle line:84%
I've been there in the darkest
of dark, and it is hard.

00:17:35.873 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And you're there
in those moments,

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:41.370 align:middle line:84%
and I remember calling my mom
going, I don't know what to do.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:84%
I feel so sad,
and I feel so low.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how I'm
going to get out of this.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:50.010 align:middle line:84%
But it's about
going, you know what?

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:84%
This is this moment right
now, and it won't forever

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.060 align:middle line:90%
be like this.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And each day just
gets better and better

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.470 align:middle line:84%
until you're in a position where
you understand how your body

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.060 align:middle line:90%
and how your mind works.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So one thing that I've heard
a lot of people talk about that

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.320 align:middle line:84%
have suffered from depression or
anxiety and come out the other

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:84%
end-- they often talk about how
what they've been through has

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:14.970 align:middle line:90%
actually been a gift for them.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:18.390 align:middle line:84%
It's actually taught them
either more about themselves,

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:20.190 align:middle line:84%
or how to relate
to other people,

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.300 align:middle line:84%
or how it's created them
to have more compassion.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.810 align:middle line:84%
What kind of things
would you say

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.590 align:middle line:84%
that what you've experienced
has given you as a gift?

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one in particular
thing was growing up next

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:33.810 align:middle line:84%
to my brother, who's struggled
with very serious drug

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:34.780 align:middle line:90%
addictions.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Now, he's struggling to this
day in and out of rehab.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.900 align:middle line:90%
And I fear for his safety.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.290 align:middle line:84%
I fear for his well-being,
and I fear for his life.

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:46.140 align:middle line:84%
Growing up alongside
that made me go,

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:49.390 align:middle line:84%
well, I don't want
to harm my body,

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.653 align:middle line:90%
so I'm not going to drink.

00:18:50.653 --> 00:18:52.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to harm
my body, so I'm not

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:84%
going to do drugs,
because if my brother can

00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:00.300 align:middle line:84%
be addicted to those
substances and not

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:04.680 align:middle line:84%
be able to control
his intake of them,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to risk
even going near that.

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.680 align:middle line:84%
What if I've got an
addictive personality?

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.190 align:middle line:84%
What happens if I
try something once

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and that once is
one too many times?

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:19.410 align:middle line:84%
So for me, growing
up alongside that

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.200 align:middle line:84%
taught me to look after
my health and wellness

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.868 align:middle line:90%
as number one.

00:19:24.868 --> 00:19:26.160 align:middle line:90%
>> But how do you manage today?

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.950 align:middle line:84%
You mentioned that your brother
is still, to this very day,

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:31.710 align:middle line:90%
fighting the addiction of drugs.

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:33.750 align:middle line:90%
How is the sibling--

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.520 align:middle line:90%
how do you manage that?

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.270 align:middle line:84%
It's still something that's
very real in your life

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and must impact you on a daily
basis, and when we're family,

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
even when we're friends, we want
to do something that can help.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And we want to fix things,
but sometimes that's

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.260 align:middle line:90%
just not our role.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.940 align:middle line:84%
So what have you
found that you can be?

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I think the biggest key for
anyone who's struggling with

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.480 align:middle line:84%
someone who might have an
addiction is to always be

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.970 align:middle line:84%
there, but don't sacrifice
your own well-being at trying

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:90%
to save someone else.

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, we are in
control of what we do

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.990 align:middle line:90%
and how our lives play on.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to
be 100% supportive.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.010 align:middle line:84%
You can't turn your back on
someone in this position,

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:21.480 align:middle line:84%
because if you turn your back
as family, who have they got?

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.530 align:middle line:90%
No one.

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:25.770 align:middle line:84%
But you can't do
it at the detriment

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:29.760 align:middle line:84%
or at the sacrifice of your own
life, your career, your family.

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.320 align:middle line:84%
So my advice is have a healthy
balance, where you are there

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.370 align:middle line:84%
100% for him or them,
but you're also there

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.160 align:middle line:84%
and 100% for
yourself, so that you

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.935 align:middle line:84%
are strong in all
aspects of your world.

00:20:43.935 --> 00:20:46.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm hearing there is
that essentially you can't give

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:90%
what you don't have.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:84%
So you have to learn
how to cultivate

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.022 align:middle line:84%
that strength for yourself and
how to be there for another by,

00:20:54.022 --> 00:20:55.980 align:middle line:84%
first of all, learning
how to give to yourself.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If you're not strong, and
if you're not looking after

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:84%
yourself, how can you expect
to look after anyone else?

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And when it comes to another,
is it very much about it has

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.440 align:middle line:90%
to be their time?

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.430 align:middle line:90%
They need to be ready.

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:12.310 align:middle line:84%
We can't force somebody to
overcome the challenges.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess it's 15, 20
years now of an addiction.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And the way I look at it is
all the rehab, all the help,

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.930 align:middle line:84%
all the family love
can only go so far.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:90%
And I truly believe--

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:29.040 align:middle line:90%
and I hope to see this day--

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that it's when they
go I have to stop.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.800 align:middle line:90%
This has to stop.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.650 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:42.420 align:middle line:84%
I will not be around if I
continue going down this path.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
realization can't be taught.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:47.910 align:middle line:90%
It can't be told.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:50.040 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
happens within.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And when that moment happens,
that's when change is possible.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.908 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:21:56.908 --> 00:21:58.700 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
sharing that with us,

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:90%
because it's real.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.610 align:middle line:84%
It's real to be part
of a family that

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:84%
has people within that
family that are suffering.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And also when it's
a sibling it's

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:15.030 align:middle line:84%
so reassuring and hopeful that
there is another path to take,

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and there is another path that
you can dedicate yourself to.

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there's also something
else I just want to have

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.020 align:middle line:84%
a little chat about, because
I know that your passion

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:84%
for food, and food,
outdoors, exercise,

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:33.560 align:middle line:84%
and the whole movement for
good mood, food for good mood--

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.890 align:middle line:84%
tell me just a little bit
more about certain foods

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:84%
that can actually exacerbate
or elevate our anxiety levels.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So first and foremost,
what comes to mind is highly

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:49.190 align:middle line:84%
processed or high sugar
foods, much like, I guess,

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:52.280 align:middle line:84%
when kids have heaps of
sugar at a birthday party.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.260 align:middle line:84%
They kind of come home a
bit mad running around.

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Imagine that as adults, but
emotionally and mentally.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.070 align:middle line:84%
You see, stimulating
foods like that

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:05.650 align:middle line:84%
that are processed and high in
sugar give us this kind of up,

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:10.040 align:middle line:84%
but then what comes with
the up is this mega down.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:14.070 align:middle line:84%
So rather than having an even
keel across the day, we go up.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.870 align:middle line:90%
We're happy.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.070 align:middle line:90%
And then we crash.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.330 align:middle line:90%
We're tired.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:23.223 align:middle line:84%
I often liken sugary sweet
foods to kindling on a fire.

00:23:23.223 --> 00:23:24.140 align:middle line:90%
So you have the sugar.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.070 align:middle line:84%
You have the sweets, and it's
like this big flame goes up

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.980 align:middle line:84%
of energy and stimulation,
but then it burns out really,

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.620 align:middle line:90%
really quickly, and we crash.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:34.640 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.160 align:middle line:84%
We're reaching for more
kindling-- more, and more,

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:37.490 align:middle line:90%
and more.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.782 align:middle line:84%
We're like, OK, I need some
more kindling, so I'm going

00:23:39.782 --> 00:23:41.270 align:middle line:90%
to have this muffin, croissant.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.950 align:middle line:90%
So I have that.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Goes up in flames like
kindling, but then it

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:84%
burns out super quick, and
you come crashing down.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:52.490 align:middle line:84%
That's why I recommend healthy
fats and slow release energy,

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.640 align:middle line:84%
because what they are-- they're
the log on the fire that

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.690 align:middle line:90%
burns all night long.

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So if you can start your day
with a log on the fire that

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:04.520 align:middle line:84%
just burns steadily along,
and you go from meal to meal,

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.000 align:middle line:90%
that's what you want.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.730 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to constantly
be reaching, reaching,

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.060 align:middle line:84%
reaching for that
sugar hit, and that's

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.760 align:middle line:84%
why I recommend people eliminate
those foods from their diet.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.255 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm hearing you
talk about right there is ways

00:24:17.255 --> 00:24:19.880 align:middle line:84%
in which we can actually help to
balance our blood sugar levels

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:25.130 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day and control
that insulin regularity, which,

00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:28.190 align:middle line:84%
when we don't do, starts to
lead to things like diabetes

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:29.150 align:middle line:90%
and obesity.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.465 align:middle line:84%
>> So really using good quality
fats to slow down the burn

00:24:34.465 --> 00:24:35.600 align:middle line:90%
of that--

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And you hear people
who say they're hangry.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.410 align:middle line:84%
It's that combination
of angry and hungry.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's actually
hilarious, but it's

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:84%
not far from the truth, because
when we are reliant on sugar--

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.700 align:middle line:84%
processed sugar-- as
our energy source,

00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
you do emotionally start to
feel agitated and angry when

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.730 align:middle line:90%
you can't get that next hit.

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:00.480 align:middle line:84%
That's why people are
like, I need to eat.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.630 align:middle line:90%
I can't talk until I eat.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.810 align:middle line:84%
Whereas if you're a fat burner,
then you're onto a good thing,

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.570 align:middle line:84%
because you can have
a nice bit of steak,

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.650 align:middle line:84%
or some avocado,
some nuts and seeds.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:11.450 align:middle line:90%
And you're good.

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:12.440 align:middle line:90%
You're sweet.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.060 align:middle line:84%
You're not reaching around
for that naughty food.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're not saying
it's one or the other.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:20.150 align:middle line:84%
We're saying that
we need to find

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.813 align:middle line:84%
some healthy unprocessed
carbohydrates.

00:25:22.813 --> 00:25:25.230 align:middle line:84%
Go back to our fruits, and our
vegetables, and our salads.

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:26.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Fruits, veggies.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, below ground
veggies, the starchy ones

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:30.740 align:middle line:90%
are phenomenal.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.570 align:middle line:84%
The sweet potatoes,
the carrots--

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:33.740 align:middle line:90%
they're fantastic.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.320 align:middle line:84%
They're high in healthy
sugars and carbohydrates.

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:90%
That's the stuff you want.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.230 align:middle line:84%
You just want to be ditching
things from packets.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Gotcha.

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.397 align:middle line:90%
In fact, I read on--

00:25:43.397 --> 00:25:45.480 align:middle line:84%
there's an awesome website
that that's pretty new.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.890 align:middle line:90%
It's called sugarscience.org.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.190 align:middle line:84%
And I read on there that up
to 74% of all packaged food

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:56.150 align:middle line:90%
has got added sugar in it.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:57.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That's horrific.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what we're
talking about, isn't it?

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That worries me.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And in this day and age,
because we're so busy,

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:02.850 align:middle line:90%
that's what people are eating.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:03.650 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.970 align:middle line:90%
Because it's convenient.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:06.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what they
have time to do.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.700 align:middle line:90%
>> But isn't it funny?

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.908 align:middle line:84%
We say it's convenient, but
then how convenient is it

00:26:09.908 --> 00:26:12.390 align:middle line:84%
to our health, where we're
actually tired, depressed,

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:15.230 align:middle line:90%
and putting on weight.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Life is becoming more stressful
and more anxious every minute.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly right.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:20.405 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not too convenient.

00:26:20.405 --> 00:26:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> No, that is exactly right.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So should we try a
little bit of dessert?

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:25.790 align:middle line:90%
What do you reckon?

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm saying I think
15 minutes is up.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>> All right, done.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.720 align:middle line:90%
Sounds good to me.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's do it.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.950 align:middle line:90%


00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> How good does this look?

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.960 align:middle line:84%
>> My mouth's been watering
for the last 15 minutes.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.043 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll cut us up a piece.

00:26:37.043 --> 00:26:42.870 align:middle line:90%


00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:43.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Good to see you're
generous with your slices.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:45.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:26:45.605 --> 00:26:46.000 align:middle line:90%
>> I like that.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:46.978 align:middle line:90%
I like that.

00:26:46.978 --> 00:26:48.520 align:middle line:84%
>> This is your
first time trying it.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.260 align:middle line:84%
I've got to give you
a good decent part.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.850 align:middle line:90%
How good is that?

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:53.810 align:middle line:90%
That's for you to try.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:54.935 align:middle line:90%
Let me know what you think.

00:26:54.935 --> 00:26:58.840 align:middle line:90%


00:26:58.840 --> 00:26:59.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:01.550 align:middle line:90%
We all right?

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.710 align:middle line:90%
Passes the test?

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.040 align:middle line:90%
Your mood already lifting?

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.037 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:27:06.037 --> 00:27:09.807 align:middle line:90%


00:27:09.807 --> 00:27:11.140 align:middle line:90%
>> It's just melt in your mouth.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:14.140 align:middle line:90%


00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.750 align:middle line:90%
That is delicious.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.500 align:middle line:84%
How can that not put
a smile on your face?

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:17.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.850 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Now that's your piece,
and this is mine.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:29.230 align:middle line:84%
So Luke, I have just one
more question for you,

00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:31.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's something
that I'm actually

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:36.760 align:middle line:84%
asking this question to all
of our wonderful speakers.

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.290 align:middle line:90%
And one of the reasons why is--

00:27:38.290 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:84%
it's been said through time
by the greatest philosophers

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.090 align:middle line:84%
that essentially we
are what we think,

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:50.070 align:middle line:84%
and that neuroscience is
now actually proving it,

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:53.070 align:middle line:84%
that our brain believes
what we tell it,

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:55.410 align:middle line:84%
and that our physiology
and our biology

00:27:55.410 --> 00:28:01.390 align:middle line:84%
then actually validates
what it is that we think.

00:28:01.390 --> 00:28:04.110 align:middle line:84%
This is still
melting in my mouth.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So my question is, what
would be the I am that you

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:11.900 align:middle line:90%
would tell yourself every day?

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:16.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I think my I am
is I am confident.

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:22.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, it might not necessarily
always be the case,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:84%
but if I go by
what you're saying,

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.440 align:middle line:84%
I think starting your day with
I am confident is powerful.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.630 align:middle line:90%
And I'll tell you why.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm confident in who I am.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:37.460 align:middle line:84%
I am confident in where I'm
supposed to be in this moment,

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and I am confident that what is
supposed to happen will happen.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.180 align:middle line:84%
And I believe having
confidence puts yourself

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.100 align:middle line:84%
in the right mindset
for moving forward.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.590 align:middle line:84%
