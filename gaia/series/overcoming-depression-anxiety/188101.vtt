00:00:06.804 --> 00:00:14.120 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Rhiannon, a very
warm welcome to you.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for making
the time to come here and share

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.890 align:middle line:90%
your story with us.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolute pleasure.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.980 align:middle line:90%
Absolute pleasure.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You are one of Australia's
leading business coaches.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.860 align:middle line:84%
And I know, however, that that
hasn't always been the case.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:84%
And your story
is-- again, I feel

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.360 align:middle line:84%
so grateful to have listened
to so many inspiring stories

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and the adversity that
people have experienced,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.685 align:middle line:90%
and yet come out the other side.

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:84%
It offers so much empowerment
and hope to people.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, for you, where do we begin?

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I know that you've
been through so much and such

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.390 align:middle line:90%
a transition.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.110 align:middle line:84%
Where would you like
to begin that journey?

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I have been really blessed
to have a lot of different

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.210 align:middle line:90%
tragedies in my life.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.855 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
sounds very strange.

00:01:12.855 --> 00:01:14.230 align:middle line:84%
But I really
believe until you're

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.370 align:middle line:84%
in a situation like that, you
don't understand how strong

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:90%
or how creative you can be.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.350 align:middle line:84%
And you may not actually
appreciate it in the moment.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.490 align:middle line:84%
But it's an appreciation
that comes later,

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:90%
when you've sorted things out.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps the best
way for me to explain

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.010 align:middle line:84%
is to explain one of
the tragedies I've had.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.440 align:middle line:90%
So about seven years ago.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.310 align:middle line:90%
I had a business.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:84%
I had a health and wellness
retreat, and I had 35 staff.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And I thought I was
happily married.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.690 align:middle line:90%
And I had a one-year-old child.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.160 align:middle line:84%
And one day, just after
my son's first birthday--

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a very great baker.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.060 align:middle line:84%
And I had actually made
an amazing cheesecake.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And it had a berry
coulis and stuff.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.220 align:middle line:90%
And my business partner--

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
she used to bake
cakes all the time.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I'm going
to bake her a cake,

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.532 align:middle line:84%
because that one
actually worked out.

00:02:03.532 --> 00:02:05.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to bring it
to her, and give it to her.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.900 align:middle line:84%
Because she baked me
stuff all the time.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:84%
So my husband and I, we
actually shared a truck.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.642 align:middle line:84%
So I would just call
him up and say, oh,

00:02:12.642 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:90%
can I have the vehicle?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.960 align:middle line:90%
And he'd say yes, and whatever.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.760 align:middle line:90%
No problems.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And this particular day, I
always think it's divinely--

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
there's some sort of
divine inspiration.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.150 align:middle line:84%
I just got the message not to
actually call him, but just

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.940 align:middle line:84%
ask my business partner if
I could borrow her truck.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So I borrowed her
truck, and I went home.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:90%
And I parked the car.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.990 align:middle line:84%
And I walked down the beautiful
garden to the front door.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And I knocked on-- not
knocked on the door.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.870 align:middle line:84%
Put my key in the
door, opened the door.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.650 align:middle line:84%
And as I walked down the
hallway, I saw a flash of pink.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.510 align:middle line:90%
And I went, huh.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.832 align:middle line:90%
That's unusual.

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:47.290 align:middle line:84%
And then as I walked down the
hallway, I turned the corner,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:84%
and there was my husband
standing in my wedding lingerie

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.780 align:middle line:84%
finishing off a job
interview on the phone.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, in that moment,
it was very--

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.210 align:middle line:84%
because my husband was a
firefighter, a extreme skier,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.270 align:middle line:84%
a mechanic, quite a
blokey sort of bloke.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's very hard for
me to, after 10 years,

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.120 align:middle line:84%
think that this is
the same partner

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:90%
that I've shared 10 years with.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.630 align:middle line:90%
So I went into shock.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't aware of the
fact that I went into shock.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like a martian in
your lounge room sort of thing.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.320 align:middle line:90%
It's unexpected.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:84%
But also, too, because
I'm a trained counselor,

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and I was a wife and mother,
I put the wife and mother over

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.292 align:middle line:84%
here, and I stepped into
the counselor space.

00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:34.750 align:middle line:84%
And when he finished
the interview,

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.770 align:middle line:90%
he came over and held my hands.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I've always
wanted to be girl.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And I took his hands, and
I looked him up and down,

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:90%
and I said, you know what?

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.690 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be the
most beautiful girl.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I grabbed
the cheesecake,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.530 align:middle line:90%
and I ran out the door.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And I cried every
day for 18 months.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:84%
But what happened during that
time was there was part of me--

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.623 align:middle line:84%
we used to have quite
a good relationship

00:03:58.623 --> 00:04:00.540 align:middle line:84%
and have a lot of laughs
and things like that.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.950 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, that's the
best one I've ever heard.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be a girl.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.580 align:middle line:84%
I just couldn't-- I didn't
actually think that it was

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.380 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So every day I would
come home, and he

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.800 align:middle line:90%
would go to work as one person.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:84%
And he would come home and dress
up at night as somebody else.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I found that
really difficult.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I wasn't sure
who I was really with.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And then after four months I
realized actually it's true.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.320 align:middle line:90%
He does want to become a woman.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.820 align:middle line:90%
He does want to do that.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to give him
my blessing at this stage.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
Also, too, I wasn't
fully understanding

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.980 align:middle line:90%
what was going on.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.620 align:middle line:84%
So I said to him, I said, how
about you go to Vancouver?

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.970 align:middle line:90%
But at the same time, like--

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
see, when something-- when
you get a shock like that,

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.370 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that happens, and you

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
make a bad decision,
what you don't realize

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.860 align:middle line:84%
is that you will make many, many
more bad decisions until you

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.150 align:middle line:90%
get to rock bottom.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
So when he left I just
thought, you know what?

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.050 align:middle line:90%
My income supply is gone, too.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.670 align:middle line:90%
My business is failing.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:90%
I have 35 staff.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.350 align:middle line:84%
I have a payroll of
$30,000 every two weeks.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:90%
I have a one-year-old child.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.900 align:middle line:84%
How am I going to
make this happen?

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.067 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, you know what?

00:05:07.067 --> 00:05:09.507 align:middle line:84%
This is something I'll just
solve in four or five weeks.

00:05:09.507 --> 00:05:10.840 align:middle line:90%
We'll just make some more money.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.400 align:middle line:84%
Get some more clients
in, and we'll be fine.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.460 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, what I'll
do is I'll house-sit.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.937 align:middle line:84%
Because that'll save
$2,000 or $3,000.

00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Then I'll be able to make
the paychecks and stuff.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:90%
And so I started house-sitting.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.000 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, that's great.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.860 align:middle line:84%
So I sort of had a
little bit of money.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.127 align:middle line:84%
Then my sister lent me a
couple of thousand dollars.

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:27.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, that's OK.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.430 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, wow.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.320 align:middle line:90%
That's not quite enough.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.120 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:84%
What I'll do is I'll get a
job cleaning restaurants.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:84%
I'll get up at 3:00
in the morning.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.050 align:middle line:90%
I'll wake my son up.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.690 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to the restaurant.

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.277 align:middle line:84%
It was a 3 and 1/2 thousand
square foot restaurant.

00:05:40.277 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:90%
I'll clean the restaurant.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.990 align:middle line:90%
I'll sweep it.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.950 align:middle line:90%
I'll wash the floors.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:90%
I'll vacuum it.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Then I'll take my
son to daycare.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.723 align:middle line:90%
Then I'll go to work.

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:90%
Then I'll pick him up.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Then I'll come home, and
I'll see some more clients.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.035 align:middle line:84%
Because that'll be
a bit of extra cash.

00:05:53.035 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So my day would start at 3:00,
kind of similar to today.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And my day would
finish at midnight.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
But I was just on this
constant treadmill going,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:90%
OK, you know what?

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.280 align:middle line:90%
It's only temporary.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:90%
This isn't forever.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.793 align:middle line:90%
I can do this.

00:06:07.793 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So after about six weeks,
I thought, you know?

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.430 align:middle line:90%
This is OK.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting house-sits.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:90%
I'll look after somebody's pets.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.600 align:middle line:84%
The next day, I'll look
after somebody's plants

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.110 align:middle line:90%
and that sort of thing.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.260 align:middle line:84%
But what I didn't realize
was I wasn't fixing it.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.850 align:middle line:84%
So over time, I was still doing
the house-sitting, all of that.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Well that
house-sitting situation

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:90%
dragged on for three years.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:84%
My son lived, from the
age of one to four,

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.250 align:middle line:90%
in 40 different houses.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I wouldn't know
if I was going to actually

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.880 align:middle line:90%
have a house to come home to.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.687 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people would call up
and they would say, I'm sorry,

00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:45.770 align:middle line:90%
we're coming home tonight.

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And I would pack
everything into the truck

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:84%
and go, god, where am
I going to go tonight?

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And I remember one
night I'd actually--

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.030 align:middle line:84%
it's so funny, because if I
speak about it for a period

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle line:90%
of time, it actually--

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:90%
I can feel.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.980 align:middle line:84%
It actually brings that
same feeling back to me.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:84%
So I was actually staying in
an A-frame house in Whistler

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:90%
upstairs.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.990 align:middle line:84%
And I was packing my
stuff into the truck.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.907 align:middle line:84%
And it was, again, another
one of those nights

00:07:08.907 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
where I actually didn't
have anywhere to stay.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:12.572 align:middle line:84%
And then some nights,
I used to sleep

00:07:12.572 --> 00:07:13.970 align:middle line:90%
in the spa on the shiatsu mat.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.178 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm like, well, that
is somewhere I could go.

00:07:16.178 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And my son would sleep
on the mat with me.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.347 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this particular night,
I was packing all the stuff

00:07:20.347 --> 00:07:21.350 align:middle line:90%
into my truck.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:84%
And this girl says to me,
she said, what are you doing?

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, I'm
just packing up.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
And she said, where
are you off to?

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And I said, actually,
I don't know.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.822 align:middle line:90%
And she said, what do you mean?

00:07:31.822 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm sort of
doing these house-sit things,

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:35.488 align:middle line:90%
and I don't have a house-sit.

00:07:35.488 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, oh, don't worry.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.200 align:middle line:90%
We're off to Hawaii.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.250 align:middle line:90%
You can stay in my place.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh, really?

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.773 align:middle line:84%
Because she actually
lived underneath.

00:07:41.773 --> 00:07:43.340 align:middle line:90%
So I've got another month there.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.880 align:middle line:84%
But what I didn't realize was
over the three-year period

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.200 align:middle line:84%
of the 40 different houses,
there was nothing left inside.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.180 align:middle line:90%
I had run out of energy.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:84%
I was just a shell going
through the motions--

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.525 align:middle line:90%
just showing up and doing it.

00:07:58.525 --> 00:07:59.900 align:middle line:84%
But there was--
seriously, it was

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:04.130 align:middle line:84%
like if you imagine just a very
huge space with nothing in it.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Like, you get echo inside me.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.485 align:middle line:90%
There was nothing in there.

00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:07.640 align:middle line:90%
I didn't care anymore.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:90%
I'd run out of energy.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:11.358 align:middle line:84%
And at that stage,
I couldn't ask

00:08:11.358 --> 00:08:12.650 align:middle line:90%
another person for a house-sit.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Now during all this time,
from one to four, pretty much

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:84%
98% of the time, my
son lived on dahl--

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.580 align:middle line:84%
I make good dahl, that's lentils
and rice-- the entire time.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't afford
a swimming lesson.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't afford a
piece of clothing.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't afford any
of that for my son.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:29.950 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.318 align:middle line:84%
I used to just wish
that I could do it.

00:08:32.318 --> 00:08:33.860 align:middle line:84%
During that whole
period, I thought--

00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.440 align:middle line:90%
I prayed to God.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.590 align:middle line:84%
If God could help me change
this, wouldn't that be amazing?

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.780 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't understand
why God wasn't listening.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:43.370 align:middle line:90%
Nothing wasn't happening.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:90%
I'm still in this situation.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:84%
At the end of three years of
house-sitting, I got so tired.

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
I called my girlfriend, I said,
look, can I just borrow a tent?

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Which is unbelievable, right?

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So at least I knew I could
put the tent up and down.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.870 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is,
too, it really impacts

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.940 align:middle line:84%
your self-esteem and
your self-confidence

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:02.740 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.210 align:middle line:84%
So at that stage, there
was nothing left of me.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.035 align:middle line:84%
So I was in the tent
for three months.

00:09:07.035 --> 00:09:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I was knocking
on doors trying

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.480 align:middle line:84%
to find a place for the winter,
because the winter was coming.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And I remember--
so I-- on average,

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.070 align:middle line:84%
I used to make
about $500 a month

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.250 align:middle line:84%
for that whole entire
time, for 12 years, when

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I had the spa that was going
down the toilet, all of that.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.510 align:middle line:90%
And I remember just--

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:27.080 align:middle line:84%
I used to cry myself to sleep at
night just thinking, you know,

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.190 align:middle line:90%
there's--

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm a smart girl.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:90%
I went to university.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.630 align:middle line:90%
I have smart parents.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.800 align:middle line:84%
How has someone like me
ended up living in a tent

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:39.440 align:middle line:84%
with this beautiful
child, that I can't even

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.000 align:middle line:90%
give him a swimming lesson?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.707 align:middle line:84%
I can't even offer
him a different meal

00:09:42.707 --> 00:09:43.790 align:middle line:90%
other than beans and rice.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:45.980 align:middle line:90%
And he never once complained.

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.740 align:middle line:84%
He never once asked
for a toy or anything.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Never once did he
ask for anything.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't give it anyway.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.968 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't give it anyway.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.010 align:middle line:90%
And this is really funny.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:58.100 align:middle line:84%
Like, I mean, I did know about
affirmations and all of that,

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.420 align:middle line:90%
and the power of attraction.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.950 align:middle line:90%
I did know about that.

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.710 align:middle line:84%
But I wasn't
necessarily using it,

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.030 align:middle line:84%
because I was in
such a bad place.

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So I remember one night I
was crying myself to sleep.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.410 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason
I just thought, oh,

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:15.550 align:middle line:84%
if I could have any amount
of money in the world,

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:84%
so that Jayesh and I don't
have to live like this,

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.320 align:middle line:84%
so I can buy him clothings, and
he can have unlimited swimming

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.120 align:middle line:90%
lessons.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
We can do whatever we
want whenever we want.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.930 align:middle line:90%
I can buy him a beautiful meal.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:27.390 align:middle line:84%
What would that
amount of money be?

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And I actually-- my girlfriend
still has the piece of paper.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I wrote down on the
piece of paper $40,000.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:39.700 align:middle line:84%
If I could make $40,000
in one month, oh my god.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Imagine all the
choice you'd have.

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know what happened
to that piece of paper.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.170 align:middle line:90%
My girlfriend has it.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.837 align:middle line:84%
But that night, I would have put
it somewhere else and whatever.

00:10:46.837 --> 00:10:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And then I got up the next
morning to go cleaning again,

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.910 align:middle line:90%
the same cycle, the same cycle.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, about three months
into living in the tent,

00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:59.110 align:middle line:84%
I got a call from my mom
that she was quite ill.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.240 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting,
because although

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
for the previous three
years I couldn't change it

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.995 align:middle line:84%
for myself, the second that
I got a call from my mom--

00:11:06.995 --> 00:11:08.620 align:middle line:84%
so it was a different
type of catalyst.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Like, I was trying
to change it for me.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:13.070 align:middle line:84%
But this call from my mom was
like a make it or break it

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:13.870 align:middle line:90%
moment.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:90%
My mom said, I'm not very well.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to
myself, oh my god,

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.200 align:middle line:84%
if my mom dies because I can't
find a way out of my tent,

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.310 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forgive myself.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.460 align:middle line:90%
I solved my problem like that.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So because sometimes it's
getting a bigger problem,

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:29.320 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.120 align:middle line:90%
And isn't it funny?

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.110 align:middle line:84%
And I thought this
problem was so huge.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:33.700 align:middle line:90%
I called all my friends.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:90%
I said I need money and points.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.725 align:middle line:84%
I need to come
back to Australia.

00:11:36.725 --> 00:11:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I need to look after
my mom, because I

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.840 align:middle line:84%
want to make sure I've
done everything in my power

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.800 align:middle line:90%
for my mom.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.760 align:middle line:90%
So I got money.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Somebody lent me $10,000.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.760 align:middle line:90%
I got points.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.035 align:middle line:90%
I bought one ticket.

00:11:47.035 --> 00:11:48.410 align:middle line:84%
I got points on
the other ticket.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.452 align:middle line:90%
I came back to Australia.

00:11:49.452 --> 00:11:52.030 align:middle line:84%
I think we put $800
in a little milk jar.

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.820 align:middle line:84%
And I went on
Centrelink benefits.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:90%
My mom was quite ill.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.080 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't sleep at night.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:90%
She couldn't actually lie down.

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.390 align:middle line:84%
And every night she thought
she was going to die.

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is,
the three of us

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:03.670 align:middle line:84%
were living in a one-bedroom
housing commission

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.500 align:middle line:90%
unit in Meadowbank.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And we were taking turns
between the couch, the bed,

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.370 align:middle line:90%
and the floor.

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's really interesting,
because it took my son years

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.690 align:middle line:84%
to actually be able
to sleep in a bed,

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.170 align:middle line:84%
because he'd spent so much
time sleeping on a floor.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So after about eight or nine
months of working through

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.168 align:middle line:84%
with mom's health and
illness, she actually

00:12:24.168 --> 00:12:25.960 align:middle line:84%
got better, which was
just such a blessing.

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.793 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, oh my god.

00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm so glad that I put
that time and energy.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I made the right decision to
come back to look after my mom

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.710 align:middle line:90%
and to change my life.

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:90%
And then I thought, oh my god.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.190 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:37.630 align:middle line:90%
My mom's better.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.950 align:middle line:90%
We've got a roof over our head.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.700 align:middle line:84%
I don't care that it's
housing commission.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.433 align:middle line:90%
I have a place to live.

00:12:42.433 --> 00:12:43.350 align:middle line:90%
What am I going to do?

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But my confidence
was about that big.

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.000 align:middle line:84%
My self-esteem was
about that big.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.237 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't really
think I could do it.

00:12:49.237 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:84%
But someone had suggested
to me, because I'd

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.612 align:middle line:84%
had the business
before for 12 years,

00:12:52.612 --> 00:12:54.567 align:middle line:84%
even though it was
a failing business,

00:12:54.567 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:84%
someone had said to
me, you know what?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.567 align:middle line:84%
You'd make a great
business coach.

00:12:57.567 --> 00:12:59.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, what's
a business coach?

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.157 align:middle line:84%
Like, you know, coach
businesses and all that?

00:13:01.157 --> 00:13:02.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.570 align:middle line:84%
So I went to see somebody
in a coaching firm.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:06.662 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, tell me
about this coaching.

00:13:06.662 --> 00:13:08.120 align:middle line:84%
And she told me
about the coaching.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:09.940 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:10.780 align:middle line:90%
That sounds good.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And don't forget, I'm
on Centrelink benefits.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually wearing
my mom's clothes to work.

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.165 align:middle line:90%
These are my clothes.

00:13:15.165 --> 00:13:18.010 align:middle line:84%
But at that time, I was wearing
my mom's clothes to work.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.892 align:middle line:90%
And she said, well--

00:13:19.892 --> 00:13:21.100 align:middle line:90%
I said, explain the training.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.390 align:middle line:84%
And she said, well, the
training is $35,000 for 10 days.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.620 align:middle line:90%
Then you buy a franchise.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Then you do this,
and you do that.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.560 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
When she said $35,000, that
was equivalent to seven years

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.110 align:middle line:90%
worth of my income.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:90%
Plus, I don't have a job.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:38.590 align:middle line:84%
I'm living in
housing commission.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm wearing my mom's
clothes to work.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.500 align:middle line:90%
How am I going to raise $35,000?

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:84%
So I did everything not to do
that, because I was already

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:90%
quite stressed.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.285 align:middle line:84%
Even though my mom was better,
I was still quite timid.

00:13:50.285 --> 00:13:52.070 align:middle line:90%
I know it's hard to believe now.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.560 align:middle line:90%
But I've worked a lot on myself.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Quite timid-- I couldn't
answer the phone.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.665 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't answer emails.

00:13:57.665 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:84%
If there was any sort
of confrontation,

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.728 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't do it.

00:14:00.728 --> 00:14:02.770 align:middle line:84%
I would say to mom, you
have to answer the phone.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:90%
You have-- I can't do it.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.500 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:84%
Because I just-- I'd
lost so much of myself.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
So when she said to me,
it's $35,000, I'm like,

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.960 align:middle line:90%
how am I going to do that?

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.680 align:middle line:84%
So I got into the
paper-- the newspaper,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.695 align:middle line:90%
started looking at jobs.

00:14:14.695 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:90%
There were some great jobs.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:90%
I love India.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.635 align:middle line:84%
There was some great jobs
going to India and stuff.

00:14:18.635 --> 00:14:20.970 align:middle line:84%
But this tiny little
voice inside--

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:84%
because sometimes we know
exactly what we need,

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and we don't want
to listen to it.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.150 align:middle line:84%
This tiny little voice
inside said, coaching.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:90%
It's coaching.

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:29.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.030 align:middle line:84%
It's got to be a job,
like a regular paycheck.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.545 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I'm going to put
$35,000 into this after I've

00:14:35.545 --> 00:14:37.420 align:middle line:84%
lost over a million
dollars in the other one,

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.240 align:middle line:84%
plus $300,000 debt,
plus, plus, plus.

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:84%
I have so much baggage,
as if I'm going

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.470 align:middle line:90%
to take another investment.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:47.320 align:middle line:84%
But this tiny little voice
inside kept saying, coaching.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.260 align:middle line:90%
It's coaching.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.060 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:84%
It was so hard to take
that leap of faith.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go and get
another loan, add to that debt,

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.040 align:middle line:84%
and who knows if I'm
even a good coach?

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:90%
I don't even know.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.450 align:middle line:84%
But I knew inside
that it was true.

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:02.890 align:middle line:84%
There was this
tiny, weeny voice,

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.130 align:middle line:84%
let's call it soul or spirit,
whatever your inner knowing,

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.930 align:middle line:90%
that said, this is the path.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:10.780 align:middle line:90%
And I chose to listen to it.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:90%
Thank God.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.050 align:middle line:90%
Thank God, I chose listen to it.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.690 align:middle line:84%
So I went to the banks, and
they laughed in my face.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.460 align:middle line:84%
They said you're in
housing commission.

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.510 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a job.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:22.060 align:middle line:90%
And you want a loan for $35,000.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.700 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.260 align:middle line:84%
I think once I
got a little taste

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:28.777 align:middle line:84%
that somehow this
little tiny voice said,

00:15:28.777 --> 00:15:29.860 align:middle line:90%
there's something in this.

00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.113 align:middle line:84%
And I did-- because a lot
of time you hear those gut--

00:15:32.113 --> 00:15:34.030 align:middle line:84%
you have that gut, and
you don't listen to it.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.870 align:middle line:90%
You go and do something else.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.310 align:middle line:84%
And then you go, god, I knew
I should have done that.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:39.340 align:middle line:84%
I held onto that
little tiny voice,

00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:43.410 align:middle line:84%
that little tiny hope
inside me that said, do it.

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:44.410 align:middle line:90%
I went to all the banks.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.340 align:middle line:90%
I asked everyone I know.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.465 align:middle line:90%
Can you lend me some money?

00:15:46.465 --> 00:15:48.430 align:middle line:90%
I want to do this training.

00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:49.320 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.570 align:middle line:90%
And the banks kept saying, no.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:51.880 align:middle line:90%
And I mean, hello?

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I went back to the same bank
again and again and again.

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:57.310 align:middle line:84%
And I got the same girl
saying, oh, it's you again.

00:15:57.310 --> 00:15:58.030 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, you know what?

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.850 align:middle line:90%
I need to get a loan.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.558 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, it's
really interesting

00:16:00.558 --> 00:16:04.960 align:middle line:84%
how sometimes things line
up just perfectly for you,

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.250 align:middle line:90%
but you don't even realize.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:07.600 align:middle line:90%
So I was sitting in a bank.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.920 align:middle line:90%
And I was sitting--

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.788 align:middle line:84%
where the chair was
were the two offices.

00:16:10.788 --> 00:16:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And there was office here, and
that lady there, and an office

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:14.710 align:middle line:90%
here, and a lady here.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, that lady there, I'd
already asked her about six,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.000 align:middle line:84%
seven, or eight times,
can I get a loan?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And she always told
me, oh, god, seriously?

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:21.510 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
You're in housing
commission, or whatever.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, when I
was sitting in that bank,

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:27.970 align:middle line:90%
I thought, I wonder--

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.610 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I get
the other lady.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if I get
the other lady.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.127 align:middle line:84%
And I thought in
that moment, I'm

00:16:35.127 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:90%
going to do something different.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.380 align:middle line:84%
Because you know the
definition of insanity

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.922 align:middle line:84%
is doing the same
thing over and over

00:16:39.922 --> 00:16:42.040 align:middle line:84%
and expecting a different
result. So what I did,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.470 align:middle line:90%
I got the other lady.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:45.580 align:middle line:84%
Call it whatever you
want-- divine intervention

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.380 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.910 align:middle line:90%
I manifested the other lady.

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So instead of asking her how
to get a loan, I said, how--

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.090 align:middle line:84%
I said, what do I need
to tell you to get

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.920 align:middle line:90%
a loan for about $35,000?

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And because it was fresh,
new person, she said,

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.733 align:middle line:84%
oh well, you need to be
making $80,000 a year,

00:17:02.733 --> 00:17:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and you need to have regular
income and all of that.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.030 align:middle line:84%
And blah, blah, blah, she
gave me the whole thing.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.609 align:middle line:84%
Well, what do you think appeared
on my form the next week?

00:17:09.609 --> 00:17:10.942 align:middle line:90%
And the thing is, you know what?

00:17:10.942 --> 00:17:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Seriously, that's
not a good thing,

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.829 align:middle line:84%
because I couldn't
prove any of that.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.140 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't real.

00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So you fabricated
all the information--

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I fabricated all
the information.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:19.690 align:middle line:84%
>> --when you got the
information that you needed.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:20.490 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what?

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.379 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I'm
either going to jail,

00:17:22.379 --> 00:17:26.087 align:middle line:84%
or I'm going to Vegas
to do this course.

00:17:26.087 --> 00:17:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> That takes some--

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I went to Vegas.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.140 align:middle line:90%
I went to Vegas.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, totally.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.065 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, I had to
borrow money for the flight.

00:17:32.065 --> 00:17:34.210 align:middle line:84%
So I ended up getting five
credit cards and a loan.

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.940 align:middle line:90%
Because that first credit card--

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.190 align:middle line:84%
they didn't give me
the loan for $35,000.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:38.982 align:middle line:84%
They gave me a loan
for 2 and 1/2 thousand.

00:17:38.982 --> 00:17:40.883 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't go, oh my god.

00:17:40.883 --> 00:17:41.800 align:middle line:90%
I've got so much more.

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go, on my god,
I've got so much more to go.

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:44.440 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yoo-hoo.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:90%
Somebody gave me a loan.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.390 align:middle line:90%
I've got two.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:47.873 align:middle line:90%
I've only $33,000 to go.

00:17:47.873 --> 00:17:48.790 align:middle line:90%
That's what I thought.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:84%
There was a little tiny,
tiny, weeny sliver of hope.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.188 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god.

00:17:55.188 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:90%
I've got one credit card.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.370 align:middle line:90%
I can replicate this.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:84%
So it's tiny, weeny baby steps,
that if you don't listen in,

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:04.130 align:middle line:84%
they're more silent than the
sound of your own beating

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.930 align:middle line:90%
heart.

00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.220 align:middle line:90%
I went, you know what?

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm one step closer.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:08.880 align:middle line:90%
So I got five credit cards.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.880 align:middle line:90%
I end up getting a loan.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.680 align:middle line:90%
I went to Vegas.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.060 align:middle line:84%
I borrowed the money for a
flight from somebody else.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.335 align:middle line:84%
When I got there, I didn't
have any spending money.

00:18:15.335 --> 00:18:16.960 align:middle line:84%
But we're in Vegas,
and we're learning.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.440 align:middle line:90%
It's all good.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:20.620 align:middle line:84%
They put us under
extreme stress.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
But you got to
understand, for me,

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.280 align:middle line:84%
I'd already been
under extreme stress.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.110 align:middle line:90%
So their stress didn't even--

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:26.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Walk in the park.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:27.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Walk in the park.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Well, I mean, hello?

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:90%
Luxury living.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.605 align:middle line:84%
Like seriously, I couldn't--
everyone's like, oh my gosh,

00:18:31.605 --> 00:18:32.813 align:middle line:90%
you're so-- you're like this.

00:18:32.813 --> 00:18:33.940 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, are you serious?

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.830 align:middle line:84%
I've had so much stress in my
life for so long, that this

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:37.630 align:middle line:90%
is like--

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to Vegas.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:39.690 align:middle line:90%
I've got three meals.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:40.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm learning.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm in an environment-- look.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean, we've got carpet.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:90%
We could be-- hello?

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.870 align:middle line:84%
And I just had the
most amazing time.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.667 align:middle line:84%
And I just sucked up
all that learning.

00:18:48.667 --> 00:18:49.750 align:middle line:90%
I was like, you know what?

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:90%
This is my chance.

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.440 align:middle line:84%
When I paid that
money to go to Vegas,

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.235 align:middle line:84%
I said, this has to
to create a new life.

00:18:57.235 --> 00:18:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So I think I didn't say,
oh, it would be nice

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:90%
if this would make a new life.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I said, this has to
create a new life.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.420 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing
was, I've looked

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:84%
at all the tiny,
weeny baby steps

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.190 align:middle line:84%
that have brought me here,
like sitting talking to you.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.080 align:middle line:84%
At the end of that
two-week course,

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:84%
with lots of these CEOs
from all around the world,

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.930 align:middle line:84%
like big companies, managing big
companies and things like that,

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:84%
they're all freaking out because
we didn't get enough sleep.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:19.660 align:middle line:84%
And there was so much
stress and stuff.

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Like, they're throwing their
water bottles around the room,

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:84%
because they're
that stressed out.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just
sitting there going,

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.990 align:middle line:90%
what else do we need to learn?

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the two weeks--

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.960 align:middle line:84%
there was about 30
of us in the group.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.342 align:middle line:84%
And they got everyone
to get up and say,

00:19:33.342 --> 00:19:35.800 align:middle line:84%
you've got to tell us who was
the most inspirational person

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:37.270 align:middle line:90%
in this course.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.490 align:middle line:84%
And all of them
kept saying I was.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.710 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, oh my god.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm the most inspirational
person in this course.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:44.950 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to run with that.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:84%
If I'm the most inspirational
person in this course,

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:90%
I can do something with that.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.340 align:middle line:90%
I can take that inspiration.

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.320 align:middle line:90%
I can use it somehow.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.080 align:middle line:90%
That can be my new wings.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.920 align:middle line:90%
That can take me somewhere.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.940 align:middle line:84%
So I came back to Australia
thinking, oh my god.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:84%
I can-- I don't know what
this inspirational thing does,

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:07.180 align:middle line:84%
but it's going to
do something for me.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.790 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, I still have a
lot of work to do on myself.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:11.680 align:middle line:84%
Because I still had poverty
conscious and all of that.

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.805 align:middle line:90%
So I still had all of that.

00:20:12.805 --> 00:20:15.915 align:middle line:84%
So here am I, trying to be a
coach, working really hard.

00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, come
and coach with me.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Joe, you'll love it.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to make a
really big difference.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, if you haven't
worked on your subconscious

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.065 align:middle line:84%
beliefs, your inner
core, your inner compass,

00:20:24.065 --> 00:20:25.440 align:middle line:84%
it's not going to
happen for you.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.180 align:middle line:84%
So what I was doing
was even though I

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.150 align:middle line:84%
was trying to sign
people to coach with me,

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:31.350 align:middle line:90%
I was sabotaging it.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.663 align:middle line:84%
Because really I was saying,
I'm not sure if you can--

00:20:33.663 --> 00:20:34.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:37.490 align:middle line:84%
So through my languaging
and my words, they would go,

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:38.290 align:middle line:90%
you know what?

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:39.360 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's catch up next week.

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'd call next
week, and they'd go,

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.220 align:middle line:84%
I've already signed
with another coach.

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't understand it.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.210 align:middle line:90%
Like how--

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:46.668 align:middle line:84%
>> So they'd be picking up on
your lack of self-confidence.

00:20:46.668 --> 00:20:47.468 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:47.468 --> 00:20:49.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though you're
saying the right thing,

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.472 align:middle line:84%
it was like they were picking
up on an energy underneath that

00:20:51.472 --> 00:20:52.272 align:middle line:90%
was--

00:20:52.272 --> 00:20:55.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Because, you know, words
are only 7% of communication,

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.900 align:middle line:84%
and the other 93% is
the language, the tone,

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.075 align:middle line:84%
the gestures, the feeling
that you get when you--

00:21:00.075 --> 00:21:00.875 align:middle line:90%
that's the truth.

00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:90%
So even though my words said--

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.700 align:middle line:90%
7% said, coach with me.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.500 align:middle line:90%
You'll be great.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.710 align:middle line:84%
The other 93%-- don't coach
with me, whatever you do.

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:09.258 align:middle line:90%
I'm not stable yet.

00:21:09.258 --> 00:21:11.050 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is, I
couldn't understand it.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:14.550 align:middle line:84%
I had 16 people in a
row with money say,

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.780 align:middle line:90%
I want to coach with you.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.730 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't sign one of them.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is, I was going
to go into a really deeply

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.250 align:middle line:84%
distressing financial situation
again if I didn't sign someone.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Because my mom was
pawning her jewelry to put

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.700 align:middle line:90%
food on the table at this stage.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:84%
Because I wasn't
making enough money.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.720 align:middle line:90%
So I thought, you know what?

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.658 align:middle line:90%
I need more help.

00:21:34.658 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:90%
I've gone to this course.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.783 align:middle line:90%
I've got this inspiration.

00:21:36.783 --> 00:21:38.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not enough.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And the trouble is,
I think a lot of time

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
when people get into
difficult situations,

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.670 align:middle line:84%
they go-- they have one
session with a psychologist.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.532 align:middle line:90%
I should be better.

00:21:45.532 --> 00:21:47.490 align:middle line:84%
They go and have one
session with someone else.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.340 align:middle line:84%
But what they don't realize is
it's actually a longer process.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:84%
You need to invest a
lot more in yourself.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:55.080 align:middle line:84%
We're so many-layered
and so complicated.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:90%
We need a lot more help.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.880 align:middle line:90%
So you know what?

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.670 align:middle line:84%
I invested every cent
I had into everything

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:05.190 align:middle line:84%
that I could do-- kinesiology,
psychology courses, anything

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.610 align:middle line:84%
that anyone had done of
remote success, I would do it.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed the top
10 coaches in the world.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.065 align:middle line:90%
I said, how do I be you?

00:22:12.065 --> 00:22:13.440 align:middle line:84%
And they were--
what do you mean?

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:13.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:84%
How do I have the
success that you have?

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.482 align:middle line:84%
How do I build a
business like you have?

00:22:17.482 --> 00:22:18.690 align:middle line:90%
And they just gave me a list.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
They said you need to do
this course, this course,

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.470 align:middle line:84%
this course, this
course, and this course.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:84%
And you need to work
with these people,

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.645 align:middle line:90%
these people, these people.

00:22:24.645 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:84%
I looked at them all
in my list, from all

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.110 align:middle line:90%
of these 10 top coaches.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:90%
And I went right.

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.400 align:middle line:84%
That's going to take about
two or three years to do.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:84%
It's going to cost
me about $250,000.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:36.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to put
every cent I have into that.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.490 align:middle line:90%
So I decided not to buy a car.

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.670 align:middle line:84%
I decided to walk
everywhere or catch a bus

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.560 align:middle line:90%
or get lifts with friends.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Because every cent I
had had to-- my life,

00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.250 align:middle line:84%
my son's life, my mom's
life, depend on the fact

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:51.580 align:middle line:90%
that I make an income for us.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:54.810 align:middle line:90%
So my why was huge.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:84%
After about two years, I think
it was about 18 months later--

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.961 align:middle line:84%
so from the time I wrote
that note about $40,000,

00:23:02.961 --> 00:23:05.700 align:middle line:84%
18 months later, I
had my first month.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.520 align:middle line:90%
I made $40,811.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.210 align:middle line:90%
>> So you signed somebody up?

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, a couple of people.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.440 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:15.120 align:middle line:84%
But to actually have
the realization,

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.320 align:middle line:84%
oh my god, I did it
within 18 months.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.290 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm like,
wait a second.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:20.250 align:middle line:90%
This stuff does work.

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:21.930 align:middle line:84%
So then what I've
done is I've just

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:25.350 align:middle line:84%
created bigger visioning and
bigger pictures and stuff.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And wherever I showed
resistance, I stepped in.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I did everything I
could to learn and grow.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.700 align:middle line:84%
And rather than run
from confrontation,

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.680 align:middle line:90%
I ran towards it going, OK, Joe.

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.097 align:middle line:84%
You and I have had
a disagreement.

00:23:36.097 --> 00:23:37.222 align:middle line:90%
How are we going to fix it?

00:23:37.222 --> 00:23:38.580 align:middle line:90%
What have I done to create that?

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I took all the
responsibility myself

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.210 align:middle line:90%
of everything that's happened.

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.512 align:middle line:84%
And the funny thing is
now it's like a game.

00:23:44.512 --> 00:23:46.970 align:middle line:84%
Like, my accountant-- because
now I make really good money.

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:47.940 align:middle line:90%
My life's amazing.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.200 align:middle line:90%
I get to help lots of people.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.208 align:middle line:84%
I've got so much
choice in the world.

00:23:52.208 --> 00:23:54.000 align:middle line:84%
So now my accountant
calls up and she goes,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.958 align:middle line:90%
I've got some bad news.

00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, tell me.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:56.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't go, oh, tell me.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:57.730 align:middle line:90%
I'll go, tell me.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:23:59.550 align:middle line:84%
She goes, you've got
this massive tax bill.

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.582 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, uh-uh.

00:24:00.582 --> 00:24:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, well
it's quite huge.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, uh-uh.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.382 align:middle line:84%
And she goes, you
need to pay it now.

00:24:04.382 --> 00:24:06.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, yeah, or-- and she
goes, what do you mean or?

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.550 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:90%
So I either pay it now or--

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:11.152 align:middle line:84%
and she goes, or
you get a huge fine.

00:24:11.152 --> 00:24:12.360 align:middle line:90%
I said, how much is the fine?

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And she tells me how
much the fine is.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:90%
And I'm thinking, OK.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:84%
I'll either pay it now, which
means I don't have any money.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Or I take the big fine.

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.803 align:middle line:84%
I keep my money now, and I get
a bit more time to work it out.

00:24:21.803 --> 00:24:23.970 align:middle line:84%
So I call the tax office
and say I'll take the fine,

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:90%
and I'll figure it out.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.432 align:middle line:90%
And so I've got more money now.

00:24:26.432 --> 00:24:29.130 align:middle line:84%
So now I don't have any
problems in my life--

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:30.300 align:middle line:90%
maybe lack of sleep.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:31.860 align:middle line:90%
Seriously, that's about it.

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:35.792 align:middle line:84%
So I feel so gifted
from this experience

00:24:35.792 --> 00:24:36.750 align:middle line:90%
that I can help people.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.025 align:middle line:84%
Because they come to
with problems like,

00:24:39.025 --> 00:24:40.650 align:middle line:84%
the bank's going to
take back my house.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:41.830 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, that's not a problem.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:42.270 align:middle line:90%
We can fix that.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:42.900 align:middle line:90%
They go, no, no.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.733 align:middle line:90%
It's really serious.

00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:47.457 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, no, living in a tent
with no hope, with no future,

00:24:47.457 --> 00:24:49.290 align:middle line:84%
thinking your life's
over, that's a problem.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.430 align:middle line:84%
The bank-- we'll
make a few calls.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.060 align:middle line:90%
We'll fix that.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:51.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry.

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.630 align:middle line:84%
We just need to do a little few
adjustments in your business

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:57.000 align:middle line:84%
and in your mind,
and we'll fix that.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.640 align:middle line:84%
So in the last three
years, every problem

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.050 align:middle line:90%
I get, I can solve.

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.730 align:middle line:84%
And even now, I'm
getting problems

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:04.650 align:middle line:90%
that I'm not even qualified for.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:06.240 align:middle line:84%
So I get people
calling me up going,

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.100 align:middle line:84%
do you think you
help me with this?

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:07.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, you know what?

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:08.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not trained in that.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:09.630 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:11.588 align:middle line:84%
And I'll sit down with
them for a few sessions,

00:25:11.588 --> 00:25:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and I'm like, actually,
I think I can do that.

00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:17.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm getting problems
so far left out of field

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.930 align:middle line:90%
for my actual training.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:84%
But it's all the ability
to see a different option.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.790 align:middle line:84%
It's the ability to
create something else.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.190 align:middle line:84%
You know the story about
Kentucky Fried Chicken.

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:31.640 align:middle line:90%
You know that story?

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:35.440 align:middle line:84%
He knocked on 1,000 restaurants
before he actually-- somebody

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.790 align:middle line:84%
signed him up for
his first paycheck.

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.848 align:middle line:90%
We're not often that tenacious.

00:25:42.848 --> 00:25:44.890 align:middle line:84%
We get three or four
knockbacks, and we go, well,

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:45.970 align:middle line:90%
that didn't work.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:84%
But it's just about
continuously try, and also

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.530 align:middle line:84%
to having the vision to
see that this has to, must,

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:52.330 align:middle line:90%
and will happen.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Like, three years ago,
I bought 110 acres.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.053 align:middle line:84%
And everyone around
me said, oh my god.

00:25:59.053 --> 00:26:00.220 align:middle line:90%
You shouldn't be doing that.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:00.700 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, why?

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And they go, well, you
don't have any money.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like--
because I'm paying off

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:84%
all the debts from
my previous mistake.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.060 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, no.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
the ball rolling.

00:26:07.150 --> 00:26:09.460 align:middle line:84%
Because the way my brain
works, in the limbic brain,

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.990 align:middle line:90%
in your subconscious mind is--

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:84%
the subconscious mind,
limbic brain, is a child.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.240 align:middle line:84%
If you show it what you want,
it will start working on it

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.860 align:middle line:84%
and try and figure
out how to get it.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:19.390 align:middle line:84%
So I'm like, I'm going
to get the ball rolling.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go and look
at these properties.

00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:84%
My mom's laughing, like,
there's no money in the bank.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:23.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no, no, no.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.180 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make this happen.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Within a year, I had the down
payment for that property.

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.650 align:middle line:90%
I got the money together.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:31.238 align:middle line:84%
And then six weeks
before settlement,

00:26:31.238 --> 00:26:33.280 align:middle line:84%
the bank calls and they
said, look, I'm so sorry.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:34.613 align:middle line:90%
We've made a really big mistake.

00:26:34.613 --> 00:26:36.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like,
what's the mistake?

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:38.020 align:middle line:84%
And they said, because of
the zoning of your property,

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.145 align:middle line:84%
because it's rural, you're
going to have to come up

00:26:40.145 --> 00:26:42.160 align:middle line:90%
with twice the deposit.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.210 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh my god.

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:45.780 align:middle line:90%
Twice the deposit in six weeks.

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.780 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, oh my god.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:47.613 align:middle line:90%
That's just massive.

00:26:47.613 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:84%
It took me a year to
make that first deposit.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, no.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:53.890 align:middle line:84%
It has to, must, and
will happen for me.

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:55.930 align:middle line:84%
It has to, because
this is my first home.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.530 align:middle line:84%
This is my home, my roof over
my head for my son and my mom

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:01.690 align:middle line:84%
and all my friends that
stay and stuff like that.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:02.555 align:middle line:90%
It has to happen.

00:27:02.555 --> 00:27:03.680 align:middle line:90%
And everyone was like, how?

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, I don't know.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.543 align:middle line:90%
It's just going to happen.

00:27:05.543 --> 00:27:09.190 align:middle line:84%
So I asked all my clients,
can I draw forward to--

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.860 align:middle line:84%
like a year forward, to put
that money towards the deposit.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And some of them said yes,
and some of them said no.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.260 align:middle line:84%
But I still needed to create
a huge amount of money,

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.832 align:middle line:90%
and I had 10 days left.

00:27:18.832 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:84%
But every night that I would
go to sleep, I would go,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.150 align:middle line:90%
it has to, must, and will.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.938 align:middle line:84%
What three different ways
can I make this happen?

00:27:24.938 --> 00:27:26.230 align:middle line:90%
And I would come up with ideas.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:27.470 align:middle line:90%
Ask someone rich.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.690 align:middle line:90%
Create a new product.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:29.495 align:middle line:90%
Do this or do that.

00:27:29.495 --> 00:27:30.370 align:middle line:90%
And I would just try.

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:33.550 align:middle line:84%
I would ask everyone I know,
and everything was a no.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And then it's
really interesting.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.810 align:middle line:84%
I really believe that when
you try with everything

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:39.850 align:middle line:90%
in your heart, doors open.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:41.620 align:middle line:84%
They just-- if that's
what you really

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.280 align:middle line:84%
want, and it's heart-centered,
your doors will open.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So after settlement,
I was supposed

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.997 align:middle line:84%
to see this client in
Perth two weeks later.

00:27:49.997 --> 00:27:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'd already asked her
if I could draw forward,

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:90%
and she said, look, sorry.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.410 align:middle line:90%
You can't.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:53.920 align:middle line:90%
I can't do it.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, OK.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.262 align:middle line:84%
Then she calls and
she says, is there

00:27:56.262 --> 00:27:58.980 align:middle line:84%
any chance that you can come two
weeks before-- like, earlier.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:27:59.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, yeah.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:00.580 align:middle line:90%
I can do that.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.480 align:middle line:90%
No problems.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.550 align:middle line:84%
So I went and I worked with
her for about three days.

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.092 align:middle line:84%
And on the third
day, we were sitting

00:28:05.092 --> 00:28:06.540 align:middle line:90%
at the back of her house and--

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:08.150 align:middle line:90%
it's in my book.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.230 align:middle line:84%
And she says to me, how are
you going with that deposit?

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:13.387 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I'm
about this much short.

00:28:13.387 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, don't worry.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:middle line:84%
My husband will
write you a check.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.233 align:middle line:84%
And I went, I don't
even know your husband.

00:28:19.233 --> 00:28:21.400 align:middle line:84%
And she-- because I'd met
him once for half an hour.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.610 align:middle line:90%
And she goes, just ask him.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:23.777 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, I'm not going to--

00:28:23.777 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to ask him.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.250 align:middle line:84%
I went upstairs
and had a shower.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.360 align:middle line:90%
He walked in the house.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:30.402 align:middle line:84%
I came downstairs, and
he'd written me the check,

00:28:30.402 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:90%
and he passed it to me.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:33.130 align:middle line:84%
But that's not the
miracle of the story.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.435 align:middle line:84%
I was jumping up
and down like I'd

00:28:34.435 --> 00:28:35.470 align:middle line:90%
won the lotto, going oh my god.

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:37.178 align:middle line:84%
That's exactly what
I need to-- you know.

00:28:37.178 --> 00:28:38.650 align:middle line:90%
So that cleared.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:90%
And I settled.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.752 align:middle line:84%
I had the money in the bank
two days before settlement.

00:28:41.752 --> 00:28:42.910 align:middle line:90%
And I bought the property.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:45.832 align:middle line:84%
But I was also playing
netball at that time.

00:28:45.832 --> 00:28:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And one of the single mums
on the team, she had said,

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:84%
look, if I could, I'd give
you the money, whatever.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.100 align:middle line:90%
And I went to play netball.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.270 align:middle line:84%
It was a few days
before settlement.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:53.380 align:middle line:84%
She goes, how did
you go with the money

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.670 align:middle line:90%
that you need for your house?

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
won't believe it.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.200 align:middle line:90%
I actually got it.

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:57.850 align:middle line:84%
She goes, well, I was going
to say if you need it,

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.010 align:middle line:84%
I actually got a bonus
at work, and it's exactly

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:01.372 align:middle line:90%
that amount of money.

00:29:01.372 --> 00:29:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And she was going
to give it to me.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So we limit ourselves by
the way we see the world,

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.070 align:middle line:84%
or by the way we think, oh,
that wouldn't happen for me.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Or you make assumptions about
how things would happen.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.240 align:middle line:84%
You stop trying right at the
point it's going to happen.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.450 align:middle line:84%
You make good and bad
things mean something,

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:18.460 align:middle line:90%
when they-- just an experience.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:21.703 align:middle line:84%
Whereas, if you only saw
that result, you'd only--

00:29:21.703 --> 00:29:22.870 align:middle line:90%
you would-- it would happen.

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:24.850 align:middle line:90%
It would happen for you.

00:29:24.850 --> 00:29:28.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So, you know, it's
an amazing story.

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:31.030 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm hearing
there is that there

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.760 align:middle line:84%
was a period of time in which
you really had to dig deep.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:35.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yeah.

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And you had to
work on yourself.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:40.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:46.510 align:middle line:84%
>> So for those that still
feel they're stuck in that,

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:53.440 align:middle line:84%
and still stuck in their stuff,
there was a time where you had

00:29:53.440 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:84%
to learn self-love,
self-forgiveness, gratitude.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.200 align:middle line:84%
There would have
been tools that you

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.420 align:middle line:84%
needed to learn
around mindfulness

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and around reshaping and putting
a new perspective to how you

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.910 align:middle line:84%
were thinking, the relationship
you had with your subconscious,

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:17.300 align:middle line:84%
how you started to become
more aware of the thinking

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.880 align:middle line:90%
and what it created for you.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:25.800 align:middle line:84%
So what-- what kind of
tools and healing processes?

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.370 align:middle line:90%
Because they're very different.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:30.660 align:middle line:84%
There's one, as you talk
about, the heart-centeredness.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:33.540 align:middle line:84%
One is to start healing
that part of yourself, which

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.070 align:middle line:84%
is learning how
to love yourself,

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.980 align:middle line:84%
learning to forgive
yourself, learning

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.360 align:middle line:90%
that you're not to blame.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And that as much as you are
absolutely responsible for,

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:45.210 align:middle line:84%
if you continue
to blame yourself,

00:30:45.210 --> 00:30:46.940 align:middle line:84%
well, you continue
to be the victim.

00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:47.740 align:middle line:90%
>> That's it.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:48.720 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.200 align:middle line:84%
>> So firstly, what sort of
things did you do to heal

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.290 align:middle line:84%
the emotional side, the
heart part of you that was

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:56.280 align:middle line:90%
so damaged?

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:58.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to
take it a step back.

00:30:58.530 --> 00:31:01.380 align:middle line:84%
I think sometimes you've
got to look at the places

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:05.370 align:middle line:84%
that you resist going, because
your greatest growth is there.

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.070 align:middle line:84%
So the girl that was
coaching me at the time,

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:11.790 align:middle line:84%
she used to say to me, you
put your son in the tent.

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:13.350 align:middle line:90%
And I used to say, no I didn't.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:14.610 align:middle line:90%
I told you about my husband.

00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:15.883 align:middle line:90%
I told you about my business.

00:31:15.883 --> 00:31:17.550 align:middle line:84%
I told you about the
situation I was in.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.800 align:middle line:90%
I didn't put-- like, hello?

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Did you not get the
situation I was in?

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.410 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't realize
I was in blame.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I was going, that
happened to me.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.772 align:middle line:90%
And look what I ended up in.

00:31:25.772 --> 00:31:27.480 align:middle line:84%
And so she would try
and coach me a week.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.990 align:middle line:90%
And I would not take that.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.790 align:middle line:90%
I would not--

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.150 align:middle line:90%
I did not put my son in a tent.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:35.200 align:middle line:84%
And that went on for
about nearly a year.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And then one day I woke up
and went, hang on a second.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:39.360 align:middle line:90%
I made the call.

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.890 align:middle line:90%
I got the tent.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.090 align:middle line:90%
I set the tent up.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.540 align:middle line:90%
I put my son in the tent.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:47.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think the second that
you own the situation that you

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.920 align:middle line:84%
in, that-- that
you're in-- sorry--

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:51.600 align:middle line:90%
that you created that.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:55.290 align:middle line:84%
That's the most powerful
moment that you can have.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.570 align:middle line:90%
Because it says, I did it.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.585 align:middle line:84%
So if you did that,
what else can you do?

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:01.960 align:middle line:84%
So I knew there
was a few things.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I had a heart that was broken,
and in many, many pieces,

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:11.370 align:middle line:84%
that didn't believe that I could
create a great life for myself.

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:12.510 align:middle line:90%
So I needed counseling.

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:13.720 align:middle line:90%
And one of the--

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.960 align:middle line:84%
psychology and I've actually,
because I was sexually

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.425 align:middle line:84%
abused as a child, I'd had
about 20 years of counseling.

00:32:19.425 --> 00:32:20.550 align:middle line:90%
But I just had more trauma.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'd go back to the counselor
going, now I've got this.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:23.390 align:middle line:90%
Now I've got this.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:24.295 align:middle line:90%
Now I've got this.

00:32:24.295 --> 00:32:25.920 align:middle line:84%
So the thing is, I
wanted to understand

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.045 align:middle line:90%
how I ended up in the tent.

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So I actually did therapy
called Adlerian therapy.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.420 align:middle line:90%
It's not--

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.650 align:middle line:90%
>> What was it called?

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:32.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Adlerian therapy.

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:35.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's based around the
time of Jung and Freud.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.410 align:middle line:84%
Adler, Jung, and Freud were
around the same period.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Adlerian therapy is
not very big here.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.240 align:middle line:84%
But the similar type of
therapy is cognitive therapy.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.440 align:middle line:84%
So it's, how have I
created the beliefs that

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.830 align:middle line:90%
have given me this life?

00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.725 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most
powerful beliefs I had--

00:32:50.725 --> 00:32:51.600 align:middle line:90%
and it's interesting.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Because the one thing
I like about Adler

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.940 align:middle line:84%
is he has a-- he talks
about a compass, that

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.430 align:middle line:84%
between the ages
of 5 and 8, that's

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.890 align:middle line:84%
when you're most susceptible
to your belief system that

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.660 align:middle line:90%
then guides you for life.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, a five, six,
seven, eight-year-old,

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.513 align:middle line:84%
they can't run the ship
when you're an adult,

00:33:07.513 --> 00:33:09.180 align:middle line:84%
because they're not
qualified to run it.

00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.370 align:middle line:84%
But your beliefs, if
they're not healed,

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.320 align:middle line:84%
run the ship when
you're an adult.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.940 align:middle line:84%
So one of the most
powerful beliefs I

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.010 align:middle line:84%
had came for me in an experience
I had when I was much,

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:18.900 align:middle line:90%
much younger.

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.870 align:middle line:84%
So this is all the
healing the heart stuff.

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:24.158 align:middle line:84%
So when I was eight
years old my mom left.

00:33:24.158 --> 00:33:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know if
she was dead or alive.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was not allowed to mention
her, bring her up, or see her

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.850 align:middle line:90%
for 10 years.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:31.770 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know if she
was dead or alive.

00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:34.470 align:middle line:90%
So I decided to find my mom.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:39.720 align:middle line:84%
But that first year that she
left, for about six months

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.310 align:middle line:90%
she was staying not far from me.

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.970 align:middle line:84%
And I was supposed to have
violin lessons at nighttime.

00:33:44.970 --> 00:33:48.930 align:middle line:84%
I used to skip my violin lessons
and sneak out and see my mom.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.188 align:middle line:84%
Now, my stepmom and dad
found out that I did that.

00:33:51.188 --> 00:33:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And they said, if you
do that again, you're

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.220 align:middle line:90%
going into foster care.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So the second that I
had that experience,

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.230 align:middle line:84%
I created a subconscious
belief, so a belief

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.520 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not aware
of that says, if I

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.490 align:middle line:84%
do anything that makes me happy,
terrible things will happen.

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:07.500 align:middle line:90%
And then I created disaster--

00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:10.210 align:middle line:84%
disaster after that, to
make sure that nothing bad

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:11.010 align:middle line:90%
would happen to me.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.260 align:middle line:84%
Because if I was happy,
something-- my whole--

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.500 align:middle line:90%
I'd lose my family, because--

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:15.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.800 align:middle line:84%
What you're talking
about right now,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:19.130 align:middle line:84%
we've just spoken to
Dr. Demartini about.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:22.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's exactly what
he was talking about.

00:34:22.390 --> 00:34:23.190 align:middle line:90%
So it's amazing.

00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:23.990 align:middle line:90%
Carry on.

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:25.199 align:middle line:90%
It's exactly the same.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So this trauma, I carried
this trauma with me throughout

00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:30.639 align:middle line:90%
my entire life.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:34.420 align:middle line:84%
So any time I was in an
experience that was really fun,

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:35.617 align:middle line:90%
I would shut it down.

00:34:35.617 --> 00:34:37.659 align:middle line:84%
So I would go up the hill
skiing with my friends.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:39.179 align:middle line:84%
And I'd start to
go, I'm having fun.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:40.350 align:middle line:90%
I would go straight to work.

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.389 align:middle line:84%
And it was like I was
on autopilot, just

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:44.280 align:middle line:84%
hitting that button,
going straight

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:45.300 align:middle line:90%
back, stopping that fun.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.758 align:middle line:84%
I would ruin any
good relationship.

00:34:46.758 --> 00:34:49.290 align:middle line:84%
If I was totally in love with
a man, having an amazing time,

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:50.165 align:middle line:90%
I would just stop it.

00:34:50.165 --> 00:34:51.179 align:middle line:90%
I'd leave.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:54.840 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't realize
that it was my survival--

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.120 align:middle line:84%
subconscious of survival
kicking in and saying,

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.730 align:middle line:84%
you know, something
really bad's going

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:00.420 align:middle line:90%
to happen if you enjoy yourself.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.270 align:middle line:84%
So when we discovered
that point,

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:06.240 align:middle line:84%
that experience of
when my mom left

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:07.973 align:middle line:84%
was so devastating
for me, because I

00:35:07.973 --> 00:35:09.140 align:middle line:90%
didn't see her for 10 years.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:10.682 align:middle line:84%
Didn't know if she
was dead or alive.

00:35:10.682 --> 00:35:13.140 align:middle line:84%
But that sneaking out meant
if my parents found out,

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.360 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
excommunicated from my family.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So in that moment I
make the belief system

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.210 align:middle line:84%
that if I'm happy, terrible
things will happen.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:23.790 align:middle line:84%
When we changed that,
it was so weird.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I can remember
the moment it changed.

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:30.870 align:middle line:84%
My Adlerian counselor had
me stick up sticky notes

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.280 align:middle line:84%
all around my house that
said, if someone suggests

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.530 align:middle line:90%
something fun, you must do it.

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.600 align:middle line:90%
Because I would stop the fun.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And I had them up for about
four months-- like, seriously,

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.050 align:middle line:90%
thousands of them.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:41.760 align:middle line:84%
If someone suggests something
fun, you must do it.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.468 align:middle line:84%
And I can remember
the moment it changed.

00:35:43.468 --> 00:35:45.540 align:middle line:84%
Like, I had this
light bulb moment

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.490 align:middle line:90%
that changed that for me.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.390 align:middle line:84%
So somebody calls up,
a girlfriend of mine,

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:51.223 align:middle line:84%
and she said, we're
going to the lake today.

00:35:51.223 --> 00:35:52.680 align:middle line:90%
And I was working, of course.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.300 align:middle line:84%
And she said, why
don't you come?

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And I went-- and I could-- and
out of the corner of my eye,

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.320 align:middle line:90%
I saw the sticky note.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel this
fight inside going,

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.200 align:middle line:90%
no, no, yes, no, yes, no, no.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.070 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:36:03.070 --> 00:36:03.870 align:middle line:90%
I can't.

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Like, this, like a battle
about going to the lake.

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.850 align:middle line:90%
So finally I look at the--

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.260 align:middle line:84%
I look at the note, and I
go, I'll come for 10 minutes.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.950 align:middle line:90%
Now see, that's a turning point.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.440 align:middle line:84%
So I did go to the lake,
and I went for three hours.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.630 align:middle line:90%
And I sort of never looked back.

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:21.540 align:middle line:84%
So I kept going to Adler, and
I went to psychology and stuff

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.930 align:middle line:84%
to heal those deep
wounds of rejection

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:27.450 align:middle line:90%
and not belonging in my heart.

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:28.630 align:middle line:90%
And it is interesting.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.880 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes I'll put
myself in those situations,

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:33.030 align:middle line:84%
but I can read it
in two seconds now.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.630 align:middle line:90%
So that's the heartfelt stuff.

00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So you've got to
heal the heart first.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.360 align:middle line:84%
You've got to change
that compass first,

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.630 align:middle line:84%
because they're the deep, the
deepest, deepest core beliefs.

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:44.910 align:middle line:90%
That's your compass for life.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.590 align:middle line:84%
If that's off, your
whole life's off.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.120 align:middle line:90%
So you've got to fix this first.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.670 align:middle line:84%
But then like a true
athlete and champion,

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:52.950 align:middle line:84%
if you then wanted to
create that in your life

00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:54.720 align:middle line:84%
and make a go of it
and create success,

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.730 align:middle line:90%
you've got to practice daily.

00:36:56.730 --> 00:37:00.930 align:middle line:84%
So your daily practices-- my
daily practices are meditation.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.363 align:middle line:84%
My daily practices
are saying out loud

00:37:03.363 --> 00:37:04.530 align:middle line:90%
the things I'm grateful for.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:07.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm grateful for my health,
for my beautiful son,

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:09.840 align:middle line:84%
for my amazing mom, for the
choices I have-- the "I am"

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.010 align:middle line:90%
statements.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.650 align:middle line:84%
I say things like, I'm the
best mother in the world.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm the happiest person I know.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.660 align:middle line:84%
And the funniest
thing is I say, I'm

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:17.910 align:middle line:90%
the best coach in the world.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.260 align:middle line:84%
My clients call and
go, we know you're

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:19.980 align:middle line:90%
the best coach in the world.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.530 align:middle line:90%
I'm like, they're hearing me.

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And so I do these practices
and strategic questions.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll ask myself what
one decision could

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:30.240 align:middle line:84%
I make today that will make a
massive difference to my life

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.210 align:middle line:90%
or to my business?

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:32.010 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.710 align:middle line:84%
Every time you ask that, it
makes a massive difference.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.170 align:middle line:90%
So I look at life now as a game.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:42.090 align:middle line:84%
What move can I make to
create that actual result?

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:44.657 align:middle line:84%
And win, lose, or
draw, let's play again.

00:37:44.657 --> 00:37:45.990 align:middle line:90%
Like, I don't take it seriously.

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:47.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's play again.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.420 align:middle line:90%
Let's play again.

00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.760 align:middle line:90%
The end result is my truth.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.700 align:middle line:84%
My destiny is to
expand and to become

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.010 align:middle line:90%
all of who I'm meant to be.

00:37:56.010 --> 00:37:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And in that journey, I'm to
touch as many lives as I can,

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.010 align:middle line:84%
and light that inner
light for them,

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:04.560 align:middle line:84%
and to share everything
that I can so that they

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.180 align:middle line:90%
can light their own path.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Because that changes
consciousness on the planet.

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:10.500 align:middle line:84%
That changes the
way we see things.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.970 align:middle line:84%
That changes the way
we deal with each other

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:14.550 align:middle line:90%
and how we show up.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:15.510 align:middle line:90%
And I think--

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.670 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Brené Brown's got
a great book called,

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.540 align:middle line:90%
"Dare to be Vulnerable."

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.680 align:middle line:84%
And I think coming from that
place where you share honestly

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and truly who you are, from
a place of loving kindness,

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.860 align:middle line:84%
at the end of the day,
that is everything.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And then if you can
put these practices,

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:32.820 align:middle line:90%
you can actually start to join--

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:35.310 align:middle line:84%
like, spiritually--
head and heart together.

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:39.900 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually live a
very soulful, heart-centered,

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.370 align:middle line:90%
spiritual journey.

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:42.960 align:middle line:90%
And your path will open up.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, you're
on a path of opportunity.

00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:48.435 align:middle line:84%
Because you fix your
stuff, you can contribute.

00:38:48.435 --> 00:38:50.060 align:middle line:84%
You can make a
difference to the world.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:52.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
a place of grace.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:54.480 align:middle line:90%
You heal the heart.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:55.740 align:middle line:90%
You do the practices.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:58.260 align:middle line:84%
And you become all
of who you are.

00:38:58.260 --> 00:38:59.760 align:middle line:84%
And also, too,
you're not judgmental

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:01.260 align:middle line:90%
about the things in your life.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.010 align:middle line:84%
You're not judgemental
about other people.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:05.250 align:middle line:84%
You receive people as you
would receive yourself.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:08.070 align:middle line:84%
Like, I see every person
now as a child within.

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.592 align:middle line:84%
I see-- I tell my
clients I love them.

00:39:10.592 --> 00:39:13.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how often would you
think that someone in corporate

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:14.280 align:middle line:90%
would say, I love you--

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.530 align:middle line:90%
the HR manager-- I love you.

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:16.780 align:middle line:90%
They're not going to say that.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.710 align:middle line:84%
But if you actually do feel
that, why wouldn't you say it?

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And would you not say it
because you feel uncomfortable?

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>> So two very last questions.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.200 align:middle line:84%
To anybody out there who is
in a position of depression

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.880 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety or stress
that you were,

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.430 align:middle line:84%
what would be one
thing that you would

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.610 align:middle line:84%
have wanted to have heard
from another tell you

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.532 align:middle line:90%
when you were there?

00:39:44.532 --> 00:39:47.050 align:middle line:90%
>> That you can do anything.

00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:48.850 align:middle line:90%
That you can do anything.

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:51.430 align:middle line:84%
But there's no such thing
as a quick-fix pill.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:53.680 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to do something
and make a difference,

00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.200 align:middle line:84%
get all the help in the
world that's around you.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But take that one step every
day and watch your progress.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.120 align:middle line:90%
Like, go, you know what?

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.350 align:middle line:90%
I took a step today.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.240 align:middle line:90%
I feel 1% better.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.530 align:middle line:90%
I'll take a step tomorrow.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.960 align:middle line:84%
People are after
a quick-fix pill.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.380 align:middle line:90%
Life is a journey.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily
about destination.

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.300 align:middle line:84%
It's about all the little gems
that you gather on the journey.

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.430 align:middle line:84%
It's about this moment
right here, right now.

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Like, if I-- god forbid--
but if anything happens to me

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:22.190 align:middle line:84%
after this, I'm happy
that I shared this,

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.160 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to
give to other people.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.830 align:middle line:84%
Like, if game all over,
the only thing I'll regret

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:29.920 align:middle line:84%
is not seeing my child
grow up, but nothing else.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.870 align:middle line:84%
I won't have any other
regrets, because I'm

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:33.970 align:middle line:90%
living from this space.

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:36.070 align:middle line:90%
You can do it.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:38.050 align:middle line:90%
Do it every single day.

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Do a tiny little bit
every single day.

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And gather people around
you who support you,

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:45.260 align:middle line:84%
who can give you a tiny bit
of advice as you need it.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.260 align:middle line:84%
Because often, when you're
in those dark places,

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.655 align:middle line:90%
you can't take much on.

00:40:48.655 --> 00:40:50.780 align:middle line:84%
You just need one little
piece of advice that goes,

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:51.430 align:middle line:90%
you can do it.

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:52.230 align:middle line:90%
I did it.

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:53.710 align:middle line:90%
You can.

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:57.040 align:middle line:84%
>> What is your one "I
am" statement that you say

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.920 align:middle line:90%
to yourself every day?

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.910 align:middle line:84%
>> I am the most love that
I can be in every moment.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.720 align:middle line:84%
Rhiannon, thank you so
much for joining us.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.700 align:middle line:90%
That was amazing.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:12.580 align:middle line:84%
You have been an
inspiration to everybody

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.440 align:middle line:90%
who watches and listens.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And you are going to
touch their lives.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.320 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much.

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:25.000 align:middle line:90%
