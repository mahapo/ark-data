00:00:06.357 --> 00:00:14.200 align:middle line:90%


00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Petrea, a very warm welcome.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.950 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a real pleasure, Jo.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:19.750 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.155 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, Petrea, you are the
founder of Quest for Life

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:22.955 align:middle line:90%
Foundation.

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And I certainly want to
speak to you about the programs

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and the retreats that
you run out of Quest,

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.080 align:middle line:84%
but to start us off, could
you share with us part

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.700 align:middle line:84%
of your journey that has led
you to really come to understand

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.350 align:middle line:84%
the many aspects required in
order to work and deal with

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.910 align:middle line:84%
people in places of
emotional and mental illness?

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Hm.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, everyone's journey, of
course, is really individual.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big difference
between the bones of a person's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.150 align:middle line:84%
story and the flesh that
hangs off those bones.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's in the flesh that all
the emotions, and the fears,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:90%
and the anxieties often lie.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.990 align:middle line:84%
So I can rattle off the
bones really easily now,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.140 align:middle line:84%
having chewed on the flesh
a good deal over my life.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.400 align:middle line:84%
But I was born with
two older brothers,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.500 align:middle line:84%
and one of them, the one who
was 18 months older than I,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.650 align:middle line:84%
probably invented ADHD
20 years before anyone

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:90%
knew what that was.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.900 align:middle line:84%
And so he spent his childhood
falling off the roof,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:84%
breaking bones, cutting himself,
setting fire to the house,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.740 align:middle line:84%
putting porridge on
his head every morning.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And so growing up
just after him,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.090 align:middle line:84%
I did my very best to be
as invisible as possible.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I was seven,
I had an experience

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.050 align:middle line:84%
where I was just simply running
around the side of our house

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:84%
with my pet dog when the
whole physical world became

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:90%
completely insubstantial.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.570 align:middle line:84%
And there was something that
was the unifying principle,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.430 align:middle line:90%
or light.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.580 align:middle line:84%
Or love that
enlivened everything.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.699 align:middle line:84%
And yet I found it quite
confusing as a seven-year-old,

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.980 align:middle line:84%
because I didn't have any
language to talk about it.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And so that remained as a
very private experience for me

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.220 align:middle line:90%
for a very long time.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Before we were both
10, Brendan told me

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.910 align:middle line:84%
that he knew he had to kill
himself by the time he was 30,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.290 align:middle line:84%
and I took that on
as my responsibility.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:90%
That's why I'm alive.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to keep Brendan safe.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that was a
mighty and unreasonable thing

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:90%
for a little person to take on.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
But I felt very deeply, I
have to grow up really quickly

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:90%
so I can look after Brendan.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, I grew 23
centimeters in the next year,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.850 align:middle line:84%
and that deranged the
bone growth in my legs,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and my knees swiveled in,
and started dislocating,

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.440 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't walk.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So I left school when I was
13 and went into hospital,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.810 align:middle line:90%
virtually for three years.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I had three months in hospital,
a month out, three months in,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.790 align:middle line:90%
a month out.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And they told me I'd
never walk again.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And I finally taught
myself to walk again,

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.680 align:middle line:84%
which was quite a challenge
in itself, because I used

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.370 align:middle line:84%
to unhook these weights
in between nurses' shifts

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.150 align:middle line:84%
at night, and get out of bed,
and take my weight on my arms,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:90%
because my--

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.100 align:middle line:84%
I'd been in traction
for nine months,

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't have any
muscles in my legs.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And Brendan was already
experiencing depression

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.410 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.010 align:middle line:84%
And so for me, being
in hospital was great,

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:90%
because I was away from Brendan.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.240 align:middle line:84%
It also got me out
of school, and I

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.680 align:middle line:84%
wasn't really interested in
what they were teaching me

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.480 align:middle line:90%
at school.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And it also got me
out of having to be

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.060 align:middle line:84%
a teenager, because I felt like
I didn't know how to grow up.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
Brendan was just ahead of
me, making a mess of it.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And so dealing
with physical pain

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.260 align:middle line:84%
was something that
I found much easier

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.890 align:middle line:84%
than dealing with the
emotional difficulties.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think from that earlier
experience when I was seven

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.490 align:middle line:84%
and then I had a lot
of pain, obviously.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.350 align:middle line:84%
I developed a split
reality, where

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.720 align:middle line:84%
I was someone very
privately to myself.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:84%
And then there was the me
that I kept highly polished

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.070 align:middle line:90%
for everybody else.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was in calipers
and crutches for years.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.950 align:middle line:84%
And of course, everyone says,
oh, isn't she marvelous?

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.740 align:middle line:84%
She's such an inspiration,
getting around

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.820 align:middle line:90%
in her little calipers.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't really
give you any space

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:84%
to be anything
different from that.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And so that lonesome little girl
was very tender and ignored,

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.990 align:middle line:84%
really, by the world, and
I was at pains not to draw

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.930 align:middle line:90%
any attention to her at all.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.850 align:middle line:90%
I got finally out of hospital.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I went into nursing, which
wasn't very sensible after 12

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.110 align:middle line:90%
major surgeries to my legs.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.010 align:middle line:84%
And I jiggered my back
lifting a patient.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.840 align:middle line:84%
And while I was in
a back brace, then

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I was raped in a house
that was full of people.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And I was lying down
in one of the bedrooms,

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.970 align:middle line:84%
and I just didn't have
a voice to call out.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:13.930 align:middle line:90%
And again, it was--

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.486 align:middle line:84%
I was so used to splitting
off and going elsewhere,

00:05:17.486 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:84%
that that's what I
did on that occasion.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:90%
Brendan was attempting suicide.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:90%
I got into drugs.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.450 align:middle line:90%
We lived overseas.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.020 align:middle line:90%
I was crippled with arthritis.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I used to walk with
walking sticks.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.060 align:middle line:90%
I changed my diet.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I learned to meditate
when I was 17,

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:84%
and that's been a great
blessing in my life ever since.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.760 align:middle line:84%
I married some very
strange people.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.590 align:middle line:90%
I had two gorgeous children.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.930 align:middle line:84%
Brendan did finally
succeed in taking

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.540 align:middle line:84%
his own life in Kathmandu after
many attempts and many times

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.140 align:middle line:84%
of getting him to the
hospital or stopping

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:56.660 align:middle line:90%
whatever was happening for him.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.340 align:middle line:84%
Then I moved to America with my
husband and two small children,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
and we'd only been
there four weeks

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.518 align:middle line:84%
when I thought he'd
gone for a long walk,

00:06:03.518 --> 00:06:07.420 align:middle line:84%
but he'd gone back to
Australia, and with the money,

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.970 align:middle line:84%
and left me in a small geodesic
dome in a meditation community

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.530 align:middle line:90%
with two small children.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And just after that,
I was diagnosed

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:90%
with acute myeloid leukemia.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was relieved, because I
felt like, this was too hard.

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.400 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how
to do a good life.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I can do a
good death, but be

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.300 align:middle line:84%
blowed if I know how
to do a good life.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I was diagnosed,
I was told that I

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.480 align:middle line:90%
had three months to live.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:43.700 align:middle line:84%
And it's a longer story, but
I came back to Australia.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.640 align:middle line:84%
My children went to
live with their father.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.730 align:middle line:84%
I moved in with my parents,
who took care of me

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:90%
during that time.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
And then it was my daughter who
came and sat on my bed one day,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:57.550 align:middle line:90%
and said, "Mum, you're sick.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:84%
If you need to
meditate to get well,

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I think you should
go back to America."

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And so that's what
I ultimately did.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:10.010 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I ended up in
a monastery outside of Assisi

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:13.280 align:middle line:84%
in Italy in the
little cave where

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.160 align:middle line:90%
St. Francis used to retreat to.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And I spent several
months in that little cave

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.090 align:middle line:84%
meditating, and weeping,
and meditating, and weeping,

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.450 align:middle line:84%
because in our family,
no matter what happened,

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.520 align:middle line:84%
we never talked about our
feelings, and we never cried.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't remember ever crying
before I was in that cave,

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and that's where my
whole life came unstuck.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.657 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd like to
say that was the end

00:07:44.657 --> 00:07:45.740 align:middle line:90%
of the bones of the story.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
There's been plenty
more since then.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Unexpected, unthinkable,
unimaginable things

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.780 align:middle line:84%
happen on a regular
basis, but that's just

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.150 align:middle line:90%
the nature of being human.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:03.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So in amongst all of the
adversity and the trauma that

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.820 align:middle line:84%
your own life has experienced,
you've also become

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:84%
a naturopath, a herbalist,
a teacher of meditation.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.990 align:middle line:84%
You've written eight
bestsellers, probably one--

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.230 align:middle line:84%
the most well-known and the one
I love the most is "Your Life

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.550 align:middle line:90%
Matters."

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And I guess when you say after
your diagnosis with leukemia

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and you went to a
cave to meditate,

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:40.309 align:middle line:84%
was that the process of
you healing from leukemia?

00:08:40.309 --> 00:08:43.100 align:middle line:84%
Or did you go through
other forms of treatment

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.010 align:middle line:84%
at the same time in
conjunction with--

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:46.780 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.710 align:middle line:84%
When I was diagnosed,
I was told that there

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.560 align:middle line:84%
was no treatment
that would give me

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.220 align:middle line:84%
either a remission or a
cure, but that would probably

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.470 align:middle line:90%
extend my life by a few weeks.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:05.120 align:middle line:84%
And given that I was still
grief-stricken and pretty

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.050 align:middle line:84%
depressed at the time,
I felt that I'd rather

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:84%
die having the reality of
my own experience untainted

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:20.330 align:middle line:84%
by feeling sick from drugs,
having done many of them

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:90%
myself in the past.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.450 align:middle line:84%
And also, I'd become
a vegetarian at 17.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.320 align:middle line:90%
I'd learned to meditate at 17.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.500 align:middle line:84%
I'd become a herbalist, and
naturopath, and yoga meditation

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.300 align:middle line:90%
teacher.

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
All of those things, really,
to help me find my own health

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:90%
and regain my own health.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the first
night I came up from the cave.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the old priest that
was there looked after me,

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.578 align:middle line:84%
and he'd kind of dragged
me up the stairs,

00:09:51.578 --> 00:09:53.120 align:middle line:84%
because I think he
was a bit worried.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:84%
He had this pale divorced
Anglican holed up

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.970 align:middle line:84%
in his little Catholic cave,
and that if I died in there,

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:90%
it would be very bad for--

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:01.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Not a good look.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.330 align:middle line:90%
>> --for business.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.240 align:middle line:84%
And so he prepared
a meal for me.

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:07.760 align:middle line:84%
And on the plate,
there was meat,

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.880 align:middle line:84%
and I hadn't eaten
meat for 15 years.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.590 align:middle line:84%
There was a big
chunk of white bread.

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And as a natural path,
I'd been telling everyone

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.690 align:middle line:84%
for years, the whiter the
bread, the sooner you're dead.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:90%
There was a goblet of wine.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:22.250 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't drank alcohol, tea,
coffee, nothing for 15 years.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:26.630 align:middle line:84%
So it was like my whole
belief system on the platter,

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:32.480 align:middle line:84%
and I realized that I
know zip about anything.

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.050 align:middle line:84%
And for all my studying,
for all my research,

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.950 align:middle line:84%
for all my qualifications
or whatever,

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:40.720 align:middle line:90%
I know zip about anything.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that for
me, it was far more healing

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:47.290 align:middle line:84%
to be grateful for what had
been lovingly prepared for me

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.750 align:middle line:84%
rather than to say,
my belief system says

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I can't have what you've
lovingly prepared for me,

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:90%
because I have to do it my way.

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:02.110 align:middle line:84%
And my way was a very
rigid, challenging--

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:84%
I always set very high
standards for myself

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:09.730 align:middle line:84%
and was pretty uncompassionate,
unkind to myself.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So it was a major
turning point for me,

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.930 align:middle line:84%
one of many, many
turning points.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think there was
any one experience that

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.330 align:middle line:90%
was profoundly healing.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I think there were a
whole lot of realizations.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And I absolutely thought
that I would die of leukemia,

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and I just wanted to
find peace before I died.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And so how long were
you in Italy in the caves?

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:41.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not exactly sure, but I
think I was about seven months.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just about to
return there, which will

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.880 align:middle line:90%
be really lovely, next week.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.990 align:middle line:84%
So that will be very special
to go back to the cave.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:84%
It was the Grotto of St. Francis
in a monastery just outside

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.260 align:middle line:90%
of Assisi.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> I recall the beautiful and
wonderful late Wayne Dyer speak

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:09.490 align:middle line:84%
often and the very healing
energy of that whole area.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:18.670 align:middle line:84%
>> So from Italy, you
returned to Australia?

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.740 align:middle line:84%
After a while, I found a great
deal of peace in the cave.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And I just wanted to
be with my children.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:35.020 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to have that peace in
my relationships, in my family.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And so I returned to Australia,
and I had more blood tests.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.280 align:middle line:84%
And the doctors said, well,
I was now in a remission,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.170 align:middle line:84%
but it was an
unexpected remission,

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.000 align:middle line:90%
and it wouldn't last.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:84%
And they said, maybe a few
days, maybe a few weeks.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And I actually found that
a lot more challenging,

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.880 align:middle line:84%
because when you know
you're going to die,

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:58.900 align:middle line:84%
there are things that you need
to say, and do, and organize.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And I had said, and done,
and organized them all.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd given my children
away to their father,

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:07.210 align:middle line:84%
I prepared my will,
and my funeral,

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:84%
and wrote letters for the
children for the future,

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:13.930 align:middle line:84%
and I had my whole
life all packed up

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:16.900 align:middle line:84%
in this little suitcase,
all ready for the big trip,

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.400 align:middle line:90%
and then the plane got canceled.

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was faced
with, well, how much

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.390 align:middle line:90%
do you unpack the suitcase?

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:26.770 align:middle line:84%
How much do you live as if
you're really going to be here?

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.150 align:middle line:84%
And it took me a while
to realize, of course,

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:84%
that everybody lives
with a tremendous amount

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.520 align:middle line:90%
of precariousness in their life.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:38.560 align:middle line:84%
They just don't know they do,
and that certainly I know.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
And I suspect a
lot of our viewers

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.230 align:middle line:84%
know that life can [SNAPS]
change in a moment,

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.860 align:middle line:90%
and it's never the same again.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't know that,
it does take you by surprise

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.490 align:middle line:90%
when it happens.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And I realize that
living with uncertainty

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
was the state of
just being human.

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And so I went into general
naturopathic practice

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.630 align:middle line:84%
a little bit reluctantly,
because I wasn't sure

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.970 align:middle line:84%
that I wanted to
be a naturopath.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:84%
But within the first two
weeks, the first woman

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.630 align:middle line:90%
with breast cancer came in.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And the day after, the first
person with AIDS came in,

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.430 align:middle line:84%
and both of them
had been told they

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't see Christmas,
which is what

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.690 align:middle line:90%
I'd been told 15 months before.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And so I felt like
I'd met my people,

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.830 align:middle line:84%
fellow travelers in the transit
lounge of their own life.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And my question to
people has always

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:84%
been, what is it that stands in
the way of you being at peace?

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, that was, I'm
not at peace with myself,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.510 align:middle line:84%
I'm not at peace
with my history.

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:45.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't love myself, I
don't know why I'm alive.

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:47.010 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I know I'm
here for something.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:48.330 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what it is.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.300 align:middle line:90%
My relationships are in tatters.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So those conversations
got ever deeper.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And then I began to see
that some of those people

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:05.040 align:middle line:84%
didn't die on time if they were
given a frame, because doctors

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
only work in three
to six, six to 12.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.230 align:middle line:84%
It's always quarterly
installments.

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.320 align:middle line:84%
I've never met anyone
given five to seven,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.140 align:middle line:84%
because they're talking about
a statistical group of people.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:84%
They're not talking
about as an individual.

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:22.170 align:middle line:84%
And so many of these
people, I began

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.020 align:middle line:84%
to see far outlive their
doctors' expectations.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.570 align:middle line:84%
And some of them are
still alive now when

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:33.040 align:middle line:84%
they were given three months
to live 25 or more years ago.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:84%
But to me, it's not
about not dying.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:39.750 align:middle line:84%
It's about coming
alive and being alive.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:44.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not about, do
anything say you won't die.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:49.160 align:middle line:84%
It's do whatever so that you
really come alive and live.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:57.510 align:middle line:84%
Which is a beautiful
way for me to ask you,

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:02.580 align:middle line:84%
in the experience of
everything that your life has

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:06.600 align:middle line:84%
had so far, the adversity, the
physical, mental, emotional

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:12.750 align:middle line:84%
trauma, it's
obviously, to sum up

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.050 align:middle line:84%
in such a short period of
time, very difficult to do.

00:16:16.050 --> 00:16:21.750 align:middle line:84%
But you have learned without
doubt some key fundamental

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.090 align:middle line:84%
living principles and
living philosophies

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:84%
that are both physical,
mental, and emotional,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.590 align:middle line:84%
which now underpin the
programs and the retreats

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.860 align:middle line:84%
that Quest for Life
Foundation offer.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.850 align:middle line:84%
So can I just get a
clearer understanding

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:42.270 align:middle line:84%
of what you've
come to understand

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:84%
as being the key
qualities that we

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:49.140 align:middle line:84%
need to embrace on
our healing journey,

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
so that regardless of
what our challenges,

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:56.130 align:middle line:84%
whether it's physical, mental,
emotional, that they are--

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:59.010 align:middle line:84%
from what I'm hearing, there are
some really fundamental things

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:00.630 align:middle line:90%
that we have to work with.

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:02.670 align:middle line:84%
Can you share a little
bit more what they are?

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a great place
that you get to where you say,

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:06.960 align:middle line:90%
that's it.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.410 align:middle line:84%
Something has to
change, and it's me.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:14.859 align:middle line:84%
I can't change the outer
circumstance of my life.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.130 align:middle line:84%
We call them the
Ds, that we might

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:21.990 align:middle line:84%
hit a drama, a disappointment, a
disaster, a diagnosis, a death,

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:26.329 align:middle line:84%
a divorce, a disfigurement, a
disability, a debt, a drought,

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:28.050 align:middle line:90%
a downpour, a downturn.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:90%
It's lots of Ds.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:90%
>> The endless Ds.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.210 align:middle line:90%
>> The endless Ds.

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you hit
this D, everything

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:36.400 align:middle line:84%
that's second nature
to you doesn't work.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.660 align:middle line:84%
It might be second nature
to isolate yourself,

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
to go into an old pattern
of I do it myself.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:45.780 align:middle line:84%
It might be second nature to
you to not sleep, or sleep

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.110 align:middle line:84%
all the time, or not
eat, or eat all the time.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
It might be second nature
to you to blame other people

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.800 align:middle line:90%
for your unhappiness.

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:57.630 align:middle line:84%
But this D, whatever it
is, demands more from you

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:59.910 align:middle line:90%
than you've ever had to draw on.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And you get to that great
place where you say, that's it.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.750 align:middle line:84%
Something's got to
change, and it's me.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
that we say, oh,

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.350 align:middle line:84%
it's second nature for
me to think like this,

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:90%
feel like this, react like this.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.780 align:middle line:84%
And we never question, well,
what's your first nature?

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.180 align:middle line:84%
What's your essential
nature before you

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:84%
took on the anxieties, the
limitations, the fears,

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.210 align:middle line:90%
the beliefs about yourself?

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And so when you hit that place,
and you want to be different,

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:34.840 align:middle line:84%
then the whole universe
conspires to bring it about,

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.780 align:middle line:84%
and you begin to find
the stepping stones.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And we find that there are
four particular qualities that

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.410 align:middle line:84%
are universal in
people who attain

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:49.030 align:middle line:84%
so-called spontaneous
remissions, people who

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:51.250 align:middle line:84%
have been through
extraordinary grief

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.990 align:middle line:84%
and then find peace, people
who have every reason

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:00.280 align:middle line:84%
to feel embittered, and
grumpy, and resentful,

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.150 align:middle line:84%
and who find a part
of themselves that

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.940 align:middle line:90%
is beyond the pain.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:90%
And we call them the four Cs.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:12.580 align:middle line:84%
So the first is, we
need to regain control

00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:15.700 align:middle line:90%
over our response to life.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:19.210 align:middle line:84%
So the first C is the
difference between a reaction

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:90%
and a response.

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.510 align:middle line:84%
A reaction is literally a
reactivation of a pattern

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:27.580 align:middle line:84%
that we've used before
that we use again

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.630 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And if we keep
reacting to life, we

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.660 align:middle line:84%
keep assuring ourselves
that our future will

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:37.420 align:middle line:90%
be a reflection of our past.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And a reaction is
actually felt in the body.

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.250 align:middle line:84%
So we know it on an
epigenetic level.

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:47.350 align:middle line:84%
If you continue to provide the
same chemistry within your body

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:84%
over and over again, why
would anything change?

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.410 align:middle line:84%
A response takes you
into new territory.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So we may need to weep
about it, rail about it,

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.440 align:middle line:84%
scream about it, write about it,
talk about it until we can say,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.240 align:middle line:90%
yes.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.740 align:middle line:84%
That did happen, and
it happened to me.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And given that I'm a woman
in this circumstance,

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.810 align:middle line:84%
what's an appropriate
response, not a reaction?

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:13.350 align:middle line:84%
A reaction is when we feel a
victim of our circumstance.

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:17.780 align:middle line:84%
A response is when we feel
empowered to make choices.

00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So what were some of the
very first tools that you would

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
teach somebody in order
to regain that control,

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.680 align:middle line:84%
in order to start to, rather
than react but to take more

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.460 align:middle line:84%
of a responsive, active,
participating role?

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in many different
ways, because firstly,

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:84%
you need to be aware of where
do you react in your own body?

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.180 align:middle line:84%
And it might be-- for
some, it's in the stomach.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:84%
For some, it's their heart
rate increases, their breathing

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.020 align:middle line:90%
changes.

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Their jaw might tense,
they might hold tension

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.680 align:middle line:90%
in their shoulders.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
So be aware of where you
reactivate in your own body.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as you become
aware of that reaction,

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:04.000 align:middle line:84%
stop and do whatever it takes
to bring yourself back to quiet.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.920 align:middle line:84%
So whether that's do
some deep breathing,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.800 align:middle line:84%
whether that's excusing
yourself from a circumstance

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.950 align:middle line:84%
until you feel more able to
respond and not just react.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:90%
It's also held in our language.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.320 align:middle line:84%
The language of
reaction contains words

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.690 align:middle line:84%
like I can't, I should,
try, but, never, if only,

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.730 align:middle line:90%
impossible, always.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:30.700 align:middle line:84%
That little group of
words, if we never

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:84%
let those words come out of our
mouth but with consciousness,

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.000 align:middle line:84%
we're home and
hosed, because those

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.650 align:middle line:84%
are the words that hooks
back in to the patterns that

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.780 align:middle line:90%
are second nature to us.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And so in order for
us to have awareness,

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.440 align:middle line:84%
we have to find ways
of quietening the mind.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And for some, that will be
meditation, or mindfulness,

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:59.320 align:middle line:84%
or Tai Chi, or being in nature,
listening to music, arranging

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:00.580 align:middle line:90%
flowers, whatever.

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a very individual
thing, but whatever

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
it is that reconnects you with
the stillness within yourself,

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:84%
that's your job to make sure
that happens on a daily basis.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm hearing there
is that step number one

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
to regaining control is about
coming back into the present

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:21.250 align:middle line:84%
moment grounding yourself,
becoming aware of your body,

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware of the
language that you're using,

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.760 align:middle line:84%
becoming aware of the senses
and the sensations that

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.180 align:middle line:90%
you're experiencing.

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.530 align:middle line:84%
And from there, we are stepping
into a place of mindfulness.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:33.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:36.130 align:middle line:84%
My most consistent
spiritual practice

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.975 align:middle line:84%
is simply to come to
my senses, and that's

00:22:38.975 --> 00:22:41.350 align:middle line:84%
what we say to people when
they're having a panic attack.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Come to your senses.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And we say that, because we
know that the body is always

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:48.100 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.960 align:middle line:84%
The mind's forever jumping
five seconds, weeks, months,

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.510 align:middle line:84%
years into the future,
five seconds, weeks,

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:90%
months, years into the past.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's the constant
practice of being

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.390 align:middle line:84%
aware of your weight, your
posture, how the chair supports

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.160 align:middle line:84%
your body, the touch
of your clothing,

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.620 align:middle line:84%
the air against your
skin, all of the sounds

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:08.530 align:middle line:84%
within and outside
of this space.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:11.290 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to have
a fully-fledged panic

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.360 align:middle line:90%
and do that at the same time.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And the more you do that, the
more the mind comes to rest.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And when mind is
at rest, you have

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:23.470 align:middle line:84%
access to your intuition,
creativity, wisdom, humor,

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:28.590 align:middle line:84%
spontaneity, all of those
qualities that we so value,

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:32.670 align:middle line:84%
especially if we're
dealing with a D.

00:23:32.670 --> 00:23:34.590 align:middle line:84%
So we want to have
access to that,

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
but we only have access to
that when the mind is quiet.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.980 align:middle line:90%
So what's our second C?

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Second C is a
commitment to living,

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and that recognizes that the
opposite of death is birth,

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:53.730 align:middle line:84%
not life, and that
consciousness is indestructible,

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:58.380 align:middle line:84%
that whether you think of it
as life, soul, energy, spirit,

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.780 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't really matter.

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But I've been with many,
many people when they die,

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:06.050 align:middle line:84%
and it's really obvious
that someone leaves.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:09.450 align:middle line:84%
So the second C is really about
being in right relationship

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:13.290 align:middle line:84%
to our physical, mental,
emotional aspects,

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:14.670 align:middle line:90%
that you're not your body.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:18.990 align:middle line:84%
You have a body, and you need
to nourish it appropriately.

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:22.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's a whole day's
lecture in itself, really,

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%
because human beings
have been eating

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.390 align:middle line:84%
slow food, seasonal,
local, organic, whole food

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:90%
for millennia.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:29.970 align:middle line:84%
It's only lately
that we've started

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:34.000 align:middle line:84%
interfering so dramatically
with our food supply.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:84%
So we need to nourish
our bodies appropriately.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.810 align:middle line:84%
We need to rest
them, because this

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.930 align:middle line:84%
is a bit of a culture
that soldiers on.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.080 align:middle line:84%
We need to exercise them,
because it's a whole system

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.080 align:middle line:90%
of pumps in our bodies.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And we need to know what fluffs
us up, what makes us feel good.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:90%
You're not your mind.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:58.410 align:middle line:84%
You have a mind,
and it's your job

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:02.040 align:middle line:84%
to quieten the mind so you
have access to those qualities

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:04.590 align:middle line:90%
that we were talking about.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's also your job to keep
your mind in good company.

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.290 align:middle line:90%
Don't hang out with turkeys.

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:11.460 align:middle line:90%
Be in good company.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.570 align:middle line:84%
Be with people, environments,
activities that uplift,

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:19.530 align:middle line:90%
inspire, and encourage you.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:20.880 align:middle line:90%
We're not our emotions.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:22.750 align:middle line:90%
We have feelings.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:26.310 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm hearing here is that
the second C around commitment

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:27.270 align:middle line:90%
is also--

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:30.300 align:middle line:84%
it includes taking
accountability

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.650 align:middle line:90%
for your choices--

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, absolutely.

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:36.460 align:middle line:84%
>> --not just committing
to the journey of healing,

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:84%
but taking responsibility,
and accounting--

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.900 align:middle line:84%
being accountable for the
choices that you're making

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.910 align:middle line:90%
along the process.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And a lot of people don't
recognize they have choice

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:90%
until they do.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the
great gift of suffering,

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.410 align:middle line:84%
is that it does get us
to a place of recognizing

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.560 align:middle line:84%
that a lot of things I
don't have choice about,

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:84%
but I do have choice about
how I'm going to embrace

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:08.380 align:middle line:90%
the challenge that I have.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:09.990 align:middle line:90%
And so I'm not my feelings.

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:11.030 align:middle line:90%
I have feelings.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:12.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's a big
difference between, this

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.670 align:middle line:84%
is how it feels to
be, portray a feeling,

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.920 align:middle line:90%
angry, that I am angry.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So we'd say watch,
out what you attach.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.950 align:middle line:90%
I am, too.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I am soul, spirit,
life, being, energy.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:28.170 align:middle line:90%
And right now, I feel angry.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:29.830 align:middle line:90%
It's not who I am.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.820 align:middle line:84%
It is what I am
feeling, and there

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.750 align:middle line:90%
is a big difference in that.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we unpack, of
course, all of these things

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:41.430 align:middle line:84%
in a lot more depth in
our retreats and so on.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's really
about, if we want

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.340 align:middle line:84%
to find peace, how do we
find the peace that passes

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.670 align:middle line:84%
all understanding, is to
anchor your sense of self

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:54.840 align:middle line:84%
in that which is beyond change,
because even if you live

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.080 align:middle line:84%
to 110, your body
will get saggy,

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.420 align:middle line:84%
and baggy, and wrinkly,
and gray, and bits

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.860 align:middle line:90%
will fall off and not work.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't want to
anchor your sense of self

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:09.240 align:middle line:84%
in your physical body or in
your mind, which is forever

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.670 align:middle line:84%
jumping into the
future or the past,

00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:15.330 align:middle line:84%
or into your feelings,
which change all the time.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.670 align:middle line:84%
So the peace that
passes all understanding

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:23.410 align:middle line:84%
is to anchor your sense of self
in that which is beyond change.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.560 align:middle line:84%
The second C is also
about communication,

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.280 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of us are not in
clear communion with ourselves,

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.520 align:middle line:84%
nor do we have the capacity
to communicate skillfully

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.877 align:middle line:90%
to others.

00:27:33.877 --> 00:27:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a lifelong
journey, because even when

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.070 align:middle line:84%
you think you're a
fabulous communicator,

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:84%
you'll get misinterpreted, or
misconstrued, or misunderstood.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And the third aspect
of the second C

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.060 align:middle line:84%
are issues of forgiveness,
because a lot of people

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.940 align:middle line:84%
use what's happened
to them in the past

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.512 align:middle line:84%
as an excuse for their
behavior in the present.

00:27:54.512 --> 00:27:55.470 align:middle line:90%
>> It's such a big one.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:56.490 align:middle line:90%
>> So forgiveness.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.055 align:middle line:84%
Yes, forgiveness is a
five-day workshop, definitely.

00:28:00.055 --> 00:28:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, a life journey.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And I was at a conference
many years ago in San Francisco

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.470 align:middle line:84%
when a 6' 5" transsexual in
a frock stood up and said,

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:13.800 align:middle line:84%
"I've just realized that
forgiveness is giving up all

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.650 align:middle line:90%
hopes for a better past."

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:18.540 align:middle line:90%
And I thought that was spot on.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.550 align:middle line:90%
That nailed it.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.470 align:middle line:84%
We might need to weep
about it, rail about it,

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:25.410 align:middle line:84%
scream about it, write about
it until we get to a place

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.140 align:middle line:84%
where yeah, that did
happen, but I'm no longer

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.100 align:middle line:84%
reacting in the present as
if still wounded by the past.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:31.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.410 align:middle line:90%
And defining myself as such.

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and that's freedom.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we no longer have
to feel wounded by anything.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.360 align:middle line:90%
>> This is amazing.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.630 align:middle line:84%
We're only up to the second
C, and already there's

00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:47.760 align:middle line:84%
been a wealth of
knowledge and wisdom

00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.750 align:middle line:90%
being shared to our audience.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.220 align:middle line:90%
So what is the third C?

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The third C is a
sense of challenge.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.540 align:middle line:90%
We thrive on challenge.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Human beings love challenge, as
long as it's not overwhelming.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So challenge is
also about how do we

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:07.290 align:middle line:84%
make meaning out
of the unthinkable,

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:11.400 align:middle line:84%
the unimaginable things
that do happen to us?

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I guess I've made
meaning out of my experiences

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.730 align:middle line:84%
by choosing to do
the work that I do.

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.310 align:middle line:84%
And many people make meaning
out of their suffering

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:22.890 align:middle line:84%
by how they choose to
live in the present

00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:25.950 align:middle line:90%
now and spend their time.

00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And so that third C is
really about how do we

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.810 align:middle line:84%
make every moment a sacred
moment, every encounter

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:38.460 align:middle line:84%
a holy encounter,
rather than feeling

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:42.370 align:middle line:84%
that this has no
meaning, I'm in despair,

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:46.540 align:middle line:90%
and I don't see any path out.

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And the fourth C is our
sense of connectedness,

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.850 align:middle line:84%
that we have a profound sense
of connection to our own innate

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:58.630 align:middle line:84%
spirit, that we have our
sense of place of belonging,

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.170 align:middle line:84%
that we've got our mates,
our loved ones, the people

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:06.330 align:middle line:84%
that we can be real with, that
we feel a connection to land,

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:11.970 align:middle line:84%
to country, to the cycles
of nature, to the cosmos.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.440 align:middle line:84%
It can be read at many,
many different levels.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's that deep
sense of connection,

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:25.240 align:middle line:84%
that I'm a part of the whole and
have a place within that whole.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:30.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So these four seas, in
that case, really underpin.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.190 align:middle line:84%
They're the living
philosophies that are

00:30:32.190 --> 00:30:33.640 align:middle line:90%
taught in all of your programs?

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Quest for Life?

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, because if
you think about it,

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:42.240 align:middle line:84%
when I started seeing people
with cancer who didn't die when

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:46.150 align:middle line:84%
they were expected to,
I'd love, as a naturopath,

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to say they all drink
carrot juice and took 5,000

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:51.150 align:middle line:84%
milligrams of vitamin
C three times a day,

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.280 align:middle line:90%
but it wouldn't be true.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:56.380 align:middle line:90%
They did all kinds of things.

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:90%
They found their spirit, though.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.510 align:middle line:84%
And so when I really
began looking at it,

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.480 align:middle line:84%
it was those four qualities
that they had in common.

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I found that whether
you were grieving, whether you

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.180 align:middle line:84%
had sexual abuse
in your childhood,

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:14.950 align:middle line:84%
whether you were
dealing with depression,

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:17.640 align:middle line:84%
suicide, whatever it
was those, those four Cs

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.710 align:middle line:90%
were equally appropriate.

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Because obviously, when the
unthinkable, the unimaginable,

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:24.900 align:middle line:84%
the unexpected happens,
you want to feel

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.440 align:middle line:84%
that you can make an
appropriate response,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.030 align:middle line:84%
not feel a victim
that can only react

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:84%
to it, that your
commitment to living

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:36.210 align:middle line:84%
is that you have a deep
reverence for your own life,

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.270 align:middle line:84%
and you express that reverence
by how you care for yourself

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:43.800 align:middle line:84%
physically, mentally,
emotionally, and spiritually,

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.170 align:middle line:84%
that you're in clear
communion with yourself

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and with others, that you have
the capacity to forgive and let

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:53.520 align:middle line:84%
go what happened in the
past, that every moment is

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.710 align:middle line:84%
a meaningful moment,
every encounter becomes

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:59.640 align:middle line:84%
a holy, a special
encounter, and where

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.860 align:middle line:84%
you feel a profound
sense of connection

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.450 align:middle line:90%
to your own innate spirit,

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:07.350 align:middle line:84%
to the spirit that
enlivens all of creation.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Because if we really
get that, then how

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:13.102 align:middle line:84%
could I do to another what
I wouldn't do to myself?

00:32:13.102 --> 00:32:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Because you would see
the other as yourself.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, the
person who feels

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.010 align:middle line:84%
completely out of
control with their life.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And they can only helplessly
react to everything

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:27.040 align:middle line:84%
that happens to them, and that
their commitment to living

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.700 align:middle line:84%
is all around, I'm going to be
happy at some future time, when

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.910 align:middle line:84%
things are different from
how they are right now,

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:36.520 align:middle line:84%
that they're not in clear
communication with themselves

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.910 align:middle line:84%
or anyone else, have
no capacity to forgive

00:32:39.910 --> 00:32:42.580 align:middle line:84%
or let go the
traumas of the past,

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.560 align:middle line:84%
that all their challenges
are overwhelming

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.420 align:middle line:84%
and nothing has
meaning for them,

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.160 align:middle line:84%
and they have no
sense of connection

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.500 align:middle line:90%
to themselves or to anyone else.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:52.150 align:middle line:84%
I think common
sense would tell us

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:54.610 align:middle line:84%
that that person's
quality of life

00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:58.270 align:middle line:84%
won't be near so good,
nor near so healing

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:03.680 align:middle line:84%
as one where you feel the
presence of those qualities.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:08.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So if somebody was to come
along to a Quest for Life

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:12.020 align:middle line:84%
program, and they
run for five days?

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:12.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have weekend
programs as well

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:14.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Weekend programs as well.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> But through most of
our retreats are five days

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:17.650 align:middle line:90%
in length.

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:21.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So can you give me an example
of what somebody would expect

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:26.230 align:middle line:84%
if they were coming Quest for
Life to be helped in overcoming

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:29.080 align:middle line:84%
depression or anxiety for
whatever the experience

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.780 align:middle line:84%
in their life that
has triggered that?

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.997 align:middle line:84%
And they're there
to learn the four

00:33:34.997 --> 00:33:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Cs of taking back
control, and commitment,

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:43.780 align:middle line:84%
and learning to take on a
challenge that's positive,

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.540 align:middle line:84%
and learning how to
reconnect in their lives?

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:50.020 align:middle line:84%
What are the kind of
processes that they

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.870 align:middle line:90%
would expect to experience?

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:56.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I guess firstly, I
think I'm always deeply touched

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.870 align:middle line:84%
that people will travel so far
to find a safe place where they

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:05.320 align:middle line:90%
can actually have their story.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.642 align:middle line:84%
Because most people are wanting
to fix you, or change you,

00:34:08.642 --> 00:34:13.659 align:middle line:84%
or make you better, or to
pull you out of where you are.

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Whereas for me, the first
step is allowing someone

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:23.830 align:middle line:84%
to be fully exactly where they
are without any need for them

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:27.620 align:middle line:84%
to be any different
from who they are.

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So rather than seeing
people as flawed in any way,

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.790 align:middle line:84%
it's to provide a very safe
environment in which they

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:41.710 align:middle line:84%
can perhaps utter what's been
unutterable up until then.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:46.210 align:middle line:84%
And I find that until you
provide that environment,

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:48.010 align:middle line:90%
people aren't ready to move.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Because once people feel
like someone gets me,

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.870 align:middle line:84%
that person gets what
my world is like,

00:34:55.870 --> 00:35:00.310 align:middle line:84%
then people are ready to
move, but not before then.

00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And people can try and
drag them out of there,

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.400 align:middle line:84%
or any number of things,
or finding them tedious

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.730 align:middle line:84%
when people are in
despair, and depressed,

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:11.320 align:middle line:90%
or whatever it might be.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.200 align:middle line:84%
But until someone
completely allows

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:15.940 align:middle line:84%
you to have the
experience that you're

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:19.600 align:middle line:84%
having, then you're in a place
where you're ready to have

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.590 align:middle line:90%
a different experience.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And so by giving
people a framework

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:26.230 align:middle line:84%
of the four Cs,
which are really,

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.810 align:middle line:90%
very common-sense based.

00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:33.380 align:middle line:84%
They're not kind of
challenging for anyone,

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.190 align:middle line:84%
whether you're working with
prisoners in Long Bay, where

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:41.050 align:middle line:84%
I've worked, or in hospices, or
with children, or politicians,

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:45.760 align:middle line:84%
or whoever it is, those
four Cs resonate so far

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:49.420 align:middle line:90%
for more than 100,000 people.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And so people come because
they want to have a different

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:58.630 align:middle line:90%
experience than they're--

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:02.200 align:middle line:84%
they want to find the part
of themselves that's more

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.570 align:middle line:90%
than what's happened to them.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And so that framework
of the four Cs,

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and then unpacking
that and helping people

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:16.622 align:middle line:84%
to understand how to take good
care of their physical body.

00:36:16.622 --> 00:36:18.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're teaching them
life skills as well around

00:36:18.830 --> 00:36:19.630 align:middle line:90%
lifestyle.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely, absolutely.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:24.920 align:middle line:84%
It's around nutrition, and
exercise, and how to sleep,

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and how to switch your
mind off at night so

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:33.620 align:middle line:84%
that you can get some deep
rest and some good sleep.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.520 align:middle line:84%
It's about finding more
skillful ways of communicating

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:42.950 align:middle line:84%
around your feelings, not only
to have the awareness yourself,

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:47.390 align:middle line:84%
but to be able to communicate
that to your loved ones.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:49.520 align:middle line:84%
We help people to
identify what are

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.010 align:middle line:90%
the activities you engage in?

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:53.700 align:middle line:90%
What goes on in your body?

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:56.540 align:middle line:84%
What are the things
that you do in your life

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.730 align:middle line:84%
when you're at the
end of your tether?

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:01.340 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
people have headaches,

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:05.180 align:middle line:84%
and digestive upsets,
and they can't sleep,

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and they abuse
drugs and alcohol.

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And they blame, and
they resent, and they

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.940 align:middle line:84%
get clumsy, and forgetful,
and they can fill a whiteboard

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.920 align:middle line:90%
with all of the behaviors.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And it's really useful to
look at these behaviors,

00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:22.140 align:middle line:84%
because these are the
symptoms of not being present.

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:23.900 align:middle line:84%
This is when you have
an emotional backlog

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.450 align:middle line:90%
that you haven't dealt with.

00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:28.880 align:middle line:84%
And so we get people
literally to write up,

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.880 align:middle line:84%
what are your half dozen
favorite ways of manifesting

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.270 align:middle line:84%
stress so that you know
that about yourself?

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:38.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we also get
them to reflect on,

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.190 align:middle line:84%
what are the activities,
the environments,

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:middle line:84%
the things that you do
or have in your life

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:44.690 align:middle line:84%
that give you back that
deep sense of connection

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.910 align:middle line:90%
to your own spirit?

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.370 align:middle line:84%
And people come up
with being in nature,

00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:54.980 align:middle line:84%
listening to music, sunsets,
music, making music, singing,

00:37:54.980 --> 00:38:00.320 align:middle line:84%
dancing, the grandchildren,
having a cuppa with friends,

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.640 align:middle line:90%
preparing a meal for friends.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.743 align:middle line:84%
And they can fill a whiteboard
with all of those things.

00:38:05.743 --> 00:38:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at those things,

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.742 align:middle line:84%
those are all
present-time activities.

00:38:09.742 --> 00:38:11.450 align:middle line:84%
We love doing those
things, because we're

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:12.830 align:middle line:90%
in the present moment.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.850 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're creating
meaning and purpose.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:19.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And therefore, a motive to
want to change and a motive

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.250 align:middle line:90%
to stay in the present.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And so we get them to write up
those half-dozen favorite ways

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:27.740 align:middle line:84%
of fluffing themselves up,
of replenishing themselves,

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.600 align:middle line:84%
of putting themselves
back together.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And we suggest, put
both those lists up

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.517 align:middle line:90%
on the bathroom mirror.

00:38:33.517 --> 00:38:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And then every day when
you're brushing your teeth

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:38.960 align:middle line:84%
or gazing lovingly at yourself
in the mirror, those days

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.710 align:middle line:84%
when you can't pull yourself
away from your own reflection,

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:84%
look down those
lists, and make sure

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.830 align:middle line:84%
that none of those behaviors
on the list of the stressors

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.530 align:middle line:84%
is happening, and that you
are doing those things that

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:55.670 align:middle line:84%
replenish you, whether
it's meditation, or ritual,

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:59.450 align:middle line:84%
or having fresh flowers in
the house, or whatever it is.

00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:03.680 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that you are creating
the environment in which you

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:07.490 align:middle line:84%
feel physically, mentally,
emotionally, and spiritually

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:10.400 align:middle line:90%
well and alive.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It really is.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.310 align:middle line:84%
It really is a process
of practicing mindfulness

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:17.450 align:middle line:90%
in every moment.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:21.110 align:middle line:84%
And we're so used to, as you
said right from the beginning,

00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:26.240 align:middle line:84%
we're so used to the autopilot
and living from this place

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.210 align:middle line:84%
of just not even realizing
what our thoughts are

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.680 align:middle line:84%
or you know getting
into the car,

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.140 align:middle line:84%
and driving to the supermarket,
and not even realizing

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.750 align:middle line:84%
that you changed gear
because you've just become

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:40.160 align:middle line:90%
so accustomed to these habits.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And the process of
creating new habits,

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:50.520 align:middle line:84%
do you find that five days
is certainly a great start?

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.270 align:middle line:84%
But I would think that
also, you send people

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:55.820 align:middle line:84%
away with a very
clear understanding

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.170 align:middle line:84%
of the sort of things that
they need to continue doing?

00:39:58.170 --> 00:39:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:05.300 align:middle line:84%
By the time they leave, they
have a clear roadmap for life.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.060 align:middle line:84%
And it's not for us to
tell another person what

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.100 align:middle line:90%
we think they should do.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:14.840 align:middle line:84%
We help people define what are
the relevant things for them

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.860 align:middle line:90%
in their life.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.150 align:middle line:84%
And so by the time
they leave, they

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:25.610 align:middle line:84%
feel empowered to make
choices, and they absolutely

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:30.320 align:middle line:84%
know when they're choosing
not to from then on.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.480 align:middle line:84%
And it is reflected
in our language,

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.700 align:middle line:84%
and in the way we
care for ourselves,

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.800 align:middle line:84%
and the company we
keep, and a whole range

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.980 align:middle line:90%
of different things.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.370 align:middle line:84%
So by the time
people leave, they

00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:42.440 align:middle line:84%
feel like, I know
exactly what I need

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.430 align:middle line:84%
to do in my own life in
order for me to move forward

00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:49.970 align:middle line:84%
in a way that's really
meaningful for the individual.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I've often heard you speak
about how trauma and traumatic

00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:57.890 align:middle line:84%
experiences is actually an
opportunity or a catalyst

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:01.760 align:middle line:84%
for an individual to grow, for
them to understand their own

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:08.690 align:middle line:84%
spirit, to embrace themselves,
and to even learn how to create

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:11.810 align:middle line:84%
a life more of
meaning and purpose.

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:15.530 align:middle line:84%
How can we encourage
people who are feeling

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:19.190 align:middle line:84%
stuck in their
circumstances to maybe start

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:23.810 align:middle line:84%
to begin to shift towards
looking at their challenge

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:26.270 align:middle line:90%
as an opportunity to grow?

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:30.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, hopefully people have
some love and support around

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:34.700 align:middle line:84%
them that will help them to
see that they actually do have

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:38.380 align:middle line:84%
choice, not in what's
happened to them,

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.250 align:middle line:84%
but certainly in how
they're going to approach,

00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:47.620 align:middle line:84%
make meaning out of whatever
has happened to them.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.370 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that's the upside
of suffering, because most of us

00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:55.330 align:middle line:84%
are so happy with
mediocrity, where we

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:58.220 align:middle line:90%
go through life a bit asleep.

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:00.560 align:middle line:84%
And we don't see the
wonder and the beauty,

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:03.560 align:middle line:84%
and we don't connect with
that, because we're so

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.420 align:middle line:90%
preoccupied with the mind.

00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And to have a quiet
mind is bliss.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.130 align:middle line:90%
That's heaven.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:14.910 align:middle line:84%
Heaven's not a
geographical destination.

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:17.850 align:middle line:84%
We make of every moment
a heaven or a hell

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.280 align:middle line:84%
depending upon the quality
of our consciousness

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.410 align:middle line:90%
and where it's absorbed.

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And if it's absorbed in
the past or in the future,

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:31.110 align:middle line:84%
then we squander all of the
possibilities of the present.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to have access
to those qualities of creativity

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:38.810 align:middle line:84%
and insight, wisdom,
if we want to be

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:42.080 align:middle line:84%
able to hear the voice
of our intuition,

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:45.320 align:middle line:84%
then we have to
have a quiet mind.

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, we're just listening
to the past or the future.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:54.540 align:middle line:84%
And then we miss out on
everything that's here now.

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:57.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And so our breath, and to
use our breath to come back

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:58.740 align:middle line:90%
into that space?

00:42:58.740 --> 00:42:59.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>> And I know that meditation
is something that you have,

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:06.080 align:middle line:84%
as you say, you've
done since you were 17.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:10.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you teach a lot of
different types of meditation?

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.640 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's important to
find the technique that works

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.320 align:middle line:90%
for the individual.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:18.020 align:middle line:84%
I would say to people, never
make the technique right

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:19.820 align:middle line:90%
and you wrong.

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:23.520 align:middle line:84%
Shop around until you find
a voice that works for you,

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.670 align:middle line:84%
or a technique
that works for you,

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:30.260 align:middle line:84%
or music that works for
you, or whatever it is.

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:35.840 align:middle line:84%
But don't think that you have
to get it right because somebody

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.880 align:middle line:90%
else benefits from something.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.830 align:middle line:84%
See, one of my
greatest blessings,

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:41.690 align:middle line:84%
really, has been my
knees, because if I

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:46.040 align:middle line:84%
don't move consciously,
although I've got new ones now.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.880 align:middle line:84%
I had them replaced in
the last couple of years.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:53.690 align:middle line:84%
But I have to move
consciously, otherwise I

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.180 align:middle line:90%
rip ligaments and tendons.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And I got rid of the cartilage
many, many years ago.

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:04.850 align:middle line:84%
So on a good day,
they're a great blessing,

00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:09.350 align:middle line:84%
because they keep me very
firmly in the present moment.

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And so it's how you choose
to see things, really.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Because you could grump and
groan over chronic pain,

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:24.320 align:middle line:84%
or you could say, because I
need to be very mindful in how

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I move in my body,
then that connects me

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:31.000 align:middle line:90%
with the present moment.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So for me, it's been, I think,
more than meditation, even.

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:39.660 align:middle line:84%
It's the constant practice
of coming to my senses,

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:43.480 align:middle line:84%
because that's what I've needed
to do throughout my life.

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:47.550 align:middle line:84%
And even though that
means that I do live

00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:53.050 align:middle line:84%
with chronic pain
and some challenges,

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.490 align:middle line:84%
I see those as great blessings,
because they've certainly

00:44:56.490 --> 00:45:01.520 align:middle line:84%
helped me to focus more
on the present moment.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, our
one of our retreats

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:07.730 align:middle line:84%
is taking control
of chronic pain.

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people who've
had horrendous injuries

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.840 align:middle line:84%
or been bedridden for
years have regained

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:20.450 align:middle line:84%
their life, and their
purpose, and have changed

00:45:20.450 --> 00:45:22.730 align:middle line:90%
their view of the story.

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:27.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very grateful
to have a story,

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:32.280 align:middle line:84%
because without that story,
we wouldn't be here having

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:33.820 align:middle line:90%
this conversation.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.330 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't wish it
on anyone either.

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:38.100 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't
change any of it now,

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.230 align:middle line:84%
because those are the
things that have pushed me

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:42.000 align:middle line:84%
into parts of
myself I would never

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.240 align:middle line:84%
have gone to explore
otherwise, and they've

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:48.570 align:middle line:90%
been a great blessing to me.

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And they've also broken me
open to a lot more compassion

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.500 align:middle line:84%
and understanding
for other people

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.320 align:middle line:90%
who are likewise suffering.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think to be in the
company of great suffering

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:05.930 align:middle line:84%
without trying to fix it, or
change it, or make it better

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:11.500 align:middle line:90%
is the first step in healing.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:16.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Petrea, you are, as always,
such an amazing inspiration

00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.000 align:middle line:90%
of wisdom, of knowledge.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.040 align:middle line:84%
I have one more question
for you to answer,

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:25.510 align:middle line:84%
and we're asking
all of our speakers.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:29.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The work of Bruce Lipton,
the work of Jody Spencer,

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:31.720 align:middle line:84%
and philosophers have been
saying it for all time,

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and that is, we are
what we believe.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And if the I Am statement is one
of the most powerful statements

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.570 align:middle line:84%
that we can ever
tell ourselves, what

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.690 align:middle line:84%
is your I Am that you wake
up to and remind yourself

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:45.490 align:middle line:90%
of every day?

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:51.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it would be just that
I am a humble servant of life.

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:52.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Beautiful, beautiful.

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:53.624 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:46:53.624 --> 00:46:54.424 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a pleasure.

00:46:54.424 --> 00:46:55.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you so
much for sharing.

00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:56.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks, Petrea.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.000 align:middle line:90%
