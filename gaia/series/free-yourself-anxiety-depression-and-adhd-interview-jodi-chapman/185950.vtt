00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.710 align:middle line:90%


00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, Jodi.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.110 align:middle line:84%
So we've been through allergies,
bacteria, nutrients, diet,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.330 align:middle line:90%
stress, hormones.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.740 align:middle line:90%
What is the seventh step?

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.520 align:middle line:84%
>> The seventh step isn't
necessarily for everyone.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.820 align:middle line:84%
The seventh step is based on
what your brainwave patterns

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.240 align:middle line:90%
are now doing.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So your brainwave
patterns are developed

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.430 align:middle line:90%
based on how you're raised.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:84%
In a lot of situations, we
learn from our experiences.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:84%
So you get a lot of
people who are raised

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:90%
in beautiful, happy homes.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.458 align:middle line:84%
And they've got a very
balanced way of living,

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle line:90%
and they're happy and positive.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just personality,
they've been raised that way.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got
situations where

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.790 align:middle line:84%
you might have had a child who's
been physically or sexually

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:90%
abused all of their life.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Now that child has grown up with
fear every day of their life.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And when you have a fear
state as the only way

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.630 align:middle line:84%
that they know how to
respond, you take them

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.940 align:middle line:84%
out of that stressful
environment by the time

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:84%
they're 15 or 16
years old, and can you

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:90%
just expect them to be happy?

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.350 align:middle line:84%
If you were to raise
their brain chemicals

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
and get their serotonin
and dopamine levels up

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.520 align:middle line:84%
to normal levels,
they haven't actually

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.380 align:middle line:90%
ever learned how to be happy.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.430 align:middle line:84%
Their brainwave patterns have
learned a certain way of being.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way
of them necessarily

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:84%
knowing how to change that
because they don't recognize

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.760 align:middle line:84%
what it feels like to have
a normal happy environment.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.390 align:middle line:84%
So in cases like that
it's not just children,

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.930 align:middle line:84%
it's people who have been raised
in a happy environment, yet

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:84%
gotten into an
abusive relationship.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.410 align:middle line:84%
They've gone through a
terrible, disastrous marriage

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.340 align:middle line:90%
or it PTSD, for instance.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.080 align:middle line:84%
These experiences
that people have

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.000 align:middle line:84%
that are so traumatic
that it changes

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.463 align:middle line:90%
their brainwave patterns.

00:01:49.463 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
Now we need to be
able to find out

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:84%
what your brainwave patterns
doing and how to balance that.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.020 align:middle line:90%
And we can.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.360 align:middle line:84%
It's retraining the
brainwave patterns.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, I tend to not do this
until I've been through all

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.190 align:middle line:90%
of the biochemical steps.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.890 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that is is
because if you try and train

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:84%
brainwave patterns when
someone's biochemistry is still

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.670 align:middle line:84%
not right, then what they eat
on a daily basis or their gut

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.710 align:middle line:84%
bacteria can then
change what you've

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.930 align:middle line:84%
tried to improve in
the brainwave patterns.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:90%
So we do it last.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand, what I
find is that 90% of patients

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:84%
are 100% better before you
get to brainwave patterns.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.810 align:middle line:84%
And so that problem
never has to be resolved.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.230 align:middle line:84%
But for that select few that
have been in those environments

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.540 align:middle line:84%
where now they don't
know any other way to be.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.510 align:middle line:84%
They're always suffering anxiety
or they are always suffering

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.150 align:middle line:84%
depression because
that's their experience,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:84%
what we can do with the
technology available--

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and this is widely
available in a lot of areas,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.400 align:middle line:90%
especially in the States--

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.020 align:middle line:90%
is brainwave retraining.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.110 align:middle line:90%
So neurotherapy is one option.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.820 align:middle line:90%


00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.840 align:middle line:90%
Mindfulness and meditation.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.170 align:middle line:84%
So people who are in a
situation where they're

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
able to control their
mindset to some extent

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.297 align:middle line:84%
can still access their
brainwave patterns

00:03:07.297 --> 00:03:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and improving their
brainwave patterns

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.860 align:middle line:90%
using meditation techniques.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.570 align:middle line:84%
But for some people,
it's too extreme

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.040 align:middle line:84%
for them and they have
no idea where to start.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.360 align:middle line:84%
So something like neurotherapy
is a fantastic tool.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And how they start
that is you do

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.800 align:middle line:90%
a qEEG, which is a brain scan.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.630 align:middle line:84%
And that measures your
brainwave patterns

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.620 align:middle line:84%
for a period of one
to five minutes.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:84%
You can get that analyzed in
different parts of your brain.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:84%
So there's 24 positions on
your brain that are measured.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And the measurements show
your delta and your theta

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and your alpha waves, your beta
waves, your high beta waves.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is show
us where the brain wave

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
abnormalities are occurring
and what abnormalities

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.410 align:middle line:90%
are happening in that position.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.500 align:middle line:84%
So some people's brains
aren't communicating one side

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.430 align:middle line:90%
to the other.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.610 align:middle line:84%
Some people suffer with
anxiety, some people

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.830 align:middle line:84%
suffer with anxiety and
hyperactivity of the brain,

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:84%
so hypervigilance
or destructability,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.940 align:middle line:84%
because they're in
the high beta range.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Beta is our concentration,
alpha is our meditation, theta

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and delta should be
produced when we're asleep.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you see patients
or children with ADD,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.300 align:middle line:84%
for instance, or
even adults with ADD,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.360 align:middle line:84%
they're producing predominantly
theta and delta while they're

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.320 align:middle line:90%
awake.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:84%
So we need to be able
to identify which

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.130 align:middle line:84%
part of the brain
is doing it first

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and then target that
part of the brain

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and help encourage them to
get that brainwave pattern out

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.500 align:middle line:84%
of that zone and up
into the beta zone.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And for hyperactive or anxious
patients, getting from the high

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.220 align:middle line:84%
beta down to the beta
or to the alpha zone.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So being able to
control that, and we

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.060 align:middle line:84%
do that with technology
and software available.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.920 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, great.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
And what's this technology
and software do?

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Is it sound waves, is
it with headphones?

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:90%
Or how does it all work?

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a lot like learning
to throw a ball at a target.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's creating new
motor neuron pathways.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.700 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.657 align:middle line:84%
After we see the
results of the qEEG,

00:05:14.657 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:84%
we're able to see what part
of the brain is the problem.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
We can then hook up
a cap to our head

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.033 align:middle line:84%
and send that message
to the computer.

00:05:23.033 --> 00:05:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And the computer will
show on the screen

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.460 align:middle line:84%
what zone you're in and
where you should be.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Now you can use reward
techniques with some softwares.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So some software
will play a movie,

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.020 align:middle line:84%
some software will play
games, like a Pac-Man game

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.730 align:middle line:90%
or different reward mechanisms.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And it can be you don't use
anything bar your brain.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And you need to get
your brainwave patterns

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:84%
into the right zone
and it will make

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.320 align:middle line:84%
the movie play or it will
make the Pac-Man move around

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.200 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it is that's going
to stimulate a reward for you.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.860 align:middle line:84%
So when you don't get
it in the right zone,

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.060 align:middle line:90%
it will stop working.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.850 align:middle line:84%
And that will tell you, OK, I've
got to try a little bit harder.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.510 align:middle line:84%
Funny enough, it only takes
about two sessions for people

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.220 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how to
get their brain wave

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.810 align:middle line:90%
pattern in that right zone.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And then we use
up to 30 sessions

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:90%
to make it a permanent change.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So I've had patients,
one particular lady who's

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.970 align:middle line:84%
just an incredible
lady, but she was

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:84%
she went through a
very difficult marriage

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.190 align:middle line:84%
and she came out the other
end with severe depression

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.580 align:middle line:84%
and anxiety to the point of
not wanting to leave her home.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So for her, she had
become a recluse.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And she was a highly
intelligent woman.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.340 align:middle line:84%
She's very academic, she
had degrees upon degrees.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And she was working
in the health field,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
but more in the orthodox
medicine-type field.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.440 align:middle line:84%
And we worked on all of
her biochemistry first.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:84%
And we improved a lot,
but we got to that stage

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.030 align:middle line:84%
where she was still
suffering some anxiety

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.500 align:middle line:90%
and some depression.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.112 align:middle line:84%
And when we did her
qEEG brainwave testing,

00:06:57.112 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
we were able to
see that there were

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
two different parts of her
brain that needed treatment.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.630 align:middle line:84%
So we started first on
one part of the brain.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And in 30 sessions, which
we did in three months,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
she had absolutely no
anxiety at the end of it.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.000 align:middle line:84%
We then went on
another three months

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.580 align:middle line:84%
and worked on the other
part of the brain,

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and the depression
completely lifted.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And this lady ended
up going back into uni

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and studying naturopathy
and entering triathlons

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and taking up personal
training and just

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.240 align:middle line:90%
completely changing her life.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
From someone who refused
to open the mail,

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.670 align:middle line:84%
someone who refused
to even handwrite.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:41.750 align:middle line:84%
It was just an absolute
profound change in her system.

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.550 align:middle line:84%
And for those people who do
need to go as far as changing

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.340 align:middle line:84%
their brainwave patterns, we can
have life changing experiences

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.140 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Same goes with
children with ADHD.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the problems with the
biochemistry in the beginning.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
They're born sometimes
with strep infections.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.490 align:middle line:84%
You see this a lot where babies
are born with strep infections.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.980 align:middle line:84%
So as they're going
through school,

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:84%
they're learning
in a foggy state,

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:84%
as brain fog is a symptom
of one of those bacteria.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
So while they're trying to
focus on school and learn,

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:84%
they're not able to and
they don't know how to.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And they've never had a
normal functioning brain.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.280 align:middle line:84%
So you correct all of
those other things first

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and then you go through
and you improve their focus

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.350 align:middle line:84%
using the neurotherapy
and getting

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:30.850 align:middle line:90%
their brainwave patterns right.

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And in a very short period of
time, all of their problems

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.530 align:middle line:90%
seem to lift.

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:90%
And then it's permanent.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Neurotherapy is
permanent, which is

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.970 align:middle line:90%
why it's such an amazing tool.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we just covered
the seventh step,

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.620 align:middle line:90%
which is brainwave patterns.

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.770 align:middle line:84%
Let's do a little bit of
a summary of these phases

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.050 align:middle line:84%
and go through the
seven steps again.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, so three phases.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.650 align:middle line:84%
Remove the things that
are irritating you.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:84%
OK, so take away
those things first,

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.327 align:middle line:84%
otherwise you're reliant
on Band-aiding them.

00:09:02.327 --> 00:09:03.410 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to do that.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.090 align:middle line:90%
So look at allergies.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:90%
Remove them out of your diet.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:07.580 align:middle line:90%
Eat clean.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of preservatives
and chemicals.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of things that are
toxic or overprocessed, so

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:16.820 align:middle line:84%
things that can cause your
digestion to slow down.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:90%
Eat well.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Control your bacteria.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:84%
Remove the bacteria
that are harming you

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and colonize the bacteria
that you require.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is the
high supplementation

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:31.840 align:middle line:84%
of the probiotics and also
the antibiotic herbs, as well.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, if you need those.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:90%
That's right, yes.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.060 align:middle line:90%
So that's removing the problems.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.660 align:middle line:84%
Then you need to
recover your system.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.400 align:middle line:84%
So you need to
restore everything

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.130 align:middle line:84%
back up to where it
should be in the beginning

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:84%
that you may have lost through
those things impacting you

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.590 align:middle line:90%
previously.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.590 align:middle line:84%
So getting your nutrients
right, finding out

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.890 align:middle line:84%
what you're deficient in,
boosting those levels up

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:55.850 align:middle line:90%
to normal levels.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Eating a really nutritious
diet, getting your diet balance

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.030 align:middle line:84%
right so that you're not
producing inflammation

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:90%
from too much insulin.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So making sure that
everything that you're doing

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.330 align:middle line:90%
is encouraging your growth.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:84%
So making sure that your stress
levels aren't overwhelming,

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.550 align:middle line:84%
that you're getting
balance in life,

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.740 align:middle line:84%
that you're
incorporating happiness.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:84%
That's the most important thing
is focusing on making sure

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.550 align:middle line:84%
that what you do in life is
what you want to do in your life

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:24.260 align:middle line:90%
and is your flow.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Some people sometimes
want to do things

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.220 align:middle line:84%
that other people
want them to do.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.860 align:middle line:84%
But I encourage people to sit
down and write down the things

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:32.750 align:middle line:84%
that they love and
that they enjoy

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.240 align:middle line:84%
and factor them into
their week every week.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.010 align:middle line:90%
Don't wait till once a year.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.810 align:middle line:84%
Do it every day,
do it every week,

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.130 align:middle line:90%
and get some sort of balance.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And figure out who
you are as a person

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:45.350 align:middle line:84%
because you need those things
to keep your life balance so

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.110 align:middle line:84%
that your stress
doesn't creep in again.

00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And that can
maintain your health.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So stress levels and
that will then help you

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.190 align:middle line:90%
with your hormones, as well.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So keeping all of those things
right in that recovery section

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that
you can maintain them.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And the last part is restoring
the brainwave patterns

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.250 align:middle line:84%
and then maintaining your
health for the rest of your life

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
without having to rely on
supplementation or anything

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:15.020 align:middle line:84%
else that you might have to
put in from an external source

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.120 align:middle line:90%
to keep yourself where you are.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
And recognize who you
are and what you require

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
and what food are right
for you as an individual.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Because every
person is different.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.480 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen two
allergy tests the same.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.580 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen two
bacteria tests the same.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen blood tests the
same with levels of nutrients.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:33.920 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:90%
So everyone is so unique.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Figure it out what
your weaknesses are.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.190 align:middle line:84%
And keep an eye on it and make
sure that if you recognize

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:42.410 align:middle line:84%
those symptoms at all
any time in your life,

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.910 align:middle line:84%
you go back to
looking at that again

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:90%
and find out why did it happen.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:84%
What have I done,
what have I changed?

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.742 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to who
I am as an individual

00:11:50.742 --> 00:11:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and make sure that I'm
treating my body the way

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:55.970 align:middle line:84%
that I've learned now is
the way I need to treat it.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:58.110 align:middle line:90%
And staying there, maintenance.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Fantastic.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Jodi, you're an
absolute champion.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Well done.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.420 align:middle line:84%
And your commitment to
helping people and helping

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.350 align:middle line:84%
improve the life of thousands
of people through your practices

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.150 align:middle line:90%
is incredible.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:84%
So thanks for sharing all
your knowledge with us today.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Thank you, and
you're welcome.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And you've been listening
to seven steps to freedom

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.380 align:middle line:84%
from anxiety,
depression, and ADHD

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.845 align:middle line:84%
with Jodi Chapman, a health
scientist and naturopath.

00:12:21.845 --> 00:12:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And I really hope you
enjoyed today's program

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.330 align:middle line:84%
and you've learned a lot and can
take some of these incredibly

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.520 align:middle line:84%
invaluable steps that
she's been teaching

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.610 align:middle line:84%
us to transform your own
health and those of the ones

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:90%
that you love.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:38.165 align:middle line:90%
