00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So without further ado,
let's get to the seven steps

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.810 align:middle line:84%
for freeing yourself from
anxiety, depression, and ADHD.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.210 align:middle line:90%
So what's the first step?

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.600 align:middle line:84%
>> First step is always to
remove the thing that's causing

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:90%
you irritation.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.270 align:middle line:84%
So what I always like to do
is go through the person's

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.528 align:middle line:84%
biochemistry, go
through their system,

00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and have a look at
what's happening to them

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.450 align:middle line:84%
and what they're
being affected by.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.940 align:middle line:84%
So the first step
is always allergy.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, so allergy will always
cause a liver response.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.180 align:middle line:84%
When you have a food allergy
response, what that does

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:90%
is affect the liver.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:84%
The liver uses enzymes that
are also required for the brain

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.210 align:middle line:90%
chemicals.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:84%
And when the liver's using them
all up, the brain misses out.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:84%
So within 5 to 10 minutes
of eating something

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.230 align:middle line:84%
you're allergic to, you can
start having mood changes.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.590 align:middle line:84%
A mood drop, anger,
irritability, depression,

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
sadness, fatigue,
mental fatigue,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
the real brain-fog kind of
feeling, just really not

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.459 align:middle line:90%
coping at all.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And you see the
little kids, they

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.080 align:middle line:84%
go from perfectly
happy one minute

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.760 align:middle line:84%
to then crying that
they missed out

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:84%
on getting picked for
a group or, you know,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
no one likes me,
that kind of thing.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.090 align:middle line:90%
And it can be an instant change.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.380 align:middle line:90%
And you wonder what happened.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.970 align:middle line:90%
So food allergy will do that.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.440 align:middle line:84%
The great news
about food allergy

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.510 align:middle line:84%
is that it doesn't take
very long to find out

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.670 align:middle line:90%
what you're allergic to.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's only about
a week turnaround

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.770 align:middle line:84%
between getting your tests
done and getting the results.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.050 align:middle line:84%
And it only takes about
between one and three days

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:84%
to actually remove those
foods out of your system.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:84%
So you can have a
really fast response

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.795 align:middle line:84%
when you take away
that problem first.

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And what are the common
foods that people are allergic

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
to that are suffering from
anxiety or depression or ADHD?

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The most profound thing
that I've found when testing

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.720 align:middle line:84%
patients for food allergies
is that no one has the same

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.740 align:middle line:90%
allergens.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
message that I've

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:84%
been trying to explain to
people is that you can't

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.120 align:middle line:90%
assume what you're allergic to.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I find that very often the foods
that are the most overprocessed

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
are the ones that
people don't tolerate

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.270 align:middle line:84%
very well, such as your
dairy, your gluten products,

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.750 align:middle line:84%
even eggs because of whatever
is being fed to the chickens.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on where you're
buying your eggs from, as well.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.280 align:middle line:84%
You find some people will react
to some eggs and not other eggs

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:90%
because of what's in them.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so you can go right back
to the food that you're eating

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.920 align:middle line:90%
and what they're being fed, too.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's like, you
are what you eat,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.400 align:middle line:84%
but you are what your
food eats, as well.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.082 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, you can have those
really common allergens.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But from the other
perspective, the way

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
you become allergic is by
suffering with leaky gut.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.050 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if you've
heard about leaky gut.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.820 align:middle line:84%
It's quite a common term,
but a lot of people haven't.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.880 align:middle line:84%
And leaky gut is a
situation where your gut

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.000 align:middle line:84%
wall has become permeable
where it's gappy

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.380 align:middle line:90%
because it's inflamed.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.600 align:middle line:84%
So the food that you
regularly eat passes

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
through the gut wall
and your bloodstream

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:90%
picks it up on the other side.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:84%
And once it does that,
it produces an antigen

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.600 align:middle line:90%
against that food for good.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
They say that you can
desensitize to some foods.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I have seen the odd food
that can be desensitized to,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
but I don't see
it very commonly.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.225 align:middle line:84%
And I also find that once they
have desensitized to the food,

00:03:17.225 --> 00:03:18.850 align:middle line:84%
if you do bring it
back in high levels,

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.892 align:middle line:84%
you can become allergic
or sensitive to it again.

00:03:21.892 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:84%
So I tend to find
that whatever you

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.290 align:middle line:84%
find is an allergen for you,
you should avoid it from there

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.160 align:middle line:90%
on as much as you can.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
But what we need
to know is that you

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:84%
can actually become
allergic to anything

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle line:90%
you are regularly eating.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So you can almost pick
the time in your life

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.090 align:middle line:84%
when you became
allergic to start with.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.130 align:middle line:84%
So for me, my food
allergy list has

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:84%
all of the foods that I
ate when I was a child.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So I look back, if I were
to go home for Christmas

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.840 align:middle line:84%
and I eat all of the
food that my dad loves

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.532 align:middle line:84%
to prepare for Christmas,
I know I'm feeling terrible

00:03:52.532 --> 00:03:54.490 align:middle line:84%
within the first day of
doing that because it's

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.440 align:middle line:84%
all those foods that I used
to eat when I was a kid.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>> And what's the
theory behind that?

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Is that because you've
consumed so much

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.140 align:middle line:84%
of that food over a
period of your life

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:84%
that it caused that
aggravation to the gut

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:84%
in the first place,
which caused the leaky

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.880 align:middle line:84%
gut or the permeability
of the gut wall?

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that,
more to the point,

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.897 align:middle line:84%
whatever it was that was causing
the inflammation of my gut back

00:04:12.897 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:84%
all those years ago when
I suffered with migraines

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.500 align:middle line:84%
and headaches, it could
have been a stress response

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.810 align:middle line:84%
because I was a very shy child,
I could've been born with a few

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.610 align:middle line:90%
allergens.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.568 align:middle line:84%
I know my mother had a
lot of allergy problems,

00:04:26.568 --> 00:04:30.937 align:middle line:84%
so had I been passed on
those problems through birth,

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.770 align:middle line:84%
then I would have been
reacting to the foods

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.728 align:middle line:84%
that she was giving me,
which would have caused

00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:35.860 align:middle line:90%
gut inflammation.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And then my allergy list
would have grown from there

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:84%
because I would
have just continued

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.860 align:middle line:84%
to leak those foods that
I was regularly eating.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So for somebody who may not
be able to visit your clinic,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.120 align:middle line:84%
what should they ask their
practitioner about what type

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
of test they should get to find
out what they're allergic to?

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.368 align:middle line:84%
Because there's IgG
tests, there's DNA tests,

00:04:55.368 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:84%
there's so many different
tests these days.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
What is the gold standard
about really uncovering

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.120 align:middle line:90%
what you're allergic to?

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> In my experience, there
are so many different tests.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.610 align:middle line:84%
I found I've had
the best response

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.690 align:middle line:84%
from the pathology testing
that tests your white cells

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.190 align:middle line:90%
against the foods.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
So there are labs all over
the world who can do that.

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you
really need to look for.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Though, all of the other
tests that are available

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.400 align:middle line:84%
tend to have accuracy
in what they're testing.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:84%
So you can do an
IgE allergy test

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.340 align:middle line:90%
to the environmental products.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.560 align:middle line:84%
I had all of that done
when I was a teenager.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you
have you scratch tests

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and they do the
desensitizing injections.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.020 align:middle line:84%
They are accurate
to the environment.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
You are allergic to those things
or sensitive to those things.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.070 align:middle line:90%
That's IgE.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got your
IgG, which generally

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:84%
tends to affect the gut
the most because that's

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:90%
the food responses.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.780 align:middle line:84%
However, when you check for
white cell responses, that's

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.170 align:middle line:84%
inflammation, that's
total system inflammation.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.650 align:middle line:84%
So they still haven't
fully determined how many

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:90%
allergy responses there are.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.933 align:middle line:90%
It's just so vast.

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:90%
It just keeps growing.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.160 align:middle line:84%
The more research is
done, the more they find.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.190 align:middle line:84%
But when you get this
white cell response,

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.650 align:middle line:84%
you see anything that could
have caused your reaction.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.700 align:middle line:84%
So they test the food against
the white cells in your blood.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.960 align:middle line:84%
It's alive blood,
and they watch to see

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.850 align:middle line:84%
if it has any
reaction whatsoever,

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.560 align:middle line:90%
any one of the reactions.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.660 align:middle line:84%
So that pretty much
covers everything.

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And when a list comes
back from this test,

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:31.300 align:middle line:90%
how expansive is it?

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>> It's pretty comprehensive.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So most people will have
three or five main allergies?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.010 align:middle line:90%
Or they'll have 20?

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it depends
on the experience.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:84%
For me, out of 200
foods, I have 70.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of those
foods I can easily

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.420 align:middle line:84%
avoid because they're not
in my regular diet anymore.

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.940 align:middle line:84%
So there's another 130
foods there available for me

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.175 align:middle line:84%
to have that I can make a
whole varied diet out of.

00:06:58.175 --> 00:07:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you need to
look for when you're testing.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.953 align:middle line:84%
I never suggest people only
get a small amount of foods

00:07:02.953 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
tested because we need
to know what you're not

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.570 align:middle line:84%
allergic to to make
a full diet out of.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.773 align:middle line:84%
So the larger range
you can test for, you

00:07:09.773 --> 00:07:11.440 align:middle line:84%
should because you
only ever really need

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:90%
to do these tests once.

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:16.120 align:middle line:84%
I had my tests redone five
years later by a different lab

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.980 align:middle line:84%
and it came back
almost identical.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.410 align:middle line:90%
So five years different.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:23.440 align:middle line:84%
So to have that accuracy and to
know that only one or two foods

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:84%
had changed, and I felt
that change as well.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.590 align:middle line:84%
So those new foods that I was
reacting to, I could tell.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I didn't feel well
on those foods.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.020 align:middle line:90%
So you can.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.543 align:middle line:84%
Once you get the test
done, you can basically

00:07:34.543 --> 00:07:37.210 align:middle line:84%
know that that's a very valuable
tool for the rest of your life,

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.872 align:middle line:84%
that that's a road
map to your body.

00:07:38.872 --> 00:07:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And that's the most
important thing

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:41.913 align:middle line:84%
that you can tell
people about allergy

00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
is that no one can guess
what you're allergic to.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.980 align:middle line:90%
It could be up to 50 foods.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And there's no
way that I'm going

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
to be able to tell you what
you were eating when you were

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.060 align:middle line:90%
a kid that you now can't have.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.970 align:middle line:84%
It could be pine nuts,
it could be basil,

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:56.620 align:middle line:90%
it could be mushrooms.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.787 align:middle line:84%
It could be anything, and
we don't know the reaction

00:07:58.787 --> 00:08:00.537 align:middle line:84%
that that's going to
have with you either.

00:08:00.537 --> 00:08:02.500 align:middle line:84%
We don't know whether
it'll drop serotonin

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:84%
or whether it'll just
cause inflammation,

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.690 align:middle line:84%
whether it'll cause
insomnia and digestive pain.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
All reactions can
be very different.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.555 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, interesting.

00:08:11.555 --> 00:08:13.930 align:middle line:84%
And do you believe that there's
a possibility that people

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.560 align:middle line:84%
can heal from certain allergies
over time by repairing the gut?

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Or is that a theory that hasn't
really been tested as much yet?

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.910 align:middle line:84%
>> It's something that I've not
been able to successfully see

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:27.280 align:middle line:90%
in myself and in my patients.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.081 align:middle line:84%
I have seen some things
removed, such as my before

00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:33.039 align:middle line:90%
and after allergy test.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:37.659 align:middle line:84%
There's the odd food that's not
showing up on my second test.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:41.020 align:middle line:84%
However, when I have too much
of it, I start to react again.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is why I think once
your body's produced the cell

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.440 align:middle line:84%
memory against
that food, I think

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:52.120 align:middle line:84%
that it's something that may
be a sensitivity or a risk

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:90%
of being a sensitivity for life.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.480 align:middle line:84%
So it doesn't mean
you necessarily

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.310 align:middle line:84%
have to completely
cut it out forever,

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:59.790 align:middle line:84%
but you should just
have it sparingly.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:84%
>> And for me, when you
were talking earlier about

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.512 align:middle line:84%
allergens, this is the step
one of the seven steps.

00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:06.970 align:middle line:84%
You said that after
you eat it, you

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:09.835 align:middle line:84%
can feel depressed or
anxious or short on temper.

00:09:09.835 --> 00:09:13.210 align:middle line:84%
And I personally know that
when I eat gluten I feel like.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:15.742 align:middle line:84%
And so do you believe
that a lot of people

00:09:15.742 --> 00:09:17.200 align:middle line:84%
that might be
listening to this may

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.683 align:middle line:84%
be able to
automatically go, hang

00:09:19.683 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:84%
on, I know when I eat this
particular type of food--

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.090 align:middle line:84%
it might be bread or it might
be eggs or it might be dairy--

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.320 align:middle line:84%
that they do feel a
certain way half an hour,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.980 align:middle line:84%
an hour, or two hours
later, or almost

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.480 align:middle line:90%
immediately after eating it?

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.580 align:middle line:84%
But that's definitely a
sign that they probably

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.600 align:middle line:90%
are reacting to that?

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not able
to get a blood allergy

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.180 align:middle line:84%
test to work out what
it is, you should keep

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:42.010 align:middle line:90%
what we call a symptom diary.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.360 align:middle line:84%
So just grab an exercise book,
you put a line down the middle,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.920 align:middle line:84%
you write down
what you're eating.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And on the other
side of the page,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.730 align:middle line:84%
you write down when
you get the symptoms.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:53.670 align:middle line:84%
So you write the time of the
food, the time of the symptom.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.050 align:middle line:90%
And after a couple of weeks--

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:84%
I know it can be a little bit
painstaking to start with,

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.102 align:middle line:84%
but this could be a lifelong
journey for you otherwise.

00:10:00.102 --> 00:10:01.602 align:middle line:84%
After a couple of
weeks, you can see

00:10:01.602 --> 00:10:03.990 align:middle line:84%
a pattern between your
behavior and certain foods.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.820 align:middle line:84%
If you've got many,
many allergens that

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:08.610 align:middle line:84%
can be very difficult
to do-- and I know

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:10.620 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't able to do it
for myself because I

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:90%
had too many allergens.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.900 align:middle line:84%
So when I was younger,
I would remove dairy

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.690 align:middle line:84%
and put soy in there instead,
not realizing that soy

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:90%
was an allergen for me too.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Plus, I was eating eggs
and I was eating capsicum

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.160 align:middle line:84%
and I was eating all of these
great things, such as carrots.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm allergic to a fair
few vegetables, as well.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle line:90%
So it could really be anything.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:90%
You can't assume.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:34.867 align:middle line:84%
So you know you can try and
do the elimination type thing,

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:36.450 align:middle line:84%
but I find that
people really struggle

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and they never really
quite get it right.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.883 align:middle line:90%
