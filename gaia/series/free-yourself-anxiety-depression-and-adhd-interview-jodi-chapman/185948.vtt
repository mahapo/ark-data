00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.730 align:middle line:90%
>> So step one was allergy.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.690 align:middle line:90%
Step two is bacteria.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Step three is nutrients.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.579 align:middle line:84%
Step four we just
talked about is diet.

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:16.379 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me about the fifth step.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.050 align:middle line:90%
>> The fifth step is stress.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So stress can be the
fifth step, but stress

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.140 align:middle line:90%
could be the first step.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're almost
coming full circle,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:84%
where stress is such a major
impact on your brain chemicals,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.710 align:middle line:84%
because it'll immediately
cause your gut to respond.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.840 align:middle line:84%
When your gut responds,
you then have difficulty

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.810 align:middle line:84%
making the brain chemicals,
and your stress responses

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:90%
can affect your hormones.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So stress will create a hormonal
imbalance, where you start

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.130 align:middle line:90%
to produce a lot of cortisol.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.150 align:middle line:84%
Cortisol is a stress hormone
that produces inflammation,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and that inflammation
can then cause

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.080 align:middle line:84%
allergy and bacterial infections
and all these other things

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:90%
and nutrient deficiencies.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.320 align:middle line:90%
So stress could come first.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:84%
We've got to be very
careful with stresses

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.250 align:middle line:84%
that we're able to deal
with them in our life.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.730 align:middle line:84%
So if someone is experiencing
a great deal of stress

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.680 align:middle line:84%
through their
lifestyle, they might

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.630 align:middle line:90%
be under financial strain.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.710 align:middle line:84%
The burden of a
lot of things that

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:84%
happen in the Western culture,
such as financial pressures

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.930 align:middle line:84%
and roles in the
household, there's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.120 align:middle line:84%
a lot of depression in
men and the responsibility

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.820 align:middle line:84%
to be the main breadwinners
in some people's cases.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.950 align:middle line:84%
Or you know, over
the last 50 years,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.540 align:middle line:84%
the role reversal
has come about,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.660 align:middle line:84%
and that can be difficult for
people to get their head around

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
when they've been raised by a
certain traditional upbringing.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:84%
So that kind of stress is
divorces and losses, tragedies,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.960 align:middle line:84%
disease, when someone goes
through cancer, and dealing

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:47.760 align:middle line:90%
with--

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.700 align:middle line:84%
if you're the carer of
someone who is terminally ill,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.433 align:middle line:90%
that kind of stress.

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:53.850 align:middle line:84%
These types of
stresses are having

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.880 align:middle line:84%
a major impact on your
body and your ability

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.988 align:middle line:84%
to produce all of the nutrients
that you require or absorb

00:01:59.988 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
the nutrients you're required
to then produce the brain

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.520 align:middle line:84%
chemicals that you need
to be able to stay stable.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So that's the first component
is, where is it coming from?

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.450 align:middle line:84%
But from the other
perspective, allergy

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.900 align:middle line:84%
creates a reaction that
makes you feel very stressed.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Bacteria releases an acid
that amplifies your stress.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.710 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
types of things--

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Work together.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:84%
>> --work together and
almost create a system,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.540 align:middle line:84%
where you're stuck in it, where
you don't know how to get out

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:84%
of it unless you're
able to work backwards.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.650 align:middle line:84%
Stressors can then have an
effect on your hormones,

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.430 align:middle line:84%
and hormones are something
that, on their own,

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
can create depression as
well, depression and anxiety.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.612 align:middle line:84%
>> So if we know that we
have these types of stress

00:02:48.612 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:84%
in our life, and we can
definitely identify with some

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
of what you've just been
talking about there,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.710 align:middle line:84%
how do you recommend patients
destress from those stressors?

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I see a lot of people
who've been through behavioral

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.660 align:middle line:90%
cognitive therapy first.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.460 align:middle line:84%
So they've seen all
of the counselors.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.560 align:middle line:84%
They've been to
the psychiatrist.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.410 align:middle line:84%
They've been to the
psychologist, and a lot of them

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
are saying that they can't
improve based on going

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:90%
through those processes.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And then when we
look at their system

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:84%
and find that they're not making
the brain chemicals to cope,

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
we are able to then
build those systems up,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.850 align:middle line:84%
and then they can go back
to the cognitive therapy,

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:90%
and it does work.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.840 align:middle line:84%
If you try and ask someone
to work through a process

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.262 align:middle line:84%
and go through the grieving
process, which everyone can do,

00:03:36.262 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:84%
if you expect them to do
that, when they're not

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.300 align:middle line:84%
making their brain chemicals,
they get stuck in the middle.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And it just doesn't
move forward for them.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.990 align:middle line:84%
So getting stuck in
a depressive state

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:84%
often starts with emotional
stress but becomes biochemical.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you're able to do
them both at the same time,

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:84%
we need to be able
to work together

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.450 align:middle line:84%
from all perspectives for the
practitioners that are working

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.790 align:middle line:84%
with people with
these problems to be

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.680 align:middle line:84%
able to work on their
emotional issues

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.570 align:middle line:84%
and help them through
that, as well as work

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.220 align:middle line:90%
on the biochemical.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.230 align:middle line:84%
So if we can get the
biochemistry right there,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.925 align:middle line:84%
they have the tools
then available

00:04:08.925 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:84%
to be able to go through
the grieving process

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.790 align:middle line:84%
properly and work through
that the right way.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:84%
And you also recommend practices
such as yoga or meditation,

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.060 align:middle line:90%
qigong, stress reduction.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.959 align:middle line:84%
So for those people who have
very high responsibilities,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:84%
so too much in a day
for one person to do--

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.130 align:middle line:90%
how many of us are doing that?

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.430 align:middle line:90%
You know, everyone.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:90%
So we wake up.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.010 align:middle line:90%
We've got children.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
We've got to get them to
school, make all their food,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.815 align:middle line:90%
make sure it's healthy.

00:04:31.815 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Then we've got to run
to work, and then we've

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.270 align:middle line:84%
got a full on day until we
race home, get our kids,

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.770 align:middle line:84%
make dinner, do the extra
email responses these days

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.470 align:middle line:84%
that people have to do, keep
up with everything you need to,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and crash in bed by
10 o'clock or later,

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.940 align:middle line:90%
and start again the next day.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.330 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of nutrients
that you require to get through

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.670 align:middle line:84%
that, you need to be
producing adrenaline

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.220 align:middle line:84%
to be able to get through
that and all of the dopamine.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.920 align:middle line:90%
Dopamine produces adrenaline.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:84%
So once we burn all
of those nutrients up

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.708 align:middle line:84%
by having these really
high pressure lives,

00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:06.000 align:middle line:84%
we need to make sure that
we're getting those nutrients

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.170 align:middle line:90%
in our food as well.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes there's
not enough in the food

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.360 align:middle line:84%
to be able to keep up with
that particular lifestyle.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.360 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's people who
have very more relaxed lives.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.470 align:middle line:90%
They keep things balanced.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:90%
They don't overdo it.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.680 align:middle line:84%
But then some people
don't have a choice,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.455 align:middle line:84%
and they are in high
stress situations,

00:05:21.455 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:84%
where they're just burning
through nutrients faster

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.810 align:middle line:90%
than they can eat them.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So for those people,
they should be

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:84%
using the support of the
nutrients if they require it.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And also practicing
the stress reduction.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.357 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, using, say,
yoga or meditation,

00:05:37.357 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:90%
any of those things.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:84%
Getting outside--
I find, for me,

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.960 align:middle line:90%
I need to be getting outside.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:84%
I need to make sure that
at least once a day,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm walking my dogs.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm getting out
into the sunshine.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I like to be around nature, so
I'll take a walk on the beach

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
or, if I'm near a rainforest,
I'll walk amongst that.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's no way
that you can be

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
stressed if you're in
an environment that

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.580 align:middle line:90%
doesn't allow that.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.310 align:middle line:84%
So giving yourself time to
think through processes,

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.530 align:middle line:84%
exercise is one of
the biggest ones.

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.290 align:middle line:84%
If you can go for a run, if
you're a runner, as opposed

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.500 align:middle line:84%
to someone who does yoga,
they will use that time

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.900 align:middle line:90%
for meditation as well.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.950 align:middle line:84%
You know, it takes
10, 15 minutes

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.260 align:middle line:90%
to get into that state of--

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.950 align:middle line:84%
that zone of running, where you
just forget about everything,

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:90%
and you just enjoy the scenery.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So it depends on
what it is for you,

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.710 align:middle line:84%
but you've really got to find
something that keeps balance

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:26.635 align:middle line:90%
back in your life.

00:06:26.635 --> 00:06:28.260 align:middle line:84%
So balance is the
most important thing.

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.270 align:middle line:84%
If you've got that
really full on life,

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.730 align:middle line:84%
you have to take a
segment of your day

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.840 align:middle line:84%
or your week to be able
to get that balance back

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
again, because you
can't just keep burning

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:90%
through those nutrients.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.011 align:middle line:90%
