00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.150 align:middle line:84%
>> So, let's go to
the second step.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.790 align:middle line:84%
What's the second
step in this process?

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.640 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost one of the most
important things that you can

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.440 align:middle line:90%
do.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.980 align:middle line:90%
And this is your gut bacteria.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.770 align:middle line:84%
So your gut bacteria are
responsible for making

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.060 align:middle line:90%
your brain chemicals.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.090 align:middle line:84%
So this is the factory
of your brain chemicals.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, the
factory of your entire

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.750 align:middle line:90%
body for all of the protein.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So all of the repair
of your muscles,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.880 align:middle line:84%
and your tissue,
all of your hormones

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.930 align:middle line:90%
are all manufactured in the gut.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.410 align:middle line:84%
So to do this, you
have certain bacteria

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:90%
that do the manufacturing.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.290 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got
certain bacteria

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.710 align:middle line:84%
that you can be carrying
that you don't require,

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.130 align:middle line:84%
but can cause depression for
themselves, in their own right.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:84%
So one of the most common ones
a lot of people hear about,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
but they can sometimes think
it's a bad one, but it's not,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:90%
is e coli.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.450 align:middle line:84%
So e coli is responsible
for producing folate.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And folate it is necessary
for every brain chemical.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.000 align:middle line:84%
Folate is also necessary
for the production

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:84%
of tryptophan, and
tyrosine, and phenylalanine.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And all of these are
amino acids or proteins.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:84%
And all of these proteins are
necessary for the production

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:90%
of every brain chemical.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you have any
problem with your e coli,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.170 align:middle line:84%
if you don't have
enough e coli, you

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.300 align:middle line:84%
can't make your own
brain chemicals.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is when people are
reliant on anti-depressants,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.920 align:middle line:84%
or they're reliant
on supplements

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.260 align:middle line:84%
with those nutrients in
them to feel good every day.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.530 align:middle line:90%
The key is to correct the gut.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you can take
them off the things

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:84%
that they're using to
support themselves and get

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.432 align:middle line:84%
their body making the
brain chemicals themselves,

00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:43.973 align:middle line:84%
because you should
be able to do that

00:01:43.973 --> 00:01:46.480 align:middle line:84%
at any time in someone's life,
if you can get that balance

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.280 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.340 align:middle line:90%
So e coli is one component.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.360 align:middle line:84%
But one of the biggest
problems, and I'm

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.830 align:middle line:84%
finding these in 90% of my
patients with depression,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:84%
is there's a range of bacteria
that produce D-lactic acid.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
The D-lactic acid
is a nerve toxin.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.480 align:middle line:84%
When you eat carbohydrates,
these bacteria

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
convert the carbons
from the carbohydrates

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.490 align:middle line:90%
into D-lactic acid.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.240 align:middle line:84%
And that D-lactic acid amplifies
every emotion you have.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
little bit of anxiety,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
maybe from a food allergen,
or maybe because you've

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
got stress in your
life, or you're

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.760 align:middle line:84%
just nervous about
something, but if you're

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.210 align:middle line:84%
carrying these bacteria as well,
all of a sudden, that anxiety

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:90%
feels 1,000 times stronger.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.170 align:middle line:84%
Or if you've got a
little bit of sadness,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.630 align:middle line:84%
that sadness feels
like severe depression.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:84%
So depending on the level
of infection that you have--

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:84%
and you can pick
up these infections

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.540 align:middle line:90%
anytime in your life.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
If you travel to
third world countries,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:90%
we pick it up from other humans.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So you drink the tap water,
you get Bali belly, we call it,

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.220 align:middle line:84%
or diarrhea,
vomiting, a cold, flu.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
Anything like that at
any time in your life,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and you could have picked
up a huge dose, or even

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.240 align:middle line:90%
a little dose of these bacteria.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.820 align:middle line:84%
And gradually, over the
years, these bacteria

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:90%
will grow and multiply.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.130 align:middle line:84%
The more they grow, then the
more carbohydrates you eat.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And carbohydrates
are not the enemy.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
So we need to know that
limiting carbohydrates

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.360 align:middle line:84%
is great for some
things, but if you

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.640 align:middle line:84%
need to do it long term to
control bacteria, that's

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:90%
not the answer.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.360 align:middle line:84%
The answer is
controlling the bacteria,

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.120 align:middle line:84%
so that you can have those
carbs without offending you.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.440 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we might eat
breakfast with carbs or lunch

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.240 align:middle line:90%
with carbs.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.980 align:middle line:90%
And we have a reaction to that.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.800 align:middle line:84%
And we wonder, well, obviously,
I can't handle carbs.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.510 align:middle line:90%
But that might not be the case.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.300 align:middle line:84%
Might not be an allergy to the
carbs, which we might assume.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.800 align:middle line:84%
But it can be
because the bacteria

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.260 align:middle line:84%
is turning that
carb into an acid

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.020 align:middle line:84%
and immediately amplifying
every emotion we have.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, how profound.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.280 align:middle line:90%
How interesting.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.240 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about bacteria
and the gut-brain connection,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we sort of
skipped over that.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.910 align:middle line:90%
But that's a bit of a big news.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the gut and the brain
are connected, because for me,

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.260 align:middle line:84%
it when I originally got into
this, helping my dad recover

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:84%
from depression and anxiety,
that research was coming out,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.430 align:middle line:90%
and it was a big deal.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.695 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when you first
start looking into it,

00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
you think, well, everything
would originate in the brain.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.172 align:middle line:84%
And the brain would be the
origin of these issues.

00:04:11.172 --> 00:04:12.130 align:middle line:90%
So let's fix the brain.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.560 align:middle line:90%
But now, it's all about the gut.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.329 align:middle line:90%
Tell me a little bit about that.

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
>> When I test people, the
amount of times that I do this

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.928 align:middle line:84%
testing and we're able to see
that the brain is actually not

00:04:24.928 --> 00:04:27.220 align:middle line:84%
being affected at all, yet
they're getting all of these

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.120 align:middle line:90%
symptoms.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.203 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's being affected.

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:33.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's a symptom
of another problem.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.257 align:middle line:84%
So we see that the brain
has no imbalances showing,

00:04:36.257 --> 00:04:37.840 align:middle line:84%
yet they've got all
of these symptoms.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.470 align:middle line:84%
And oftentimes, depression,
or the depressive symptoms

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
and the anxiety
symptoms, are coming

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:84%
from an overload of
lactic acid, instead of

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.000 align:middle line:84%
from a drop in
serotonin or dopamine.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:84%
It might not even be biochemical
in brain neurotransmitters.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.703 align:middle line:84%
It might be completely caused
by too much acid in the brain,

00:04:56.703 --> 00:04:58.120 align:middle line:84%
or not enough
oxygen to the brain.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.270 align:middle line:84%
All of those things will have
an impact on how you feel,

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:84%
without actually altering
the brain chemicals.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you are then
given antidepressants

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.940 align:middle line:84%
to treat the problems,
and you don't

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.780 align:middle line:84%
respond to antidepressants,
It's a good indicator

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:84%
to say that this isn't
even coming from the brain.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.952 align:middle line:84%
We really need to
look somewhere else.

00:05:16.952 --> 00:05:18.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's mostly
from the gut, you say.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.868 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, mostly from the gut.

00:05:19.868 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, 90% of the
patients that I found,

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.370 align:middle line:84%
over 2,000 stool tests that
I had done for my patients

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.828 align:middle line:84%
over the years,
and I decided I was

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:29.953 align:middle line:84%
going to go through and
count them up, and find out

00:05:29.953 --> 00:05:31.320 align:middle line:90%
what the percentage was.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.590 align:middle line:84%
And out of the ratio
shift, so you're

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
supposed to have almost none
of the D-lactic acid producing

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:90%
bacteria.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
You can get away with none, and
your gut will be very healthy.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.837 align:middle line:84%
And you're supposed to
have 70% to 90% of e coli,

00:05:45.837 --> 00:05:47.670 align:middle line:84%
because it's making all
the brain chemicals.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.370 align:middle line:84%
But what I find is
that the ratio changes.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.860 align:middle line:84%
And we end up with 80% to 90%
of the D-lactic acid producing

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.660 align:middle line:90%
bacteria.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.430 align:middle line:84%
And the e coli is
suppressed, because it

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
has to fight for its
space in the gut.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:90%
And it can't compete anymore.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Because these bacteria
produce so much acid,

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.240 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't allow the
other bacteria to survive.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.340 align:middle line:84%
So your lactobacillus
and your bifidobacterium,

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.830 align:middle line:84%
the good bacteria that
help you digest your food

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
and keep your immune
system strong,

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:16.170 align:middle line:84%
they also suppress in the
presence of the acid producing

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.130 align:middle line:90%
bacteria.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:84%
And then people's
immune system drops.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.815 align:middle line:84%
And then they're able
to pick up more viruses.

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting
chronic fatigue syndrome.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.600 align:middle line:84%
And their allergies
develop further,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.250 align:middle line:84%
because they're
not able to digest

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:90%
the food that they're eating.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.820 align:middle line:84%
So having that
bacterial imbalance

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.150 align:middle line:84%
can lead to more allergies,
where having allergies

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
doesn't necessarily
lead to bacteria.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.500 align:middle line:90%
Bacteria you have to catch it.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.170 align:middle line:84%
You have to be
exposed to it somehow

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:90%
to be able to pick it up.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.290 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of my patients are
teachers working with children,

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:84%
and kids not
washing their hands.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Also a large percentage
of my patients

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:59.010 align:middle line:84%
are nurses and even janitors
who work in the hospitals.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So they're exposed
to environments

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.480 align:middle line:84%
where they're having to
look after other people.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.013 align:middle line:84%
And the contact is through stool
and caring for someone else.

00:07:08.013 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:84%
So those are the types
of people that you see.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:84%
So sanitization, and
washing your hands,

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and being very careful
in public toilets.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.210 align:middle line:84%
That's really important
to keep this at bay.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.670 align:middle line:84%
>> And how do you normally
test for the bacteria

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.957 align:middle line:90%
in somebody's gut?

00:07:21.957 --> 00:07:23.040 align:middle line:90%
>> You can do stool tests.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.310 align:middle line:90%
They're available.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.682 align:middle line:84%
So there's a few
different pathology labs

00:07:27.682 --> 00:07:28.890 align:middle line:90%
who do different stool tests.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And most health practitioners
know how to access those.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.860 align:middle line:84%
So it's just about
getting a test that

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.540 align:middle line:84%
will show you all
of the bacteria

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.380 align:middle line:84%
that you're currently carrying,
and have a look at the ratios

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:90%
that you're carrying.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.720 align:middle line:84%
So it's you can almost Google
D-lactic acid producing

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.110 align:middle line:84%
bacteria and see a whole
range of them on the internet,

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and learn about their
presence, and whether you're

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:90%
carrying those ones or not.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.020 align:middle line:84%
It's the L-lactic acid
producing bacteria that we want.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, so L-lactic acid,
we make, or the bacteria

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.520 align:middle line:90%
that's healthy for us.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
We have an enzyme in our body
that breaks down L-lactic acid.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.310 align:middle line:84%
So L-lactic acid
helps us with thought,

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.570 align:middle line:90%
emotions, cognitive function.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.410 align:middle line:84%
So when we're producing
our L-lactic, acid

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.170 align:middle line:84%
and we're producing our
emotions, we can control that.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.450 align:middle line:84%
Because once it's
used, our enzyme

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.520 align:middle line:90%
gets rid of the L-lactic acid.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
When a bacteria is
living in your gut,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.050 align:middle line:84%
producing endless amounts
of D-lactic acid--

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.540 align:middle line:84%
D-lactic acid and
L-lactic acid are

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.070 align:middle line:90%
mirror images of each other.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.590 align:middle line:84%
They fit into the same
receptor sites in your brain.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.052 align:middle line:84%
So the D-lactic
acid then amplifies

00:08:34.052 --> 00:08:35.760 align:middle line:84%
every emotion you
have, because it can do

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.590 align:middle line:90%
the same as the L-lactic acid.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:39.690 align:middle line:84%
Except we have no
enzyme to get rid of it,

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:41.400 align:middle line:90%
so it becomes uncontrolled.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.159 align:middle line:84%
So this is why a little bit of
nervousness, all of a sudden,

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:48.120 align:middle line:84%
feels so profound that
you can't breathe.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.470 align:middle line:90%
And you can't control that.

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:90%
And you wonder why.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:90%
And you think, nothing happened.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that I
feel so stressed?

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand why I'm
feeling as strongly as I am,

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.100 align:middle line:84%
severe anger, severe
behavioral problems, you

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.810 align:middle line:84%
see it in children
or adults where

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.320 align:middle line:90%
they can't control that anger.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's just that
amplification of emotion.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.390 align:middle line:90%
It's coming from the gut.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And so how do we
go about healing that?

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.500 align:middle line:84%
If you discover that you're
high in D-lactic acid,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.170 align:middle line:84%
or you might anticipate
that you are, is it foods?

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:90%
Is it supplements?

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:90%
Is it a combination of both?

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Is it traditional
cultured foods?

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we hear a lot
about that, at the moment,

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:27.410 align:middle line:84%
like kefirs, and kombuchas,
or sauerkrauts, or kimchis.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's your approach
to healing the gut bacteria?

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Those foods are fantastic in
helping to keep the environment

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.040 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Though, we're supposed to
colonize our good bacteria

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:84%
through breastfeeding
and through bacteria

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:84%
that come through
our mother, which

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.300 align:middle line:90%
are human strain probiotics.

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.460 align:middle line:84%
So humans strain
probiotics are the type

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.490 align:middle line:84%
that colonize the gut,
where vegetable version

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:84%
probiotics, which
are very beneficial,

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.400 align:middle line:90%
they don't colonize the gut.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.230 align:middle line:90%
They are transient.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.530 align:middle line:90%
So they move through.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.442 align:middle line:84%
So if you're using them on a
daily basis, that's fantastic.

00:09:59.442 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:84%
It will help with
that environment.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.610 align:middle line:84%
But what we want to do is
colonize good bacteria,

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.390 align:middle line:84%
so that they're permanent, so
that you get that ecosystem

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.320 align:middle line:90%
right.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to picking
up an infection that

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:14.210 align:middle line:84%
is D-lactic acid, such as
streptococcus, staphylococcus,

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.920 align:middle line:84%
enterococcus, these are all
D-lactic acid bacterium,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:17.730 align:middle line:90%
very common.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people have heard
of strep throat or staph

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.670 align:middle line:90%
infections on the skin.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
School sores, impetigo, that's
what they're commonly called.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.920 align:middle line:84%
When you're carrying
those in your gut,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.800 align:middle line:84%
they will keep multiplying
and multiplying.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.870 align:middle line:84%
And you can't really alter them
too much by changing something

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.290 align:middle line:90%
in your diet.

00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:39.740 align:middle line:84%
What you really need
to do is be using

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:42.368 align:middle line:84%
different types of antibiotic
herbs, garlic in your diet,

00:10:42.368 --> 00:10:43.660 align:middle line:90%
and different things like that.

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.720 align:middle line:84%
If you've got a very, very
strong infection, such as one

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.030 align:middle line:84%
strong enough to be causing
depression and anxiety,

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:90%
you can use herbal antibiotics.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.310 align:middle line:84%
But you really need to be able
to suppress those bacteria,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and do something about them,
rather than just controlling it

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:58.940 align:middle line:90%
with your diet.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.570 align:middle line:84%
You can make it worse by
eating foods that fuel them,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:05.070 align:middle line:84%
such as carbohydrates,
as I mentioned before,

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:08.810 align:middle line:84%
which is what directly
converts into the acid.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.940 align:middle line:84%
But if you can control
that, you don't

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.060 align:middle line:84%
want to have to rely
on a diet permanently

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:84%
to try and keep your
symptoms at bay.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.620 align:middle line:84%
You want to actually get the
bacteria right, permanently,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.900 align:middle line:84%
so that if you do change
your diet, occasionally,

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't end up
giving you symptoms

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.910 align:middle line:90%
of depression or anxiety.

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So when we talk about
the colonization of the gut,

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:31.070 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned breastfeeding
or breast milk,

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and also I think I'd anticipate
you talking about the birth

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:37.100 align:middle line:84%
process, coming through
the vaginal canal,

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the initial inoculation
through the mouth into the gut.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
But how does somebody
colonize themselves later,

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:84%
like at our age or
if they're older?

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they can't go and
rebirth or take any breast milk

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:90%
again.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, how do we
recolonize our gut?

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.920 align:middle line:84%
Does supplementation do that,
or is that also transient?

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.477 align:middle line:84%
No, no, there are some
amazing companies out there,

00:12:00.477 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:84%
the research companies, the
natural therapies companies,

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.365 align:middle line:84%
that are testing up to thousands
of different probiotics,

00:12:06.365 --> 00:12:09.710 align:middle line:84%
the lactobacillus and the
bifidobacterium ranges.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And there are hundreds of
subtypes of all of those.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And they're testing
them for quality,

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.090 align:middle line:84%
and for endurance, and being
able to get through stomach

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.830 align:middle line:84%
acid, and being able
to survive heat,

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:90%
and all those types of things.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And when they work out
those levels of probiotics

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:27.410 align:middle line:84%
that are strong enough to get
through all of those systems

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.990 align:middle line:84%
that we need to get through,
then they produce those.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.140 align:middle line:84%
And we can use that
in probiotic form.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.540 align:middle line:90%
So if you do use probiotics--

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that you need
to take probiotics for life.

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.240 align:middle line:84%
I think that once you've
colonized a good level of them,

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.910 align:middle line:84%
you can use the food
sources, fermented foods,

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:45.800 align:middle line:90%
to keep your gut flora right.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.612 align:middle line:84%
So as I said, you can
keep those transit ones

00:12:49.612 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:90%
happening all the time.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.700 align:middle line:84%
And they will help prevent
you from picking up

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.060 align:middle line:84%
infections of the D-lactic
acid producing bacteria.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:84%
But if you do happen to
have missed that somehow,

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and have picked up a bacteria
that's changed the ecosystem,

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.292 align:middle line:84%
then you really need to go
through a correction phase

00:13:05.292 --> 00:13:06.500 align:middle line:90%
to be able to get that right.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Like a colonization phase.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Colonization, so reducing the
ones that are causing you harm,

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and colonizing the ones
that need to be colonized.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So that, eventually, you
can change the ratio again.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And that, for some people, can
take as little as three months.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:84%
Some people, on average,
around about six months.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.860 align:middle line:84%
But I have seen some
patients-- generally,

00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:27.170 align:middle line:84%
people become symptomatic
with these symptoms

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:29.600 align:middle line:84%
once they're carrying
at least a million

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.250 align:middle line:90%
of the bacteria in their gut.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:35.440 align:middle line:84%
But I've seen some patients
at 20 to 200 million

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.310 align:middle line:84%
of these D-lactic acid
producing bacteria.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.380 align:middle line:90%
And they're quite depressed.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Then, I've seen some
patients carrying up

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.310 align:middle line:90%
to 300 million bacteria.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And for those, they're not
even tolerating sounds,

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.380 align:middle line:90%
electrical environments.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:84%
So they can feel everything,
because it's a nerve toxin.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So their nervous system is
so awake and alive that they

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.150 align:middle line:84%
can hear things that
are bothering them.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.010 align:middle line:90%
The smells are intensified.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So fuel, the smell
of fuel, really

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.330 align:middle line:84%
causes them quite
severe symptoms.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And those emotions are
just through the roof.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And so when they go through,
say, someone with that level,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.160 align:middle line:84%
or someone with
a moderate level,

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.020 align:middle line:84%
they'll go through a
process, like you said,

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.630 align:middle line:84%
of a few weeks or a few
months of re-colonizing

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.390 align:middle line:84%
or re-inoculating the
gut through probiotics.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So that'll be high doses of
probiotics for that period?

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't tend
to use high doses.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:84%
I tend to just use the
minimum dose of the probiotic.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:31.188 align:middle line:84%
That will take its
time to colonize,

00:14:31.188 --> 00:14:33.230 align:middle line:84%
as long as you keep doing
that during the period.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Consistently.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Consistently.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:84%
The most important
part is suppressing

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.500 align:middle line:90%
those other bacteria.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.468 align:middle line:84%
They can be quite resistant,
can take quite a while to treat.

00:14:42.468 --> 00:14:44.885 align:middle line:84%
>> And you suppress that with
the antibiotic herbs or with

00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:90%
the probiotics?

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.035 align:middle line:84%
>> No, with the
antibiotic herbs.

00:14:47.035 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:84%
>> OK so the first
step is the allergies.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.002 align:middle line:84%
So doing the tests, or
keeping the food dairy,

00:14:53.002 --> 00:14:53.960 align:middle line:90%
removing the allergies.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And the second step
is the bacteria.

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
So ideally, having
the stool test,

00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:84%
and then using the
antibiotic herbs

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:90%
to suppress the bad bacteria.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.410 align:middle line:84%
And using the
probiotics to recolonize

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.010 align:middle line:84%
with the good bacteria
over a period of time.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:14.052 align:middle line:84%
And then taking the fermented
foods as a supportive process,

00:15:14.052 --> 00:15:15.260 align:middle line:90%
once you've done that that's.

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Great, OK.

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:21.067 align:middle line:90%
