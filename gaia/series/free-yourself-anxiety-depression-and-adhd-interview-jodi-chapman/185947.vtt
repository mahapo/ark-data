00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400 align:middle line:90%


00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so the first
step is allergy,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.140 align:middle line:84%
the second step is the
bacteria, the third step is

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.450 align:middle line:90%
the nutrients.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And now the fourth step,
tell us about that.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:19.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Fourth step is diet.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Diet has to come
into it somewhere.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.650 align:middle line:90%
We can't just eat anything.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.230 align:middle line:84%
We need to really stick
with whole foods that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.530 align:middle line:84%
are really dense in nutrients
as best as you can get it.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you get your proteins,
fat, and carb ratio incorrect,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.260 align:middle line:84%
you can be producing
inflammation.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And that inflammation
can then upset the gut

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.305 align:middle line:84%
and then make you more
susceptible to all

00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:43.430 align:middle line:84%
of the other things that
can go wrong with the gut.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.820 align:middle line:84%
So very, very high carb diets
can be pro-inflammatory.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.710 align:middle line:84%
We know that insulins
are the underlying cause

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.540 align:middle line:90%
to most disease these days.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:84%
So being able to
balance that protein

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.920 align:middle line:90%
and carbohydrate balance.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Protein releases hormones
that controls insulin,

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.110 align:middle line:84%
and carbohydrates
releases insulin.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:84%
So if you're able to couple
those together and give

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
yourself great quality,
rich fats in your diet.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Those fats are really important
for your nervous system.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:90%
So your brain is made of fat.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.620 align:middle line:84%
All of the nerves that
run down through your body

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.570 align:middle line:84%
are surrounded by
a lining of fat.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.290 align:middle line:84%
So without your omega 6s,
which are your vegetable

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.390 align:middle line:84%
form of fats, and
your omega 3s, which

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.700 align:middle line:84%
are your animal
forms of fats, you've

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.040 align:middle line:84%
really got to have a great
combination of the two.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.640 align:middle line:84%
And your essential fatty
acids, so your fats,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.540 align:middle line:84%
have to be in the right
ratios, as well, from the omega

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.580 align:middle line:90%
3s and the omega 6s.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's right,
to produce the 9s

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.822 align:middle line:84%
and then be able to have a
rich source of all of it.

00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's very important.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to treating
all of these problems

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.230 align:middle line:84%
in the step-by-step
process that I go through,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:84%
I need to make sure
that someone's diet is

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.100 align:middle line:84%
in the right balance to be
able to control the bacteria.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So the bacteria will, as I
said, feed on carbohydrates.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.920 align:middle line:84%
You can't remove carbohydrates
from someone's diet.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:84%
It is an absolutely essential
food for brain function.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
The brain's initial
food source is glucose.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.980 align:middle line:84%
So without enough
carbohydrates you

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.680 align:middle line:84%
can cause yourself
depression, as well.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:84%
So you can't just
remove carbohydrates

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.900 align:middle line:84%
and be done with it, you need
to get the balance right.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's where a lot of people
don't really know what to do.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.380 align:middle line:84%
So getting that right
is really important.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me, what are some of
the main carbohydrate sources

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.140 align:middle line:84%
or protein sources or fat
sources that you recommend

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
to people as generally great
and healthy for people that are

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:84%
trying to avoid
depression or anxiety?

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.145 align:middle line:84%
>> That question comes down to
what's on their allergy list.

00:02:43.145 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what's on their
sensitivity list?

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.790 align:middle line:84%
So what I do is I go
through their lists,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and we make a diet out
of what they can have.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.670 align:middle line:84%
So we look in the fats and
oils and the nuts and avocados

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.670 align:middle line:84%
and coconut and all of
these beautiful foods.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.960 align:middle line:84%
And then we look at
all the animal products

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.696 align:middle line:84%
that do contain fats,
such as omega 3s

00:03:01.696 --> 00:03:03.950 align:middle line:90%
in your eggs and your fish.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.310 align:middle line:84%
All of these are fantastic
for the brain function.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.620 align:middle line:84%
We look at the carbohydrates
that they can have,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
such as the fruits
that they should have,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:90%
the grains that they can have.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.410 align:middle line:84%
For some people, they're
not gluten intolerant.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So some people are perfectly
fine with breaking down wheat,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.040 align:middle line:84%
for instance, if it's not
overprocessed too much.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.492 align:middle line:84%
Whole products, not
bleached, not overprocessed.

00:03:26.492 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
But then you've
got a lot of people

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.770 align:middle line:84%
who, if they're including
oats in their diet

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.280 align:middle line:84%
or if they're using a lot
of rice in their diet,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.030 align:middle line:84%
they're rich in B
vitamins so that they're

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.450 align:middle line:90%
really important, as well.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's just about getting the
balance of how much they serve

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.870 align:middle line:84%
themselves so that they're
not overdoing their insulin

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.377 align:middle line:84%
production and they're not
feeding the bacteria too badly.

00:03:45.377 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
>> And you do normally suggest
combining those foods together?

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.270 align:middle line:84%
So you talked about
balancing the carbohydrates

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.380 align:middle line:90%
and the proteins.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.940 align:middle line:84%
Do you like to
combine them at meals

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:84%
or do you like to
take them separately?

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's two
schools of thought on that.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of agree with both,
which is a little bit tricky.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.550 align:middle line:84%
Because for those
people who've ever

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:84%
tried food combining, where you
have proteins and vegetables,

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and you keep the carbs
away from that meal,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:84%
that works beautifully for
improving assimilation.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.520 align:middle line:84%
So one stomach acid for protein
is different to the stomach

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.080 align:middle line:90%
acid to carbohydrate.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.399 align:middle line:84%
Where if you have
your carbohydrate

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.149 align:middle line:84%
and your vegetables, or
carbohydrate and fat combined,

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.589 align:middle line:90%
that's a very satisfying meal.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.030 align:middle line:84%
It can give you
energy, as well as

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.270 align:middle line:84%
satisfy you because the
fats make you feel satisfied

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.190 align:middle line:90%
and give you further energy.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:84%
And that stops you
from being hungry.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And that produces another
type of stomach acid.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.810 align:middle line:84%
So keeping your carbs and
proteins away from each other

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:90%
could work in that sense.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.210 align:middle line:84%
However, when you eat
carbohydrates on their own,

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.370 align:middle line:84%
you produce
uncontrolled insulin.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is
rise your insulin level.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
And a few hours later you can
go too low in blood sugar,

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:90%
and then you start to crave.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
And what that does
is sets off a cycle

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.123 align:middle line:84%
of too much carbohydrate
through the day

00:04:55.123 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
because you're
constantly craving,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.940 align:middle line:84%
and your blood sugar is
up and down all day long.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.970 align:middle line:84%
To be able to balance
that, protein does that.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.800 align:middle line:84%
So protein can stabilize
your blood sugar

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.310 align:middle line:90%
for up to eight hours.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.940 align:middle line:84%
So if you start you day
with a great protein meal,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.930 align:middle line:84%
you can have sustained
blood sugar all day long.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.500 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't drop too low.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:84%
You don't get that 3:30-itis,
where you have to go grabbing

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.130 align:middle line:84%
chocolate somewhere or
any carbohydrate meal.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
You can balance
it by doing that.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:90%
So it's a bit of a delicate mix.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:84%
And getting that right can
sometimes take a bit of help

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.030 align:middle line:84%
because it's not something
that we learn mainstream,

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.130 align:middle line:90%
unfortunately.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But everyone's slightly
different, as well.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.243 align:middle line:84%
So it's about finding
what suits that person.

00:05:35.243 --> 00:05:37.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think it sounds
like a combination of both.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.440 align:middle line:84%
But what your general
recommendation might be

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
is to not consume the
carbohydrates on their own

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.240 align:middle line:84%
because that can cause
the blood sugar issues.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So potentially having
it with the protein,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.373 align:middle line:84%
although that can
have another effect,

00:05:48.373 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:84%
but having it with the
protein to stabilize it more.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:84%
Or having the
protein on its own,

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:84%
or having the protein
and the vegetables.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So the fats can
go with anything.

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.440 align:middle line:90%
The fats are beautiful.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:84%
So add the avocado
on everything.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Perfect.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.984 align:middle line:90%
