00:00:04.068 --> 00:00:05.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Hi, it's James here
from "Food Matters."

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to this special
program on seven steps

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.580 align:middle line:84%
to freeing yourself from
anxiety, depression, and ADHD.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.040 align:middle line:84%
My guest today, Jodi Chapman,
is a health scientist

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.100 align:middle line:90%
and naturopath.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.840 align:middle line:84%
And through her clinic, the
Center for Advanced Wellness,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.010 align:middle line:84%
she uses investigative
technologies

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.470 align:middle line:84%
applied with a
naturopathic approach

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.260 align:middle line:84%
and has helped thousands of
people recover their health.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.987 align:middle line:84%
It was through a
personal experience

00:00:27.987 --> 00:00:30.070 align:middle line:84%
that drove Jodi to become
an expert in this field.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Jodi, welcome and
tell us a little bit

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.427 align:middle line:90%
about your experience.

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:33.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I started off at
the age of seven

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.520 align:middle line:90%
with my first recorded migraine.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.470 align:middle line:84%
And these happened to me
probably more than half

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.210 align:middle line:90%
of the week, so almost daily.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.180 align:middle line:84%
But by the time I was 14,
they were happening daily.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.900 align:middle line:84%
So this was extreme
enough to require

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:84%
medication or painkillers
every four hours.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And it was caused by many
different reasons at the time.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.450 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't aware of that.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.830 align:middle line:84%
So from a daily response
to those headaches

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.950 align:middle line:84%
I was on painkillers
every four hours,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I was on caffeine tablets every
four hours to keep me awake.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.610 align:middle line:84%
And I was on a cocktail of
medication from the doctors

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.460 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying to work
out what the cause was

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and/or how to treat it or how
to suppress those headaches.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Though, I didn't
have any success.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.910 align:middle line:84%
So I went through all of my teen
years, or from the age of 7,

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:84%
and it amplified from the age of
14 around that hormonal shift.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I
was 23, that was

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:84%
when I first was
able to get ahold

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:90%
of what was happening there.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.198 align:middle line:84%
But those things were happening
underlying in the background

00:01:47.198 --> 00:01:48.490 align:middle line:90%
and I was getting through life.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And I was very
concerned for my future

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
because I had been on such
high levels of medication

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.920 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't much I could
do to try and control that,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.130 align:middle line:90%
but I'll take the medication.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So I had concerns about having
children later on in life.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.490 align:middle line:84%
How was I going to do that if
I was on such strong medication

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:90%
all the time?

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:84%
Getting through pregnancies,
all of that kind of thing.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I was 20,
unfortunately, I lost my mom.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.660 align:middle line:84%
She passed away, and within
a week of that happening

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I was covered in psoriasis
from head to toe.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And within another three
weeks of that I was hospital

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:84%
hospitalized with ulcerative
colitis bowel disease.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So that then went on
another three years.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
So in and out of hospital,
a lot of surgeries, no real

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.120 align:middle line:90%
answers still.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't until
I was, as I said,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.470 align:middle line:84%
when I was 23, when I started
to look into my health myself,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.480 align:middle line:84%
not getting any
answers, and having

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.387 align:middle line:84%
to find out what it is for me
that was doing all of that.

00:02:49.387 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Was that what inspired you
to study to become a naturopath?

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.870 align:middle line:84%
At the age of 23 was when I
came across a practitioner who

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
actually wasn't a
qualified practitioner.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
He was a massage therapist,
and he had a belief

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
if you cleared out the tubes
and the piping in your body,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.607 align:middle line:84%
you could break out the
disease or break it up,

00:03:14.607 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
break up the blockages
and clear it all out.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And so he did this deep tissue
massage on me, on my gut

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:90%
and on my head.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And within a few weeks he had me
clear of a lot of my symptoms.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, he
gave me a few books to read.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.650 align:middle line:84%
And I'd been raised in
an orthodox medicine

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.580 align:middle line:90%
type of household.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.160 align:middle line:90%
So we never saw naturopaths.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.260 align:middle line:84%
We never looked at
alternative health,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:90%
it was doctor all the way.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And anyway, he gave me a few
books on diet and health.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And I started to read them and
I started to implement them,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.660 align:middle line:90%
and I noticed huge changes.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And that was only
the basic stuff.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.400 align:middle line:84%
So I thought, right, I'm going
to find out more about this.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.530 align:middle line:84%
And I walked straight
down to university

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.640 align:middle line:90%
and signed myself up.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, fantastic.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.358 align:middle line:84%
So after you studied, then
you went into practice,

00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:01.900 align:middle line:84%
and, obviously, you've been in
practice for a number of years

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.140 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, you've
treated thousands of people

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:84%
with anxiety and
depression or helped them

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:90%
recover from their symptoms.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.410 align:middle line:84%
What are some of the symptoms
of depression and anxiety

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and ADHD, and how
would people identify

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.450 align:middle line:90%
that they have these symptoms?

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people don't realize
that they have depression

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:90%
or anxiety.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.080 align:middle line:84%
They see it from a
symptom point of view.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.970 align:middle line:84%
Some of the time
it's very mild, where

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.238 align:middle line:84%
someone might be
just very overwhelmed

00:04:27.238 --> 00:04:28.655 align:middle line:84%
and they're feeling
very stressed.

00:04:28.655 --> 00:04:31.490 align:middle line:84%
They're irritated, they're
becoming intolerant

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.490 align:middle line:84%
of the people around them
and they're really not

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.990 align:middle line:90%
feeling very happy.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it brings on
insomnia, or insomnia

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.110 align:middle line:84%
can start the process where
stress and worry will cause

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.580 align:middle line:90%
them to not sleep very well.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Fatigue will be another symptom.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.320 align:middle line:84%
But when people get
too far into that,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.200 align:middle line:84%
then sadness becomes an
issue or nervousness.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
And this nervousness
and sadness can

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.010 align:middle line:84%
start to become a daily problem
for them, where they can't seem

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.570 align:middle line:90%
to pull themselves out of it.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
They still might not
consider themselves

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.050 align:middle line:84%
as someone who suffers
with depression or anxiety,

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:84%
but they're getting those
symptoms around their lifestyle

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.060 align:middle line:84%
and not really realizing that
it can develop into something

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.030 align:middle line:90%
much more sinister.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.620 align:middle line:84%
And when we hear about
depression and anxiety,

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.410 align:middle line:84%
we hear about things like
serotonin or dopamine.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.710 align:middle line:84%
What happens when people are
low in those particular brain

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.810 align:middle line:90%
chemicals and neurotransmitters?

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Serotonin is quite easy to
distinguish because you get

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.480 align:middle line:84%
negative self-talk
or negativity.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.110 align:middle line:84%
It makes you criticize yourself,
criticize other people.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you consider a small
child at school, the shy child,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.870 align:middle line:84%
they're shy because they're
thinking no one likes me,

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't fit in.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.380 align:middle line:84%
They've got this negative
self-talk happening.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.280 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it
means that they don't feel

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.500 align:middle line:90%
like they fit into society.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.730 align:middle line:84%
And this almost evolves their
personality as time goes on.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.420 align:middle line:84%
But they're most often
suffering with low serotonin.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.170 align:middle line:84%
So criticism of themselves and
of others later on in life.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So if they throw tantrums,
they get more angry,

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.380 align:middle line:90%
they suffer with anxiety.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And that anxiety makes
them feel quite fearful.

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And a fear response always comes
out as aggression or anger.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So you see little children
throwing tantrums and quite

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.700 align:middle line:84%
upset, and it's
because they're afraid.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
So with adults you
get negativity,

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.060 align:middle line:84%
you get sadness, depression, but
you can get anxiety, as well.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So the heights of
anxiety but the lows

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.493 align:middle line:90%
of sadness and depression.

00:06:31.493 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And is that similar
with dopamine, as well,

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.870 align:middle line:84%
when those levels
are suppressed?

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Dopamine can
be very different.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Dopamine deficiency,
people can feel quite happy

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.800 align:middle line:84%
and not even realize that
they've got this problem.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.260 align:middle line:84%
Because dopamine doesn't
cause any negative thoughts,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.170 align:middle line:84%
dopamine deficiency makes
you feel almost nothing.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:52.313 align:middle line:84%
So that feeling of losing
all touch with emotion.

00:06:52.313 --> 00:06:54.730 align:middle line:84%
So they sit on the lounge,
they don't want to do anything.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.938 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to go
anywhere, they lose motivation.

00:06:56.938 --> 00:07:00.040 align:middle line:84%
They think, I just don't
have any drive anymore.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel like going to work.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.480 align:middle line:84%
I used to like gardening
but now I don't care.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.190 align:middle line:84%
I used to want to go to the
gym but now I don't care.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.010 align:middle line:84%
I just want to watch
TV and just enjoy

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.990 align:middle line:90%
sitting here doing nothing.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:90%
A lack of everything.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And that can cause
physical fatigue, as well.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So not only the mental
fatigue, but it goes on

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.600 align:middle line:90%
to cause the physical fatigue.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.570 align:middle line:84%
So difficulty getting
up and doing the things

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.910 align:middle line:84%
that they used to love doing,
even if they get the idea,

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:84%
I know I have to do
it, they physically

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.870 align:middle line:90%
can't get up and do it.

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>> So when a patient is
diagnosed with depression

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.350 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety from their medical
doctor or from their GP

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and they come and see you, do
they always have the illness,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:90%
or what's happening there?

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Are we overdiagnosing these
conditions these days?

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes we find
that patients are given

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.390 align:middle line:84%
the medication for symptoms
that are symptoms of depression

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
or anxiety, such as
fatigue or such as sadness.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.440 align:middle line:84%
When there has been
something emotional happen

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.890 align:middle line:84%
in the household, sometimes that
can build and build and build

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:84%
and can present as
depression to a GP,

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.580 align:middle line:84%
where it may actually be
caused by another problem,

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.540 align:middle line:84%
such as excessive stress
becoming adrenal fatigue.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.760 align:middle line:84%
That kind of thing can
cause all the same symptoms.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.310 align:middle line:84%
So they're treated
with antidepressants,

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.330 align:middle line:84%
though that might not
be the answer for them.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:23.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And how is somebody
typically diagnosed

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.870 align:middle line:84%
with depression or anxiety
from a medical practitioner?

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.450 align:middle line:84%
Not from yourself, but from the
mainstream medical community.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.270 align:middle line:84%
>> As far as I'm aware,
it's purely symptom-based.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:34.110 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.539 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a
subjective checklist.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.414 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel like this,
do you feel like that?

00:08:37.414 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:90%
And then it's diagnosed.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And when you have patients
come to you on antidepressants

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:47.700 align:middle line:84%
or on anxiety
medication, are they

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.310 align:middle line:84%
able to get off their
medication or treat

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:90%
these diseases naturally?

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.070 align:middle line:84%
How do you normally
approach that?

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:55.560 align:middle line:84%
>> What I find is that there
are a very small percentage

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.460 align:middle line:84%
of people who do rely on that
medication in life-threatening

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:03.120 align:middle line:84%
type situations, such as when
they're extremely suicidal.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.520 align:middle line:84%
Those people should
never consider coming off

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:84%
their antidepressants
unless things have changed

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:09.520 align:middle line:90%
dramatically for their health.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
But there are 99% of my patients
never get to that extreme.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So they're being
medicated, yet it's never

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.390 align:middle line:84%
going to be the point for
them as being suicidal.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So for those
patients, the goal is

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.750 align:middle line:84%
to replenish their
system of everything

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
that they need to build them
back up to optimal levels

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.510 align:middle line:84%
so that they're feeling so good
that then they can go and talk

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
to their doctor about
coming off their medication.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And we talk about
antidepressants and being put

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.080 align:middle line:84%
on these, but when we understand
what causes depression,

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.600 align:middle line:84%
there's so many different
theories out there.

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.250 align:middle line:84%
It could be originating
from the gut,

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.130 align:middle line:84%
it could be originating
from emotional trauma.

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.830 align:middle line:84%
What do you believe to be
the root cause of depression

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:90%
in the first place?

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:59.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It can come from both ways.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.700 align:middle line:84%
The brain and the
gut is so intertwined

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.590 align:middle line:84%
that they both use the same
brain chemicals to work.

00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people don't
realize that serotonin

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:84%
is used only 10% to 20% in
the brain for your mood.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:18.000 align:middle line:84%
The rest, the 80% to 90%, is
used to make your bowels move.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So some people
never get depression

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:84%
but they'll have
lifelong constipation.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:90%
And it's the same problem.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:90%
So the same goes with dopamine.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.442 align:middle line:90%
It's manufactured in the gut.

00:10:27.442 --> 00:10:29.400 align:middle line:84%
So if you've got something
going on in the gut,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.250 align:middle line:84%
then your brain is where
it misses out first.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And you start to get mood
symptoms or mental health

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.710 align:middle line:90%
symptoms.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.382 align:middle line:84%
Yet really, the process
is going on in the gut.

00:10:38.382 --> 00:10:39.840 align:middle line:84%
There are, however,
a lot of people

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:84%
who do start with
the emotional trauma.

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Something will
happen in their life,

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it was from
childhood and they've

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.910 align:middle line:84%
been through a lifelong
stressful environment,

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:90%
such as abused children.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.410 align:middle line:84%
They are always needing to
produce so much more brain

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.230 align:middle line:84%
chemical in their gut but
they don't necessarily

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:00.630 align:middle line:84%
get the nutrients in the
diet to be able to do that.

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:06.300 align:middle line:84%
So they will develop a lifestyle
of behavioral problems or mood

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:07.740 align:middle line:84%
disorders because
they never knew

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.420 align:middle line:90%
what it felt like to feel good.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:13.265 align:middle line:84%
Yet it's still that the
stress that they experience,

00:11:13.265 --> 00:11:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and the same goes
with anyone who

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.260 align:middle line:84%
goes through a trauma or
a family death or divorce

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.050 align:middle line:84%
or any of these types
of things, the stress

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.872 align:middle line:84%
requires a whole lot
more nutrients to be

00:11:23.872 --> 00:11:25.830 align:middle line:84%
able to make those brain
chemicals so that they

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:29.040 align:middle line:84%
can keep up with the emotions
and keep up with their moods.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Yet, if they don't get it from
their diet in higher levels

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:34.380 align:middle line:84%
during that time, they
suffer with the symptoms

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:35.790 align:middle line:90%
and the symptoms continue.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a then
biochemical problem

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.690 align:middle line:84%
where it started as
an emotional problem.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:42.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.652 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:11:44.652 --> 00:11:46.610 align:middle line:84%
We talked about the
serotonin and the dopamine,

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.985 align:middle line:84%
but are there any
brain chemicals

00:11:47.985 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:84%
that are implemented
with mental health

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.220 align:middle line:90%
or with anxiety or depression?

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.550 align:middle line:84%
>> There aren't actually that
many brain chemicals that they

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.810 align:middle line:90%
haven't--

00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.700 align:middle line:84%
They don't talk
about a lot of them,

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:84%
but a couple of other
ones that I find

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.180 align:middle line:90%
very important in looking at.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.720 align:middle line:84%
One called acetylcholine,
which is actually

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.730 align:middle line:84%
in control of balancing your
fight and flight response.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you don't have
enough of that brain chemical

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.678 align:middle line:84%
you can fall into
that stress response

00:12:14.678 --> 00:12:16.970 align:middle line:84%
where you're always on the
go, you're always panicking,

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.200 align:middle line:90%
you're always nervous.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.270 align:middle line:84%
For those people, that
brain chemical actually

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.950 align:middle line:90%
controls your digestion.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So when you irritate
your gut, it

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:28.640 align:middle line:84%
becomes deficient because it's
trying to digest those foods.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.340 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to keep you in that
calm state of rest and digest.

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.660 align:middle line:84%
And when you use up all
of that brain chemical

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.580 align:middle line:84%
you fall into the fight
or flight response,

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.705 align:middle line:90%
and you get stuck in there.

00:12:38.705 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
So you're always on the
go, you're always stressed,

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:84%
you're burning up
your hormones, you're

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.560 align:middle line:84%
getting high cortisol
level, and you're

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.540 align:middle line:90%
in that rush, rush, rush phase.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.550 align:middle line:84%
And that can cause
anxiety that then

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.800 align:middle line:90%
becomes an ongoing problem.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:84%
We've got GABA,
as well, which is

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:56.150 align:middle line:84%
another one that can be a
problem specifically for kids

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.410 align:middle line:90%
in ADHD.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:02.030 align:middle line:84%
So GABA's job is to calm
down too much excitation.

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't
have enough GABA,

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.050 align:middle line:84%
your moods can just
keep escalating.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.880 align:middle line:84%
So for some people, they get
anxiety, stress, everything

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.680 align:middle line:90%
goes up.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:13.160 align:middle line:84%
But for kids, some of them
go into hypervigilance

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and distractability
because they've

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.047 align:middle line:90%
got nothing to keep them calm.

00:13:16.047 --> 00:13:17.630 align:middle line:84%
So they're all over
the place, they're

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:84%
looking all over the place, and
their thinking is everywhere.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.870 align:middle line:84%
And they get the
diagnosis of ADHD

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:26.450 align:middle line:84%
when it could be a
nutritional deficiency causing

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
that inability to produce that
particular brain chemical.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:34.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's funny how you see
so many patients coming in that

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.250 align:middle line:84%
have been diagnosed with ADHD
or depression or anxiety,

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
and you might be
looking at them going,

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.558 align:middle line:84%
hang on, we've got a gut issue
here or we've got a nutrient

00:13:41.558 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:90%
uptake issue here.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.700 align:middle line:84%
And yet they're being put on
these dangerous medications

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.630 align:middle line:90%
a lot of the time.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.400 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big challenge.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Though, when you break it
down to where it comes from

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.770 align:middle line:84%
and you start
treating those things,

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.360 align:middle line:84%
the challenge falls
away very quickly

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.430 align:middle line:84%
because you start to see
really quick changes.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.230 align:middle line:84%
And when someone's
deficient in something,

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.990 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't take very long
to be able to produce

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.310 align:middle line:90%
that pathway for them.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little bit
just like building.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.360 align:middle line:90%
All you need is the material.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So you supply the material,
and within days and weeks

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:90%
you just see them change.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's not required anymore,
if they're on the medication,

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.620 align:middle line:84%
you see them then
move into a site
