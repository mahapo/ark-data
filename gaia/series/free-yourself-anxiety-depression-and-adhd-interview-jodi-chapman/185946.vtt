00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Tell me about the third step.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.060 align:middle line:84%
>> The third step is nutrients,
so nutrients are very important

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.150 align:middle line:84%
to make all of our brain
chemicals or to produce

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.440 align:middle line:90%
anything in our body.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.478 align:middle line:84%
But when you go through
a period of time,

00:00:23.478 --> 00:00:25.520 align:middle line:84%
where you've been eating
foods you're allergic to

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.108 align:middle line:84%
and your gut is
inflamed, or you've

00:00:27.108 --> 00:00:29.525 align:middle line:84%
been carrying gut bacteria
that causes gut inflammation as

00:00:29.525 --> 00:00:29.660 align:middle line:90%
well--

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is step
one and step two.

00:00:31.077 --> 00:00:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Step one and step two.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.880 align:middle line:84%
What you find is
that the body hasn't

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.130 align:middle line:84%
been able to absorb
nutrients for quite awhile.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.560 align:middle line:84%
So then we find secondary
reasons for depression.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So we find nutrient
deficiencies,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.170 align:middle line:90%
often vitamin B12 is low.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Vitamin D can be low.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Iron, folate-- a lot
of these nutrients

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.250 align:middle line:84%
are necessary for
the brain chemicals.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And we haven't
absorbed them very well

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.500 align:middle line:84%
over the period of time,
so we become deficient.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So we need to go
through and check

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.280 align:middle line:84%
what our deficiencies
are, and get them

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.120 align:middle line:84%
back up to normal levels at the
same time as correcting the gut

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.210 align:middle line:84%
function so that you
can then lift yourself

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.050 align:middle line:84%
into an optimal level
and provide the ability

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.640 align:middle line:84%
to make those brain
chemicals all at once.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So if we're low on vitamin
D or we're low on B12,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.660 align:middle line:84%
do you recommend
supplementation,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
or do you recommend food-based
sources, a combination of both?

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean--

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.050 align:middle line:90%
>> A combination of both.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:84%
You always should be
having a varied diet anyway

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.110 align:middle line:84%
to be able to absorb
your nutrients,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.240 align:middle line:84%
and yes, if someone's
iron deficient,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.260 align:middle line:84%
we need to encourage them
getting those really rich iron

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.010 align:middle line:84%
sources from their
food so that they don't

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:90%
rely on supplements long term.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a believer in people
taking supplements long term,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:84%
but I am a believer in
someone taking supplements

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.060 align:middle line:84%
for the period of time
that it takes to get them

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.620 align:middle line:84%
from absolutely no nutrition
level up to a standard level,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.290 align:middle line:84%
because otherwise, it can take a
very, very long time if they're

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:84%
relying on what they're
getting from their diet.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.420 align:middle line:84%
These days, the food that is
available to us isn't always

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.890 align:middle line:84%
rich in those nutrients, isn't
always as rich as it could be,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
can't necessarily

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.090 align:middle line:84%
afford organic food as
well, even though that would

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.979 align:middle line:90%
be fantastic and the optimum.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Being able to get there,
being able to spend

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.300 align:middle line:84%
the money on that, it's
not always available.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.870 align:middle line:84%
So taking nutrients for that
period of time to get them back

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.150 align:middle line:84%
to that level and
then relying on diet

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.450 align:middle line:90%
to keep their body right.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.410 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so-- and do you find that
those nutrients that you just

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.060 align:middle line:84%
mentioned-- the B12,
the vitamin D, the--

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.060 align:middle line:90%
what were the other two?

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.750 align:middle line:90%
>> The iron.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:90%
>> The iron.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, the iodine [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And the iodine, and
then did you say B3?

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, B3's important.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.090 align:middle line:90%
Niacin as well.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Folate-- all of
those B vitamins are

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.510 align:middle line:84%
necessary for brain
chemical production.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're the most common
ones that you find that people

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.660 align:middle line:84%
are deficient in when suffering
from depression and anxiety

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:90%
and ADHD?

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, generally.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:84%
The electrolytes seem
to not be too much

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:84%
of an issue, such as magnesium
and calcium, potassium.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
These kinds of things only
tend to shift a little bit,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.190 align:middle line:84%
and they tend to shift when
you have allergy responses.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.610 align:middle line:84%
But the nutrients are
very, very important,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.820 align:middle line:84%
and they really have to be
there to fill those pathways

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.590 align:middle line:90%
to those brain chemicals.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.260 align:middle line:84%
You also need to look
at genetic issues that

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.990 align:middle line:84%
may cause you to not absorb
your nutrients properly.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.620 align:middle line:84%
And these can affect up
to 40% of the population.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So there's a condition
called pyroluria, where it

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:90%
is affecting a lot of people.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.150 align:middle line:84%
It is an inability to
absorb zinc and B6.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Now zinc and B6 are necessary
for you to produce stomach

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
acid, but they are the
most abundant nutrients

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
to be able to produce
every brain chemical.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.037 align:middle line:84%
So without that supplementation
for those people,

00:03:41.037 --> 00:03:43.370 align:middle line:84%
and they might not know that
they've got this condition,

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:84%
and they will have
had it from birth.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
These people grow
up as shy children.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.480 align:middle line:84%
They're nervous,
they're anxious,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.050 align:middle line:84%
and they can develop depression
or anxiety further on in life

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.450 align:middle line:90%
or that fear, ongoing fears.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.110 align:middle line:90%
It can cause insomnia.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.570 align:middle line:90%
It can cause--

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
I find it causes other
problems, such as allergy

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and bacterial problems later,
because food allergy needs

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.070 align:middle line:84%
really good stomach acid to
be able to process your food.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:84%
And zinc and B6 is
necessary for stomach acid.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.339 align:middle line:84%
And then your stomach
acid is required

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.250 align:middle line:90%
to protect you from bacteria.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.810 align:middle line:84%
You're swallowing
bacteria every single day.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.570 align:middle line:84%
The stomach acid is designed
to kill that and stop it

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.312 align:middle line:90%
from colonizing in your gut.

00:04:25.312 --> 00:04:27.020 align:middle line:84%
So if you don't have
enough stomach acid,

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:84%
because you have a
zinc or B6 deficiency,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.853 align:middle line:84%
you're more likely to suffer
with bacterial infections

00:04:32.853 --> 00:04:34.770 align:middle line:84%
than someone who can go
anywhere in the world,

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.790 align:middle line:84%
and they call them an
iron gut people that

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle line:90%
never get affected by anything.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.870 align:middle line:84%
They've got really rich
levels of zinc and B6,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.680 align:middle line:84%
and their body's
digesting properly.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a
digestive issue,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.670 align:middle line:84%
it can cause all of these
nutritional deficiencies.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>> There's also another
genetic disorder,

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.040 align:middle line:84%
which can cause under
or over-methylation,

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.390 align:middle line:84%
and that's inability
to absorb folate or B9.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.300 align:middle line:84%
So those people
can respond worse

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.680 align:middle line:90%
when you give them feel folate.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
They need to have it converted
in their body for them.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.920 align:middle line:84%
They also need to have
some liver support to be

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.540 align:middle line:90%
able to methylate properly.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.090 align:middle line:84%
That under or
over-methylation problem

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.380 align:middle line:84%
can cause anxiety,
depression, really high

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.880 align:middle line:84%
performing people,
so perfectionists,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.210 align:middle line:90%
or very nervous type people.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.243 align:middle line:84%
It can look like a
personality trait,

00:05:25.243 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
but it actually comes
down to the liver.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:84%
So for the layperson who
can try to maybe identify

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.160 align:middle line:84%
some of the foods
they are allergic to

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.660 align:middle line:84%
and remove them,
or have a test done

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.800 align:middle line:84%
with their local practitioner,
and the next step

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.200 align:middle line:84%
is they get a stool
analysis, and they

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.680 align:middle line:84%
start supplementing with
the probiotics and also

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.310 align:middle line:90%
the herbal antibiotics.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.320 align:middle line:90%
Then they get to the nutrients.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.807 align:middle line:84%
How are you able to
determine what nutrients

00:05:50.807 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:90%
you might be deficient in?

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.630 align:middle line:84%
Is that like a hair
and mineral analysis,

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:84%
or are there general
supplement recommendations

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.248 align:middle line:84%
that you make for
people that are going

00:05:58.248 --> 00:05:59.540 align:middle line:90%
through anxiety and depression?

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:90%
Or you don't [INAUDIBLE] that?

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.330 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I-- being that I've been
working with this for so long,

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.895 align:middle line:84%
my experience tells me what
someone might be deficient

00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:10.070 align:middle line:90%
in in terms of brain chemicals.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:12.830 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll fill that
pathway with basic nutrients,

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.130 align:middle line:90%
so that's one component.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.755 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot
of nutrients that I

00:06:15.755 --> 00:06:18.580 align:middle line:84%
won't give unless a blood
test shows that it's down.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So what are some of the
general ones that you would

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.120 align:middle line:90%
recommend for most people?

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, generally,
magnesium, vitamin C,

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.670 align:middle line:84%
a good rich complex vitamin
B, or multivitamin zinc--

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:90%
so important.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:84%
You almost can't
overdose on zinc.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.790 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of people
who are deficient in zinc.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:41.088 align:middle line:84%
>> So zinc,
magnesium, vitamin C,

00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and a really strong B
vitamin [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%
