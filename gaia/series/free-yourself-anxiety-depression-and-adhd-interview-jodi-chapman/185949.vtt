00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.410 align:middle line:84%
>> So Jodi, tell me
about the sixth step.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The sixth step is hormones,
and one of the most important

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.410 align:middle line:84%
things that we need to know
about hormones is that they

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.087 align:middle line:90%
never go out on their own.

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:21.920 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people come
to me, and they say,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle line:90%
my hormones are out of balance.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.010 align:middle line:90%
I need them balanced.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.050 align:middle line:90%
What can we do about it?

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And they expect to
be given a cream,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.980 align:middle line:84%
and they expect to be given
herbs to balance them back up.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.380 align:middle line:84%
But what I've found is
that if you try and treat

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:84%
hormones without finding out
why they're out of balance,

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.020 align:middle line:84%
whatever you give them
might last for two weeks,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.603 align:middle line:84%
and then they're out
of balance again.

00:00:40.603 --> 00:00:42.560 align:middle line:90%
And it just won't sustain.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.040 align:middle line:84%
Hormones are actually
affected by everything,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.810 align:middle line:90%
so your hormones are--

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.020 align:middle line:84%
if we go back through
all of the other steps,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.300 align:middle line:84%
allergies will throw
out your hormones,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
because allergies actually
make you retain fluid.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And that fluid retention
has an instant impact

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.560 align:middle line:90%
on causing a hormonal imbalance.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Your bacteria amplifies
hormonal problems.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Your nutrients are required
to make your hormones.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.060 align:middle line:84%
Your diet is very important
in controlling insulin

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:84%
and glucagon, which
are dietary hormones.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:84%
And they will impact all
of your other hormones.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got stress,
which produces too much

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.170 align:middle line:84%
cortisol, if you're
very stressed,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.150 align:middle line:90%
and affects your DHEA levels.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.870 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is then
impact how much of your other

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:84%
hormones that you can produce,
as a lot of your hormones--

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.880 align:middle line:84%
your testosterone
and your estrogen--

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.980 align:middle line:84%
is produced by your
DHEA, so if you're

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.800 align:middle line:84%
declining in DHEA because
of long term adrenal

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.570 align:middle line:84%
insufficiency, you will
decline in those other hormones

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.370 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
So you can get mood disturbances
from a ratio difference

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:84%
between estrogen
and progesterone,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.080 align:middle line:84%
which is women
with PMS symptoms.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.190 align:middle line:90%
You can get--

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:84%
>> So they need to get rid
of estrogen and increase

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:90%
the progesterone.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.895 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's right, and
progesterone can be quite

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:58.550 align:middle line:84%
difficult to increase, if you're
eating foods you're allergic

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.560 align:middle line:84%
to-- for instance, if
you're very stressed,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.720 align:middle line:84%
because both of those
things drop your thyroid,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.510 align:middle line:84%
and your thyroid has a role
in helping with progesterone

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:90%
production.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.889 align:middle line:84%
Same as dopamine has a role
in progesterone production.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So all of these initial
steps we talked about

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.280 align:middle line:84%
are all very, very important in
making your hormones balanced.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So in most cases, what
I find is once I've

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.050 align:middle line:84%
been through the first
five steps with people,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
their hormones are
almost optimum.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And then what we do is have
a look at what's remaining,

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.580 align:middle line:84%
and there might be
imbalances caused

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:84%
by a lifetime of imbalances,
where the body will then

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.690 align:middle line:84%
need encouragement to
balance those hormones again.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And that might mean
using certain herbs

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.120 align:middle line:84%
to help raise your progesterone
levels or certain nutrients

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.930 align:middle line:84%
that are required to make
those, using certain nutrients

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.300 align:middle line:84%
to clear estrogen out
through your liver.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.030 align:middle line:84%
Your liver has a major
role in estrogen clearance,

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.400 align:middle line:84%
and when that's not
doing its job properly,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.422 align:middle line:84%
you find that estrogen
can be too high.

00:02:54.422 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:84%
And that will change the
ratio between estrogen

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and progesterone as well,
not to mention leading

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
to other diseases,
like estrogen dominance

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.780 align:middle line:84%
has been linked to cancers and
all sorts of other problems.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.570 align:middle line:84%
So tell me practical steps
for increasing progesterone

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.360 align:middle line:84%
and decreasing estrogen. Are
you into topical progesterone,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.880 align:middle line:84%
or are you into
supplementing DHEA,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.980 align:middle line:84%
or what sort of supplements
do you recommend?

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.450 align:middle line:90%
What's your general approach?

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:84%
>> What I find is once we're at
a situation where everything is

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.090 align:middle line:84%
being done to
remove the problems,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.600 align:middle line:84%
the most common problem you
find is low progesterone.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And as I said, your thyroid
is responsible for helping

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:90%
that production.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:84%
Now your thyroid will
decline or drop in function

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.810 align:middle line:84%
when you eat foods
you're allergic to

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.530 align:middle line:90%
or when you are very stressed.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.440 align:middle line:84%
So you want to make sure
you are using everything

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
you can, such as iodide
and selenium and nutrients,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.052 align:middle line:84%
to make your thyroid
work at its best.

00:03:50.052 --> 00:03:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And that will help your
progesterone production

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.810 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.610 align:middle line:90%
But dopamine is also reliant--

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.410 align:middle line:84%
progesterone is also
reliant on dopamine,

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.640 align:middle line:84%
so making sure you're
getting your vitamin

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.380 align:middle line:84%
C and your nutrients
that help you

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:84%
make that dopamine production
and balancing your lifestyle,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.487 align:middle line:84%
you know, using those stress
controls like yoga and all

00:04:08.487 --> 00:04:10.070 align:middle line:84%
of those things we
talked about before

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.110 align:middle line:84%
and making sure that you
can balance your life

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.248 align:middle line:90%
to help with the progesterone.

00:04:14.248 --> 00:04:16.040 align:middle line:84%
There are different
herbs that you can use.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:90%
There are progesteronic herbs.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.029 align:middle line:84%
You know, people have heard
of Chaste Tree and Dong Quai

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.230 align:middle line:84%
and a few of these other
herbs that you can use,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.260 align:middle line:84%
but you really
should be finding out

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.480 align:middle line:84%
exactly what your
problem is, because there

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
can be a multitude of
different imbalances or levels

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.890 align:middle line:84%
that can cause all
the same symptoms,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.880 align:middle line:84%
and you need to know
what it is for you.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.970 align:middle line:84%
So estrogen dominance,
for instance-- as I said,

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.820 align:middle line:84%
we support the liver
by clearing that out so

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:84%
that we have an ability to use
that estrogen that we have,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.693 align:middle line:90%
and then get rid of it.

00:04:50.693 --> 00:04:52.610 align:middle line:84%
But we want to also be
able to make sure we're

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:90%
making enough estrogen as well.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.510 align:middle line:84%
Now your estrogen
and your progesterone

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.955 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
hormones are also

00:04:57.955 --> 00:04:59.330 align:middle line:84%
made through your
adrenal glands,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.180 align:middle line:84%
not only through your
tissues and your ovaries.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.060 align:middle line:84%
So-- and with men with
their testes also.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.130 align:middle line:84%
So producing
testosterone can also

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.730 align:middle line:84%
be produced through
the adrenal gland.

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is why stress is
a very important factor.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.280 align:middle line:84%
We need to make sure that our
adrenal glands are functioning

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:84%
very well so that as our sex
hormones decline with age,

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:84%
our adrenal glands can take
over and do the job for us.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.430 align:middle line:84%
So to be able to make
all of those also

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.010 align:middle line:84%
then relies on stress
management techniques

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.960 align:middle line:90%
and toning your adrenal glands.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.250 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to DHEA, if
someone is declined enough

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.950 align:middle line:84%
that they're not making it at
all or incredibly low levels,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.230 align:middle line:84%
you can supplement with DHEA
until you repair the system.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:84%
But I don't believe
in giving hormones

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.150 align:middle line:84%
externally in the
majority of cases,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:84%
unless you're also giving
herbs to encourage the body

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.230 align:middle line:90%
to make it themselves.

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.430 align:middle line:84%
So there are certain herbs, such
as your adrenal adaptogen type

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.250 align:middle line:84%
herbs, that will encourage your
adrenal glands to be working

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.610 align:middle line:84%
better, and they will
help improve your ability

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:90%
to make those hormones again.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.127 align:middle line:84%
But they can take
quite a while to do.

00:06:05.127 --> 00:06:06.710 align:middle line:84%
And in the meantime,
for someone who's

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:84%
bed-bound because of
chronic fatigue syndrome,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.730 align:middle line:84%
because of low DHEA, they may
require that supplementation

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.730 align:middle line:90%
for that period of time.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, understood.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.175 align:middle line:84%
But your general premise
is start at the beginning.

00:06:17.175 --> 00:06:17.975 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:06:17.975 --> 00:06:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Start with the allergies.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.718 align:middle line:84%
Start with the
backed up bacteria.

00:06:20.718 --> 00:06:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Start with the nutrients.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.593 align:middle line:90%
Start with the diet.

00:06:22.593 --> 00:06:23.780 align:middle line:90%
Start with the stress.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.490 align:middle line:90%
And then look at all those.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't believe that there is
any reason to give a supplement

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.510 align:middle line:90%
for anything.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
If you continue to put
the problem into the body,

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.000 align:middle line:84%
all you're doing is
band-aiding, and that

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.580 align:middle line:90%
should never be the goal.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.540 align:middle line:84%
You need to always look at
removing the causes first,

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.660 align:middle line:84%
then replenishing all of the
nutrients required to do it

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
yourself so that when your
body is doing it yourself,

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.770 align:middle line:84%
all you then need to rely on
is your own diet and lifestyle.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.410 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you ask anyone to
stay on supplements for life,

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.900 align:middle line:84%
they are going to look at
you and think you're crazy.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's not
something we want to do,

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:04.217 align:middle line:84%
but when you have a problem that
is so vast in your body, where

00:07:04.217 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:84%
it's filtered through
all different systems,

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.970 align:middle line:84%
because it's been
going on too long,

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:09.890 align:middle line:84%
you don't really have
much of a choice.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.868 align:middle line:84%
But to spend that period of
time recovering with support,

00:07:12.868 --> 00:07:14.660 align:middle line:84%
and that support may
come from supplements.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:90%
It may come from herbs.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.680 align:middle line:84%
It may come from
changing your diet.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:84%
It may come from controlling
those gut bacteria.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.980 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you need to do
to correct your situation,

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.950 align:middle line:84%
and then when you're in that
state of maintenance, you go on

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.090 align:middle line:84%
and you control it
with a great lifestyle.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So I met a medical
doctor once in the US,

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.780 align:middle line:84%
and he was a very high level
integrative practitioner.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.092 align:middle line:84%
He said, anytime you
use a drug or anytime

00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:39.800 align:middle line:84%
you use a supplement,
you should treat it

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.880 align:middle line:84%
like a crutch, when
you have a broken leg.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> You're on a crutch for a
period of time, until it heals,

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
and then you come off it,
and your body will progress

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:47.710 align:middle line:90%
naturally.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's
right, and you know,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I've seen patients who've
been on supplements for life.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.060 align:middle line:84%
They've been naturopath
shopping or doctor shopping,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.810 align:middle line:84%
and they just keep going to
new practitioners all the time.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And the cause was
never found for them.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.280 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
important thing that you

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:84%
can do for any
person or any patient

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.870 align:middle line:90%
is to investigate their health.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.220 align:middle line:90%
Get the diagnosis right.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.600 align:middle line:90%
The diagnosis is the answer.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:84%
If you get that right, you
can target their problem,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.850 align:middle line:84%
and the rest will
start to improve.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:84%
If you get the
diagnosis wrong, they're

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.480 align:middle line:84%
reliant on symptomatic
treatment alone.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.800 align:middle line:84%
>> That never
changes their life.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.175 align:middle line:84%
They are reliant on it for
life, and they never get well.

00:08:26.175 --> 00:08:28.910 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's the same philosophy
as the conventional medical

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:31.380 align:middle line:84%
paradigm, which is relying on
symptomatic treatment only.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, that's right.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:39.467 align:middle line:90%
