[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:08.126 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.126 --> 00:00:15.930 align:middle line:10%
>> We think that we see
our beliefs in the world.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.140 align:middle line:90%
So beliefs are actually meaning.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So something happens,
we get criticized,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.550 align:middle line:84%
and we give it the meaning, oh,
I guess I'm not good enough.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And then we get
criticized again,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.652 align:middle line:84%
and we go, yeah,
I'm not good enough.

00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And then the third time
we give it the meaning,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:90%
the meaning becomes a belief.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Now I have a belief.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.060 align:middle line:84%
And we look at our
childhoods, and we go--

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.283 align:middle line:84%
and when I ask this question
to people from, again,

00:00:45.283 --> 00:00:46.450 align:middle line:90%
every country in the world--

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.800 align:middle line:84%
I work on zoom, so I
have clients in Uganda--

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and I say, doesn't it seem like
you saw I'm not good enough?

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
And they say,
well, I did see it.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.760 align:middle line:90%
And I say, really?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.410 align:middle line:90%
Can you see my scarf?

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.520 align:middle line:90%
They say yes.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.470 align:middle line:84%
Does it have a color,
shape, and location?

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.930 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Does, I'm not good enough, have
a color, shape, and location?

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.800 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:90%
You can't see, I'm not good.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.230 align:middle line:84%
But before we do
that, they say, well,

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.890 align:middle line:84%
but I saw my father
criticize me,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:84%
and I saw I didn't
get A's in school,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.530 align:middle line:84%
and I saw my mother tell
me that I would never

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.780 align:middle line:84%
amount to anything, or
all the wonderful things

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.450 align:middle line:84%
that sometimes people
say to children.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.670 align:middle line:90%
I saw I wasn't important.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:84%
No, you saw your parents
busy working all the time,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.820 align:middle line:84%
not being at home, not
paying attention to you.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.470 align:middle line:90%
That's seeable.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.360 align:middle line:90%
But you cannot see a belief.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.610 align:middle line:90%
So that's how they get formed.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.850 align:middle line:90%
Now, why do they run our lives?

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.195 align:middle line:84%
If you believe
that water is hot,

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:53.820 align:middle line:84%
are you going to put
your finger in it?

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.460 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:84%
If you believe, I don't
deserve good things--

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to rattle
off a lot of common beliefs

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.010 align:middle line:90%
people have--

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.490 align:middle line:84%
are you going to ask
for what you want?

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to buy
yourself a nice new car?

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.710 align:middle line:90%
You just won't.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, the beliefs
are unconscious.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle line:84%
So when I work with people,
they don't come in and go,

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.620 align:middle line:90%
I have this belief.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Can I get rid of it?

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And first of all, nobody cares
about getting rid of beliefs.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.810 align:middle line:84%
You care about getting
rid of patterns.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.540 align:middle line:84%
You want to get rid of the
fact that you procrastinate.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.910 align:middle line:84%
You want to get rid of the
fact that you don't speak up

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:90%
You don't ask for what you want.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.910 align:middle line:90%
You haven't asked for a raise.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:84%
You let people take
advantage of you.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Whatever it is.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.870 align:middle line:84%
So if you believe,
I'm not important,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.045 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
sit in a meeting,

00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:45.420 align:middle line:84%
and the little
voice in your head

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:84%
is going to go, yeah, no,
they probably know this,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:84%
or, nobody cares
what you have to say.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And that voice comes
from your beliefs,

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.780 align:middle line:90%
and so you don't speak up.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.380 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.620 align:middle line:90%
It's so simple.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:84%
If you believe, I'm going
to get what I want--

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.290 align:middle line:90%
here's a really good example.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the most common
beliefs, James--

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's shocking,
because evidence does not

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.300 align:middle line:90%
get rid of beliefs.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
I have worked with five Harvard
PhDs who had the belief,

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm stupid.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:84%
I said, but you have
a PhD from Harvard.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I conned my
way through Harvard.

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.170 align:middle line:84%
The first time I heard
that I was like, what?

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:84%
But when he was a
boy, his father,

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.167 align:middle line:84%
every time he would say
something that wasn't correct,

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
his father would smack him
on the back of the head

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.770 align:middle line:90%
and say, genius.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.190 align:middle line:90%
So again, I saw, I was stupid.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.340 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that I have
evidence to the contrary

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.970 align:middle line:90%
does not change beliefs.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So these beliefs run us, even
if we know they're not true.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.777 align:middle line:84%
When I ask people, do
you have the belief--

00:04:07.777 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
because they tell me, I
can never get what I want,

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.027 align:middle line:84%
and I'm always efforting,
and I'm always struggling,

00:04:12.027 --> 00:04:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and money comes hard,
everything comes hard.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So I'll say to them,
say this out loud,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.120 align:middle line:84%
because this is how you test
to see if you have a belief.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Say, life is hard.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.910 align:middle line:84%
And they look at me and
they go, well, life is hard.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.080 align:middle line:90%
That's not a belief.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.260 align:middle line:90%
Life is hard.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.430 align:middle line:84%
There are certain beliefs
that are so real to people.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.630 align:middle line:84%
For many years, my husband
thought that we come in,

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.040 align:middle line:84%
we form beliefs, and
then we give meaning,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.710 align:middle line:90%
given the beliefs that we form.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we realized-- we sat
and we really looked at this--

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.885 align:middle line:84%
and we realized that
meaning comes first.

00:04:56.885 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:90%
So you come into the world.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.690 align:middle line:90%
You give meaning.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.560 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.090 align:middle line:90%
Why are my parents struggling?

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.605 align:middle line:84%
Well, I guess money's
scarce and hard to get.

00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:05.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, there they are.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.650 align:middle line:90%
They're struggling again.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.690 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, boy, it really
looks like money

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.280 align:middle line:90%
is scarce and hard to get.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And at some point, you
start believing it.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, your beliefs will determine
the meaning you give events.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So for instance,
let's assume somebody

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.130 align:middle line:84%
walks by and doesn't
speak to you.

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And you have the belief,
people don't like me.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:84%
You're going to give it the
meaning that he doesn't like

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.280 align:middle line:84%
you If you don't
have that belief,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have any
specific beliefs about people,

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.392 align:middle line:84%
people are fine, if
somebody walks by you

00:05:45.392 --> 00:05:47.600 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't say hello, you
might give it the meaning,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.267 align:middle line:84%
oh, maybe they didn't see me, or
maybe they're having a bad day.

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:53.690 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:10%
If you have the belief,
I'm not good enough,

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.085 align:middle line:10%
and you have a
project that fails,

00:06:00.085 --> 00:06:01.960 align:middle line:10%
you're going to give it
the meaning, oh, God,

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.690 align:middle line:10%
I'm a failure.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.490 align:middle line:90%
I'm a loser.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm terrible.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:84%
If you have the belief,
mistakes and failures

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.290 align:middle line:84%
are learning opportunities,
and that's how you grow,

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:90%
and your project fails, you go--

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I once heard Steve Wynn speak,
the famous hotel builder.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.320 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I want to tell
you when what happens when

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.120 align:middle line:84%
one of my buildings fail,
when one of my hotels

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.662 align:middle line:90%
goes bankrupt, what I do.

00:06:30.662 --> 00:06:32.120 align:middle line:84%
And everybody takes
out their pens,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.560 align:middle line:90%
and they're all ready to write.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, I
build another one.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:84%
So the meaning he gave
it is, sometimes you win,

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:44.030 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes you lose, and
you just build another one.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.410 align:middle line:90%
But it doesn't stop him.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.520 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't flatten him.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.090 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't take him out,
because of the meanings

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:90%
that he gives the events.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.620 align:middle line:90%
We give meaning all day long.

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, because the meanings
are informed by our beliefs,

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.720 align:middle line:84%
ultimately you want to
get rid of your beliefs.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.530 align:middle line:90%
When I got rid of the belief--

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.810 align:middle line:84%
now, this is a belief
that runs people--

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.930 align:middle line:84%
what makes me good enough
is having other people

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:13.910 align:middle line:90%
think well of me.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.682 align:middle line:84%
So I would walk away from
people going, did they like me?

00:07:18.682 --> 00:07:19.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing an interview.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Did I say the right thing?

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Did I do the right-- am
I talking too much-- ugh.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:90%
Like that.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.400 align:middle line:84%
When I got rid of that
belief, I had the freedom

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.240 align:middle line:90%
to be my authentic self.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.213 align:middle line:90%
So I'm talking to you.

00:07:31.213 --> 00:07:32.630 align:middle line:84%
All I care about
is the people who

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:84%
are listening I want to give
everything I have in the time

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.150 align:middle line:90%
that we have to the people.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:39.050 align:middle line:90%
Some people like me.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.850 align:middle line:90%
Some people won't.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.808 align:middle line:84%
Some people say, oh, she
has a New York accent,

00:07:41.808 --> 00:07:43.910 align:middle line:90%
she talks too much, whatever.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:90%
You can't please everybody.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Now, I knew that before,
but it didn't matter.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:84%
So when something
happens now, I just

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.140 align:middle line:90%
don't give the same meaning.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:84%
You can get rid of
meaning in the moment.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:07.040 align:middle line:84%
So there's two ways I'm going
to teach you how to do that.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.643 align:middle line:84%
Let's assume somebody
doesn't speak to you.

00:08:11.643 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Somebody walks by and
doesn't say hello,

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:90%
and you start to get upset.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.370 align:middle line:84%
Or your boss yells at
you, and you go, oh, God.

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:84%
The moment you have a negative
emotion, stop and ask yourself,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.230 align:middle line:90%
what just happened?

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you a
parenting example.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:29.840 align:middle line:90%
What just happened?

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.970 align:middle line:90%
My kid just mouthed off at me.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.130 align:middle line:90%
What meaning did I give it?

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:90%
They don't respect me.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:90%
They mouthed off at me is here.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.410 align:middle line:90%
They don't respect me is here.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Meaning is never
inherent in the events.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:90%
Meaning is in your mind.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.310 align:middle line:84%
So if you get that the meaning
is separate from the event,

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:90%
the emotion will go away.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.197 align:middle line:90%
Now you can handle it.

00:08:57.197 --> 00:08:58.613 align:middle line:84%
You can say to
your child, I don't

00:08:58.613 --> 00:08:59.980 align:middle line:90%
like being spoken to that way.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.578 align:middle line:90%
I don't speak to you that way.

00:09:01.578 --> 00:09:02.620 align:middle line:90%
You could say, what's up?

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Are you having a bad day?

00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:09.680 align:middle line:84%
You can also look at it and
say, what just happened?

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.670 align:middle line:90%
My teenager mouthed off at me.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.890 align:middle line:90%
What meaning did I give it?

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:90%
They don't respect me.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:90%
What else could it mean?

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.800 align:middle line:84%
It could mean they're a hormonal
teenager having a rough day.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.190 align:middle line:90%


00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, take it the last step.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.900 align:middle line:84%
What does it really mean that
they just spoke to me that way?

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.430 align:middle line:84%
And another way of saying
that is, what do I know

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:44.770 align:middle line:90%
for sure because that happened?

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:47.650 align:middle line:84%
It isn't that it doesn't
have consequences.

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying you shouldn't
feel your emotions.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.380 align:middle line:84%
But when you want to get rid
of them, that's how you do it.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:10%
