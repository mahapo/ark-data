00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Our beliefs drive
everything, right?

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.710 align:middle line:84%
So our beliefs are really
what drive our actions

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and our behavior, and
our actions and behavior

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.980 align:middle line:90%
drive our destiny.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.900 align:middle line:90%
So they are paramount.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.200 align:middle line:84%
They are really those hidden
tracks underneath our lives

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:84%
that help us produce the results
that we have or we don't have.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to
understanding whether or not

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.240 align:middle line:84%
we have limiting
beliefs, one clue

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.270 align:middle line:84%
is to see if there's a
recurring pattern in your life.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.150 align:middle line:84%
If there's something that
you say that you want,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.900 align:middle line:84%
but it's not a reality for
you, and it's been true

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:90%
for years and years and years--

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.470 align:middle line:84%
or even months and months
and months, and you've

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.550 align:middle line:90%
been working on it--

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.990 align:middle line:84%
that's probably
a clue that there

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.000 align:middle line:84%
could be a limiting
belief under there

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.460 align:middle line:84%
that you need to
investigate and then

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.200 align:middle line:90%
consciously work on changing.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.470 align:middle line:84%
So I think when it comes
to limiting beliefs,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.650 align:middle line:84%
if there's any area in your
life that consistently creates

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.220 align:middle line:84%
a lot of pain, a lot of stress,
a lot of struggle or anxiety,

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.050 align:middle line:84%
a good place to peek
around is say, well,

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.760 align:middle line:90%
what do I believe about this?

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Do I believe that it's
possible to resolve?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Do I believe I'm worthy
of having this resolved?

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.750 align:middle line:84%
I think investigating
it on that level,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.240 align:middle line:84%
from a place of
curiosity, is step one.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.210 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're not
aware of the belief,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.710 align:middle line:90%
it's hard to change it.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.040 align:middle line:84%
For most of my life, I had
a lot of limiting beliefs

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.010 align:middle line:84%
around money, and that
comes from my family.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.280 align:middle line:84%
My mom grew up in poverty, and
her entire experience of life--

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.930 align:middle line:90%
money doesn't grow on trees--

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and I just remember from
the time I was very small,

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.450 align:middle line:84%
all the way up and through
when I was an adult,

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.180 align:middle line:84%
there was never enough
when it came to money.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.230 align:middle line:84%
And so I knew that that
was what I was steeped in,

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.110 align:middle line:84%
but there was another
part of me from starting

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.870 align:middle line:84%
to learn and understand
how the world works,

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.150 align:middle line:90%
that that wasn't always true.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.010 align:middle line:84%
And I felt in my
bones that there

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.110 align:middle line:84%
was more than
enough to go around,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.450 align:middle line:84%
but my checkbook
didn't reflect that.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was starting
my business, I remember,

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.110 align:middle line:90%
it was in the early days.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.047 align:middle line:84%
And you know, going to write
those checks to pay rent

00:02:02.047 --> 00:02:04.630 align:middle line:84%
every month I would get nervous
because sometimes there wasn't

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.120 align:middle line:84%
enough there, but I was
so committed to growing

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:84%
this business and breaking
out of this limiting belief.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.460 align:middle line:90%
And I've realized one thing--

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.200 align:middle line:84%
that if I kept
behaving in the way

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that I always
behaved in the past,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.390 align:middle line:90%
nothing was going to change.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.220 align:middle line:84%
So I thought to myself, what
if I start changing my behavior

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.870 align:middle line:84%
rather than working
on the belief?

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.680 align:middle line:90%
So here's what I did.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.620 align:middle line:84%
There was a coaching
program coming up

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:84%
where it was a group
coaching program,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and I was about to open up the
doors to have people come in.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:84%
And again, this was
at a point in my life

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.480 align:middle line:84%
where money was
still very scarce

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.640 align:middle line:84%
and everything was
still touch and go.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.060 align:middle line:90%
And I made a promise to myself.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know, I've
always wanted my business

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.570 align:middle line:84%
to be about more than just
me, more than just profits

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.120 align:middle line:84%
for my own bank account, and
I don't really care that much

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.040 align:middle line:90%
about material things.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I wanted it to make a
difference beyond me,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.560 align:middle line:84%
but how do I figure
out this money thing?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:90%
And I said, you know what?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.310 align:middle line:84%
No matter how many people come
into this coaching program,

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.440 align:middle line:84%
I am going to make a commitment
to myself and to the universe

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.560 align:middle line:84%
that I'm going to give
away 10% of the profits,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:90%
no matter what it was.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.850 align:middle line:84%
The logical part of
my mind was screaming.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:90%
There's no way.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't even
pay your own rent.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.940 align:middle line:90%
This is nuts.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.673 align:middle line:84%
This is not even a
wise business move.

00:03:11.673 --> 00:03:13.090 align:middle line:84%
How can you even
claim that you're

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.770 align:middle line:84%
a business person
or a life coach

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.960 align:middle line:84%
if you're doing
something so silly?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Yet my heart knew it was
the right move to do.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.902 align:middle line:84%
So I made that commitment,
opened the doors,

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
people came through,
and I said, I'm just

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.830 align:middle line:84%
going to trust whatever
is left at the end.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.900 align:middle line:90%
We're going to do this.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:84%
So everyone came
through the program,

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:84%
and it turns out that
amount turned out

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
to be about $7,000, which
was way more than I even

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.940 align:middle line:84%
had in my bank account
starting this whole crazy idea,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.010 align:middle line:84%
and the idea of giving that
away got me so excited,

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't know who I
was going to give it to.

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.870 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking around
for an organization

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.940 align:middle line:84%
that I felt like would be
a good fit with my values,

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and I've always been an advocate
for empowering girls and women.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.280 align:middle line:84%
Turns out there was a UN
initiative that was starting up

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.550 align:middle line:84%
called Girl Up, and it was
all about taking a look

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:84%
at how many girls around the
world are denied an education

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and doing what we can to
get them back in school.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.163 align:middle line:84%
I had gotten touch with the
director of that program.

00:04:10.163 --> 00:04:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And she said, hey, we're having
a launch party in New York

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:90%
City.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:13.580 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to come?

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.830 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, I would love to.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.019 align:middle line:84%
And I said, by the way, I'd
like to make a donation.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And she's like,
this is incredible.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.440 align:middle line:84%
I always had a
dream of having one

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.240 align:middle line:84%
of those big
cheesy, large checks

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
and being able to give
it to someone else.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I said, would you mind if
I presented you with a check--

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:90%
like, a big one?

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:84%
She's like, that
would be amazing.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:31.630 align:middle line:90%
So I went to FedEx.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I got this big cheesy
check drawn up.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.740 align:middle line:84%
I remember going on
stage, and I just

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.650 align:middle line:84%
started bawling because
I couldn't believe

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.445 align:middle line:84%
that it was mere eight
weeks ago that I didn't know

00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
if I was going to be
able to pay my own rent,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.870 align:middle line:84%
and here I was being able
to present a check that

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.010 align:middle line:84%
was $7,000 plus to a
group of young girls

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.670 align:middle line:84%
who needed it way more
than I ever would.

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:84%
I got on stage,
presented the check.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.080 align:middle line:84%
I walked off stage, and
someone came up to me,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.530 align:middle line:84%
and they said, Marie,
that was incredible.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to hear more about your
work and what you're doing.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.490 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, thank you.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.290 align:middle line:90%
That's great.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And she said I work
for Richard Branson,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and we're about to do a
trip with entrepreneurs

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.000 align:middle line:84%
to South Africa with
him, and we would

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.080 align:middle line:90%
love to invite you to come.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.880 align:middle line:90%
I kid you not.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.958 align:middle line:84%
I started jumping up
and down in my heels

00:05:15.958 --> 00:05:18.500 align:middle line:84%
right then and there because he
was always one of my business

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.780 align:middle line:84%
idols, and he was someone
who I had always looked

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.770 align:middle line:84%
to that embodied such
creativity and such an ability

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.550 align:middle line:84%
to bring joy and purpose
to all of his businesses.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that by following
my heart and what I knew to be

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.030 align:middle line:84%
true, which was that there was
more than enough to go around--

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.130 align:middle line:84%
not just for me,
but for others--

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.070 align:middle line:84%
that it triggered
this domino effect

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.490 align:middle line:84%
of me shifting my own
limiting belief around money.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.040 align:middle line:84%
That was actually the beginning
of my business starting

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:90%
to take off.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And then it enabled me
to interact with and meet

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.500 align:middle line:84%
so many other people
on this journey that

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.737 align:middle line:84%
could inspire me
to continue to grow

00:06:00.737 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:84%
in terms of my generosity
and the difference

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.500 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to make.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.370 align:middle line:84%
In terms of how to
change a limiting belief,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.610 align:middle line:84%
it's less about the psychology,
from my point of view,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:84%
and it's more about
really flipping

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.120 align:middle line:90%
old wisdom on its head.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So most of us have heard the
kind of process of creation.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.700 align:middle line:84%
So we have thought,
then we have word,

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:84%
then we have deed or action,
and that's how things usually

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.300 align:middle line:90%
come to life.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.217 align:middle line:84%
But when you want to
change a limiting belief,

00:06:26.217 --> 00:06:28.860 align:middle line:84%
you have to flip that
formula and make it reverse.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.480 align:middle line:90%
You act first.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Then you speak in alignment
with how you want to behave,

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:90%
and then your beliefs changed.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's this really
cool, interesting,

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.312 align:middle line:84%
very action-oriented way to
kind of sidestep all of the,

00:06:43.312 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
"oh, my gosh, I have so
many limiting beliefs,"

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.890 align:middle line:90%
and get right to changing them.

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:50.730 align:middle line:84%
You do that enough, and you will
absolutely change the belief.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So one of my mantras that I've
lived by ever since I realized

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.680 align:middle line:84%
that limiting
beliefs around money

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:84%
were really holding
me back was there's

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:84%
always more where
that came from.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.640 align:middle line:84%
So every single time,
still, when I write a check

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
or I pay a bill or
I make a donation

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.590 align:middle line:84%
or whatever I have to do
that is in terms of outflow,

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.070 align:middle line:84%
I always say, there is always
more where that came from.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.620 align:middle line:84%
And you do that enough,
and it absolutely

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.820 align:middle line:90%
becomes your reality.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.670 align:middle line:84%
I am one of the most pragmatic,
practical people you will ever

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:20.810 align:middle line:84%
meet, and so this isn't
about just saying it,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:21.810 align:middle line:90%
and it will become true.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.430 align:middle line:84%
And there may be people
that believe that--

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.263 align:middle line:84%
and I honor and respect
it-- but for me, I'm

00:07:25.263 --> 00:07:26.820 align:middle line:90%
a very brass tacks kind of girl.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] So it is about aligning
your actions in a way that's

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.700 align:middle line:84%
appropriate with your
life at this moment,

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and then changing your
reality from that place.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
other most powerful ways

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:84%
that we can change limiting
beliefs is through finding

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.350 align:middle line:84%
evidence to the contrary, so
actively looking for what else

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:47.550 align:middle line:90%
might be true.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.308 align:middle line:84%
In the example of
limiting money beliefs,

00:07:49.308 --> 00:07:50.850 align:middle line:84%
well, if you're
struggling with money

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:53.850 align:middle line:84%
but other people aren't,
recognizing, OK, well,

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
maybe they've figured out
something that I haven't yet.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:84%
So let me go collect all
the evidence of other people

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:84%
that disprove this
limiting belief.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
It could be the same
thing around health--

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.030 align:middle line:84%
actively, proactively
searching out

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:09.810 align:middle line:84%
and creating a whole stack
of evidence to the contrary

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.417 align:middle line:84%
is, I think, how
we can also start

00:08:11.417 --> 00:08:13.500 align:middle line:84%
to begin to change some
of those negative beliefs.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.550 align:middle line:90%
