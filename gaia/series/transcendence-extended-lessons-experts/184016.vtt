>> During the summertime, in
this extreme conditions of heat

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.550 align:middle line:84%
and humidity, I try to hydrate
myself very well the night

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.310 align:middle line:90%
before and also that morning.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.750 align:middle line:84%
When I stand up, I
get, plenty of water,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.210 align:middle line:84%
maybe some Himalayan salt
in the water, some lemon

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.870 align:middle line:84%
as well, for a little cleansing,
little detox, and also,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:84%
of course, cold pressed
juices, if I have, obviously,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:84%
access to, when I am traveling,
to those cold-pressed juices

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.010 align:middle line:90%
in places around.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm always looking for
those little hidden juice

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
bars and those kind
of healthy corners.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.918 align:middle line:84%
Or I just get those cold-press
machines inside of the house

00:00:55.918 --> 00:00:57.210 align:middle line:90%

00:00:58.585 --> 00:01:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I like in the
morning, I'm really

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.269 align:middle line:90%
a big fan of green juices--

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.220 align:middle line:84%
so spinach, kale, cucumber,
all this stuff, and, you know,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:84%
spirulina, chlorella,
just mixing it all.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So green or whatever--
orange, red-- beetroot

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:84%
is great for oxygen
intake and, you know,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.410 align:middle line:84%
obviously carrots for
healthy skin and vision.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.190 align:middle line:90%
And so it really depends.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.460 align:middle line:84%
You know, I like, if I
would play a night match,

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.230 align:middle line:84%
I would increase
a little bit more

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.790 align:middle line:84%
of that, of carrots,
maybe beetroot as well.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:84%
During the day, then in the
morning, if I would play--

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:84%
if I would practice
in, you know,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.247 align:middle line:84%
like 1:00, 2:00, 3:00 PM in a
big heat or play a match, then

00:01:43.247 --> 00:01:45.330 align:middle line:84%
maybe in the morning I
would add a little bit more

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.330 align:middle line:84%
of a coconut water, just to
get that hydration, and maybe

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.990 align:middle line:84%
some other products that I use
for hydration and endurance

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.688 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:01:56.688 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:90%
And, you know, that's about it.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And I try not to take food
that would kind of sit heavily

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.245 align:middle line:84%
on my stomach because
then, you know,

00:02:09.245 --> 00:02:10.620 align:middle line:84%
you all of a sudden
on the court,

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.990 align:middle line:84%
sometimes you feel like
the food is coming back.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.820 align:middle line:84%
And you have this
kind of acidity,

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, and burping,
and this uncomfortable feeling.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And you waste a lot of energy
on the digestion, right?

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So got to be careful with the
time span as well, you know,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.290 align:middle line:84%
and how long before the match
you eat, and what you eat,

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.920 align:middle line:84%
and how does that affect your
sugar levels, your energy

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:90%
levels, and so forth.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.630 align:middle line:84%
But I think it doesn't
just start that day.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.590 align:middle line:84%
It starts the days
before, you know?

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.260 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, so prior
to the tournament,

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
usually if we have like
a week before Grand Slam,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.500 align:middle line:84%
I would emphasize
maybe the first couple

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.160 align:middle line:84%
of days of that week
prior to the Grand Slam

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.740 align:middle line:84%
the protein intake, a little
bit more protein, building

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.590 align:middle line:90%
that good supply base.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.315 align:middle line:84%
And then after that, you know,
leveling it with carbohydrates

00:03:05.315 --> 00:03:07.440 align:middle line:84%
and then increasing a little
bit more carbohydrates

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.950 align:middle line:84%
and getting that stored, so I
can have that kind of supply

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.210 align:middle line:84%
if I need it for longer matches
and on a big heat and so forth.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:84%
So in the end of today, it
was a learning process for me.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, I didn't have this
kind of knowledge all my life,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.390 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I thought I was eating
well, I was eating healthy.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.590 align:middle line:84%
I was coming from home-cooked
meals from my mother.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:90%
They are, by the way, delicious.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
really good things.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.180 align:middle line:84%
But then there's some
food that I over-consumed

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.400 align:middle line:90%
know that contained gluten.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.280 align:middle line:84%
It contained too much of maybe
red meat, and beans, you know,

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and heavy stuff that
my stomach was not

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.487 align:middle line:84%
able to digest as
accurately as maybe the food

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:90%
that I'm eating now.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
So I found myself the
best in plant-based diet.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, I think I have
plenty of sources and nutrients

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.300 align:middle line:84%
that I'm looking for, that my
body needs in a daily basis

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.089 align:middle line:90%
because, you know, if--

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:23.370 align:middle line:84%
today, the question that you get
the most if you're plant-based

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.810 align:middle line:84%
is, where do you
get your protein?

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Where you get your iron,
your B12, your calcium?

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean, well, for example,
one of the richest

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:84%
sources of calcium on earth
is poppy seeds, you know?

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Protein you can get in all
the seeds and all the nuts,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.480 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, and the
legumes, and beans, and god

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.890 align:middle line:84%
knows what in this great
smoothie and protein shake

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:90%
blends.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So I guess people would
tend to make judgments

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.470 align:middle line:84%
upon lack of information
and knowledge about food

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:08.282 align:middle line:84%
and what plant-based earth-given
food gives to you, to your body

00:05:08.282 --> 00:05:09.240 align:middle line:90%
and to your metabolism.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.010 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very excited that at this
stage of my life and my career,

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:84%
when I'm so blessed to
be on top of the game

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
and on top of the
men's tennis world,

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.910 align:middle line:84%
to be plant-based
mostly, you know?

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's a leap that I decided
to take almost a year ago.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.010 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't easy,
because the last couple

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.640 align:middle line:84%
of years, I've felt
like my body started

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.750 align:middle line:90%
to cleanse more and more.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.485 align:middle line:84%
And I did start to
refuse a lot of the meat.

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't really feel--
especially the red meat,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.910 align:middle line:84%
I didn't eat it
at all very much.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.180 align:middle line:84%
I had more of a lean chicken
or turkey and so forth,

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.690 align:middle line:84%
and, you know, eggs, and
egg whites, and so forth.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Those were kind of
the animal-based foods

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.280 align:middle line:84%
that I was having,
and then fish as well.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:84%
But I just, I didn't
feel well after that.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.450 align:middle line:84%
It took a lot of time for
my body to digest that.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.880 align:middle line:90%
So I spent energy and time.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And then it would
reflect negatively

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.780 align:middle line:84%
on my practice session or
my match that was coming up.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.690 align:middle line:90%
So I would feel exhausted.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.750 align:middle line:90%
And you would have--

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.750 align:middle line:84%
I would have, especially
when I would have meat,

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.120 align:middle line:84%
I would have food
comas and energy drops.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And those kind of things
you can't afford yourself

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.768 align:middle line:84%
as an athlete, you
know, especially

00:06:27.768 --> 00:06:30.870 align:middle line:84%
as-- as a matter of fact,
as an ordinary human being,

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.700 align:middle line:84%
of course, but as an
athlete even more,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:84%
because you need your energy
sustained throughout the day.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to have
those oscillations.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's been an
exciting journey so far.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.460 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very pleased
and proud, as well,

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.060 align:middle line:84%
to be able to say that I'm
plant-based at the moment,

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.430 align:middle line:90%
because, you know, it just--

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.990 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I'm fueling my
body with the right nutrients,

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm eating
the food correctly,

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.913 align:middle line:90%
as my body's asking me to.

00:07:02.913 --> 00:07:04.830 align:middle line:84%

throughout the day.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:90%

Mm.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:40.960 align:middle line:90%
And what do we got here?

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.820 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is being
cooked and prepared.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm just kind of
pretending like I'm

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:90%
stirring something-- whatever.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.990 align:middle line:90%
But this is for my son, Stefan--

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
some quinoa, zucchini,
carrots, and stuff

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.740 align:middle line:90%
like this on a very low heat.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:00.630 align:middle line:90%
So it's fine by itself.

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to show you guys
what I took today for practice.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.350 align:middle line:84%
This is-- I usually take
a little box with me

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:11.600 align:middle line:84%
on the practice sessions
with some snacks.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.610 align:middle line:90%
This is what we make at home.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:84%
It's coconut oil, cacao, some
almond butter, and some dates.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%
So you can always mix with
ingredients that you like.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.210 align:middle line:84%
But generally, coconut
oil, dates, cacao--

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of
the nutty butters

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.738 align:middle line:84%
are a perfect base for
those kind of snacks.

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:33.780 align:middle line:90%
And this is banana bread.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:39.350 align:middle line:84%
So, of course, no refined
sugar, all the natural sugars.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And that gives me
energy-- sustained energy.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.790 align:middle line:84%
And during the matches,
I usually eat dates.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.598 align:middle line:90%
That's very simple.

00:09:46.598 --> 00:09:47.640 align:middle line:90%
I like to keep it simple.

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.445 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to send too much
information to my stomach.

00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:52.570 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to confuse it.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to put too much
weight on it, because, you

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.680 align:middle line:84%
know, obviously, when
you're playing a match,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.480 align:middle line:84%
and you're in competition
mode, your stomach

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.295 align:middle line:84%
is closing up a
little bit because

00:10:04.295 --> 00:10:06.670 align:middle line:84%
of the stress and the emotions
that you're going through.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, you're exposed
to that competitive play

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:90%
and so forth.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:17.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to
keep things very simple.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And since I've
just recently have

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.510 align:middle line:84%
finished my tennis practice
and my fitness practice,

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I need some protein intake,
protein replenishment.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:31.670 align:middle line:90%
And I got some stuff here.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I usually like to
have a quick smoothie

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.910 align:middle line:84%
that I make in a blender,
right, with, of course,

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.920 align:middle line:90%
plant-based milk.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
This is rice and coconut,
our favorite combination.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:56.720 align:middle line:84%
And this protein, nourishing
protein, is by company Well--

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:90%
WelleCo from Australia?

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.890 align:middle line:84%
I just recently found out--
discovered it a few days ago,

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.780 align:middle line:84%
actually bought
it here in Spain.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.970 align:middle line:90%
And it's delicious.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.720 align:middle line:84%
So officially, these are my two
favorite ones for now, right,

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.180 align:middle line:90%
Shakeology and Welle.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.410 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to make a little
protein for myself, if you

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:18.150 align:middle line:90%
guys don't mind, right here.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And it's important
because, obviously, you

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:29.720 align:middle line:84%
lose a lot of minerals, a lot
of liquids during training,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.840 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're
training on a big heat,

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.190 align:middle line:84%
like I've done here in
the European summer.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.620 align:middle line:84%
So you need that
quick replenishment.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And I like to add a little
bit of an extra seed or nut

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:44.290 align:middle line:90%
protein in it.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to put a little
bit of pumpkin seeds inside.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.400 align:middle line:90%
There is no measurement.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.710 align:middle line:84%
There is no right
or wrong quantities,

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.580 align:middle line:90%
just as much as you feel.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:12:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And right after that, I'm going
to have the digestive enzyme

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:02.090 align:middle line:90%
blend from Udo's Choice--

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:04.340 align:middle line:90%
fantastic, great stuff.

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.040 align:middle line:84%
And I was thinking
since today it

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:84%
was very humid and
very warm, I felt

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.980 align:middle line:84%
like I'm going to need a little
bit of an extra minerals.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And this is one of
the highest mineral

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.820 align:middle line:90%
sources on earth, scheelite.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:84%
So-- and it [SNIFFS] doesn't
smell so good, trust me

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.710 align:middle line:90%
on that.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to try
to hide it in this blend.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to put
one banana in there--

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:90%
good potassium source, right?

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.450 align:middle line:90%
Good sugar.

00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And then we are just
going to close it.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:43.230 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to blend it.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.876 align:middle line:90%
Very simple.

00:12:45.876 --> 00:12:48.321 align:middle line:90%
[BLENDING]

00:12:48.321 --> 00:12:56.650 align:middle line:90%


00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.020 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so this is my hardest
work in the kitchen.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.080 align:middle line:84%
This is what I (CHUCKLING)
do in my kitchen.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:08.090 align:middle line:84%
This is the biggest
effort I make.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's so simple, right?

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:14.300 align:middle line:84%
Raw foods nourish
your body so much.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:20.610 align:middle line:84%
And they don't require a
lot of time to prepare.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.320 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to treat
myself with this

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.640 align:middle line:90%
and let you know how it feels.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:30.340 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:90%
Delicious.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Oh.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.100 align:middle line:90%
Mm.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:42.645 align:middle line:84%

much, so we've got to cut here.
