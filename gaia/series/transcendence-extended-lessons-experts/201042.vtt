00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:13.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Tapping as a process that we
know now was discovered right

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.800 align:middle line:84%
around 1980 by a psychologist
called Roger Callahan.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.990 align:middle line:84%
Roger was a
traditional therapist

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and working with clients
in his home office.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.790 align:middle line:84%
And he had a really
unique experience,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
it was sort of like that
eureka, light bulb moment.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:84%
So Roger had a client
by name of Mary,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.259 align:middle line:84%
and she had a
severe water phobia.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:84%
You know, thinking about fear
of flying and phobias before,

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.290 align:middle line:90%
so what happened?

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Mary had some sort of experience
that said water is dangerous.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.950 align:middle line:84%
Now this was an out and
out phobia, so not just

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.210 align:middle line:90%
swimming or the ocean.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.190 align:middle line:90%
It was drinking water, showers.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.120 align:middle line:84%
It was just like full-on
panic attack, sweating.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.240 align:middle line:84%
So imagine walking around
every day with a water phobia.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.550 align:middle line:84%
It's not the
easiest thing to do.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.540 align:middle line:84%
And she had been working with
Dr. Callahan for about a year.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:84%
He was doing traditional
therapy methods,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.500 align:middle line:84%
so he would do
exposure therapy--

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.240 align:middle line:90%
hey, let's look at the pool.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.250 align:middle line:84%
What do you feel
when you look at it?

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Try to relax as you
look at the pool.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.705 align:middle line:84%
Try to desensitize the
body to that experience.

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:15.330 align:middle line:84%
She found the whole
thing so stressful.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Just looking at the pool,
she'd get migraines.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.180 align:middle line:84%
It was like everything
was just not working.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
And as any good therapist
or psychologist would feel,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.890 align:middle line:90%
he was frustrated.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.348 align:middle line:84%
It's like, you want
to help people.

00:01:26.348 --> 00:01:28.810 align:middle line:90%
That's why you're there.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And he had an experience where
Mary came one day for a session

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.150 align:middle line:84%
and she said, when
I look at the pool,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:84%
I just get butterflies
in my stomach.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.290 align:middle line:84%
And he'd been reading
about the Chinese meridian

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.290 align:middle line:84%
system in the body and the fact
that the stomach meridian ends

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.590 align:middle line:84%
underneath the eye, and that you
can tap to activate meridians.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.720 align:middle line:84%
So on a whim in that
moment, he said,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:90%
try tapping underneath your eye.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.730 align:middle line:84%
So she did so for 30
seconds, or a minute,

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.220 align:middle line:84%
and looked at the water,
and the phobia was gone.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.237 align:middle line:90%
She was blown away.

00:01:56.237 --> 00:01:57.320 align:middle line:90%
I mean, he was blown away.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.360 align:middle line:84%
Like, what happened
in that moment?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:84%
How could decades of
this fear and anxiety--

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.300 align:middle line:84%
something happened to
calm that amygdala,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.452 align:middle line:84%
to tell the body
that it was safe.

00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:09.410 align:middle line:84%
Potentially, something
with the meridian system

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.993 align:middle line:84%
that we're learning
more about, but we

00:02:10.993 --> 00:02:13.520 align:middle line:84%
don't have the concrete
data that we need for that.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.160 align:middle line:84%
But something happened
in that moment

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.110 align:middle line:90%
that calmed that water phobia.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And so you can imagine
he was excited.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:84%
He started looking at the
different meridians of the body

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.830 align:middle line:84%
and developed a
process called TFT,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.420 align:middle line:90%
which is Thought Field Therapy.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.900 align:middle line:84%
It's still around today and
practiced by a lot of people.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And what TFT does for different
emotions and different things

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.280 align:middle line:84%
you have going on, you have a
different sequence of tapping.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Gary Craig was one of
Roger Callahan's students,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and he took the TFT process
and said, this is great.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to remember,
hard to implement,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.990 align:middle line:84%
hard to execute,
so let's just tap

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.620 align:middle line:84%
through all the points, the
same points, every single time.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.777 align:middle line:84%
He had a couple of innovations,
codified the system,

00:02:54.777 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:90%
then put out in the world.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.443 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
learned, personally.

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the version
of what I use today.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:84%
EFT is sort of-- if we think
of EFT as a specific technique

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and tapping as the
general process.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.360 align:middle line:84%
So like meditation--
there's vipassana meditation

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.910 align:middle line:84%
and then there's
general meditation,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.618 align:middle line:84%
and there's guided
meditation and there's

00:03:12.618 --> 00:03:13.702 align:middle line:90%
this, that, and the other.

00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:15.380 align:middle line:84%
So tapping, you'll
find practitioners

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.900 align:middle line:84%
doing different forms of it,
different approaches, sometimes

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.850 align:middle line:84%
different points--
that's the general thing.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.010 align:middle line:90%
EFT is the specific thing.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So since 1980, this
techniques been

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:84%
out there growing steadily,
being shared steadily,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:84%
being used by
therapists and doctors

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.613 align:middle line:84%
and psychologists
when they saw results.

00:03:30.613 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:84%
And more than
anything, being used

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.490 align:middle line:84%
by individual people
who say, oh wow,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.815 align:middle line:84%
I can use this to
change my life.

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:38.690 align:middle line:84%
What's really happened
in the last five years

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.782 align:middle line:84%
or so, which I'm very excited
about, is the research

00:03:41.782 --> 00:03:42.740 align:middle line:90%
is starting to come in.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.607 align:middle line:84%
Now it's always like,
why does it take so long?

00:03:45.607 --> 00:03:47.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you could talk
about funding and the money

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.710 align:middle line:90%
available.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.327 align:middle line:84%
But, like, meditation is
the newest, hottest thing

00:03:51.327 --> 00:03:52.910 align:middle line:84%
in the last decade,
and it's obviously

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.935 align:middle line:84%
been around for a
long time, so a time

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:56.060 align:middle line:90%
and a place for everything.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:84%
But at this point, there's over
100 different research studies

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.050 align:middle line:84%
on EFT, more growing every
single day, on everything

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.137 align:middle line:84%
from anxiety to PTSD
studies with veterans.

00:04:08.137 --> 00:04:10.220 align:middle line:84%
We at The Tapping Solution
have done a lot of work

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
with veterans and
supporting that work.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.780 align:middle line:84%
And there's been research
showing that people coming back

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:84%
from war, people
affected with PTSD

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.390 align:middle line:84%
can do the tapping process,
preferably with a trained

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
practitioner when it's the more
difficult things, to change

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.320 align:middle line:84%
that PTSD, to turn off
that fight or flight

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
and to bring the body back
in a state of balance.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.030 align:middle line:84%
But to me, what's so
exciting about tapping

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.250 align:middle line:90%
is that you can just do it.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.455 align:middle line:90%
The basics are so easy to learn.

00:04:36.455 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:90%
You can teach it to your kids.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
You can show it to a loved
one and have an experience.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.770 align:middle line:84%
And for 99% of the people, just
the basic points are great.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:10%
