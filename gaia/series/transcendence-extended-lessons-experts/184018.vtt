00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.370 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that
I think that we do to stop

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.997 align:middle line:84%
ourselves when it comes
to putting our mission out

00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:14.080 align:middle line:84%
into the world, to doing
work that really matters,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.220 align:middle line:84%
to changing our life is we feel
like we have to kind of have it

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.100 align:middle line:84%
all figured out and we have to
do some big, massive change.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.080 align:middle line:84%
But I think what
we fail to realize

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.510 align:middle line:84%
is that how we do anything is
almost as important as what

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.310 align:middle line:90%
we're doing.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.970 align:middle line:90%
So what do I mean by that?

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.320 align:middle line:84%
You can start activating your
purpose in the exact life

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.970 align:middle line:90%
that you have right now--

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.950 align:middle line:84%
how you're showing up
at the breakfast table,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.912 align:middle line:84%
how you're showing up
at your existing job,

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:40.120 align:middle line:84%
how you're engaging with
people at the grocery store,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:90%
on the bank line.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:90%
You can embody your purpose.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.797 align:middle line:84%
If you want to make a
difference to others,

00:00:44.797 --> 00:00:47.380 align:middle line:84%
then start making a difference
with the energy that you bring.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Your attitude is so
incredibly important

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.010 align:middle line:84%
in terms of how you
make people feel.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll walk
around in this world

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.540 align:middle line:84%
and I see people-- they'll
come into my work and say, "Oh,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.420 align:middle line:84%
but I really want
to empower women,"

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.910 align:middle line:84%
or "I really want to empower
this group of people,"

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.305 align:middle line:84%
but all day long
they're complaining.

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of
women around them,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and they're not
actually empowering them

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle line:84%
through their energy
or their attitude.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.598 align:middle line:84%
So I think one of
the things that's

00:01:12.598 --> 00:01:14.650 align:middle line:84%
really important
before getting, even,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.840 align:middle line:84%
to some of the tactical
things that we can do

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.810 align:middle line:84%
is recognizing that every
single moment we're alive,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:90%
we are making a difference.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to us whether or not
we're living into that purpose

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.120 align:middle line:84%
or making that positive
difference or not.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.750 align:middle line:84%
So attitude and energy is
always the first place to look.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.060 align:middle line:84%
Because the 24 hours
you're alive every day are

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.860 align:middle line:84%
24 hours that you
have an opportunity

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.510 align:middle line:90%
to make a positive difference.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Now when it comes to using
these pockets of time

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.330 align:middle line:84%
to create a business or
to launch a new career,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.370 align:middle line:84%
I think getting really
clear on whatever

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.310 align:middle line:84%
it is that you're trying to do
is obviously step number one.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.170 align:middle line:84%
Talking about what
is the vision, what

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:84%
are we working
towards here, so you

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.640 align:middle line:84%
understand how to create a
game plan to reverse-engineer

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:90%
bringing it to life.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to making
a difference in the world

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and using our gift
to create change,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:84%
oftentimes we think we
have to change everything,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.063 align:middle line:84%
and we need a new career, and
we need to start a new business.

00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:08.860 align:middle line:90%
But that's not always the truth.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.810 align:middle line:84%
The energy and the
attitude that we

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.530 align:middle line:84%
bring to every single
moment of our day counts.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.180 align:middle line:84%
And that energy
and that attitude

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:90%
can create such a ripple effect.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's like the
infamous Gandhi quote,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.740 align:middle line:84%
"Be the change that you
want to see in the world."

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.800 align:middle line:84%
Having a vision for what
you want to create is vital,

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.990 align:middle line:84%
but I do want to say that not
all of us can have that crystal

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.990 align:middle line:84%
clear vision, especially
when we're starting out

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.910 align:middle line:84%
and things are a
little murky, right?

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.550 align:middle line:84%
But even if we do have a
vision, I think what's equally,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:84%
if not more, important is
having a plan to bring it

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:84%
to life to make sure that
it's not just something

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.230 align:middle line:84%
that you're looking
at on a vision board.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.530 align:middle line:84%
That every single day that
you're executing on effective

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.000 align:middle line:90%
steps to bring it to life.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.130 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that I do myself,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.280 align:middle line:84%
that I advise anyone who wants
to bring a big vision to life

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.460 align:middle line:84%
to do, is take four to five
minutes at the end of your day

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.140 align:middle line:84%
and write down
exactly what you're

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.070 align:middle line:90%
going to do the following day--

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:84%
so looking at your appointments,
looking at any special projects

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:84%
that you know must get done
to bring that vision to life,

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and even mapping out
things like working out,

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.400 align:middle line:84%
meditation time,
any of the self-care

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.290 align:middle line:84%
practices that you
know that you need

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.810 align:middle line:90%
to do in order to be your best.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:84%
It sounds so simple but so
many people don't do it.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.830 align:middle line:84%
They don't go, OK,
well, you know what?

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
If I really do want to
fit in that meditation

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.150 align:middle line:84%
or that 15-minute workout
or 10 minutes of prayer

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and I need to feed the kids
and I need to walk the dog,

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.190 align:middle line:84%
then I'm going to need
to wake up whether it's

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:90%
5:30 or 6:00 or 7:00 AM.

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
If I need to get x amount of
writing done to eventually get

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.580 align:middle line:84%
my book done, I need to
block out this chunk of time.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.800 align:middle line:84%
Taking four to five minutes
to do that the night before

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.950 align:middle line:84%
has such an extraordinarily
transformative effect.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.450 align:middle line:90%
And here's the second piece.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I like to say if it's not
scheduled, it's not real.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.247 align:middle line:84%
So popping all of those
different tasks with time

00:03:55.247 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:84%
estimates into your calendar
and-- here's the piece that

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:90%
most people miss--

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.120 align:middle line:90%
where you're going to do it.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.660 align:middle line:84%
So studies have shown that you
can increase from two to three

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.550 align:middle line:84%
times the likelihood
that you will actually

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:84%
complete a task if you not only
say when you're going to do it,

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:90%
but the physical place.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.157 align:middle line:84%
Is this going to happen
at your kitchen table?

00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to work out at
the gym or in your bedroom?

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.820 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to actually
create that business plan

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.019 align:middle line:90%
at the library?

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.590 align:middle line:84%
So a few little steps
like that every single day

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
can help you actually take that
vision and concretely put it

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:90%
into life.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.980 align:middle line:90%
