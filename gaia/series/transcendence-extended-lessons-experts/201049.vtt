[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's just start, if
you're watching at home,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.820 align:middle line:84%
just massage underneath
the collarbone here.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to take
you through some points.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And you just follow
the points with me

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.620 align:middle line:84%
and/or if you tap
on the wrong point,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.310 align:middle line:84%
you really can't mess up because
there's points everywhere.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So the most important
piece is to really feel

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.690 align:middle line:90%
what's coming up.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.318 align:middle line:84%
Not to intellectualize it--
to let yourself really feel.

00:00:33.318 --> 00:00:34.610 align:middle line:90%
And then just follow the point.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.800 align:middle line:90%
That's all you need to do, OK?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So tune into any
challenge that you're

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.090 align:middle line:84%
having right now in your life,
something that's bothering you,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:84%
someone who's triggered
you, something that's

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:90%
really hurting right now.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And give yourself permission
just to tune into that.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to do
a call and response.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:84%
So I will share some
thoughts, and then you'll

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:90%
just repeat them.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.120 align:middle line:84%
And if the word isn't
completely accurate,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.230 align:middle line:84%
just change the word
to match what you feel.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
If you don't know what you
feel, then give my word a try

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's likely
that you're numb.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So repeating after
me, even though I've

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.210 align:middle line:90%
been struggling here.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.430 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.640 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the center of the chest.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And I just want
you to say out loud

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.340 align:middle line:84%
how you've been
struggling, what's

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.670 align:middle line:84%
been going on in your world,
why are you struggling,

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.510 align:middle line:90%
how does it feel.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.250 align:middle line:84%
Just go on a little
rant about it.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:90%
Talk about it out loud.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.700 align:middle line:90%
I've been struggling by.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.060 align:middle line:90%
And then tap between the brows.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And then just tune
into that struggle.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.400 align:middle line:84%
Tune in to how it feels
to have that struggle,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.200 align:middle line:84%
that pain that's coming up,
all of that hurt that's there.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And what's the most intense
emotion that comes up for you.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:90%
Is it fear?

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.820 align:middle line:90%
Is it anger?

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Is it sadness?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.430 align:middle line:90%
Is it grief?

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.960 align:middle line:90%
Is it worry?

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.130 align:middle line:90%
What is the emotion?

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.905 align:middle line:84%
It feels like-- and
just name the emotion.

00:02:02.905 --> 00:02:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.960 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the temples.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
It feels like-- say
the emotion again.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.490 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:90%
And tapping the cheeks.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.340 align:middle line:90%
And I feel really stuck here.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.595 align:middle line:90%
And you say those words.

00:02:20.595 --> 00:02:23.800 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.458 align:middle line:84%
And just feel into any
stuckness that's right there.

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
And I want you to feel what
it feels like in your body.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:90%
What's the texture of it?

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.900 align:middle line:90%
What's the color of it?

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.990 align:middle line:84%
If I had a color, where
is it in your body?

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Where are you
holding it right now?

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.520 align:middle line:90%
And then just lean into it.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.230 align:middle line:90%
Really feel it right now.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.400 align:middle line:90%
Lean into it.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.360 align:middle line:84%
Get uncomfortable with it
just for a moment with me.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.140 align:middle line:84%
And then take a big, deep
breath and release a big sigh.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.850 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS]

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:59.650 align:middle line:90%
Awesome.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And then tap
underneath your nose.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.310 align:middle line:84%
I love and deeply accept
myself exactly as I am.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:90%
Tapping underneath the lips.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Even though I've been
really struggling here.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.050 align:middle line:84%
It's possible I'm
worthy of love.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.570 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.350 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the center of the chest.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.005 align:middle line:90%
It's possible I can heal this.

00:03:32.005 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:90%
Take a big, deep breath.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:90%
Release a big sigh.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:90%

Beautiful.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the front of the ribs.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I love and deeply forgive myself
for how hard this has been.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.970 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the side of the ribs.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.780 align:middle line:84%
It's possible I'm still
a good human being.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:90%


00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.740 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the side of the wrist.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.840 align:middle line:84%
It's possible I'm
still worthy of love.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.690 align:middle line:90%


00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.430 align:middle line:90%
Take another big, deep breath.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:90%
Release a big sigh.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.414 align:middle line:90%

Tapping the side of
the thumb here where

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.780 align:middle line:90%
the nail juts out the most.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.370 align:middle line:90%
I am worthy of love.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.960 align:middle line:90%


00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the next finger.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.040 align:middle line:84%
I am worthy of
having my needs met.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.660 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the middle finger.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm worthy of taking
care of myself here.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.614 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.614 --> 00:04:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into the struggle
that you've been having.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.210 align:middle line:84%
Tune into when it
was most intense.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And then just imagine yourself
giving yourself a great big hug

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:90%
of love right now--

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.340 align:middle line:84%
all of that love,
all of that empathy,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.870 align:middle line:84%
all of that forgiveness
that you deserve.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.110 align:middle line:84%
You've been trying so
hard to figure it out.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.320 align:middle line:84%
Just receive all of
that empathy right now.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Lean into receiving that.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.450 align:middle line:84%
And then take a
big, deep breath.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.410 align:middle line:90%
Release a big sigh.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.995 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS]

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:84%
Tapping the opposite
side of the next finger.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.635 align:middle line:90%
I love and accept myself.

00:05:30.635 --> 00:05:33.310 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Tapping the little
finger inside.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.300 align:middle line:90%
And I can move on from this.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.990 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And what do you need
in this situation?

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
What do you need that
will help you feel safe,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:84%
feel love, feel cared
for, encouraged?

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:90%
What would help right now?

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.418 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the side of the hand.

00:05:56.418 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And just tune into
what that is right now.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.220 align:middle line:90%
See what that is.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.380 align:middle line:90%
And then repeating after me.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:90%
What I really need is--

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.390 align:middle line:90%
and just name it out loud.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:15.567 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.567 --> 00:06:18.880 align:middle line:90%
And what I really want is--

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.140 align:middle line:90%
name it out loud again.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.330 align:middle line:90%


00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the top of the head.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.060 align:middle line:90%
And I'm ready to get it.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.570 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.980 align:middle line:90%
Tapping between the brows.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.160 align:middle line:84%
And I don't have
to wait any longer.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.570 align:middle line:84%
So are you ready to really
receive it in your life now?

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Are you really ready to have
this come into your life

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.300 align:middle line:90%
and bless your life?

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the temples.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So now, tune into that
situation and imagine

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.990 align:middle line:84%
yourself giving yourself all of
that, what you just asked for.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.740 align:middle line:84%
See yourself receiving
it from yourself.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.330 align:middle line:90%
Tapping the cheeks.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself
receiving it fully

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.370 align:middle line:90%
and how it feels to your body.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.960 align:middle line:84%
How it feels to
your heart to know

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.630 align:middle line:84%
that you are taking care
of yourself right now

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.150 align:middle line:84%
and that you are taking
care of all of your needs

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
and that you are safe,
and that you are loved,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.270 align:middle line:84%
and that you are held,
and you are beautiful,

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:90%
and you are respected.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.520 align:middle line:84%
And feel yourself
giving that to yourself

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.665 align:middle line:90%
right now, how powerful you are.

00:07:30.665 --> 00:07:33.980 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.430 align:middle line:84%
And then any resistance
to fully receiving, take

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:84%
a big, deep breath
into any resistance

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.030 align:middle line:90%
there and release a big sigh.

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.702 align:middle line:90%


00:07:44.702 --> 00:07:49.570 align:middle line:90%
[SIGHS]

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:90%
And tapping underneath the nose.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:90%
I can relax here.
