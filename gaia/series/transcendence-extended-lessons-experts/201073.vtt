00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Traditionally, the dark
night of the soul is a moment

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:18.140 align:middle line:84%
in which you lose all sense of
connection with the presence

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.080 align:middle line:90%
of the higher order of being.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.690 align:middle line:84%
What you formerly believed,
it's gone out the window.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Your old identity has
begun to evaporate.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.650 align:middle line:84%
The new identity
hasn't emerged yet.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.520 align:middle line:84%
So you're in that
proverbial no man's land.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And that can last for
a short period of time

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.120 align:middle line:84%
or it can last for a
long period of time.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.425 align:middle line:84%
And the dark night of the
soul, understand, is not--

00:00:46.425 --> 00:00:48.050 align:middle line:84%
you don't have a dark
night of the soul

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.590 align:middle line:84%
because someone died or you
lost a job or you got a divorce.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.440 align:middle line:90%
That's regular sadness.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.540 align:middle line:84%
That's the sadness
of loss and sadness

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.230 align:middle line:84%
of somebody dying, the sadness
of a structure in your life.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.090 align:middle line:84%
Dark night of the soul
is something different.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.870 align:middle line:84%
You could have nothing
wrong in your life,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.280 align:middle line:84%
and then suddenly
there's a bereftness.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:84%
That generally means
that either through grace

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
or through spiritual practice,
past life or present,

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.990 align:middle line:90%
your new identity is emerging.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.937 align:middle line:84%
But it hasn't emerged yet and
you're not who you used to be.

00:01:23.937 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:90%
So you don't know who you.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't even know
what you believe.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.940 align:middle line:84%
And in the dark night, if
you can ask a question,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
such as, what quality do
I need to give birth to

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.220 align:middle line:84%
to have peace of mind if
this were to last forever?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.410 align:middle line:84%
You start to work with
something like that.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.030 align:middle line:90%
Now why is that important?

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.910 align:middle line:84%
Generally, when an individual
is in a dark night,

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
they go through
wishful thinking.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:90%
I wish I wasn't here.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.460 align:middle line:90%
I wish I wasn't who I was.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.170 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd done
something differently.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.670 align:middle line:84%
I wish I'd made
different decisions,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.087 align:middle line:90%
I'd made poor choices.

00:02:03.087 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's a kind
of a wishful thinking.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:84%
None of those things
can ever happen

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.699 align:middle line:84%
because you are who you
are, you are where you are,

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.610 align:middle line:90%
and this is what's happening.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So to the degree that
you can pull yourself out

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.320 align:middle line:84%
of wishful thinking and ask
a different kind of question,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.140 align:middle line:84%
when the dark night
is over, you found

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.310 align:middle line:84%
that you are a little bit
higher in your transformation

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.400 align:middle line:84%
because you didn't waste the
time asking futile questions.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.920 align:middle line:84%
You want to ask an
empowering question.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.270 align:middle line:84%
And most people
when they're going

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.210 align:middle line:84%
through something
that's debilitating,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:84%
they'll ask a
disempowering question.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:90%
They'll ask from a victim state.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:90%
Why me?

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.440 align:middle line:90%
Who's to blame?

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.515 align:middle line:84%
And the mind would just go rapid
with those kind of questions,

00:02:50.515 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
take you anywhere.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:84%
They take you on
a downward spiral,

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:00.230 align:middle line:84%
or you will end up mining the
database of human consciousness

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.960 align:middle line:84%
of all of the negativity that's
ever happened on the planet.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.070 align:middle line:90%
Why me?

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.880 align:middle line:90%
What's wrong?

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Who's to blame?

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:84%
You'll just pull in all the
frequency of all the suffering

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:90%
that's happening on the planet.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.780 align:middle line:84%
So you have to ask an
empowering question,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
a question such as, you know,
what good is present that I

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:90%
cannot see right now?

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.660 align:middle line:84%
What's seeking to emerge
in my life right now?

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.230 align:middle line:84%
What gift is being
born in me right now?

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.970 align:middle line:90%
What talent is being honed?

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.960 align:middle line:90%
What power is being cultivated?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.620 align:middle line:90%
What's trying to unfold?

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.630 align:middle line:84%
What am I seeking to
give birth to right now?

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.670 align:middle line:84%
Because as you know,
when birth has happened,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.320 align:middle line:90%
it's very intense.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.980 align:middle line:84%
It's a very intense period
of time in a woman's life

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.920 align:middle line:90%
and in the infant's life.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
And so in the same
way, we're always

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.100 align:middle line:90%
giving birth to something.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to ask a
different kind of question.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Now here's the deal.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.550 align:middle line:84%
The universal presence,
by whatever name

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.930 align:middle line:90%
you choose to call it--

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
I call the presence
limitless love intelligence,

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.560 align:middle line:84%
or a presence that's
never an absence.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:90%
It's life itself.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.940 align:middle line:84%
This universal presence,
through the universe

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.680 align:middle line:84%
and the universal law, will
answer any question you ask.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you ask
what's wrong, it'll

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:84%
tell you all the
things that are wrong.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.340 align:middle line:84%
If you ask what's
trying to be born,

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.520 align:middle line:84%
it will begin to
show you potential

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.820 align:middle line:84%
that's within you that's
seeking to emerge.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And when your attention
starts to shift more

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.990 align:middle line:84%
towards the potential
rather than the problem,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.900 align:middle line:84%
you begin to understand
a universal truth--

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.500 align:middle line:84%
potential is always
bigger than problem.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:84%
Your potential is always bigger
than any problem you're facing.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.440 align:middle line:90%
You start to see your potential.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you focus on that,
the answers from that realm

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.380 align:middle line:84%
start to come as guidance,
wisdom, transforming knowledge,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.400 align:middle line:84%
spontaneous goodness,
insight, ahas.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
perception changes simply by
asking a question that empowers

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.340 align:middle line:90%
you rather than takes you down.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.450 align:middle line:84%
The perception of
the victim is largely

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.070 align:middle line:84%
different from the perception of
the individual that is taking--

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.530 align:middle line:84%
having more dominion
over their awareness.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.460 align:middle line:84%
It's the difference of looking
at life from the valley

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:90%
or from the mountaintop.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.780 align:middle line:84%
When you're looking
at life in the valley,

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.365 align:middle line:90%
life is totally different.

00:05:37.365 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:90%
You see the obstacle.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.725 align:middle line:84%
You see obstacles,
hindrances, obstructions.

00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:42.100 align:middle line:84%
When you go to
the top and you're

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.260 align:middle line:84%
able to look down at everything,
life is quite different.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:84%
So when you ask a
different kind of question,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.530 align:middle line:84%
your perception expands
and you see life

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.350 align:middle line:84%
from a much wider
expanse, and you're

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.610 align:middle line:84%
able to make more deliberate
choices from that awareness.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.450 align:middle line:84%
The trick is in the
moment of your angst,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
in the moment when
it's difficult,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.330 align:middle line:84%
ask the question, you know,
what's trying to be born here?

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:90%
What gift is trying to be given?

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's when you want to ask.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.940 align:middle line:84%
It's easy to ask when
everything is going well.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.380 align:middle line:84%
But you want to ask the
question on such a regular basis

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.550 align:middle line:84%
that when things seem
to be contracting,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
you're still asking
empowering question.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.960 align:middle line:84%
And that becomes a
practice, and then that

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
becomes a way of
life, and then you

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
start to develop the
capacity to deeply listen.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
You're always in
a listening space.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.610 align:middle line:84%
You know the guidance
is here, wisdom is here,

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.580 align:middle line:90%
direction is here.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
That underlying question
keeps your listening faculty

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.520 align:middle line:90%
acute and available.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.170 align:middle line:10%
