00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.350 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the depressing
statistics is how many people

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.070 align:middle line:84%
check their phones first
thing in the morning.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.580 align:middle line:84%
They wake up and they look at
their social media accounts.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.780 align:middle line:84%
They check email first
thing in the morning.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.720 align:middle line:90%
And that's over half the people.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.500 align:middle line:84%
In some surveys, about
2/3 of people do this.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.600 align:middle line:84%
There are studies showing that
some people check their cell

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.330 align:middle line:84%
phones during
sexual intercourse.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.850 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] This is an addiction.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:90%
That's addictive behavior.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.680 align:middle line:84%
We're addicted to stuff, and
very little of it is positive.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.550 align:middle line:84%
So we're filling our minds with
negative news, negative inputs.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.300 align:middle line:84%
We're not taking
control of our health.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.818 align:middle line:84%
We're handing control
of our health,

00:00:48.818 --> 00:00:50.860 align:middle line:84%
and our thoughts, and our
beliefs to other people

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.030 align:middle line:90%
outside of ourselves.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And we're handing our thoughts
and control of our beliefs

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.770 align:middle line:84%
over to people who just want to
make a buck off negative news.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.400 align:middle line:84%
So one study, for example,
looked at the world.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
And it compared the world
to news about the world.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you look at
actual objective measures

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.190 align:middle line:84%
of human flourishing,
they're fantastic.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.220 align:middle line:84%
In the last 33 years,
human global wealth

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.590 align:middle line:84%
of the average
citizen has tripled.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.400 align:middle line:84%
Over the last century, the
human lifespan has, on average,

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.720 align:middle line:90%
doubled.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.750 align:middle line:84%
We now have about half the
CO2 production per unit of GDP

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.500 align:middle line:90%
we had 20 years ago.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.400 align:middle line:84%
If you look at human rights, if
you look at infant mortality,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.160 align:middle line:84%
virtually every
measure of flourishing

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.990 align:middle line:90%
shows we're improving.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Globally, IQ is rising by about
three points every decade.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.290 align:middle line:84%
So if you just look
at all the statistics,

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:84%
everything points to us
being in an unprecedented era

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.210 align:middle line:90%
of human flourishing.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's happening in
the media is the opposite.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.620 align:middle line:84%
One team of scientists did
a word analysis of words

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.015 align:middle line:84%
in "The New York Times" dating
from 1945 to the present.

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we have
records going back that long

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.360 align:middle line:90%
with "The New York Times."

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.920 align:middle line:84%
And they found that
over the years,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.400 align:middle line:84%
the number of words like
good, and positive, happy, all

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.370 align:middle line:84%
of those words were
in steady decline.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And words like horrific,
and tragic, and violent--

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.010 align:middle line:84%
all these negative
words were going up.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Even as the actual state of the
world is improving steadily,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%
our perception of it as
portrayed by the media

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.480 align:middle line:90%
is getting worse.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that same team,
they looked at word analysis

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.187 align:middle line:84%
from 130 countries, all
their media since 1975.

00:02:38.187 --> 00:02:39.520 align:middle line:90%
And they found the same pattern.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.050 align:middle line:84%
All over the world,
we're being told

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.060 align:middle line:84%
things are worse, and worse,
and worse while they're getting

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.570 align:middle line:90%
better, and better, and better.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens when
we wake up in the morning

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:84%
and we then hand our
conscience over to Facebook,

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and Google, and Instagram, and
all these external sources,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.900 align:middle line:84%
we're then saying, you go
program my mind for me.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.260 align:middle line:84%
And you're getting a completely
inaccurate view of the world

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.310 align:middle line:90%
by doing that.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.020 align:middle line:84%
What I recommend
you do instead--

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.700 align:middle line:90%
what I do every morning--

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.500 align:middle line:90%
is I wake up in the morning.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And immediately, I
attune to what I call

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:90%
in my books the non-local mind.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:90%
We have our consciousness.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.190 align:middle line:84%
But our consciousness is not
the artifact of a complex brain.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.740 align:middle line:84%
Our brain is more
like a transceiver

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.780 align:middle line:84%
of information from
non-local fields,

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:84%
and a translator of that
information into local reality.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:84%
We literally make up
local reality around us

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.250 align:middle line:90%
with our brains.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.080 align:middle line:84%
So if you wake up in the
morning and you, of course,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
have a local mind,
you have a local body.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.120 align:middle line:84%
But if you immediately
attune it to non-local mind,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.150 align:middle line:84%
non-local reality, then
the news you're getting

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.510 align:middle line:90%
is the news of the universe.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.490 align:middle line:90%
And it is positive.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:84%
It is full of abundance, and
love, and compassion, and joy.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.430 align:middle line:84%
So now you're plugging
yourself into all of that.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.010 align:middle line:84%
You aren't plugging yourself
into all the negative media,

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.770 align:middle line:84%
the negative inputs, and
filling your mind with that.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.660 align:middle line:90%
You're plugging into reality.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.270 align:middle line:84%
That stuff out there
is not reality.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:90%
This stuff up here is reality.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.100 align:middle line:84%
The mystics, the saints,
the sages throughout history

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
have told us that you lose
yourself in this ocean of bliss

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.495 align:middle line:90%
when you're there.

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, what starts
happening in your body

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:90%
then is not high cortisol.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:90%
It is not high adrenaline.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:90%
It's high DHEA.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.410 align:middle line:90%
It's high oxytocin.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.200 align:middle line:84%
It's high anandamide,
the bliss molecule.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.000 align:middle line:90%
It is nitric oxide.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
It is norepinephrine,
which helps you stay alert.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.000 align:middle line:84%
All these beneficial
shifts happen in your body.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.957 align:middle line:84%
Your brain secretes
beta endorphins.

00:04:32.957 --> 00:04:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So you'll be in a
meditation practice.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Beta endorphins are the
natural form of morphine.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.550 align:middle line:84%
They are three
times more powerful

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.930 align:middle line:90%
than synthetic morphine.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:84%
So now you start your
meditation practice.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.737 align:middle line:84%
You feel a little bit
of an ache in your back.

00:04:44.737 --> 00:04:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Your tummy is rumbling.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.130 align:middle line:84%
You feel a bit of a neck
ache from exercising too

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:90%
much yesterday.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.310 align:middle line:90%
And suddenly, you're in bliss.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.960 align:middle line:84%
You've forgotten
about your body.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.730 align:middle line:84%
That's beta
endorphins kicking in.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.703 align:middle line:84%
So you now have all
these beneficial hormones

00:04:57.703 --> 00:05:00.370 align:middle line:84%
and neurotransmitters kicking in
because you've plugged yourself

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.470 align:middle line:84%
into the information source
of the universe, which

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.290 align:middle line:84%
has nothing but love for you and
love for everything around you.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's how you want
to start your day.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.572 align:middle line:84%
And those are the beneficial
biological changes

00:05:10.572 --> 00:05:12.030 align:middle line:84%
you want be producing
in your body,

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.160 align:middle line:84%
not all these negative
ones that come

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.620 align:middle line:84%
from plugging into
the outside world,

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.740 align:middle line:84%
to these thoughts, and
ideas, and world views,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.630 align:middle line:84%
and stories that
come from the news.
