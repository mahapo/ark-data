00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.740 align:middle line:84%
>> In the morning,
you're still in bed.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.290 align:middle line:90%
So we are very tranquil.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.680 align:middle line:84%
Your body is de-tensed
up till the tissue.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Then you're without
food in the body.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So the body's chemistry
is not into working.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not digesting the energy.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.150 align:middle line:84%
It's not concentrated
over there.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.380 align:middle line:90%
It's able to flow through that.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:84%
So if you're doing
a breathing exercise

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.540 align:middle line:84%
and you can shelter
yourself from being acidic,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
because as the night goes on,
all kinds of acidic elements

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.790 align:middle line:90%
come out of your body.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.590 align:middle line:90%
They get into your system.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.450 align:middle line:84%
You see yourself being
acidic when you rise.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.330 align:middle line:84%
Within 20 minutes
of this breathing,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.390 align:middle line:84%
you will be able to become
completely alkaline.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:84%
And that makes you very
much better performing

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:84%
during the day, very
much more in control

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.880 align:middle line:84%
at will over your
mood and energy.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.470 align:middle line:84%
We only need to do
this breathing, just

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.250 align:middle line:90%
deeper breathing.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes a cold
shower is stimulating

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.080 align:middle line:84%
the vascular system, which
is the transportation system.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.150 align:middle line:84%
And it brings about
energizing elements

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.200 align:middle line:84%
inside the body called
oxygen. And it brings it

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.850 align:middle line:90%
to the immune cells.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And then the immune
cells are awake.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:84%
When you have these temperature
differences, people get a cold.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:84%
And it's only because
you're not adapting directly

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.950 align:middle line:84%
toward that change, because
your immune cells are not

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.570 align:middle line:90%
really active.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.500 align:middle line:84%
They are a little bit,
because of the comfort,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.000 align:middle line:90%
like a muscle non-trained.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.650 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know
how to handle it.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
So what we do with
the cold shower

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:07.390 align:middle line:84%
is alerting the immune cells by
alerting the vascular system.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:84%
It's 75,000 miles
inside of each of us,

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.920 align:middle line:84%
full of reflexes and
primitive muscles.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.350 align:middle line:84%
They are being exercised
by the cold shower.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.900 align:middle line:84%
Then the heart rate
goes down, because it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.070 align:middle line:84%
doesn't need to compensate the
loss of the vascular system

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.350 align:middle line:84%
to transport oxygen and the
right nutrients in the body.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:90%
So stress hormone is less.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.220 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Because the heart rate goes
down to its natural status.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:90%
It's far too high.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's creating
stress in the body.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.230 align:middle line:84%
It's alarming for a
heart which goes--

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
trying to compensate
the blood flow through,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.660 align:middle line:84%
because all these little muscles
and reflexes of the 75,000

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.370 align:middle line:84%
miles are not working together
with the heart, lazybones.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Then the heart is
trying to compensate.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It creates a signal to the
brain stem, the primitive brain,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.670 align:middle line:84%
the reptilian brain, hey, there
is danger, stress hormone.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.010 align:middle line:84%
And that stress
hormone is constantly

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.640 align:middle line:84%
in the modern man, woman,
human in society present.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And it keeps the
sympathetic nervous system,

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.760 align:middle line:90%
the action going.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:84%
On the cell level,
there is no peace.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.340 align:middle line:84%
There is no rest, which it needs
to rehabilitate for its energy

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:90%
to store up energy.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Thus we get defense
systems of ours,

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.890 align:middle line:84%
they become lower, because
they have no energy.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:84%
And we are working ourselves
even to burnout and fatigue.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
Very important that
the defense system--

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.210 align:middle line:90%
it needs energy.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And we have all the
systems to do that.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.800 align:middle line:84%
But we do not
breathe well enough.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it
doesn't get the oxygen.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And then all these processes
like aerobic dissimulation,

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.190 align:middle line:90%
they don't happen.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.290 align:middle line:84%
And then the defense
systems, of course,

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.980 align:middle line:84%
are not accurate toward its
ability to fend off disease,

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
to adapt to any danger, not
only the cold but also to virus.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:90%
We got all these.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.460 align:middle line:84%
We are exposed to all the
time to bacteria, viruses,

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:90%
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.420 align:middle line:84%
But if the defense
system is right,

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:84%
then there is no
danger whatsoever.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.190 align:middle line:90%
And we got it all in our hands.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And we can feel when we
become a little bit awkward,

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.840 align:middle line:84%
like getting towards
sickness or flu

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.080 align:middle line:84%
or fever or any other disease,
like autoimmune and all.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.980 align:middle line:90%
We can feel it.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
But we lost this
contact within to deal

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:90%
with that at that moment.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.790 align:middle line:90%
We take it for granted.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:90%
And we keep on in our rat race.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:84%
And we do not know how
to stand still and become

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
aware of our physiology
at that moment to maintain

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.770 align:middle line:90%
happy, strong, and healthy.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:90%
We just know it.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.980 align:middle line:90%
But now we got it.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.890 align:middle line:84%
So comfort, real comfort is
the confidence and the strength

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.400 align:middle line:84%
and the happiness within and
maintaining it at any time.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.980 align:middle line:90%
Be the master of yourself.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.030 align:middle line:90%
And that feels good.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.780 align:middle line:90%
