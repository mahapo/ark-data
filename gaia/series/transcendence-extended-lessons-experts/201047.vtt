00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes, you need to set
a goal or create that dream.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.450 align:middle line:90%
You don't need to know the how.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Just first get the
dream together,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.610 align:middle line:84%
and often, we are the ones
that are our own obstacles

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.400 align:middle line:90%
in our own way.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:84%
And whatever your
dreams are, when

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:84%
you're able to create
your big dreams,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.480 align:middle line:84%
once you've decided on
that, then the opportunities

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and the ideas start
coming to you, right?

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So you become, once you
have that really big goal,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.810 align:middle line:84%
then you become more
aware, more alert.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.310 align:middle line:84%
Once you're looking
out that window,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.600 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing what
you're looking for,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.450 align:middle line:84%
which is how to make
a million dollars,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.160 align:middle line:84%
how to find my soulmate, how
to have the dream career.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.790 align:middle line:84%
All those things all of a
sudden start showing up for you.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.220 align:middle line:84%
It's when you get stuck
in that negative space

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.710 align:middle line:84%
that you don't see
the opportunities.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:84%
You're in this dark fog,
you're in that tunnel.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
There could be a million
doors of opportunities

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:84%
all around you, you
will never see them.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.370 align:middle line:84%
You will never see them
because you're stuck, right?

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:84%
I always say you know
when you are stuck,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.930 align:middle line:84%
it's like you are
staring at a closed door.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Not only is it closed,
but it's locked,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.900 align:middle line:90%
and you're not going anywhere.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean
by that is anytime

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
you're complaining, anytime you
are feeling sorry for yourself,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.573 align:middle line:84%
anytime you're saying,
why is this happening?

00:01:40.573 --> 00:01:41.990 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe
this is happening?

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:84%
This isn't fair, and
all that resentment

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:84%
and anger around your situation,
it's hard to move past that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.630 align:middle line:84%
and actually bounce back
quickly and bounce back big.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.330 align:middle line:84%
It's really difficult
because you're just busy

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:90%
staring at this closed door.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.880 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, there are all these
open doors all around you,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:84%
but you don't see them
because I'm too busy staring

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.630 align:middle line:84%
at this closed door that's
right in front of your face,

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.320 align:middle line:84%
and so what I say is step
away from that closed door.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.990 align:middle line:84%
Stop focusing on all the
negative and all the things

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.710 align:middle line:84%
that you're not happy about, and
start focusing on what you want

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.810 align:middle line:84%
and what you want to
create into your life.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.230 align:middle line:84%
What you want to
bring into your life.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Focus on the
positive, and as soon

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.820 align:middle line:84%
as you start focusing on the
positive in what you want

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:84%
to create and dream big, all
of a sudden, you step away

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.290 align:middle line:84%
and you look around, and
you say, oh, my goodness,

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.930 align:middle line:84%
where were all these
open doors before?

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:84%
They were there
all along, right?

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.980 align:middle line:84%
It's what you look for
is what you will find.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
constantly negative,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:90%
you'll find more negativity.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.157 align:middle line:84%
If you're constantly
positive, you

00:02:47.157 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:84%
will always find all the
positive things all around you,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.230 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.260 align:middle line:10%
So it's one of those things that
once you start becoming aware

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.480 align:middle line:10%
what's in there and what's going
on and be able to shift that,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.900 align:middle line:10%
your entire life will shift.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.470 align:middle line:84%
I talk about reprogramming
your conscious mind,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.590 align:middle line:84%
and I usually break it
down into three steps,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:84%
and the first one is
reprogram your conscious mind,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.360 align:middle line:84%
and what your conscious mind
is all about your thoughts

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.920 align:middle line:90%
and what you're thinking.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:90%
So let me explain.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.250 align:middle line:84%
The way it works is
this, is that when

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.240 align:middle line:84%
something negative is
happening around you,

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.820 align:middle line:84%
so it's, let's say, outside
of you, and it could be--

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.460 align:middle line:84%
in my case, I was
$124,000 in debt.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.140 align:middle line:84%
My relationship was breaking
up, my ex was an alcoholic.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.060 align:middle line:90%
I had serious health issues.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.060 align:middle line:90%
We were losing our home.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.643 align:middle line:84%
All these things
were happening to me.

00:03:39.643 --> 00:03:41.840 align:middle line:84%
All these things
were happening to me,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and I was feeling really sad,
depressed, angry, resentful,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.840 align:middle line:90%
all those negative feelings.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.775 align:middle line:84%
And so if somebody would
have asked me and said, well,

00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:84%
why are you feeling
all those feelings?

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.300 align:middle line:90%
Why are you feeling sad?

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.230 align:middle line:90%
Why are you feeling angry?

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:90%
Why are you feeling resentful?

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.120 align:middle line:90%
What is all this negativity?

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm saying, why?

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm losing my
home, $124,000 in debt.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.310 align:middle line:84%
My ex-- at the time,
he wasn't my ex--

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.540 align:middle line:90%
is an alcoholic.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.970 align:middle line:84%
I have a serious
health challenge.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Of course I'm feeling this way.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why I feel this
way, but you know what?

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.010 align:middle line:84%
So you have something outside
of you that's happening,

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.470 align:middle line:84%
financial,
relationship, whatever,

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.240 align:middle line:90%
and you feel something.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:84%
You assume that the
reason you feel this way

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.890 align:middle line:84%
is because of that,
but that isn't true.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Something happens
between that and this.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.560 align:middle line:84%
Something here happens,
and what happens

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.630 align:middle line:84%
is you have a thought about
what's happening in your life.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:84%
That thought is causing
you to feel the way you do.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.770 align:middle line:84%
So you were causing your
own pain and suffering.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.075 align:middle line:84%
It's not out there, and
the reason that's true

00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:84%
is because you can
have 10 people going

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
through the exact same
situation and have

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:90%
10 different reactions, right?

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And so if that's the case,
then what's the difference?

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.100 align:middle line:90%
It's what you think.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you're going through
a difficult time in your life

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're not feeling good,
you have to ask yourself,

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.030 align:middle line:84%
OK, obviously
something's happening

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.450 align:middle line:84%
and things happen in life,
and we have to deal with it,

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and get through it, get back
up, move forward, handle it.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.430 align:middle line:84%
How quickly you
do that, is this.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens is
you have to ask yourself

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:84%
that question in
those situations

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.520 align:middle line:84%
when you don't feel good,
and the question is this,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.990 align:middle line:84%
what am I thinking
about right now

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.080 align:middle line:90%
that's making me feel this way?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:84%
And the stories
we tell ourselves.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.170 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't even talk to
your worst enemy the way

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.220 align:middle line:84%
we talk to ourselves, and
of course, do that exercise.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.220 align:middle line:90%
To this day, I still do that.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.800 align:middle line:84%
If I feel like I'm getting
upset or stressed or anything,

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.150 align:middle line:90%
I will ask myself, I say, wow.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.500 align:middle line:90%
I do not feel good.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.820 align:middle line:90%
I need to stop for a second.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.020 align:middle line:90%
What is going on right now?

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, what am I
thinking right now?

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And then I go over the story
I've been telling myself,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:84%
and I realize, oh,
well, that makes sense.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Now let's change the
story, because often, it's

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.400 align:middle line:84%
just a story and your
interpretation of what's

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.200 align:middle line:90%
going on.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.658 align:middle line:84%
Well, what if you could actually
change that interpretation

00:06:10.658 --> 00:06:11.980 align:middle line:90%
to something positive?

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.332 align:middle line:84%
Because in the end,
think about this.

00:06:14.332 --> 00:06:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Think about something
that happened

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.190 align:middle line:84%
to you in the past
that was negative

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.490 align:middle line:84%
and then fast forward two years,
five years, and you look back,

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.608 align:middle line:84%
and most of the
time, you would say,

00:06:24.608 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
that was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.150 align:middle line:84%
Could have been a
breakup, and then

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.090 align:middle line:84%
you later met your
real soulmate.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:90%
So you never know.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.920 align:middle line:84%
You have to trust and
you have to believe,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.598 align:middle line:90%
and you move forward.

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:90%
But I'm telling you right here.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.270 align:middle line:90%
This is where it all begins.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.890 align:middle line:84%
By reprogramming
your conscious mind.

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Conscious mind
means your thoughts.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.180 align:middle line:84%
You can easily become aware
of what you're thinking.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.100 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you do
that and you're

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:53.410 align:middle line:84%
able to shift it and turn it
into a positive story or a more

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.270 align:middle line:84%
positive story, you feel
better, because obviously,

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.830 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts are
what's causing you

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:90%
to feel what you're feeling.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Step 2 is reprogram
your subconscious mind.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.080 align:middle line:90%
So what that means is--

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:84%
this is a lot
harder, by the way.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.190 align:middle line:84%
You can do it, it's just
harder than the other one

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.018 align:middle line:84%
is like, what am I
thinking about right now

00:07:14.018 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:90%
that's making me feel this way.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.330 align:middle line:90%
Pretty simple.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.100 align:middle line:90%
Step 2 subconscious.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Reprogram your
subconscious mind.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:24.310 align:middle line:90%
Those are your limiting beliefs.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:29.950 align:middle line:10%
What you believe is what
you will manifest, right?

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.370 align:middle line:10%
And so you have to figure
out that area of your life

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.510 align:middle line:10%
that isn't working, what are
your beliefs around that area?

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.320 align:middle line:10%
Because those beliefs will
determine how successful you

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.220 align:middle line:10%
are in that area of your life,
and it's really interesting

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.630 align:middle line:10%
because sometimes
we have beliefs

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.662 align:middle line:10%
and we don't even know we
have those beliefs, right?

00:07:49.662 --> 00:07:52.120 align:middle line:84%
And that's why that's step 1
is important, because once you

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:84%
start becoming aware
of your thoughts,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.750 align:middle line:84%
then you start recognizing
what you're telling yourself.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
What you're telling
yourself is so

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.140 align:middle line:84%
powerful in determining
what action you take,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:84%
determining of what direction
you will go in your life,

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:84%
and so your limiting beliefs
are what really drive you

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:84%
in every way without
you even realizing it.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.550 align:middle line:84%
The good news is
that you can uncover

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.860 align:middle line:84%
what your limiting beliefs
are, and once you--

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.530 align:middle line:84%
in that area that's not
working and once you do,

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:23.440 align:middle line:84%
then you just shift them to
positive empowering beliefs

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.460 align:middle line:84%
instead, and then once you've
done that, everything shifts

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.190 align:middle line:84%
in that area, but until
you do that, it'll

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.400 align:middle line:84%
be very difficult
to truly transform

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.659 align:middle line:90%
that area of your life.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.341 align:middle line:84%
You might say I want
to meet my soulmate,

00:08:37.341 --> 00:08:39.549 align:middle line:84%
and then you meet your
soulmate but then you break up

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:40.690 align:middle line:84%
three months later
and then you're

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:41.950 align:middle line:84%
looking for your
soul mate again,

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
and then you meet your
soulmate six months later

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.990 align:middle line:84%
and then you break up, and
then there are limiting beliefs

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.410 align:middle line:84%
around that area of your life
around relationships or money

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:90%
is a big one for many people.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're finding you're
having a lot of difficulty

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:84%
making ends meet or you're not
reaching your financial goals

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.450 align:middle line:84%
and no matter how hard you
try, how hard you work,

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
no matter what you do,
it's still not happening,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.920 align:middle line:84%
or sometimes it happens,
and then you lose it,

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:09.100 align:middle line:90%
and it happens, and you lose it.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.960 align:middle line:84%
You need to analyze and figure
out what your beliefs are

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.230 align:middle line:90%
around that area of money.

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:15.440 align:middle line:90%
That's a really huge one.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.898 align:middle line:84%
So what people are
normally looking

00:09:16.898 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
for when it comes
to making money

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.620 align:middle line:84%
is all different kinds
of opportunities.

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
a better job, I'm

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
going to start a new business,
I'm going to do this,

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.420 align:middle line:84%
and those are all good things,
but if you haven't shifted

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.390 align:middle line:84%
your limiting
beliefs around money,

00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:36.040 align:middle line:84%
you will always be struggling
around money no matter what.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
So the good news is
all you have to do

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.330 align:middle line:84%
is uncover what your
limiting beliefs are.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:40.913 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to give
you some examples

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:45.190 align:middle line:84%
around what limiting beliefs
are around money, for instance.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.590 align:middle line:90%
I'll never be a millionaire.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:50.920 align:middle line:90%
Rich people are jerks.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:90%
I'm too old to be rich.

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not smart enough to be rich.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:06.300 align:middle line:84%
Money doesn't grow on trees,
and another exercise--

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:84%
a really great exercise
would be actually pick

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.710 align:middle line:84%
that area of your life
that isn't working,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.515 align:middle line:84%
so let's say financial, and
then just write out the story.

00:10:15.515 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:90%
Write out your story.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:19.258 align:middle line:84%
Just hand write the story of
what's going on in that area.

00:10:19.258 --> 00:10:20.800 align:middle line:84%
I do journaling
every single morning.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.578 align:middle line:84%
I start off my day
journaling, and I just

00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:25.120 align:middle line:84%
write, and write, and write,
and write, and write, and write.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.700 align:middle line:90%
So you tell your story.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.930 align:middle line:84%
So I can't believe that
I'm six figures in debt.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.400 align:middle line:90%
How did this happen?

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Whatever the story
is, and I'm never

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.330 align:middle line:84%
going to make that
kind of money.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.955 align:middle line:84%
How am I ever going
to get out of debt?

00:10:35.955 --> 00:10:38.380 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to end up losing
everything, and whatever.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Just write and write, and
don't edit or anything.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:84%
Just free flow and write, and
write, and write, and tell

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.750 align:middle line:84%
your story and keep on
writing until you just can't

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.340 align:middle line:90%
write anymore around that.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.140 align:middle line:84%
Just put it-- whatever
is in your head,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:51.610 align:middle line:90%
just put it on paper.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:55.070 align:middle line:84%
This is your truth
around that area.

00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.640 align:middle line:84%
And then what I want you to
do is then go back and then

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.900 align:middle line:90%
read it.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.690 align:middle line:84%
And then read it again, and
then read it again, and then

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.080 align:middle line:90%
read it again.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.470 align:middle line:84%
And by the time you read
it the fifth or sixth time,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.110 align:middle line:84%
you're going to start
noticing the story.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:12.520 align:middle line:84%
A, how negative it is, and B,
ask yourself that question,

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.500 align:middle line:84%
is this really true
or is this the stories

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.120 align:middle line:90%
I've been telling myself?

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.820 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
pick up what that is,

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.530 align:middle line:84%
you can easily shifted into
a positive empowering belief.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So for money, for instance, I
always say this to this day,

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's an ongoing
joke with all my friends

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and family because I
do this all the time.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I love to say, money
flows easily, freely,

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.170 align:middle line:90%
and from everywhere.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Money flows easily, freely,
and from everywhere.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Money flows easily, freely,
and from everywhere.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:47.210 align:middle line:84%
And I have it on the
poster in my office.

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:50.740 align:middle line:84%
I will find a nickel on the
ground, and I will pick it up

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and I will be, money
flows easily, freely,

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.530 align:middle line:90%
and from everywhere.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:01.480 align:middle line:84%
I say it all the time,
and it really does.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.410 align:middle line:90%
It's really crazy.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:90%
It's really crazy.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And so you start reprogramming
your subconscious mind.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:84%
Instead of thinking money
doesn't grow on trees,

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.000 align:middle line:84%
I'll never be a millionaire,
only other people,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.680 align:middle line:84%
other people, are the ones
that become rich, not me.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.420 align:middle line:90%
Well, why not you?

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:90%
Why not you?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.680 align:middle line:90%
Ask yourself that question.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.140 align:middle line:84%
All kinds of stuff
is going to come up.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.302 align:middle line:90%
Why not you?

00:12:30.302 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, because I'm
not smart enough.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.250 align:middle line:84%
OK, there's another
limited belief.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.292 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of people
that are not smart that

00:12:35.292 --> 00:12:39.100 align:middle line:90%
are billionaires, right?

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.942 align:middle line:84%
And so it's important
to really uncover

00:12:41.942 --> 00:12:43.900 align:middle line:84%
those limiting beliefs
and trying to figure out

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:84%
what is it that has been
stopping me from moving forward

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.270 align:middle line:90%
in that area of my life.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you right
now, once you uncover

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.750 align:middle line:84%
what your limiting beliefs
are around that area that's

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.230 align:middle line:84%
not working in your life,
everything will shift.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:03.040 align:middle line:84%
You just need to turn it into
positive, empowering beliefs

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.140 align:middle line:84%
instead, but you can't
do that until you

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.180 align:middle line:90%
uncover what they are.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.140 align:middle line:84%
Step number 3 is elevating
your vibrational frequency

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:16.810 align:middle line:84%
to a state of love,
peace, joy, and gratitude.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Once you get yourself to a
state of love, peace, joy,

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude, everything
will shift in your life.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.430 align:middle line:90%
Everything.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:84%
Not whether you believe
in the law of attraction

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.850 align:middle line:84%
or you don't, it
doesn't really matter.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.220 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.720 align:middle line:84%
If you get yourself to a
state of love, peace, joy,

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude, how
would you feel?

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.320 align:middle line:90%
How would you like your life?

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:90%
It would be great.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter what you
believe, but I'm telling you,

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
once you get yourself to a state
of love, peace, joy, gratitude,

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.160 align:middle line:84%
which is the highest vibrational
frequency, especially love

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and peace, really
powerful, and you

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.020 align:middle line:84%
do the work to be
able to get to that,

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:84%
everything will be OK in your
life, even when something quote

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:90%
unquote bad happens, right?

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll start attracting
more positive people, things,

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.470 align:middle line:90%
situations in your life, why?

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.002 align:middle line:90%
Because that's who you're being.

00:14:08.002 --> 00:14:10.587 align:middle line:84%
You're being love, peace,
joy, and gratitude.

00:14:10.587 --> 00:14:12.670 align:middle line:84%
That is what you will
attract back into your life.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.908 align:middle line:84%
When you're being negative,
angry, resentful, all that,

00:14:15.908 --> 00:14:17.450 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
attract more of that.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:17.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what you're
focusing on and that's what

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:90%
you're going to see.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:90%
Remember all those open doors?

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.280 align:middle line:90%
They're not there.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.780 align:middle line:84%
When you're in love, peace,
joy, and gratitude, you're like,

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.350 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen so
many open doors.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't even know which
one to go through.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:32.990 align:middle line:90%
Wow, right?

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And so how do you get to a
state of love, peace, joy,

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.380 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude is the number one
question people always ask me,

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.280 align:middle line:90%
and there's many ways.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:47.960 align:middle line:84%
There are many ways that you can
do it, and one of the things--

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you a few
ways of doing it, and probably

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:90%
all these things you should do.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.835 align:middle line:84%
Let go of the negative
past, because when

00:14:57.835 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:84%
you're holding onto the negative
past, the negative things that

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.305 align:middle line:84%
happen to you in the past that,
not only are you bringing it

00:15:03.305 --> 00:15:04.930 align:middle line:84%
into your present,
but you're affecting

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:08.230 align:middle line:84%
your future, because
every decision you make,

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:84%
how you see things,
your perception,

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.820 align:middle line:84%
you're holding onto
something from the past,

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.790 align:middle line:90%
so it's very negative.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And so if you don't let
go of the negative past,

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:84%
it will be difficult to
transform your life going

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:27.020 align:middle line:84%
forward, and a lot of people
say, well, how do we do that?

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:34.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, one great way is to
think of the past as no longer

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:40.330 align:middle line:84%
real, because the reality
is the past doesn't exist.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:44.507 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people argue
that, and it doesn't exist.

00:15:44.507 --> 00:15:45.340 align:middle line:90%
Where does it exist?

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:90%
Show it to me.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:90%
Where does it exist?

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:48.910 align:middle line:90%
Is it this?

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:49.710 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.470 align:middle line:84%
The only place that exists
is this thing again.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:56.650 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't exist, right?

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.570 align:middle line:90%
And so the past--

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:84%
we're keeping the past
alive by our thoughts.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.270 align:middle line:90%
The crazy part is this.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Is that the future doesn't
exist either, right?

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.150 align:middle line:90%
So the future is also a thought.

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.460 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:84%
When you're thinking about
the future, you're thinking.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:18.795 align:middle line:90%
It's not real.

00:16:18.795 --> 00:16:20.920 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean you don't
think about the future,

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:21.890 align:middle line:90%
you don't plan for the future.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Of course, you do,
but think about it.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.480 align:middle line:84%
The future doesn't
exist either, and I

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
want you to know
that anytime you're

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.810 align:middle line:84%
feeling stressed or angry
or worried, chances are,

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:32.980 align:middle line:90%
you were either--

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:84%
all those negative
feelings, you're either

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.610 align:middle line:84%
focusing on what
happened in the past

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.902 align:middle line:84%
or you're worrying about
what's going on in the future.

00:16:38.902 --> 00:16:40.630 align:middle line:84%
You're not in the
present, right?

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.727 align:middle line:84%
So as soon as you become aware
of that, that immediately makes

00:16:43.727 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:84%
everything better, because
as soon as you bring yourself

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:49.300 align:middle line:84%
into this present moment,
which is my point here,

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.810 align:middle line:84%
is that the past doesn't exist,
the future doesn't exist.

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:55.750 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that exists
is this moment right now.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.640 align:middle line:84%
This conversation
we're having right

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.840 align:middle line:84%
now is all that exists
in this exact moment.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean you
don't plan for the future,

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:08.470 align:middle line:84%
because remember, while you're
planning and once it arrives,

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:12.250 align:middle line:84%
it's not the future anymore,
it's the present again.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.827 align:middle line:84%
This is all there
is, and so the reason

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:18.369 align:middle line:84%
I'm mentioning that
is as soon as you

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.790 align:middle line:84%
let go of the past, which
is all negative energy,

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.530 align:middle line:84%
then you can get yourself to
that state of love, peace, joy,

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.220 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude, because
it's not holding you back.

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:31.480 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is another thing,
but of course, forgiveness

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.385 align:middle line:84%
has everything to do
with your past again.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:35.260 align:middle line:84%
It's based on something
that happened to you,

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.750 align:middle line:84%
something someone did
to you, or sometimes

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.720 align:middle line:84%
you need to forgive yourself
for what you did, right?

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.920 align:middle line:90%
None of us are perfect.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:84%
We've all done things that we're
not happy about because we're

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:90%
human, right?

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:53.300 align:middle line:84%
And so to forgive yourself,
and so forgiveness is key too,

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.407 align:middle line:84%
and when we forgive,
it's really important

00:17:57.407 --> 00:17:58.990 align:middle line:84%
to realize that when
you're forgiving,

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:04.150 align:middle line:84%
you're not condoning
what somebody did to you,

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.280 align:middle line:90%
all you're doing is this.

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Is you're letting go
of that negativity.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.960 align:middle line:90%
You are doing it for yourself.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.640 align:middle line:84%
There is this
expression, and I can't

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.660 align:middle line:84%
remember who the
author was, but not

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.950 align:middle line:84%
forgiving is like
drinking rat poison

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and expecting the
rat to die, right?

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.700 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.090 align:middle line:84%
The only person dying
is us holding on to it,

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.040 align:middle line:84%
and so forgiveness
is key because you're

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.330 align:middle line:90%
doing it for yourself.

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:90%
It's not for them.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And forgiveness can
happen without even

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.750 align:middle line:90%
speaking to the person.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.860 align:middle line:84%
You can write a letter
and never send it.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.500 align:middle line:90%
In here you could forgive them.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:90%
Let it go.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:48.800 align:middle line:84%
It's for you, because
you're holding

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:84%
onto all that negativity,
and let's face it.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:53.570 align:middle line:84%
That person's probably not
even thinking about you,

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.980 align:middle line:84%
and here, they're holding on
to this mental real estate

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.130 align:middle line:84%
that you're allowing them
to have in your mind.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
They're taking on this mental--
this realist prime real estate

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.250 align:middle line:90%
in our minds.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And they're just out
doing their own thing.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:90%
Just let it go.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:90%
It's the past.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't exist anymore.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.410 align:middle line:84%
People are doing the best they
can with the tools they have,

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
and they make
mistakes around that,

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:21.350 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they grow and
learn and become evolved great

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.610 align:middle line:84%
people, and
sometimes they don't.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's their journey,
that's not yours.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.400 align:middle line:84%
You can choose that
for yourself and be

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.580 align:middle line:84%
able to choose your
revolvea awakened state

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:90%
and allow yourself to forgive.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Forgiveness is important,
because once you forgive,

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.710 align:middle line:84%
you're alleviating
all that negativity,

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.960 align:middle line:90%
and you're being expansive.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.410 align:middle line:84%
You're expanding yourself, and
so forgiveness is important.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.160 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
meditation, and so meditation

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:54.650 align:middle line:84%
is really important because
it quiets your mind.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:55.790 align:middle line:90%
It quiets your mind.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
It allows you to connect
to your higher self

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.360 align:middle line:84%
to source whatever
you believe in,

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
and once you connect
to your higher self,

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.410 align:middle line:84%
you're able to get
the messages that

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.020 align:middle line:90%
are being sent to you, right?

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:12.590 align:middle line:84%
When you're in that
dark, resentful, angry,

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.050 align:middle line:84%
you won't forgive, you're
focusing on the past,

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.850 align:middle line:84%
all that negative
stuff, it's negative.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.410 align:middle line:84%
You're not in a
state of love, you're

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:84%
not in a state of
peace, that's for sure.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:23.270 align:middle line:84%
You're not happy, so you're
not in a state of joy,

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and so you're definitely
not in gratitude,

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:27.300 align:middle line:84%
because you're focusing on
all the negative things.

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:29.330 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, it's hard.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to attract
positive things

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:32.362 align:middle line:90%
if that's what you're thinking.

00:20:32.362 --> 00:20:35.780 align:middle line:84%
So do everything you can to get
yourself to that state of love,

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.700 align:middle line:90%
peace, joy, and gratitude.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Definitely let go of the
past, definitely forgive,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.590 align:middle line:84%
and do whatever allows
you to feel good.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Meditation is a great way.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.780 align:middle line:84%
Walking in nature, go
hiking, go to the park,

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.420 align:middle line:84%
spend time with the
journal is really great,

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.120 align:middle line:84%
but once you get yourself
to that state-- so imagine.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.340 align:middle line:84%
You've reprogrammed
your conscious mind,

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.370 align:middle line:84%
so your thoughts now, you're
becoming aware of them,

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.300 align:middle line:90%
and you realize.

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.187 align:middle line:84%
And you're shifting
what you're thinking.

00:21:01.187 --> 00:21:03.020 align:middle line:84%
You've reprogramming
your subconscious mind.

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:04.812 align:middle line:84%
You've let go of all
those limiting beliefs

00:21:04.812 --> 00:21:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and turn them into positive,
empowering beliefs,

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.370 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a state of love,
peace, joy, and gratitude.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:15.020 align:middle line:84%
How can your life not
be amazing, right?

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:84%
So that's all you have to do
to live your greatest life

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:20.510 align:middle line:90%
and bounce back.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.785 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say you can
bounce back instantly.

00:21:22.785 --> 00:21:25.160 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is change
what you're telling yourself

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.127 align:middle line:90%
and you immediately feel better.

00:21:27.127 --> 00:21:29.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, down the road it will
take maybe a little bit

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:33.270 align:middle line:84%
longer to get to all your
big dreams and goals,
