00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.280 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.470 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a class of
plant-based compounds called

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.750 align:middle line:90%
polyphenols.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And these are basically
the colored compounds

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.940 align:middle line:84%
that are present in anything
that's brightly colored.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.580 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find a
reasonable amount of them

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.880 align:middle line:84%
in leafy green vegetables, and
fruit, and things like that,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.620 align:middle line:90%
but frankly, not that many.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Where they explode is
in herbs and spices.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.950 align:middle line:84%
So the more herbs
and spices you use,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.460 align:middle line:84%
things like rosemary,
oregano, thyme, fennel--

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.650 align:middle line:84%
all those have masses
of these things.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.830 align:middle line:84%
The average Westerner
gets about 1 gram

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.800 align:middle line:84%
of these powerful plant-based
compounds in their food

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.990 align:middle line:84%
if they're eating
just a regular diet

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.290 align:middle line:90%
and they're drinking coffee.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Coffee is the number one source
of polyphenols in the West.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And from an anti-aging
perspective,

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.490 align:middle line:84%
my goal is to get
4 or 5 grams a day.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So I drink my coffee, I eat
chocolate, I drink green tea,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.580 align:middle line:90%
and I eat my vegetables.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:90%
I put extra herbs on them.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:84%
Because the evidence
is that your cells can

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.240 align:middle line:84%
work better when they have
enough of these plant-based

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:90%
compounds.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.000 align:middle line:84%
So I like these
anti-aging compounds

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.040 align:middle line:84%
and performance-enhancing
compounds.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.540 align:middle line:84%
Different polyphenols
do different things.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.670 align:middle line:84%
And there's this amazing
synergistic dance

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.220 align:middle line:84%
between what Mother Nature
makes and what humans want.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.650 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
makes us happy as humans

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.140 align:middle line:90%
is to perform better.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:84%
So no one likes to say, I cooked
dinner, and I did a crappy job.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.790 align:middle line:84%
Even if it wasn't necessary
you did a good job,

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.670 align:middle line:90%
you just want to.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.107 align:middle line:84%
It feels good to do
something with excellence.

00:01:38.107 --> 00:01:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So one of the things
that we're attracted to

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.480 align:middle line:84%
are things that enhance
human performance.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.620 align:middle line:84%
And you could say
that's not true.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, sorry, fire
enhances human performance.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:84%
A million years
ago or something,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:51.815 align:middle line:90%
there were two cavemen.

00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:54.190 align:middle line:84%
And one of them said, I'm
going to use fire to stay warm.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.160 align:middle line:84%
And the other one
said that's cheating.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.470 align:middle line:84%
Well, the guy who said fire is
going to keep me warm-- he's

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.808 align:middle line:90%
our ancestor.

00:02:01.808 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:90%
The other guy didn't make it.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So we have a built-in,
innate desire to do that.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.759 align:middle line:84%
And for thousands of years,
probably tens of thousands

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.430 align:middle line:84%
of years, really, we have been
using plant-based compounds

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.830 align:middle line:84%
in a way that is based
on direct observation

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:84%
from people who use them
over multiple generations.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And the Mother
Nature smart drugs

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.720 align:middle line:84%
that are just endemic
out there that people

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.400 align:middle line:90%
don't think of as smart drugs--

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:90%
number one, it's caffeine.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:84%
Coffee, tea, and
chocolate-- global wars

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.600 align:middle line:84%
have been fought
over these compounds.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.280 align:middle line:90%
They have fueled human progress.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.910 align:middle line:84%
The Enlightenment in Europe
was based on the explosion

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.860 align:middle line:90%
of coffee houses.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.590 align:middle line:84%
Civilization is tied
to these things.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.450 align:middle line:84%
You go back 5,000
years in China.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.770 align:middle line:90%
There was tea.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
And they tracked the different
grades and what they did.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:90%
And we knew this.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.990 align:middle line:90%
You go back in India--

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:90%
tea.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.890 align:middle line:90%
Go back in Africa--

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.690 align:middle line:90%
coffee.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:90%
So this stuff has been around.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.885 align:middle line:84%
What's the other massive,
most studied smart drug

00:02:57.885 --> 00:03:00.010 align:middle line:84%
that Mother Nature makes
that no one ever heard of?

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.690 align:middle line:90%
It's actually tobacco.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Smoking is terrible for you.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.780 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows smoking
is bad for you.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.363 align:middle line:84%
Everyone knows it
makes you smell bad.

00:03:06.363 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:84%
It makes you look old and all
the bad stuff-- cancer, teeth

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:90%
falling out, whatever else.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:84%
However, when people use
nicotine, they type 15% faster.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.610 align:middle line:90%
Their working memory improves.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.830 align:middle line:90%
They perform better.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
And we are so wired
to perform better

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.410 align:middle line:84%
that we are willing to give up
the second half of our quality

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.790 align:middle line:90%
of life to feel good right now.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.220 align:middle line:84%
And emerging studies
in the last 30 years

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.962 align:middle line:84%
from an academic
researcher at Vanderbilt--

00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
I call him Dr. Nicotine
when I interviewed them

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.060 align:middle line:90%
on Bulletproof Radio.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.280 align:middle line:84%
He's like, hey, here's
the first paper that

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.090 align:middle line:84%
shows from the 1980s that
low doses of oral nicotine

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and not smoked, but just
the purified nicotine

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.500 align:middle line:90%
reverse Alzheimer's disease.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.830 align:middle line:84%
If you look at what's
likely to kill you today

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.925 align:middle line:84%
if you're in the West,
it's diabetes, cancer,

00:03:57.925 --> 00:03:59.550 align:middle line:84%
heart disease, and
Alzheimer's disease.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.040 align:middle line:84%
And I just wrote
an anti-aging book

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:90%
looking at these four things.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.420 align:middle line:84%
What if a very tiny amount
of nicotine on a daily basis

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.065 align:middle line:84%
not only made you
smarter, faster--

00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, your cells
worked better,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.340 align:middle line:84%
but also reduced your
risk of Alzheimer's.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.427 align:middle line:90%
Well, I do not sell nicotine.

00:04:13.427 --> 00:04:15.260 align:middle line:84%
If I did, I wouldn't
be allowed to say that.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.420 align:middle line:84%
But what I can say is
there is evidence of this.

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
There's also evidence that large
doses of nicotine or smoking

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.649 align:middle line:90%
are just bad, right?

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.402 align:middle line:84%
The dose is-- or
what does it say?

00:04:23.402 --> 00:04:25.610 align:middle line:84%
The dose is in the poison,
the poison is in the dose.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.525 align:middle line:90%
Something like that.

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So we can look at these
plant-based compounds

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:84%
and just understand
we want to feel good.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.680 align:middle line:84%
We want to perform
well, and Mother Nature

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.480 align:middle line:90%
will help us do it.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And plant-based compounds
are a big part of it.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.350 align:middle line:84%
The secret that
no one had told me

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
was that if you want to do
the personal development work,

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:84%
if your body, your hardware,
isn't working very well,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.510 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be really
difficult, if not impossible.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.010 align:middle line:84%
So get your body
working well enough

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.050 align:middle line:84%
to make enough energy to
create personal change,

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and that has been
transformative for me.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.100 align:middle line:84%
Indigenous cultures
everywhere knew

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.520 align:middle line:84%
that there were two things
that worked for parasites,

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.423 align:middle line:90%
for diarrhea, and for GI upset.

00:05:03.423 --> 00:05:04.840 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
activated charcoal.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.597 align:middle line:84%
The other one is
certain kinds of clay.

00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:08.930 align:middle line:84%
And you've probably heard
bentonite clay is another one.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.750 align:middle line:84%
These are toxin binders,
broad spectrum ones.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.997 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in
Nepal and Tibet,

00:05:13.997 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
you could go to
little street vendors.

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.000 align:middle line:84%
And they have these little bags
or bottles of charcoal tablets,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:84%
because there's
a lot of Giardia.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.450 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
parasitic things

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.938 align:middle line:90%
where people get diarrhea.

00:05:23.938 --> 00:05:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And they'd say, oh, charcoal
is what you do if you have

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:27.550 align:middle line:90%
any upset for your stomach.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So if my kids have
an upset stomach,

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.320 align:middle line:90%
do they get charcoal first?

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they do.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Does it usually work to
make you feel better?

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.770 align:middle line:84%
If I eat something and
I feel weird afterwards,

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:84%
I take charcoal,
and I feel better.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.280 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty amazing,
but this has been around

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.273 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:05:40.273 --> 00:05:41.190 align:middle line:90%
It's used in Ayurveda.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
It's used in Traditional
Chinese Medicine.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.050 align:middle line:84%
The indigenous people in
the United States used it.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.630 align:middle line:84%
And you just go
around the world.

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Oh, we all knew about charcoal.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.760 align:middle line:90%
And charcoal is amazing.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:84%
Because about a
teaspoon of charcoal,

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.640 align:middle line:84%
depending on how it's made,
can have the surface area

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.557 align:middle line:84%
of a football field
and/or a soccer field,

00:06:00.557 --> 00:06:02.140 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
country you're from.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.190 align:middle line:90%
Same difference.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.000 align:middle line:90%
And what's going on there?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.850 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's basically
these crinkly carbons.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.790 align:middle line:84%
So the little nooks and
valleys and canyons in it

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:84%
have this huge amount of
ability to bind to toxins.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And it has a strong
negative electrical charge,

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.412 align:middle line:90%
so you take this.

00:06:16.412 --> 00:06:17.870 align:middle line:84%
If you take it with
food that has--

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle line:84%
oh, I don't know--
mold toxins in it,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.630 align:middle line:84%
it binds to the mold
toxins to the point

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that in agriculture,
ranchers will say,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.370 align:middle line:84%
oh, I'm going to buy the
food with these field toxins

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.995 align:middle line:84%
and storage toxins
that we know is bad,

00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:30.328 align:middle line:90%
but we're going to buy charcoal.

00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:31.810 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put
it in the food,

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.490 align:middle line:90%
so the animals don't get sick.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So I think I'll do
that for myself,

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.410 align:middle line:84%
too, because their data
set is very strong.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And there are
studies out there not

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.417 align:middle line:84%
of anything that
are manufactured,

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:43.420 align:middle line:84%
just of charcoal
in general, looking

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.370 align:middle line:84%
at what it does to
things like cholesterol,

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.370 align:middle line:84%
looking at what it does even
for longevity in animal studies.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.900 align:middle line:84%
They're living 15%
longer from having this.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.270 align:middle line:84%
What's going on with
charcoal in general

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.550 align:middle line:84%
is that it binds to all kinds
of toxins, including pollutants.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.220 align:middle line:84%
But the most
important thing that's

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.070 align:middle line:84%
emerging for the
anti-aging field right now

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.620 align:middle line:84%
is something called
lipopolysaccharide.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:07.030 align:middle line:90%
You have gut bacteria.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:84%
All of us have some good
ones and some bad ones,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.570 align:middle line:90%
even if you do everything right.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And the good ones keep
the bad guys in check.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.420 align:middle line:84%
But the bad guys make LPS,
which crosses the gut barrier

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.462 align:middle line:84%
and causes inflammation
throughout the body,

00:07:18.462 --> 00:07:19.420 align:middle line:90%
including in the brain.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.462 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the things
that probably triggers

00:07:21.462 --> 00:07:22.670 align:middle line:90%
some of the causes of aging.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.730 align:middle line:90%
Charcoal sticks to LPS.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.820 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a good
idea to take it regularly.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.000 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.730 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
that it's so strong

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.430 align:middle line:84%
that if you go to the emergency
room and you've been poisoned,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.472 align:middle line:84%
they're going to pump
charcoal into your stomach.

00:07:35.472 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So charcoal has to be taken
away from any medications

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.250 align:middle line:84%
or anything that you don't want
bound up in it, because it's

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.100 align:middle line:90%
that powerful.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:44.892 align:middle line:84%
So I take it on an
empty stomach every day.

00:07:44.892 --> 00:07:47.730 align:middle line:10%
