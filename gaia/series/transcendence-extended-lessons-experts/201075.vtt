00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:02.988 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.988 --> 00:00:07.970 align:middle line:90%


00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Play and pray have a
very similar vibration.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.670 align:middle line:84%
When you were a kid, and now
we're obviously, as an adult,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.580 align:middle line:84%
we want to maintain
this, you play,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.040 align:middle line:84%
but there was no
attachment to an outcome.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.145 align:middle line:84%
That got serious later, when an
adult put rules to it and said,

00:00:25.145 --> 00:00:27.020 align:middle line:84%
you're going to win and
you're going to lose.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.780 align:middle line:84%
But when a kid is
just playing, there's

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.140 align:middle line:84%
no attachment to the
outcome and they're fully

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.712 align:middle line:90%
vested in the play.

00:00:33.712 --> 00:00:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And when they're fully
vested in the play

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
and that moment of
creativity, they're in a zone.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.010 align:middle line:84%
They're in flow motion,
as I like to call it.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Now when you're in prayer,
it's the same thing.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.020 align:middle line:84%
You have no attachment
to the outcome.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:84%
You're just connecting to this
vast wisdom and storehouse

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.700 align:middle line:84%
of love and presence, and
you're allowing the outcome

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.380 align:middle line:84%
to form based on the
play or on the pray.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.700 align:middle line:90%
It's the same thing.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.540 align:middle line:90%
So yes.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And we don't want to
tell people if they

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.535 align:middle line:84%
don't play an instrument or
don't do a sport or don't sing,

00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:08.410 align:middle line:90%
they're not creative.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.370 align:middle line:84%
No, you can be
creative with anything.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.670 align:middle line:84%
You shift your
mindset and engine

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.730 align:middle line:90%
to the flow of creativity.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.580 align:middle line:84%
Everyone is here to be soulful
artists, soulful artists.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if you're
vacuuming a rock,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.740 align:middle line:84%
washing a dish, writing a song,
doing something that's tedious.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:84%
When you enter into it
in the spirit of play,

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.310 align:middle line:84%
you get the universal plus
factor, something else ah,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.430 align:middle line:90%
gets added to it.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.300 align:middle line:84%
And you find yourself afterward
witnessing yourself do it.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:90%
It's very powerful state.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Once you start walking
down this path,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.040 align:middle line:90%
people will talk about you.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Now if you, it's like
you're working on a project.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.885 align:middle line:84%
And you're afraid, I don't,
I'm afraid I'm going to fail,

00:02:01.885 --> 00:02:03.302 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid it's
not going to work.

00:02:03.302 --> 00:02:05.210 align:middle line:84%
People are going to
laugh at me if I fail.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you do fail, which is
the learning, people will talk.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.440 align:middle line:84%
If you succeed, they're
going to talk about you.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.220 align:middle line:84%
They're going to talk about
you either way, you see,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.377 align:middle line:84%
because mediocrity
attacks excellence.

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:90%
So they're going to.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So knowing that you're going
to be talked about either way,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.790 align:middle line:84%
you don't live your life
with what other people are

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.520 align:middle line:90%
thinking as your consideration.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.320 align:middle line:84%
That's where many, that's
what much anxiety comes from.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:84%
People are taking too much
into consideration what

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.080 align:middle line:90%
others are thinking about them.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.450 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly enough,
others are more concerned

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.080 align:middle line:84%
about what you're
thinking about them.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.500 align:middle line:84%
So everybody is living in
this kind of false narrative

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.958 align:middle line:84%
that people are thinking about
what they're thinking about,

00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:51.860 align:middle line:90%
and they're not.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the first
ways that you grow,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.470 align:middle line:90%
is that you let the they go.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
And you become aware that
there's something within you,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.655 align:middle line:84%
the great, I am, the singular
manifestation of a cosmic good

00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:09.580 align:middle line:84%
that's within you, that
becomes which you listen to.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:84%
And after a while with practice,
meditation, light visioning,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.820 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, that becomes the
predominant voice you hear.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't even hear
the other voices.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.530 align:middle line:84%
And then you're able to
look at the two impostors

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.240 align:middle line:90%
and treat them both the same.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.300 align:middle line:84%
The imposter of praise and
the imposter of criticism.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.480 align:middle line:84%
Their imposters, you
don't live for either one.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:84%
You're not trying
to go get praise,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.990 align:middle line:84%
you're not running
from criticism.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:84%
You're living your
passion of the gift that

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:90%
wants to come forward.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.930 align:middle line:90%
So yeah, people are anxious.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.520 align:middle line:84%
They're anxious
about the future.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.560 align:middle line:84%
They're afraid of what
people are thinking.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.908 align:middle line:84%
Again, spiritual practice
allows you to be very present.

00:03:50.908 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:84%
One of the other things
I share about fear,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.120 align:middle line:84%
is people sometimes
spend a lot of time

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.400 align:middle line:90%
trying to get rid of it.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.750 align:middle line:90%
It's futile.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.610 align:middle line:90%
You take it with you.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.380 align:middle line:84%
You just acknowledge,
there's fear here,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.390 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going take
the first step anyway.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:90%
This, oh, I'm afraid.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, there's fear here.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Take the next step.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
What happens is,
everything is this energy

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.110 align:middle line:90%
based on thought forms.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So you're afraid, you're
afraid, you're afraid.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.940 align:middle line:90%
You keep taking the steps.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is, fear gets
transmuted into excitement.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.700 align:middle line:84%
It's another form of energy,
it's a higher form of energy.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And when you keep
walking, excitement

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.170 align:middle line:90%
gets transmuted into enthusiasm.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So you've gone from
fear to enthusiasm

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.910 align:middle line:84%
by walking in the direction
of your dreams, you see.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
So you don't let
it stagnate you,

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.840 align:middle line:90%
nor do you try to get rid of it.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.840 align:middle line:90%
You just acknowledge it.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, there's fear here.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.060 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, of course there's fear.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.685 align:middle line:84%
If you never, if
you're doing something

00:04:48.685 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
you've never done before, you're
stepping into the unknown.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.370 align:middle line:10%
Then the egoic
structure, which does not

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.360 align:middle line:10%
know the difference
between self-actualization

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:10%
or enlightenment or
awakeneness or transformation,

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle line:10%
there's no difference between
that and annihilation,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:10%
it projects fear
onto everything.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.675 align:middle line:84%
So you walk, fear
becomes excited.

00:05:12.675 --> 00:05:14.500 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm excited.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.495 align:middle line:90%
Then I'm enthused.

00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:18.007 align:middle line:90%


00:05:18.007 --> 00:05:19.340 align:middle line:90%
You never know, if you don't go.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.010 align:middle line:84%
The universe supports
your movement.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.765 align:middle line:84%
And supports your thought
and supports your actions.

00:05:25.765 --> 00:05:27.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
doing anything,

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:90%
then you get no support.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:36.290 align:middle line:84%
But as we mature, there is an
unconditional non-agenda love.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is what
we're seeking to be.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.540 align:middle line:84%
That's what our practice
is leading us to.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So that no one loses your
love if they make a mistake.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.830 align:middle line:84%
And you don't give more love
because they've done better.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.500 align:middle line:84%
It's unconditional, non-agenda,
all conditional kind of love.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:90%
That emanates from the spirit.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.130 align:middle line:84%
You can't will
yourself into that.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.450 align:middle line:90%
That's not willpower.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.620 align:middle line:90%
It's not mental might.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to love
unconditionally, no.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.320 align:middle line:84%
That comes from practice
of affirmative prayer

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.730 align:middle line:84%
and meditation until the
debris around the mind

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:11.810 align:middle line:90%
gets cleared up.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:15.260 align:middle line:90%
Then you find yourself loving.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.500 align:middle line:90%
No one can stop you from loving.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.470 align:middle line:84%
All they can do is help
create the tributary

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.910 align:middle line:90%
of the frequency of love.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So if someone's done
something to you,

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:84%
they can't stop you
from loving them.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.130 align:middle line:84%
They just provide the
context for forgiveness,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.360 align:middle line:84%
which is a form of
love or compassion

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.100 align:middle line:84%
or kindness or
patience or intimacy.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.140 align:middle line:84%
You know, there's different
tributaries of this love.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.600 align:middle line:84%
But then as you
really mature, you

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:84%
discover you don't need
an object for love.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.550 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
objectify ourselves.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.870 align:middle line:90%
We just love.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
we find that we're

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:84%
able to be in love
with nothing there.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the universe brings
into our field individuals

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.820 align:middle line:84%
and circumstances and
things around the world

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.500 align:middle line:90%
that need our love.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.510 align:middle line:84%
That's a very mature
state, because most people

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.955 align:middle line:84%
are operating on you
know, I love that

00:07:10.955 --> 00:07:14.070 align:middle line:90%
or I love him or I love her.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And then they circumscribe
their love to just their kin.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.800 align:middle line:84%
But they're not mature enough
yet, spiritually mature enough

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.210 align:middle line:90%
yet, to just love.

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.440 align:middle line:90%
Just be in the flow of love.

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.600 align:middle line:84%
Now when you can
love with no object,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.140 align:middle line:90%
that's a very high state.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is where the
human race is seeking to go.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.500 align:middle line:84%
A long way to go
before we get there,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.680 align:middle line:84%
but that's where
we're seeking to go.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.800 align:middle line:84%
At one point, you have to
ask, how can I be of service.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Service is the great
opener of the heart.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.630 align:middle line:84%
And you discover that service
is also a path to awakening.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And what happens
after you're awake?

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:90%
You serve more.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:84%
And so it's a continual
being of service,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.820 align:middle line:84%
awakening, being of
service, and awakening.

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.170 align:middle line:84%
If we maintain our
service ethic and rather

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:84%
than our acquisitive,
trying to appease

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
our acquisitive appetite,
I want more of this,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.930 align:middle line:84%
I want more money,
I want more of this,

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.740 align:middle line:84%
how can I serve more,
then into that frequency,

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:16.580 align:middle line:90%
then the other things are given.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.820 align:middle line:84%
Greater prosperity,
greater opportunities,

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.560 align:middle line:90%
which comes greater prosperity.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.783 align:middle line:90%
How can I serve?

00:08:22.783 --> 00:08:24.950 align:middle line:84%
That's, I think that's a
question people need to ask

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.600 align:middle line:90%
themselves on a regular basis.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And what they'll
discover, is they

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.259 align:middle line:84%
begin to tap into an
inexhaustible energy.

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:32.059 align:middle line:90%
It's not them.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.789 align:middle line:84%
It's not I'm going to
burn myself out serving.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:34.589 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no.

00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:90%
It's not martyrdom.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.267 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm going to serve
until I can't give.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.100 align:middle line:84%
No, no, that's not what
we're talking about.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.530 align:middle line:84%
When you just ask, how
can I be of service,

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:46.640 align:middle line:84%
the energy that flows through
you is of service to everyone.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.570 align:middle line:90%
And you get the first bite.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:90%
It feeds you first.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.180 align:middle line:84%
This is why all of the different
research and test after test

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.090 align:middle line:84%
after test have shown that
people who are of service

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:00.390 align:middle line:90%
are more happy.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.170 align:middle line:84%
They have long-term
joy when they're

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:05.660 align:middle line:84%
living a life of
service and generosity,

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.760 align:middle line:84%
rather than individuals who
are living a life of feeding

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:90%
their acquisitive appetite.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it gets, going
back to meaning,

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:90%
it gives your life more meaning.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.600 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't prevent you
from having fun.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.958 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't prevent you
from being successful.

00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't prevent you from
having wonderful relationships

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:90%
and friendships.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:30.995 align:middle line:84%
No, it just makes your life
wider, bigger, more luminous,

00:09:30.995 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:90%
wow.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.860 align:middle line:90%
How can I be of service?

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:37.310 align:middle line:84%
That's an empowering question
we all have to ask every day.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:10%
