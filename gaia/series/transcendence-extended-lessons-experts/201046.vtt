00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>> There are two
kinds of trauma.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.180 align:middle line:84%
There is simple trauma,
and there's complex trauma.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And complex trauma is
usually developmental trauma.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So an example of simple trauma
is somebody who's 25 years old,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.390 align:middle line:84%
they have a terrible car
crash and they're in hospital

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.780 align:middle line:90%
for a long time.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.300 align:middle line:84%
It takes them a
great many months

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.560 align:middle line:84%
to regain physical function,
and this shatters their lives

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.560 align:middle line:90%
in some fundamental way.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a simple trauma.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.740 align:middle line:84%
A complex trauma is one
where there was abuse,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:90%
often as a child.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.697 align:middle line:84%
And if there's
developmental trauma

00:00:37.697 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:84%
where you were beaten over
and over and over again

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.912 align:middle line:84%
or where you were
being neglected,

00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:43.620 align:middle line:84%
whether you were being
raped, whether you

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.357 align:middle line:84%
were being physically
assaulted and it was repeated,

00:00:46.357 --> 00:00:47.940 align:middle line:84%
and that's a different
kind of trauma,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.830 align:middle line:84%
because the brain is growing
while that trauma is happening.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:84%
And that information is
being installed at the level

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:90%
of circuits in your brain.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It's not just a thought
or a belief or one event.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.670 align:middle line:84%
It is crucial, it is
fundamental to the actual way

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.260 align:middle line:90%
your brain wired together.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.440 align:middle line:84%
For the first two years of
life, the fastest growing brain

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:90%
region is the limbic system.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:84%
So the limbic system,
the emotional midbrain

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.440 align:middle line:84%
is the fastest
growing brain region.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not a part of the
brain that has language.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
That's Broca's area over
here behind our temple.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:84%
That has-- that's
the language part.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.595 align:middle line:84%
This is the center of our
brain, the emotional midbrain.

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:84%
That's the fastest
growing part of our brain.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:84%
It has no language,
but it feels.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.860 align:middle line:90%
It feels deeply.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
being traumatized

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.280 align:middle line:84%
while that part of
your brain is growing,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:84%
then trauma is woven into
the neural fabric of the way

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.850 align:middle line:90%
your brain structure is.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:84%
And so that kind of
trauma is hard to treat.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
We find in trauma treatment,
manuals and approaches,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.130 align:middle line:84%
that simple trauma
is relatively easy.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
But developmental
trauma, complex trauma

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.660 align:middle line:90%
is hard to treat.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.030 align:middle line:84%
So how does that
person get through it?

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.140 align:middle line:84%
And you can't easily get through
it using cognitive techniques,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
using thought or
language based therapies.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.449 align:middle line:84%
I can't sit you in
a chair and say,

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
you shouldn't feel
that way, because it's

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.590 align:middle line:84%
fundamental to the way
your brain functions.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So for example, there
was a famous psychiatrist

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.040 align:middle line:90%
called Joseph Wolpe.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.310 align:middle line:84%
After World War
II, he was working

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.610 align:middle line:84%
with veterans of World
War II, and these men,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
for the most part
men, had shell shock.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.418 align:middle line:84%
They were dreadfully
affected by the war.

00:02:29.418 --> 00:02:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And he was a good
Freudian therapist.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.110 align:middle line:84%
So he laid them on a couch to
do the talking cure and said,

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.864 align:middle line:90%
tell me about Omaha Beach.

00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:38.520 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.170 align:middle line:84%
And he wrote in
one of his books,

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.480 align:middle line:84%
he said, he came
to the realization

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.060 align:middle line:84%
after doing this with
those soldiers, he said,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.440 align:middle line:84%
that kind of therapy
is not ineffective.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.180 align:middle line:90%
It's harmful.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And a later term is
it's re-traumatizing

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.307 align:middle line:84%
to remember the bad stuff, to
remember the pit bull attack,

00:02:57.307 --> 00:02:59.640 align:middle line:84%
remember the car accident,
remember your buddy was being

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.560 align:middle line:90%
blown to bits on the beach.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
By replaying that in your mind,
that thought, now stimulating

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.200 align:middle line:84%
that emotion is actually
re-traumatizing you.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.010 align:middle line:84%
And as you fire those neural
circuits in your brain,

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.440 align:middle line:84%
they wire together bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.620 align:middle line:84%
So we find, for example,
that stress circuits

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:84%
like the amygdala grow in
people who have been traumatized

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.230 align:middle line:84%
in that way, and
learning and memory

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.480 align:middle line:84%
circuits, like those
in the hippocampus

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.440 align:middle line:90%
actually shrink over time.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.800 align:middle line:84%
So we're doing brain
remodeling with our thoughts.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Our thoughts aren't just
producing some kind of emotion

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:90%
or experience in our minds.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.737 align:middle line:84%
They're producing neural
tissue in our brains.

00:03:41.737 --> 00:03:44.070 align:middle line:84%
And if you start to use that
neural tissue over and over

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
again, then it becomes
hard to change.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.540 align:middle line:84%
So you can't use
cognitive techniques

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.068 align:middle line:84%
for development trauma
or preverbal trauma.

00:03:51.068 --> 00:03:53.610 align:middle line:84%
You need energy techniques, and
we have huge numbers of them.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.360 align:middle line:84%
We have acupuncture, which
affects the flows of energy

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:90%
in the body's meridians.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.780 align:middle line:84%
We have acupressure,
like EFT, where

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.020 align:middle line:84%
you interrupt that thought and
that experience with pressure

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.430 align:middle line:90%
or tapping on a point.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.760 align:middle line:84%
We have energy medicine,
energy psychology techniques.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:84%
And these work below
the level of thought.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.660 align:middle line:84%
They work at the level of
the body's energy system.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.050 align:middle line:84%
What we see, for
example, on MRI or EEG

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
scans is massive shifts in
the body's usage of energy.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:84%
As you shift the energy of the
body, then the form of the body

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:90%
shifts as well.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.220 align:middle line:90%
EFT is a very simple technique.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:84%
It has you think about
something that bothers you.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Now when you think about
a thing that bothers you,

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
you're activating all the
circuits in your brain

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.550 align:middle line:90%
that carry that information.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So you then have your brain
working in a certain way.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.240 align:middle line:84%
You have certain
circuits lit up.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
If you think about
things that bother you

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
over and over and
over again, you

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.930 align:middle line:84%
make those circuits bigger
and bigger and bigger.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.930 align:middle line:84%
But if you interrupt that
pattern with something else,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.990 align:middle line:84%
then you are able to
break that signaling,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.390 align:middle line:84%
and then your brain no
longer uses that circuit.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And the something else, in
case of EFT, is acupressure.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.530 align:middle line:84%
There are over 300 meridian
points on the body.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.580 align:middle line:84%
They're organized into
14 meridian lines.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.000 align:middle line:84%
And EFT has you apply
acupressure in the form

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.530 align:middle line:84%
of fingertip tapping like this
to about 13 of those points--

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:84%
there are seven in the preform
of EFT and 13 in the long form

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:21.610 align:middle line:90%
of EFT--

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.380 align:middle line:90%
as well as using eye movements.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.040 align:middle line:84%
And what you see in
people's EEGs and MRIs when

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.280 align:middle line:84%
they do this is that
you first have them

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.513 align:middle line:90%
think about the problem.

00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:31.930 align:middle line:84%
When they think
about the problem,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.390 align:middle line:84%
about the event in their
life, about the bomb blast,

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.910 align:middle line:84%
about the car crash, about
the terrible divorce,

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle line:84%
whatever it might be, you find
the emotional brain is all

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.530 align:middle line:90%
lit up.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.010 align:middle line:84%
In an MRI or an EEG, you
see all this activity

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.190 align:middle line:84%
in the emotional midbrain
when people start tapping,

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.370 align:middle line:84%
it sends a second signal
to the brain of safety.

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.400 align:middle line:84%
Because if you are
being chased by a tiger,

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:55.675 align:middle line:90%
you would not be tapping.

00:05:55.675 --> 00:05:59.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.950 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So now, the brain's
getting two inputs.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:84%
It's getting this signal
from your memory saying,

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.380 align:middle line:84%
be stressed, be
stressed, be stressed,

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.340 align:middle line:90%
danger, danger, danger, danger.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And so you have a second signal,
a somatic signal of soothing

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.070 align:middle line:90%
in the form of tapping.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And it prioritizes that
soothing signal just the way

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.430 align:middle line:84%
your mom when you were
crying, hopefully, as a baby,

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.310 align:middle line:84%
she would stroke your face,
she would stroke your head,

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:90%
she would touch you.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.220 align:middle line:84%
Touch is a fundamental safety
signal that we as animals,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:90%
as mammals understand.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.520 align:middle line:90%
Every animal understands touch.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.650 align:middle line:84%
So say your dog, every time
it sees a car coming by,

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:42.125 align:middle line:84%
it just starts
barking and goes crazy

00:06:42.125 --> 00:06:44.500 align:middle line:84%
and gets really wildly excited,
goes into fight or flight

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.990 align:middle line:84%
itself, runs after the car, and
you want to calm the dog down.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.250 align:middle line:84%
You can explain to the
dog really logically why

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.830 align:middle line:84%
running after cars
is such a bad idea,

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.522 align:middle line:84%
and it's likely to lead
to the dog's demise.

00:06:56.522 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And you can get really
super clear with the dog

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.210 align:middle line:84%
and paint a great
word picture of why

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.510 align:middle line:84%
the dog shouldn't do that,
but that isn't going to work.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:84%
But if you stroke the dog,
that will calm the dog.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.055 align:middle line:84%
So the dog understands
touch in a way which

00:07:12.055 --> 00:07:13.700 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't understand language.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.310 align:middle line:90%
Same thing with us.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.610 align:middle line:84%
We-- our emotional
midbrains understand touch.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
When a friend of
yours is crying,

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.120 align:middle line:84%
you don't explain to them why
they shouldn't feel so bad.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:84%
You put your arm around them,
and touch will sooth them.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.428 align:middle line:90%
So EFT is stroking in a dog.

00:07:31.428 --> 00:07:36.075 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It calms the
emotional midbrain.

00:07:36.075 --> 00:07:37.075 align:middle line:90%
And it's really amazing.

00:07:37.075 --> 00:07:40.450 align:middle line:84%
On MRI scans, we have
people imagine a trauma,

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.300 align:middle line:84%
their midbrain gets
all that up in the MRI.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.820 align:middle line:84%
We have them tap, it
just gets shut down.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:90%
Some people love yoga.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Some people prefer
Qigong or Tai Chi.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:84%
Some might prefer
martial arts or dance.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.200 align:middle line:90%
So same thing with therapy.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Some people respond really
well to cognitive therapies.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:58.030 align:middle line:90%
Others energy therapies.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Others hypnotherapy.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:03.100 align:middle line:84%
So you want to play around with
this whole beautiful bundle

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.850 align:middle line:84%
of possibilities, and then find
the one that works for you.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.280 align:middle line:84%
Like someone said to me
once, tell me, Dawson, you've

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.290 align:middle line:84%
done all this research,
you've looked at all

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:12.710 align:middle line:90%
these different therapies.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.620 align:middle line:90%
Which is the best therapy?

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, I'll tell
you the best therapy.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:21.515 align:middle line:84%
The best therapy is the
one that works for you.

00:08:21.515 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Another time someone
said to me, what's

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.710 align:middle line:84%
the very best form
of meditation?

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, the best
form of meditation

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.727 align:middle line:84%
is the one you
will do every day.

00:08:28.727 --> 00:08:32.572 align:middle line:84%
[CHUCKLES] So play around in
all these different techniques,

00:08:32.572 --> 00:08:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and then pick the one that
resonates with your energy

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:84%
system, with your psyche, with
your history, with your body.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.730 align:middle line:10%
