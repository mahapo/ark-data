00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:08.119 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So with plants, the nice
thing about a lot of the herbs

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.170 align:middle line:84%
that we use here in my house
is that they grow here.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's plants that are
extremely good for your body

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.620 align:middle line:90%
that grow on your front lawn.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.840 align:middle line:84%
I have dandelions
growing on my front lawn.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Dandelions are
extreme medicinal.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.380 align:middle line:90%
We look at them as weeds.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:84%
They are extremely good
at detoxifying our liver.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.700 align:middle line:84%
They're something that's been
used for thousands of years

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.990 align:middle line:90%
to help our body heal itself.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And here they are sprouting
up all over our lawns

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and asking for us to
start imbibing them.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:84%
So I think that a lot
of the herbs that we

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.390 align:middle line:84%
could use and could be
the most benefit to us

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.290 align:middle line:90%
grow in our yards.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.430 align:middle line:90%
They grow around us.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.120 align:middle line:90%
They grow right down the road.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.820 align:middle line:84%
You can find them
in Whole Foods.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So I like to use herbs,
starting off, just herbs that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.290 align:middle line:84%
taste good, that I could put in
my food, like dandelion greens.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.620 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.550 align:middle line:90%
You can put that into a salad.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.480 align:middle line:90%
You could it into a soup.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.280 align:middle line:90%
It's delicious.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.890 align:middle line:84%
It's also going to help
detoxify your body.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.223 align:middle line:90%
I also love medicinal mushrooms.

00:01:09.223 --> 00:01:11.015 align:middle line:84%
And I think that those
are starting to make

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:12.290 align:middle line:90%
a big comeback right now too.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Not even a comeback.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.133 align:middle line:90%
They were never even here.

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So maybe they're starting make
a big entrance onto the world

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.760 align:middle line:84%
stage of what's available,
dietarily speaking,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.030 align:middle line:84%
to help not only spruce up your
meals, but also heal your body.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.655 align:middle line:84%
So we use a lot of
medicinal mushrooms.

00:01:26.655 --> 00:01:27.947 align:middle line:90%
And they also grow around here.

00:01:27.947 --> 00:01:29.425 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find
most places, you'll

00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:31.050 align:middle line:84%
find some species of
medicinal mushroom

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.530 align:middle line:84%
that can be harvested that
can benefit you in some way.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.490 align:middle line:84%
My friend Daniel Vitalis says
that the herbs we need most

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.630 align:middle line:90%
tend to sprout up around us.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds almost like an old
wives' tale or like, you know,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.050 align:middle line:84%
a little myth and a nice way of
thinking about nature and just

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.750 align:middle line:90%
a good story.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.122 align:middle line:90%
But it's really interesting.

00:01:52.122 --> 00:01:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Like I said before,
like dandelions

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:90%
sprouting up outside my door.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.060 align:middle line:84%
They sprout up outside
everyone's door here

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.110 align:middle line:90%
in the United States.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And guess what the most toxified
culture is in the world?

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.490 align:middle line:90%
It's the United States.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.702 align:middle line:84%
Our diets are full of
toxins, pesticides.

00:02:05.702 --> 00:02:07.410 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
this medicine that's

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:84%
the most perfect
medicine that nature

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.100 align:middle line:84%
has to offer us to
detoxify our system

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.440 align:middle line:84%
is sprouting up everywhere
asking us to eat it.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.995 align:middle line:10%
So in my opinion, the more
you start dancing with herbs,

00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:20.370 align:middle line:10%
the more you start understanding
the subtleties of nature

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.390 align:middle line:10%
around you.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.660 align:middle line:84%
The more you start realizing
that the medicine you need

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.193 align:middle line:84%
is often growing in your town
or available in your town.

00:02:30.193 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to go
down to the Amazon.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.660 align:middle line:84%
Don't need to travel
into the Sahara

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.683 align:middle line:84%
Desert to that some
far-off oasis to find

00:02:35.683 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:90%
the medicine you need.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.350 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times it's growing
in your neighborhood.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.450 align:middle line:84%
There's some plants
that are actually

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.720 align:middle line:84%
really good at surviving in
really harsh conditions, which

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.000 align:middle line:84%
an ethnobotanist would
tell you that some

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.400 align:middle line:84%
of the most medicinal
plants are the ones that

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.850 align:middle line:84%
are able to survive in the
harshest environments, a lot

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.020 align:middle line:90%
of the most alkaline plants.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:84%
We look for alkaloids
in plants to find out

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.040 align:middle line:90%
what they're good for.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.915 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times, the
most medicinal plants

00:03:00.915 --> 00:03:02.820 align:middle line:90%
are the most alkaline plants.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of those
plants are growing only

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:90%
in harsh conditions.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
interesting to see plants

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.993 align:middle line:84%
that survive our Roundup
and survive the pesticides

00:03:11.993 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:84%
and still sprout
up all around us.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.517 align:middle line:90%
What medicine do they have?

00:03:15.517 --> 00:03:17.100 align:middle line:10%
I think that there
are some definite--

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.642 align:middle line:10%
I don't want to call
them shortcuts--

00:03:18.642 --> 00:03:21.090 align:middle line:10%
but there's some definite
allies to get started on.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.540 align:middle line:10%
One of them is using herbs.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.680 align:middle line:10%
And I like to use a category
of herbs called adaptogens

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.450 align:middle line:10%
that are known to be great at
modulating stress in the body.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.000 align:middle line:84%
I eat Reishi mushroom
on a regular basis.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:90%
I put it in tinctures.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.190 align:middle line:90%
I make teas out of it.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.360 align:middle line:84%
It helps me do things
that I wouldn't otherwise

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.050 align:middle line:84%
be uncomfortable about doing,
like step onto a stage in front

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.690 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of people
and talk about shamanism,

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:90%
let's just say.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.010 align:middle line:90%
Might not feel that comfortable.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.920 align:middle line:84%
But with the right plant
allies, as they're commonly

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.590 align:middle line:84%
referred to in
different cultures,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.000 align:middle line:84%
the right plant ally will
give you a subtle advantage.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:84%
It'll help keep your system
in a state of homeostasis,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.910 align:middle line:84%
even when the
environment around you

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.440 align:middle line:90%
gets a little bit more intense.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:84%
So I highly recommend
starting to use herbs

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
and finding that right
subtle herb for you.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's Reishi mushroom.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.160 align:middle line:84%
It's another herb called
skullcap and a third herb

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.110 align:middle line:90%
called ashwagandha.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.510 align:middle line:84%
They all have their
own unique qualities.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.468 align:middle line:84%
And they are perfect for
my own unique physiology.

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:84%
Because there are some
things you can't get past.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
You can definitely evolve
as a spirit, as a soul,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.850 align:middle line:84%
at least in my eyes, some things
genetically are just there.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.000 align:middle line:84%
So how do you use
herbs to try to right

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.172 align:middle line:84%
some of the genetic expressions
that might not be helping you?

00:04:45.172 --> 00:04:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I've been
really into these days

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.840 align:middle line:90%
is I use ashwagandha.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.660 align:middle line:84%
And I use skullcap
because it helps

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.510 align:middle line:84%
to quiet the chatter in my
brain and also boost the tone,

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.940 align:middle line:84%
for lack of a better
word, of who I am.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
So skullcap grows in the
forest along streams.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.920 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't grow along
anywhere on the stream.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:84%
It grows along the parts of the
stream that are the most rough,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.920 align:middle line:90%
the battling parts.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.900 align:middle line:84%
The parts that are really,
really, really turbid, I guess,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.860 align:middle line:90%
is a good word for it.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.890 align:middle line:84%
You'll find that that's
where the skullcap will

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.385 align:middle line:90%
be sprouting up and loving it.

00:05:25.385 --> 00:05:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So herbalists look at this,
and they say, well, you know,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:84%
a lot of times our
external environment

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:90%
mimics our internal environment.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So in the woods, if we're
looking at a stream,

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
what plants are growing
close to the most rough parts

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.100 align:middle line:90%
of that stream?

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And what could they
possibly be good for?

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So I've had it told to me by
a couple different herbalists

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.537 align:middle line:84%
that the reason
why skullcap works

00:05:44.537 --> 00:05:47.200 align:middle line:84%
to quiet the mental
chatter in your brain

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.050 align:middle line:84%
is closely synced up to exactly
what it's doing on that stream.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:84%
It loves to grow right
near a lot of babbling,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.750 align:middle line:90%
a lot of extra energy happening.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.150 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
take skullcap, it

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.000 align:middle line:84%
has this way of
not pacifying you,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.420 align:middle line:84%
and it's not in any way
dulling your senses,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:84%
but it just somehow
quiets the noise.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.810 align:middle line:84%
Everybody here has a
ticker tape of thought

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
running across
their consciousness

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.860 align:middle line:84%
behind their eyeballs
at all times.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.800 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
even the best meditators

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle line:84%
in the world, the masters,
they know it's real.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.242 align:middle line:90%
They're not beyond it.

00:06:21.242 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:90%
They've learned to accept it.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.492 align:middle line:90%
And they can turn it off.

00:06:23.492 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And they can be OK with
it when it comes back on.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.517 align:middle line:90%
But it's always there.

00:06:26.517 --> 00:06:30.130 align:middle line:84%
There's always going to be some
kind of ticker tape of thought.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And so getting an advantage
on that ticker tape

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
through meditation, through
herbs, other practices,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.560 align:middle line:84%
I think is a huge part of
living this life of purpose.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And seeing the world
as ripe with medicine.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.130 align:middle line:84%
So the skullcap
really does a good job

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:90%
of quieting that ticker tape.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And ashwagandha does sort
of a complementary thing

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.053 align:middle line:90%
of boosting the true you.

00:06:56.053 --> 00:06:57.970 align:middle line:84%
That's how it's been
told to me by herbalists.

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
beautiful part of herbalism

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.240 align:middle line:84%
is you start getting
into herbalism,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.240 align:middle line:84%
there's great science to
support all this stuff.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.770 align:middle line:84%
You could find science to
support these same functions

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.350 align:middle line:84%
from a medical
perspective in the brain.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.070 align:middle line:84%
But an herbalist
will also tell you

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:84%
it's more of like the
soul behind that herb,

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
which I personally
really resonate with.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So ashwagandha is really
good at supporting you.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:84%
It's a good at lifting you up
without it being a stimulant,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.220 align:middle line:90%
like coffee.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.020 align:middle line:84%
It's good at boosting your
tone, the who that you want

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.150 align:middle line:90%
to have show up in the world.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.450 align:middle line:10%
It's good at doing that without
giving you any jittery energy.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.990 align:middle line:10%
So combining ashwagandha
with skullcap

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.930 align:middle line:10%
is a really, really nice thing
to do because it boosts you.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:41.050 align:middle line:10%
And it also kind of turns the
volume down on all the noise.

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.170 align:middle line:10%
So I use that along with an
adaptogen like Reishi, which

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:45.610 align:middle line:10%
is great at modulating stress.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.170 align:middle line:10%
And it allows me
to live that life.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.420 align:middle line:84%
So there are, conservatively,
80,000 plus species

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:56.702 align:middle line:84%
of plants in the jungle,
the Amazon jungle alone.

00:07:56.702 --> 00:07:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Of those 80,000-- and that
number continues to go up.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.325 align:middle line:84%
My ethnobotanist friends,
it seems like every year

00:08:01.325 --> 00:08:02.200 align:middle line:90%
they're finding more.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.750 align:middle line:84%
Even though the jungle's
being burned down,

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:84%
they're finding even
more species of plants.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.840 align:middle line:84%
But of that 80,000 species of
plants, less than 3% of them

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.450 align:middle line:84%
have been studied for
their medicinal value.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Of that 3%, a number
of modern medicines

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.250 align:middle line:90%
have been synthesized.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:90%
3%.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.460 align:middle line:84%
Why aren't we looking
at the other 97%?

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.360 align:middle line:84%
And this is true of the
world's rainforests.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.012 align:middle line:84%
25% of the most effective
cancer treatments

00:08:31.012 --> 00:08:32.429 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing
in hospitals are

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.679 align:middle line:90%
derived from rainforest plants.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:90%
So why are we not looking?

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Why are we not
exploring everything

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.419 align:middle line:90%
that nature has to offer?

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:47.730 align:middle line:84%
The only practical reason
that I can see is money.

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:49.920 align:middle line:90%
You can't patent plants.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.850 align:middle line:84%
So unless you can find something
that you can synthesize,

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.070 align:middle line:84%
a constituent that can
be reproduced in a lab,

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.600 align:middle line:90%
there's no money to be made.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And medicine, as we're
all starting to see,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
big pharma, I
think, is a concept

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:07.240 align:middle line:84%
that just about everyone is
aware of now, it's money.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.110 align:middle line:90%
Starts with money.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a big business.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:17.510 align:middle line:84%
So until we start
putting value in nature

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:22.920 align:middle line:84%
and its ability to heal us,
and until we de-emphasize

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.650 align:middle line:84%
the monetary association
with health care,

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.820 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we're going
to see much exploration

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.540 align:middle line:84%
of the other 97%
of those plants.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't seem like
it's a wise business

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:38.180 align:middle line:84%
decision for
institutions that are

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
bent on making as much
profit as they possibly can.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Cannabis is fascinating to
me because it indicates to me

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:84%
that the masses are starting
to say enough is enough.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:54.590 align:middle line:84%
You can only be failed by modern
medicine for so many years

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
until you start asking questions
about what else is out there.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.260 align:middle line:84%
I think cannabis is
definitely paving the way.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Until recently, it was
not available to be

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.130 align:middle line:84%
studied in universities
because of legality issues.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:09.050 align:middle line:84%
But over the last few
decades, now we're

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.200 align:middle line:90%
starting to dig into it.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.950 align:middle line:10%
And we're seeing the
importance of the ECS,

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.560 align:middle line:10%
or the endocannabinoid
system, and how

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:20.300 align:middle line:10%
that controls pain, or at
least affects heavily pain,

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:10%
appetite, sleep
cycles, exercise.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.470 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of those
that is front and center.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And once people realize
the power of cannabis

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.250 align:middle line:84%
and the different
constituents to heal the body,

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.380 align:middle line:84%
it's going to open up
the opportunity for us

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.680 align:middle line:84%
to look at all the other plants,
whether they're psychoactive,

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.400 align:middle line:84%
like psilocybin, and its
effects with trauma and end

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.540 align:middle line:90%
of life issues.

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Or whether we're just
talking about chamomile.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.440 align:middle line:84%
There's all kinds
of plants out there

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.210 align:middle line:84%
that have incredible
healing value.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason,
somewhere along the line,

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:53.600 align:middle line:90%
we wrote them off.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.340 align:middle line:90%
Everyone should be using herbs.

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.785 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're all
using herbs anyway.

00:10:57.785 --> 00:10:59.660 align:middle line:84%
If you're eating a salad,
you're using herbs.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.390 align:middle line:84%
I just think it's
about us going deeper

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.750 align:middle line:84%
with our understanding
of herbs and learning

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.090 align:middle line:90%
which herbs are our allies.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody
has an herbal ally.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.540 align:middle line:84%
Mine happens to be Reishi,
ashwagandha, and skullcap.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.590 align:middle line:84%
But I think when people
find their perfect herb,

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.720 align:middle line:90%
it's extremely empowering.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.290 align:middle line:84%
I think it's about being
cautious, making distinctions,

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:90%
moving slowly.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.600 align:middle line:84%
We live in a culture
of convenience,

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.460 align:middle line:90%
a culture of the quick fix.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.900 align:middle line:90%
We want results now.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.640 align:middle line:90%
We want a good time now.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.830 align:middle line:90%
We want to feel better now.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.970 align:middle line:84%
And if there's anything
that the traditional healing

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.400 align:middle line:84%
path has taught me is
that it's not about that.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:84%
It's about improvement every
single day, one step at a time,

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.150 align:middle line:84%
learning how to enjoy the
process, make distinctions.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you'll be
better before you know it.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:55.680 align:middle line:10%
