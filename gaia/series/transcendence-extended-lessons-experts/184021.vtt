00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, there's a few
things that are non-negotiable.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.300 align:middle line:84%
I know that if
they are not a part

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.830 align:middle line:84%
of my regular daily
activity that I'm going

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.003 align:middle line:90%
to be falling off the wagon.

00:00:16.003 --> 00:00:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to
be feeling so good.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.500 align:middle line:84%
One of those things
is meditation.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:84%
It is so practical, so
transformative, so powerful.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And there is so much science
behind why it transforms us

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:84%
physiologically,
psychologically, emotionally.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean I think there's hundreds
and hundreds of peer reviewed

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.510 align:middle line:84%
research papers that
people can go and Google.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.580 align:middle line:90%
And it's phenomenal.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So meditation for
me twice a day.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.120 align:middle line:90%
Also, exercise.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.880 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of the
most underrated ways

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:84%
to change your psychology,
and your physiology,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.820 align:middle line:90%
and your emotional well-being.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.030 align:middle line:84%
Any time that I find myself
really frustrated, or anytime

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.550 align:middle line:84%
I find myself blocked,
I get into the gym.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.200 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's
taking a spin class.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's
taking a dance class.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's
just taking a walk.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.700 align:middle line:84%
But getting out of my head
and getting into my body again

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.050 align:middle line:84%
opens up this enormous channel
of wisdom that I cannot access

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.250 align:middle line:90%
any other way.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.800 align:middle line:84%
So movement at least 15,
20 minutes if not an hour

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.310 align:middle line:90%
a day, some type of intensity--

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:90%
that for me keeps me sane.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's about
what we put in our bodies.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.340 align:middle line:90%
It's about the food that we eat.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.810 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm Italian American.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.810 align:middle line:90%
I grew up in New Jersey.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.110 align:middle line:84%
I love pasta like
the next person.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.790 align:middle line:90%
Like you have no idea.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.090 align:middle line:84%
But I have discovered through
lots of trial and error

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.840 align:middle line:84%
when I eat certain foods,
do I feel alert or not?

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Do I feel cranky?

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Do I get brain fog-- and have
begun to create a nutritional

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.750 align:middle line:84%
lifestyle for myself
where I'm eating

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:84%
to fuel my emotional
well-being, and my intelligence,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and my cognition rather than my
historical past and, you know,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.870 align:middle line:90%
what those cravings are.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.820 align:middle line:84%
Intuition is just
our internal wisdom.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.610 align:middle line:84%
It's this natural knowing
that each of us have

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.800 align:middle line:84%
that oftentimes we're
never listening to.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.470 align:middle line:84%
One of the benefits that I
had was my mom trained me ever

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.310 align:middle line:84%
since I was little to listen to
the still small voice inside.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And she said you
will always know

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.290 align:middle line:84%
the right move to make if you
tap inside and you listen.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.590 align:middle line:90%
There will always be an answer.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.100 align:middle line:84%
So I heard this message
over and over again.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
So whenever in my adult life
I'm wondering which way to go,

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:90%
I get quiet.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.910 align:middle line:84%
And I pay attention to what's
happening on the inside,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.870 align:middle line:84%
whether it's I actually hear
a voice or one of the most

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.900 align:middle line:84%
useful tests for me
is I do something

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.650 align:middle line:84%
and I figure out whether or not
I feel expansive or contracted.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:90%
So here's what I mean.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.050 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times people
will ask me, well, Marie,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.383 align:middle line:84%
how do I know the difference
between fear and intuition?

00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:42.008 align:middle line:84%
Like is this something
that I should do

00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:43.633 align:middle line:84%
and maybe I'm just
feeling butterflies,

00:02:43.633 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:84%
or is this like my
intuition saying, no,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.470 align:middle line:90%
don't do that, this is bad?

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.970 align:middle line:90%
So here's what you need to do.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:84%
You need to imagine yourself
moving ahead with whatever

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.620 align:middle line:90%
you're considering.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:84%
Start to tap in on a
very subtle level and see

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
do you feel yourself expansive,
like everything is either

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.110 align:middle line:84%
moving forward, or getting
brighter or lighter,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
or, on a very subtle level,
is everything contracting,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.610 align:middle line:90%
meaning it feels heavy.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
You feel a subtle
sense of dread.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
Now again, we're talking
microscopic levels.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.690 align:middle line:84%
But if you just ask
yourself that question

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.660 align:middle line:84%
how do I feel imagining
moving ahead with this,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and you pay enough
attention, you

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.137 align:middle line:84%
will either feel yourself
pulling back or moving forward.

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And nine times out
of 10, that's going

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.100 align:middle line:90%
to give you the best answer.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, if
it feels contracted

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.570 align:middle line:84%
or it feels heavy
or dread, that's

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.573 align:middle line:84%
your intuition
telling you don't go.

00:03:33.573 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:84%
If it still feels
scary and you're

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.407 align:middle line:84%
like I don't know
if I can do this

00:03:36.407 --> 00:03:38.980 align:middle line:84%
but everything feels like
it's coming alive, do it.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.390 align:middle line:90%
That's a yes.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And you know, something
can be really uncertain.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.128 align:middle line:84%
Something that you might not be
able to decide whether or not

00:03:46.128 --> 00:03:48.170 align:middle line:84%
you know I don't know if
I'll be able to do this.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm
good enough to do this

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.760 align:middle line:84%
but it still feels
really fun, that's

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:90%
a clear sign to go for it.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.018 align:middle line:84%
There's real
opportunity for growth.

00:03:55.018 --> 00:03:56.560 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one
of the beliefs that

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.500 align:middle line:84%
drives my whole life is
everything is figureoutable.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, if there's
something that you want to do,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.340 align:middle line:84%
there's something that
you want to experience,

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.090 align:middle line:84%
there's something that
you want to change,

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.820 align:middle line:84%
you can absolutely
figure it out.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.043 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
have all of the hows.

00:04:09.043 --> 00:04:10.960 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to have
all of the information.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to know if
it'll actually turn out right.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.675 align:middle line:84%
But you have to take
that first step.

00:04:15.675 --> 00:04:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think one of the
other things that can really

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.880 align:middle line:84%
help us is an idea that
clarity comes from engagement,

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:90%
not thought.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:84%
So if you have an
inkling that you

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.930 align:middle line:84%
might want to pursue
a particular career,

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.690 align:middle line:84%
or maybe start a business,
or try a new path,

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.570 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to quit your
job and just go for it.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.080 align:middle line:84%
See if there's a small way that
you can test or experiment.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.490 align:middle line:90%
Can you take a class?

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.230 align:middle line:90%
Can you volunteer for a day?

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Can you go engage in whatever
that possibility is so that you

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.030 align:middle line:84%
can feel from your body and from
the world does this feel right.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Is this exciting?

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:90%
Do I want to keep going?

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:84%
Or was this just
an idea that I'm

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.255 align:middle line:84%
really glad that I did this
day or I did this experiment,

00:04:56.255 --> 00:04:58.630 align:middle line:84%
but, you know what, I don't
want to change my whole life.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.060 align:middle line:84%
I think so many times
we can sit on a couch

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.740 align:middle line:84%
and think about how
we want our life

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.650 align:middle line:84%
to possibly change, or imagine
starting that business,

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.920 align:middle line:84%
or imagine moving to that
place without realizing

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.550 align:middle line:84%
that if we can just
engage in some small way,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.990 align:middle line:90%
we'll get the information.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:84%
We'll feel whether or
not we should move ahead.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.010 align:middle line:84%
And that will inform
our next step.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.520 align:middle line:84%
For some of us, we have a lot of
responsibilities in our lives.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:84%
We have people that
are depending on us.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.400 align:middle line:84%
We have parents that
we're taking care of.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:90%
We have children.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:90%
We have pets.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.160 align:middle line:84%
We have people that depend
on us for their well-being.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.520 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of just uprooting
everything and making

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.623 align:middle line:84%
a huge change might
not be practical.

00:05:35.623 --> 00:05:36.790 align:middle line:90%
It might not be responsible.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.322 align:middle line:84%
It might create
more stress that's

00:05:38.322 --> 00:05:40.780 align:middle line:84%
not actually conducive to the
change that you want to make.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.220 align:middle line:84%
So if that's the
case, that doesn't

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.540 align:middle line:84%
mean that you can't
change your life.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.623 align:middle line:84%
That just means that you
have to be more creative.

00:05:45.623 --> 00:05:47.770 align:middle line:84%
You have to find a way to
engage, and experiment,

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.140 align:middle line:84%
and test things, whether
it's late at night,

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.060 align:middle line:84%
early in the mornings,
on the weekends.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.905 align:middle line:84%
And then you can start
to create change.

00:05:53.905 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:84%
Some of us are
built differently.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Some of us do need
to burn the bridges.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
Some of us need
to say that's it.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.550 align:middle line:84%
I'm changing
everything right now.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.590 align:middle line:84%
I think the point
is there's not one

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.700 align:middle line:84%
right way, that if you are that
person who just needs to do it

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
all in one fell swoop and that
feels most exciting to you,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:90%
rock on.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.630 align:middle line:84%
But if you're someone who's
a little more risk averse

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.502 align:middle line:84%
and you want to test
things out, don't

00:06:15.502 --> 00:06:16.960 align:middle line:84%
think that you're
not going to have

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.800 align:middle line:84%
a huge transformation because
you take small steps over time.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And within a year, three
years, five years, or 10 years,
