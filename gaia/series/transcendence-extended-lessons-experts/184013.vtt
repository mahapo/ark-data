00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The presence of fear is a
sign you're relying on your own

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.050 align:middle line:90%
strength.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a beautiful message
from a course in miracles.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So when you identify
that you are

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.020 align:middle line:84%
trying to control
your circumstances

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:84%
or make something happen
or try to force something

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:84%
to happen on your own time
or even just even controlling

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.050 align:middle line:84%
something in your mind, then you
know that there's fear present.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:84%
And it also is in
any time in our life

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.690 align:middle line:84%
when we're relying on
ourselves to create

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
or relying on
ourselves to show up,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.970 align:middle line:84%
we're misaligned with
the truth of who we are

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.610 align:middle line:84%
and we're out of alignment
with a higher power.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.777 align:middle line:84%
So that's the presence of fear
is when we forget that there

00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:51.360 align:middle line:84%
is a higher power, that there
is a presence of love within us,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.700 align:middle line:84%
around us, an ever
present energy of love

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.530 align:middle line:90%
that's always supporting us.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.520 align:middle line:84%
It's when we forget that,
that we get into fear.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
So the way that we
unlearn that fear

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.570 align:middle line:84%
is through reconditioning
truly, truly reconditioning

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.360 align:middle line:84%
our thought processes,
reconditioning our belief

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.090 align:middle line:90%
systems, prayer, meditation.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.370 align:middle line:84%
Any type of spiritual
path is really

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.730 align:middle line:84%
a mental reconditioning of
unlearning fear and remembering

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.680 align:middle line:90%
love.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And the beauty of all this that
the love doesn't go anywhere.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.300 align:middle line:90%
The love is always there.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.410 align:middle line:90%
And we can't actually block it.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:90%
We just forget to see it.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.080 align:middle line:90%
So we have to really--

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
we're in a dream.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.310 align:middle line:90%
We're having a nightmare.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:84%
And we wake up from
that dream and we

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.150 align:middle line:84%
realize that the moment that
we turn on those lights,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:84%
we realize we're just
having a nightmare.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.855 align:middle line:84%
But we have to remember that
those lights are always on,

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:46.980 align:middle line:84%
right, so we can turn those
lights on at any moment

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
and we can wake up
from that dream.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.810 align:middle line:84%
We all have fear-based
limiting belief systems that

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.277 align:middle line:84%
have been ingrained
in us since childhood,

00:01:54.277 --> 00:01:55.860 align:middle line:84%
belief systems of
I'm not good enough,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.020 align:middle line:84%
or belief systems of,
who am I to be great?

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Or who am I to earn money?

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Or how could I possibly do that
thing I've been dreaming of?

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And these belief
systems are stifling us

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.595 align:middle line:84%
and keeping us small
and blocking us

00:02:07.595 --> 00:02:08.970 align:middle line:84%
from really living
in our highest

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.770 align:middle line:84%
potential in our highest service
and in our highest joy truly.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.740 align:middle line:84%
So the first step to really
healing those belief systems

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.750 align:middle line:84%
is to witness them,
to witness them

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.510 align:middle line:84%
without any judgment, witness
our judgment of ourselves

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:84%
without judgment, and to
be really conscious of,

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.690 align:middle line:90%
what are these belief systems?

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.988 align:middle line:90%
How are they making us feel?

00:02:26.988 --> 00:02:28.530 align:middle line:84%
We can ask ourselves
those questions.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.450 align:middle line:90%
What is my limiting belief?

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:90%
How is it making me feel?

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And then going so far to say,
what experience from my past

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.600 align:middle line:84%
is causing me to
believe this now?

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Because all of it comes
from a root cause condition.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.810 align:middle line:84%
It comes from a moment in time
when we separated from God,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.340 align:middle line:90%
when we separated from love.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And then we had that
experience of separation

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.750 align:middle line:84%
and then we
continued to build up

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
a world that is a false
belief system of fear,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.810 align:middle line:84%
a false belief
system of inadequacy

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:84%
and feelings of not
being good enough.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So we continue to
repurpose and replay

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
this story over and over
in so many different ways.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So we repurpose it in our
career or relationships.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.010 align:middle line:84%
We have the same relationship
just a different body

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.030 align:middle line:90%
every time.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And so the quickest pathway
to creating that change

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:84%
is to first and foremost
witness it and recognize it.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.120 align:middle line:84%
And we have to be the
witness of that fear

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.770 align:middle line:90%
in order to change it.

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And in that witnessing,
there's also a willingness

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.625 align:middle line:84%
because there's a willingness
to look at our crazy really.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have to look
at our crazy and we

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.550 align:middle line:84%
have to call it by its
name, which is fear.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And that really begins the
journey of undoing the fear

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.590 align:middle line:90%
and unlearning the fear.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.740 align:middle line:90%
The first step is crucial.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Because without that
willingness and that desire

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.900 align:middle line:84%
to witness and look
at it, we can't

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.420 align:middle line:90%
have the catalyst for change.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.720 align:middle line:84%
We can't have the
desire to change.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we have
to really open up

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
to a belief system
beyond our own.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.130 align:middle line:84%
Because in order to
create that change

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.730 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of the
transformation of a belief

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.360 align:middle line:84%
system that has held
us back for a lifetime

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:84%
requires a spiritual connection,
a spiritual awareness,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:07.445 align:middle line:90%
in my opinion.

00:04:07.445 --> 00:04:09.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's many
things you can do.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.237 align:middle line:84%
There's many personal growth
tools that you can use.

00:04:11.237 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And there's beautiful
therapy practices.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
But there's spirit
and God in all that.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.910 align:middle line:84%
I believe that spirit works
through those doctors and works

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.535 align:middle line:84%
through those self-help
books and works

00:04:19.535 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:84%
through those different
practitioners and yoga teachers

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.830 align:middle line:84%
and meditation instructors or
whoever you may be guided to.

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.790 align:middle line:84%
And so when you open up with
a willingness to change,

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.110 align:middle line:90%
you will be guided.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.250 align:middle line:84%
You'll be guided to the teacher,
the yoga instructor, the book,

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.170 align:middle line:90%
maybe this film.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.940 align:middle line:84%
Many of us, and I
speak for those of us

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:84%
out there who dissociate
from traumatic events

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.530 align:middle line:84%
particularly when we're
a child, and for me, I

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:84%
tucked it away and
remembered it at 36,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.050 align:middle line:84%
which was one of the most
terrifying and liberating

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.730 align:middle line:90%
moments of my life.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.820 align:middle line:84%
But I never understood, why
did I become a drug addict

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.810 align:middle line:90%
and alcoholic?

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.450 align:middle line:84%
Why did I become addicted to
relationships and co-dependent?

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.500 align:middle line:90%
Why was I a food addict?

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.760 align:middle line:90%
What were all-- why?

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.800 align:middle line:90%
What was the why, right?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.070 align:middle line:90%
I felt everything was so good.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:84%
But many of us, whether
we literally remember

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
the traumatic event or have
completely dissociated from it,

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.310 align:middle line:84%
have many mechanisms for
running from the pain,

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:84%
running from the trauma,
anesthetizing that trauma.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.690 align:middle line:90%
That's why we drink.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.040 align:middle line:90%
It's why we overwork.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.480 align:middle line:90%
It's why we overachieve.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:90%
It's why we self-sabotage.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
trauma is the root cause

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.880 align:middle line:90%
of most addictive behaviors.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So if there's those
addicts listening,

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.907 align:middle line:90%
I've been sober 12 years now.

00:05:32.907 --> 00:05:34.490 align:middle line:84%
I believe that the
trauma was the root

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.850 align:middle line:84%
cause of my addictive behavior
because I was running,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.110 align:middle line:90%
because I was anesthetizing.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:90%
I was avoiding.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
I was doing anything I could
to not remember and not feel.

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.850 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that the
cat was out of the bag

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and I actually did have the
recollection and the memory

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
came back to me, as terrifying
and fearful as that was for me,

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.380 align:middle line:84%
it was also this incredible
liberating experience

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.050 align:middle line:84%
of finally feeling like I
don't have to run anymore.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.380 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is
to face the trauma,

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:05.990 align:middle line:84%
to accept that you
have been traumatized,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.140 align:middle line:84%
to accept that these
events are real,

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.720 align:middle line:90%
and to choose to stop running.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.710 align:middle line:90%
That's scary.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Because the ways that we've
been running have been the ways

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.310 align:middle line:90%
that we've stayed safe.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.110 align:middle line:84%
But there's really
nothing safe about that.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:84%
True safety lies in
our freedom from it

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.190 align:middle line:90%
not from the running from it.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.500 align:middle line:84%
So some things I
really recommend

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.200 align:middle line:84%
for people who
are healing trauma

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
is emotional freedom
technique, EFT, otherwise known

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.850 align:middle line:90%
as tapping.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.090 align:middle line:84%
It's something I teach in
practice in my own trauma

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:90%
healing.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.640 align:middle line:84%
EMDR is eye movement
desensitization

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.690 align:middle line:90%
and reprocessing.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And EMDR is a beautiful
practice of reprogramming

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.550 align:middle line:84%
the neural pathways through
bilateral brain functioning

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.360 align:middle line:84%
and really unlocking the
amygdala to release the trauma.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And with EFT and EMDR,
really what's happening

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
is you're healing the emotional
disturbance that lives

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.670 align:middle line:90%
beneath the traumatic event.

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And so when you can heal
that emotional disturbance,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.830 align:middle line:84%
then you can be released
of that fight or flight.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.230 align:middle line:90%
And this is a big suggestion.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
When you're in the place of
recognizing identifying trauma

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:84%
and becoming
prepared to heal it,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:84%
stay in prayer to
find or attract

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.560 align:middle line:84%
or seek the right healer
that's going to be the safest

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.820 align:middle line:90%
healer for you.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.710 align:middle line:84%
Because that was probably-- my
prayers for healing guided me

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:34.370 align:middle line:84%
to a team of very
talented therapists,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.600 align:middle line:84%
spiritual healers, EMDR
experts, who I've built up

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
and I've had the privilege
of being able to work with.

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:43.430 align:middle line:84%
Now someone is saying, well,
OK, I can't afford a therapist.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.360 align:middle line:90%
I can't afford that.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.040 align:middle line:84%
There's many
resources out there.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:84%
There's plenty of EFT
videos for free on YouTube.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.220 align:middle line:84%
I promise to write
a book on trauma

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that I will give to anybody
that can't afford it.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.330 align:middle line:84%
I just I am on a
mission of helping

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.730 align:middle line:84%
people heal their
traumatic wounds so

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.200 align:middle line:90%
that they can be free.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.880 align:middle line:84%
And freedom is on
the other side.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.910 align:middle line:84%
Many people feel
like, what is my life

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.880 align:middle line:84%
without this because it's
been so debilitating?

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.705 align:middle line:84%
But I do promise
anyone that's watching

00:08:09.705 --> 00:08:11.330 align:middle line:84%
that there is freedom
on the other side

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:13.520 align:middle line:84%
because I'm
experiencing it myself.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:84%
It comes with commitment
and a real desire to change.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:24.662 align:middle line:90%
