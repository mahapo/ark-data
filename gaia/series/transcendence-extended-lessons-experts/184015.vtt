00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I think one of the keys to
setting goals that are really

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.490 align:middle line:84%
going to be incredible for
you is do they excite you.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.730 align:middle line:84%
If you look at them on
that piece of paper,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.230 align:middle line:90%
does it bring you to life?

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Does it bring you joy?

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Does it make you
have those little mix

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
of fear and anticipation
where you're like you

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.270 align:middle line:90%
can't wait to dive into them.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.540 align:middle line:84%
If not, something's
probably wrong.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.360 align:middle line:84%
So you know, if we're
setting goals out of fear

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.630 align:middle line:84%
or a place of pain, that's
not necessarily bad.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.700 align:middle line:84%
We can either change
our lives from a space

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.540 align:middle line:90%
of inspiration or desperation.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And so many of us hit a pain
point where we're suffering.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.270 align:middle line:90%
We're depressed.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.610 align:middle line:84%
We have hit this
place in our lives,

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.920 align:middle line:84%
whether it's emotionally
in a relationship,

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:84%
financially in our careers,
where something is not working.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And we find ourselves
feeling like we're beating

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.730 align:middle line:90%
our head against a wall.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.850 align:middle line:84%
If you're setting a goal out of
I can't take this pain anymore,

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:84%
that's not necessarily
bad, because we

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.360 align:middle line:90%
have to start where we are.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.640 align:middle line:84%
But when you're
looking at your goals,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:84%
if they don't make you
want to jump out of bed,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.190 align:middle line:84%
stay up all night,
just get so fired up

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.400 align:middle line:84%
about figuring out how to
bring them into the world,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.950 align:middle line:84%
then I think it's time
for some re-evaluation.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I think there's maybe a
little bit of a distinction

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.910 align:middle line:90%
to make here.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
There's things that we
have to do, like pay taxes.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.260 align:middle line:84%
There's parts of our business or
our life that don't necessarily

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.650 align:middle line:90%
evoke a ton of joy.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.130 align:middle line:90%
But we can bring joy to them.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.853 align:middle line:84%
And then if we're looking at
something major like where

00:01:32.853 --> 00:01:35.020 align:middle line:84%
we want to live, or how we
want to express ourselves

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.645 align:middle line:84%
through our business
or career, or what

00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
we want our
relationship to life,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.470 align:middle line:84%
or what we want this body
and our energy to be like,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.960 align:middle line:84%
if the vision that
we set for ourself

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.750 align:middle line:84%
isn't lighting us
up on fire, again,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.090 align:middle line:84%
it is time to go back
to the drawing board

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.770 align:middle line:90%
and rewrite that story.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.850 align:middle line:90%
Rewrite that vision.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.790 align:middle line:84%
Rewrite those goals so it makes
you want to jump out of bed,

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.850 align:middle line:84%
so it makes you say I
cannot wait to tackle this.
