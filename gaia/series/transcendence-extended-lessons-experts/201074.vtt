00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.367 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:08.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I've worked with tens of
thousands of people at this

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.840 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.130 align:middle line:90%
And everyone has a wound.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's OK.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.330 align:middle line:90%
And that's actually normal.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not a tragedy
of epic proportions

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.230 align:middle line:84%
that everyone in humanity
ends up having a wound.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It is tragic in the sense of
the severity of some people's

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:90%
wounds.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.980 align:middle line:84%
And you can't help
but have empathy

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.010 align:middle line:84%
for that, and compassion,
and feel that pain with them,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
but it's almost, to me at
this point with everything

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.690 align:middle line:84%
I've seen, a kind of universal
anatomical feature if you will.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And this is, in its own
way, a beautiful thing

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.160 align:middle line:84%
because the wound is what
sets you up for bliss.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Your deepest wound is the
source of your greatest

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:90%
gift to the world.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.110 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it's your wound that
basically throws the penny

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:84%
into the deep end
of the pool for you

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.790 align:middle line:84%
then to dive down in terms
of fulfilling and finding

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.680 align:middle line:90%
your bliss.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how it turned
out to be like that,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.832 align:middle line:84%
but that's the pattern
I see in everyone.

00:01:32.832 --> 00:01:34.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, despite
all this, there's

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.480 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of navigating
we need to get you out

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.780 align:middle line:84%
of the minefield to go on and
find and follow your bliss,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.860 align:middle line:84%
because when you do
that, the importance--

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean as a tech person, the
scalability of helping people

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.310 align:middle line:84%
find and follow their
bliss is powerful

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.090 align:middle line:84%
because when a person is
following their bliss,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.970 align:middle line:84%
there's kind of two
orders of benefit.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:84%
The first order is when you
find and follow your bliss,

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.919 align:middle line:84%
it is the things you love
to do for no good reason

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
that you would pay
to do if you had to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and you had the means,
which also as a byproduct,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.460 align:middle line:84%
as a sort of happy accident,
creates value for other people.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So there's all these
things you love

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:84%
to do some of which
create value for people.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.920 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
bottom is what I call

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.970 align:middle line:84%
the bliss target or
an empathy target,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.020 align:middle line:84%
which is a
constituency of people

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
that you have just
disproportionate empathy for,

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
like you will drop everything
to help the stranger

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.850 align:middle line:84%
or friend of a
friend of a friend

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.980 align:middle line:84%
build their backyard
deck for barbecuing.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.140 align:middle line:84%
If that happens
to be your bliss.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.940 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.400 align:middle line:84%
You have those three
things together.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.090 align:middle line:84%
And you've got a
complete bliss circuit.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And so when you find
and follow your bliss,

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.370 align:middle line:84%
the first order of benefit
is your empathy target.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I mean they are benefiting all
the live long day from you just

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.540 align:middle line:84%
doing the thing
you love selfishly.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.520 align:middle line:84%
But then the second
order benefit

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:84%
is that you become a signpost
to other people around you.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:84%
When you're finding and
following your bliss, you are--

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean we talk about
soothing and shielding.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Following your bliss is
the ultimate soothing,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.870 align:middle line:84%
because it feels good
minute to minute.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the
ultimate shielding,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.220 align:middle line:84%
because you have
this like goofy smile

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:90%
on your face the whole time.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And you really don't care
what other people think.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.010 align:middle line:84%
I mean someone taps you on
the shoulder and asks you

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.760 align:middle line:84%
who your mother is and
you don't know, all right,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.600 align:middle line:84%
because you're so in the
flow of what you're doing.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And people can smell
that a mile away.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it when you're
sitting in the room with them.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that is to me
an even more powerful--

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:06.750 align:middle line:90%
because it's more generalized.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.125 align:middle line:84%
When you're
following your bliss,

00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:09.780 align:middle line:84%
your own sort of
nerdy empathy target

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
benefits, but you become
a signpost for everyone

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:84%
around you, because
people look at you when

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.490 align:middle line:90%
you're following your bliss.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.059 align:middle line:84%
And hopefully, the reaction is,
first of all, they're inspired.

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:23.500 align:middle line:84%
They're like, oh my
gosh, she's so amazing.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.840 align:middle line:84%
But then, hopefully, their
next reaction is like,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.440 align:middle line:84%
and I mean, what's
so special about him?

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.400 align:middle line:84%
If he could do it, I
mean I must have a shot.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.402 align:middle line:90%
I must have a shot.

00:04:33.402 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
In an ideal world, you know,
we reach a tipping point

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.160 align:middle line:84%
where enough people
are doing it where

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:84%
there's a critical
mass where it becomes

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:90%
more of this normal thing.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And there is this constant tug
of war between the two forces

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.600 align:middle line:84%
of bliss, doing the thing
you do out of love not fear,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.772 align:middle line:84%
and fear, doing the thing you
do out of just abject fear.

00:05:01.772 --> 00:05:03.480 align:middle line:84%
The way I think about
it is that we all--

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.150 align:middle line:84%
and this is an image
from my corporate days.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:84%
We all have like what is
metaphorically like a board

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.920 align:middle line:84%
of directors within us
where we're the CEO.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And there are a number of
characters on this board.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.730 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.188 align:middle line:84%
There's a chief of
security to make

00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:20.850 align:middle line:84%
sure you don't get
hit by a bus when

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.440 align:middle line:90%
you walk out on the street.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.740 align:middle line:90%
There's your creativity.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.000 align:middle line:84%
There's the one in
charge of making

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.990 align:middle line:84%
sure you get prestige
and are not humiliated.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.520 align:middle line:90%
Your body is a board member.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Your muse, if you
think of it that way,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.540 align:middle line:90%
can be a board member.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
And basically, all
the sort of major life

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
forces you identify as
such are board members.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So in the more
nuanced cases, money

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.660 align:middle line:84%
itself can be seen
as a board member.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you have money
blocks or fear of money,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.080 align:middle line:84%
it is that board
member being exiled.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.820 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And so the way the
wounding happens then

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.233 align:middle line:84%
is that when you're
told to put this mask on

00:06:11.233 --> 00:06:13.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're like, shit,
I'm going to lose love.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:84%
I've got a gun to my head
so I'm going to put it on,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.070 align:middle line:84%
there will be parts
of you that stick out,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:90%
because the mask is not organic.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:84%
The mask is fashioned by society
for its own machined purposes.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:27.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.095 align:middle line:84%
But when you put it
on, you'll realize

00:06:30.095 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:84%
that there are certain
parts of you that don't fit,

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.300 align:middle line:90%
that stick out.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.590 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, allowing
those parts of you to stick out

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:43.340 align:middle line:84%
is punished as much as
if you took a mask off,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:84%
because it's ruining my
suspension of disbelief.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And so cattle prod is
hit and we start running.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.260 align:middle line:84%
You get that cattle
prod enough times,

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.530 align:middle line:84%
pretty soon an emergency meeting
of the board of directors

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.630 align:middle line:90%
is called.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And the chief of security--
in this day and age,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.450 align:middle line:84%
I might even say the chief
of Homeland Security--

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.270 align:middle line:84%
makes an announcement
and says, look,

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.940 align:middle line:84%
I know we all have
our roles and we're

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.920 align:middle line:84%
all life tenured members of
the board and everything,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:15.750 align:middle line:84%
but we've got a serious life or
death situation on our hands.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.440 align:middle line:84%
If our dad looks at
us like that again,

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:90%
there could be real trouble.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.170 align:middle line:84%
If our mom looks at us with
that look of disappointment,

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:90%
there could be trouble.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:30.780 align:middle line:84%
And there is a part of our
deep biological chassis

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.960 align:middle line:84%
that knows that if we
are rejected enough

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.100 align:middle line:84%
and we don't comply
past a certain extreme,

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.960 align:middle line:90%
we could lose our lives.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:84%
We'll be left on the
hillside to freeze or be

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.920 align:middle line:90%
fed to the wolves or whatever.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.768 align:middle line:84%
And a civilized person may
go, well, this is 2019.

00:07:47.768 --> 00:07:48.810 align:middle line:90%
We don't do that anymore.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.268 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, there's seven
billion people on the planet.

00:07:51.268 --> 00:07:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Most of them live without
electricity or running water.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.460 align:middle line:90%
This still happens all the time.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.560 align:middle line:90%
This still happens all the time.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.120 align:middle line:90%
Kids are given up in orphanages.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
So it's not unreasonable
that as human beings

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:12.720 align:middle line:84%
we come with a safety code
of like looking out for,

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.330 align:middle line:84%
especially as a child, signs
that we are being rejected

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.998 align:middle line:84%
and not compliant, signs
that we're being shamed.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:21.540 align:middle line:84%
And shame is the feeling that
there's something intrinsically

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:90%
wrong with me.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:84%
When we look out for
the people around us who

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:84%
are protecting us and
feeding us thinking there's

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.580 align:middle line:84%
something wrong with
us, we're constantly

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:35.520 align:middle line:84%
looking out for that
threshold of like if we

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.788 align:middle line:84%
cross a certain
threshold, we're dead.

00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And we have to do
something about it.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.169 align:middle line:84%
Then you call the emergency
meeting of the board members.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
And you say, look,
you know, we're

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.430 align:middle line:90%
a young man in this family.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.410 align:middle line:84%
Everyone in this family
is bankers and lawyers.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:50.560 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it is.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you've benefited from
all that sort of privilege

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.930 align:middle line:84%
and economic resource and
education so don't complain.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
But if our dad looks
at us like that again,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.940 align:middle line:84%
there's going to
be serious trouble.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And we've called you here to
this emergency board meeting,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.450 align:middle line:84%
because, I'm sorry, we're going
to have to declare martial law.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And you punk rocker, you
guitar playing artist,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.760 align:middle line:90%
and you long hair--

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.270 align:middle line:84%
yo, definitely you
long hair, you guys

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.420 align:middle line:90%
are voted off the island.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Security, escort them
into the cafeteria.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Sequester them there
until further notice,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.550 align:middle line:90%
which is like forever.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.460 align:middle line:84%
The rest of you, ignore
the banging on the door.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:35.610 align:middle line:90%
Carry on with the meeting.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.110 align:middle line:84%
So when these board members
within you are exiled,

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:90%
it's done out of love.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.490 align:middle line:90%
It's not malicious.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.950 align:middle line:84%
It's done out of love and a
well-meaning but panicked fear.

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:53.940 align:middle line:84%
The question basically
boils down to

00:09:53.940 --> 00:10:01.260 align:middle line:84%
to what extent can you get a
reading on what board member

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.900 align:middle line:84%
or board members were exiled
in order to keep your mask on

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.740 align:middle line:84%
and are you able to actually
recover them and bring them

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:90%
back into the boat with you?

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:15.150 align:middle line:84%
As far as the entire
board is concerned,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:20.250 align:middle line:84%
you all parachuted in
here to find and prosecute

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:25.030 align:middle line:84%
your meaning and purpose in
your life for your bliss.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:middle line:84%
And whatever wound was given
to you was part of the compass.

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And now you're following in
the direction of the wound

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:35.100 align:middle line:84%
instead of letting
the wound guide you.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:39.120 align:middle line:10%
The key to this healing for
me is finding your lost board

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.000 align:middle line:10%
member and recovering it,
because the quintessence

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:50.580 align:middle line:10%
within you of feeling like
a part of you is not worthy,

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:10%
I mean it's probably
deeper, but let's just

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.700 align:middle line:10%
say the musician in you
who was stuffed down,

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.800 align:middle line:10%
when you finally recover
him and like, look,

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.770 align:middle line:10%
we're not going
to quit our lives

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:10%
and go join the circus,
because we're not

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.440 align:middle line:10%
going 100% in your
direction, but also we're

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:10%
not going to go in 100%
of the bully's direction

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.300 align:middle line:10%
and just be an accountant
for the rest of our lives.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.758 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to come up
with some kind of compromise

00:11:14.758 --> 00:11:16.260 align:middle line:90%
plan.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.070 align:middle line:84%
That is stepping away
from fear, because if I

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:24.570 align:middle line:84%
add a little mix, maybe
increasing over time,

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.900 align:middle line:84%
of musician, I
will not lose love.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And I slowly get
acclimated to that.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.790 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.215 align:middle line:84%
For most people,
that board member

00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:37.810 align:middle line:84%
is stuffed down
very, very deeply.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.110 align:middle line:84%
And it will come up
with all kinds of ways

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:90%
to get its message to you.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Pulling the emergency
brake, having

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.842 align:middle line:84%
like a big crisis in your
life, getting laid off,

00:11:46.842 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:84%
throwing out your
back-- all these things

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:90%
are ways of doing it.

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And there are two
very powerful ways

00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:84%
that lost board number will come
to you when your guard is down

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:84%
and you're more
accidentally receptive.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And the two are when
you're meditating

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:90%
and when you're asleep.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So meditation,
you'll get visions.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.175 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.175 --> 00:12:19.050 align:middle line:84%
That lost board member
will come up and start

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.990 align:middle line:84%
talking at you, a
voice that you usually

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:90%
don't allow to yourself.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
When you're in full meditation
and those things within you

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.270 align:middle line:84%
are open, that will be the
moment where the guerrilla

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:90%
forces are like, OK, now.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:34.930 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:35.790 align:middle line:90%
Go.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:36.670 align:middle line:90%
And they run up to you.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:84%
And you're like you're
going to stab me.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.140 align:middle line:90%
They're like, no.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.400 align:middle line:90%
They're handing you an envelope.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:43.870 align:middle line:84%
Please don't burn this one
like you did the last 3,000

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:45.425 align:middle line:90%
we've been trying to send you.

00:12:45.425 --> 00:12:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And then dreams
of the other one.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.230 align:middle line:84%
When people start
a healing cycle,

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:51.940 align:middle line:84%
their dreams will
invariably fire up.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.180 align:middle line:84%
And even dreams that have
been recurring for 30 years

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
when you start to
remember, oh yeah,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.870 align:middle line:84%
there's this dream I've had
for 30 years that's recurring.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.162 align:middle line:84%
And I'm like, OK, you just
spent an hour telling me you

00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:90%
don't dream, which is fine.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle line:90%
That happens, right?

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And the most common dream
pattern is someone chasing you,

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:10.960 align:middle line:84%
a boogie man chasing
you, invading your home,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.950 align:middle line:90%
breaking into your home.

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And typically, the
way I read that is

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:21.900 align:middle line:84%
that that is some form of lost
board member running after you

00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:24.300 align:middle line:90%
trying to get you a message.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's so at the
end of its rope

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.820 align:middle line:84%
because it's tried
everything else.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:31.155 align:middle line:84%
It's tried your girlfriend
breaking up with you.

00:13:31.155 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:84%
It's tried your son
telling you you're a jerk

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.390 align:middle line:90%
and not talking to you.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.057 align:middle line:84%
Nothing's getting
through because you're

00:13:36.057 --> 00:13:39.522 align:middle line:84%
like I have to continue
soothing and shielding.

00:13:39.522 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Finally, it'll come to you
in this dream where you're

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.160 align:middle line:84%
being chased, because
it has resorted

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.145 align:middle line:84%
to pulling the lever of fear,
because unless you wake up

00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:84%
at 3:00 in the morning
in a cold sweat,

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.470 align:middle line:90%
you won't remember anything.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:54.030 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm going
to do that to you.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.215 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, but I'm going
to hit the button,

00:13:57.215 --> 00:13:59.340 align:middle line:84%
wake you up at 3:00 in the
morning in a cold sweat.

00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:00.990 align:middle line:90%
You'll have this dream.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is it
doesn't know that we're

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.350 align:middle line:90%
in 2019 and Western--

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:07.300 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't know you can't go
anywhere to get the dream read.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, you go on the
internet for dream directory

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:84%
and it says, oh boogey man
is some lost fear of yours.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.190 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, but what
does that mean, you know?

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:84%
But it's a very ancient
part of ourselves.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.547 align:middle line:84%
So when people come to
me, I say, OK, OK, fine.

00:14:25.547 --> 00:14:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Have your dreams been firing up?

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:27.797 align:middle line:90%
And I know the answer.

00:14:27.797 --> 00:14:33.960 align:middle line:84%
And give me a few and I'll
just give you the thumbnail

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.810 align:middle line:84%
but just enough so that you're
like, OK, this is a real thing.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.690 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And I'm willing to go
find my lost board member.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:45.270 align:middle line:90%
And that typically is enough.

00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:50.960 align:middle line:84%
For me, what I am is a
boardroom consultant.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a board member.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:54.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a vote.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.370 align:middle line:90%
I don't have a vote.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:84%
But I do come in and
help people start talking

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:04.410 align:middle line:84%
to these parts of
themselves to basically say

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.570 align:middle line:84%
even if you get to the
point where you just

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:84%
draw up the battle lines,
like we want money.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.450 align:middle line:90%
We want prestige.

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:16.020 align:middle line:84%
We want comfort,
material comfort.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:19.200 align:middle line:84%
We want the ability
to shut dad up,

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.780 align:middle line:84%
because now he is
asking us for money.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:90%
So that's nice.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:24.210 align:middle line:90%
Shuts the old man up, right?

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:84%
But on the artist
side, it's like I

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:84%
need to express
this, this, and this.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And if you are so afraid
of it that you only

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:42.120 align:middle line:84%
take a fleeting glance, it just
looks like the immovable force

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.230 align:middle line:90%
hitting against--

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
the irresistible force hitting
against the immovable object.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.080 align:middle line:84%
But when you get in
there, even drawing up

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:53.610 align:middle line:84%
the battle lines is huge
progress, because then at least

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.230 align:middle line:90%
you know what each side wants.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And you can start
the negotiation

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:59.320 align:middle line:90%
and potential compromise.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.150 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:01.890 align:middle line:84%
And I've found
that there's always

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:90%
a way to thread the needle.

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:07.050 align:middle line:90%
I've never found a case--

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.650 align:middle line:84%
I've never found the
case where it was not

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.200 align:middle line:90%
possible to thread the needle.

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean by that is
I've never seen the dice throw

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:30.000 align:middle line:84%
of the universe end up where a
person is born into this world

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and they're given
a bliss that is

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.790 align:middle line:84%
completely
incompatible with life,

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:37.290 align:middle line:90%
the practicalities in life.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:90%
I've never seen it.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:40.660 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why the
occurrence and fulfillment

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:84%
of bliss is so low in
humanity at this point,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:84%
and it just is what it
is, we are where we are,

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.290 align:middle line:90%
is that we're shamed.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:01.007 align:middle line:84%
We're taught that if
we have this bliss,

00:17:01.007 --> 00:17:02.340 align:middle line:90%
there's something wrong with us.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.140 align:middle line:90%
We will lose love.

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.960 align:middle line:84%
There's all this
fear surrounding it

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:84%
so that we don't even look
at the sight of the wound

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:14.609 align:middle line:84%
or area in question, what was
exiled, what was pushed off.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:17.460 align:middle line:90%
And that's 99% of the problem.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And the metaphor I always
use is even a paper cut,

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:27.270 align:middle line:84%
if you don't attend to it and
let it get infected and fester,

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.420 align:middle line:90%
even a paper cut can kill you.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So for me, there's really
only one thing out of which

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.570 align:middle line:90%
bliss itself will emerge.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And that is the deeper
and deeper understanding

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:05.820 align:middle line:84%
that I as a person,
whoever you are,

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.660 align:middle line:84%
it's not even that
I'm worthy of love.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:13.780 align:middle line:84%
I am actually loved
without condition.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.580 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:90%
Full stop.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.810 align:middle line:90%
That there is no condition.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's the only switch
that needs to be flipped.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:30.000 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
feeling, the way that

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.810 align:middle line:84%
changes the physics
of your life is

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:37.850 align:middle line:84%
that I mean at a very
fundamental level,

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:43.440 align:middle line:84%
you're, first of all,
not afraid of anything,

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
because if I quit my job
and I don't make any money,

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.700 align:middle line:84%
it means, well, I'm
making less money

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.370 align:middle line:90%
so I need to tighten my belt.

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.550 align:middle line:84%
For most people, it doesn't
mean they'll starve.

00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And even if they do
starve, they can figure--

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.340 align:middle line:84%
they can friends, family,
the government, whatever.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Typically, there's a level of
money below which all the shame

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.590 align:middle line:84%
factors and loss
of love kick in,

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:84%
which is way above
like what you actually

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.800 align:middle line:90%
need to live and survive.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:90%
That delta is fine.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:12.460 align:middle line:84%
It's fine to have
that difference there.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:20.720 align:middle line:84%
But the key is that
the things you do out

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:84%
of a fear of loss of love,
when you truly flip the switch

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:33.770 align:middle line:84%
to say, actually, it's not
possible for me to lose love,

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:38.600 align:middle line:84%
all the things you were
doing based on that fear

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.590 align:middle line:90%
instantly fall away.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.060 align:middle line:84%
And if we go back to
soothing and shielding,

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.680 align:middle line:90%
let's just look at the list--

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
money and prestige,
perfectionism, anger,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:20:01.370 align:middle line:84%
invisibility, people
pleasing, sex and drugs,

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:05.980 align:middle line:84%
shopping, alcohol, sex and
relationships, unhealthy sex

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and relationships-- all
those things fall away.

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:12.010 align:middle line:90%
You've lost your fear.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.920 align:middle line:84%
So all the things you were
doing motivated by the fear

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.560 align:middle line:90%
have stopped dead in the water.

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.370 align:middle line:90%
And voila, you're still alive.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.020 align:middle line:84%
People who love
you still love you.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:23.560 align:middle line:90%
Everything's fine.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.393 align:middle line:90%
You're not starving.

00:20:24.393 --> 00:20:26.020 align:middle line:90%
No one's come to arrest you yet.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:28.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And then as you sit
there for long enough,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:84%
this other muscle will start to
flex that had previously been

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:41.180 align:middle line:84%
quite atrophied which is
not the muscle of fear,

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:45.080 align:middle line:84%
which is very strong, but the
muscle of-- there are many

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:45.880 align:middle line:90%
words--

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.130 align:middle line:90%
desire, love, bliss, vision.

00:20:49.130 --> 00:20:53.780 align:middle line:90%


00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And you realize it's not
that you have no motivation

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.100 align:middle line:90%
to do anything.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.672 align:middle line:84%
It's just that all the usual
menu options in society

00:21:02.672 --> 00:21:03.630 align:middle line:90%
are all driven by fear.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.088 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, yeah, but I
don't have any fear so I'm not

00:21:06.088 --> 00:21:07.573 align:middle line:90%
going to check that box.

00:21:07.573 --> 00:21:08.490 align:middle line:90%
I don't have any fear.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine with my body image.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.303 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to check that box.

00:21:13.303 --> 00:21:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And you leave all
these boxes unchecked.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:17.137 align:middle line:84%
And you're sitting at home
alone like doing nothing.

00:21:17.137 --> 00:21:19.943 align:middle line:90%
And you have gobs of free time.

00:21:19.943 --> 00:21:21.360 align:middle line:84%
And your mind will
naturally work.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Other board members will be
like, hey, now can we paint?

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:35.503 align:middle line:84%
And the board is like,
uh, sure, whatever.

00:21:35.503 --> 00:21:37.170 align:middle line:84%
And before you know
it, you're painting.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.990 align:middle line:84%
In other words, nature
abhors a vacuum.

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:44.190 align:middle line:84%
So when fear is
taken off the table,

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:45.700 align:middle line:84%
the vacuum doesn't
last very long.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.170 align:middle line:90%
You can hear the hissing.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.600 align:middle line:84%
And the thing that's coming
in, the only other thing

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.020 align:middle line:90%
side from fear is love/desire.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:90%


00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:90%
And so you start to sort of--

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.950 align:middle line:84%
your radar starts to lock
on things that you do--

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:06.607 align:middle line:84%
it sounds corny, but you do
out of love, not out of fear.

00:22:06.607 --> 00:22:08.190 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
something out of love,

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.230 align:middle line:84%
you're doing it
for no good reason.

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:11.730 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't make money.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't burnish my baseball
card or my reputation.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.700 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't look good or not
good on Instagram or whatever.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm just doing it because
I'm just the stupid nerd

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:84%
and I like collecting a
certain kind of stamp.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:25.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:26.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:26.940 align:middle line:90%
So sue me.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:27.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:28.898 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why I like this.

00:22:28.898 --> 00:22:30.330 align:middle line:90%
I just like it.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And you start doing
things for that reason.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.280 align:middle line:84%
And then those things
then, when you take them

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:84%
through the bliss
process of like

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.060 align:middle line:84%
so these are all
the things you like

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:90%
which happen to create value.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And then, of those people
it creates value to,

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.270 align:middle line:84%
who are the ones who feel the
most intrinsic empathy toward?

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:54.570 align:middle line:90%


00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Then that, if you wish--
you don't have to.

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:57.080 align:middle line:90%
There is no should.

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.205 align:middle line:90%
There is no finger wagging.

00:22:58.205 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
If you wish, you can
start to craft that

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:04.253 align:middle line:84%
into actually your livelihood
from there forward if you want.

00:23:04.253 --> 00:23:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Some people, they've
lived in fear

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:07.837 align:middle line:84%
for so long they've got a
huge bank account from all

00:23:07.837 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:84%
the companies they've
started and sold or whatever

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.970 align:middle line:90%
and it doesn't matter as much.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:15.180 align:middle line:84%
But you still do it, not
because you need the money

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:19.960 align:middle line:84%
but because money is
also a board member.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:20.850 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you see it only
as a necessary evil,

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:25.080 align:middle line:84%
you're exiling
that board member.

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:27.243 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.243 --> 00:23:29.160 align:middle line:84%
Now we're not saying go
in the other direction

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.250 align:middle line:84%
where it is the dictator
running the whole show.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.950 align:middle line:90%
That's out of fear too.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.930 align:middle line:84%
But there is a balanced, healthy
place for money on the board.

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:41.307 align:middle line:84%
And so you'll often end
up doing your bliss.

00:23:41.307 --> 00:23:43.140 align:middle line:84%
And there will be money
involved, because it

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.690 align:middle line:90%
does create value for people.

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:50.460 align:middle line:90%
And you know, that's OK.

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:56.160 align:middle line:84%
So the move from
fear to love feels

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.110 align:middle line:84%
like that where
you do great things

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.630 align:middle line:90%
and you don't get more love.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So you don't do anything out
of fear anymore to get love

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.300 align:middle line:90%
or to avoid losing love.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.050 align:middle line:84%
The love is just
maxed all the time.

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:84%
And then from that, the
love which is maxed,

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.737 align:middle line:84%
which you're actually
acknowledging exists now,

00:24:13.737 --> 00:24:15.570 align:middle line:84%
it starts to have its
own opinion over life.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:16.655 align:middle line:90%
Well, let's go do that.

00:24:16.655 --> 00:24:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And you say, well, that
won't make any money.

00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:20.648 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, but that's OK.

00:24:20.648 --> 00:24:22.440 align:middle line:84%
If we don't make money,
we won't lose love.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:22.830 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:23.630 align:middle line:90%
Never mind.

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:25.820 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go
back to my cupcake.

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:26.620 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:26.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:27.560 align:middle line:90%
So let's go paint.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:28.640 align:middle line:90%
Let's go paint.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.110 align:middle line:84%

this stuff like mindlessly.

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.920 align:middle line:90%

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:90%
Things just flow out of you.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.670 align:middle line:84%
It was like someone was
doing it through my hands.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.880 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
love, surrender,

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.940 align:middle line:90%
and all those related things.
