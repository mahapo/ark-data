00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.388 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.388 --> 00:00:08.240 align:middle line:90%


00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Everyone at home, you want to
start by just picking something

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.570 align:middle line:90%
to work on.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So we've talked
about fear of flying.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.010 align:middle line:90%
We've mentioned anxiety.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.680 align:middle line:84%
So you're anxious about
something that is coming up.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.660 align:middle line:90%
You can pick that experience.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.540 align:middle line:84%
You're angry about something
someone said to you three days

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.340 align:middle line:90%
ago.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And you think about it, and your
blood starts boiling already.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.210 align:middle line:90%
You have some pain in your body.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.420 align:middle line:90%
It's great for physical pain.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:90%
So you tune into your body.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.643 align:middle line:90%
You go, oh, my shoulder's tight.

00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:33.950 align:middle line:90%
There is this tension.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.640 align:middle line:84%
Something that you're
stressed about.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.057 align:middle line:84%
And we want to try
to be specific.

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:39.080 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to just
say, my life sucks,

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.760 align:middle line:90%
and everything's overwhelming.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.690 align:middle line:90%
So you pick one thing.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 align:middle line:84%
And then once you've
identified that one thing,

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:84%
give it a number on
a scale of 0 to 10.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.480 align:middle line:84%
So to do the process,
you can close your eyes

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.470 align:middle line:90%
if it's safe to do so.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.210 align:middle line:90%
You can tune into your body.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And you go, you
know, I'm anxious.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.310 align:middle line:90%
And I feel it in my chest.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's about a
presentation that I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.480 align:middle line:90%
have coming up on Friday.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.394 align:middle line:90%
And it's a seven.

00:01:03.394 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:84%
When I think about it,
just give it a number.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.660 align:middle line:90%
I'm uncomfortable.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.910 align:middle line:90%
It's a seven.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.610 align:middle line:84%
So now we have our target,
what we're going to tap on.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.213 align:middle line:90%
And we have our number.

00:01:12.213 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And then we start by
tapping on the side

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.040 align:middle line:84%
of the hand, the karate
chop point, whatever

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.870 align:middle line:90%
hand feels comfortable for you.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:84%
And you can tap with
eyes open or closed.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use
general language.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And you can just repeat after
me in your mind or out loud.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.610 align:middle line:84%
So tapping on the
side of the hand.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.490 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have all
this stress in my body,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.143 align:middle line:84%
I choose to relax
and feel safe now.

00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:42.060 align:middle line:84%
We're going to do that
two more times, staying

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:90%
on the side of the hand.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Even though I feel
all of this stress,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.825 align:middle line:84%
I choose to relax
and feel safe now.

00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Now, one more time, still
on the side of the hand.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.893 align:middle line:84%
Even though I have all
this stress, all is well.

00:02:04.893 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, we'll tap
through the points.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.370 align:middle line:84%
The first point is
the eyebrow point.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.242 align:middle line:84%
Right on the inside
of the eyebrow where

00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:11.700 align:middle line:84%
the hair ends and
it meets the nose

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.220 align:middle line:84%
you can tap with two fingers
of one hand, the other hand,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.030 align:middle line:90%
or both hands.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.700 align:middle line:84%
The meridians run down
both sides of the body.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And you're just tapping gently.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I want you to think about
what your thing was.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.960 align:middle line:84%
So if you have pain,
tune into the pain.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.350 align:middle line:84%
If you're anxious, think of the
thoughts that make you anxious.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.840 align:middle line:84%
If you're angry,
what did they say?

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:90%
What did they do?

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.250 align:middle line:84%
Tuning into that
thought pattern.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:84%
And then we move to
the side of the eye.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.440 align:middle line:90%
It's not at the temple.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.640 align:middle line:90%
Right next to the eye.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
On the bone again, one
side, or both sides.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.330 align:middle line:84%
Tapping gently, breathing
gently, and tuning in.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.380 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle line:90%
What are you angry about?

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.820 align:middle line:90%
What is stressing you out?

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.935 align:middle line:84%
Under the eye,
right on the bone.

00:02:53.935 --> 00:02:56.810 align:middle line:90%


00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.593 align:middle line:90%
Think the thoughts again.

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:02.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you're focusing on the
points or your mind wanders,

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.810 align:middle line:90%
that's OK.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Just bring it back to the
thing that you are working on.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:90%
Is there pain in your body?

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Are you anxious?

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.150 align:middle line:90%
Are you angry?

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Are you overwhelmed?

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:90%
Now, under the nose.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.660 align:middle line:84%
As you think about this
thing you're working on,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.640 align:middle line:84%
see if you can localize
it in your body.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel anxiety
in your chest,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.040 align:middle line:84%
a rumbling in your stomach,
or tension in your shoulders?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Tuning in.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:90%
Tapping gently.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.850 align:middle line:90%
Now, under the mouth.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.840 align:middle line:90%
Above the chin.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Below the lip in that
little crease there.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.890 align:middle line:90%
Tapping gently.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.948 align:middle line:90%
Thinking the thoughts.

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:36.990 align:middle line:90%
What are you angry about?

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.115 align:middle line:90%
What are you anxious about?

00:03:38.115 --> 00:03:39.780 align:middle line:90%
Give it a voice.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.780 align:middle line:84%
You can speak it out loud
if it's safe to do so.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.480 align:middle line:84%
You can say, I'm so angry
about what they said.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:90%
Be present to what's in the way.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:90%
Be present to this stress.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.310 align:middle line:84%
Three points left for
the collarbone point.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.643 align:middle line:84%
Just right below the two
little bones of the collarbone,

00:03:56.643 --> 00:03:59.290 align:middle line:84%
you can tap with 10
fingers, both hands,

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.165 align:middle line:84%
focusing on the
issue, tapping gently.

00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Tuning into the stress,
the anxiety, the anger,

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.040 align:middle line:90%
the overwhelm.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Underneath the arm, three
inches underneath the armpit.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.230 align:middle line:90%
Right on the bra line for women.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.430 align:middle line:90%
Tapping gently.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:90%
Thinking the thoughts.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.240 align:middle line:84%
If there's a movie,
play it in your mind.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.260 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.060 align:middle line:90%
Last point.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.280 align:middle line:90%
Top of the head.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:90%
Tapping gently.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.920 align:middle line:90%
Tuning in.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.275 align:middle line:90%


00:04:29.275 --> 00:04:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll do
one more round.

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.858 align:middle line:90%
We'll go back to the eyebrow.

00:04:31.858 --> 00:04:34.470 align:middle line:84%
And repeat after me in
your mind or out loud.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.255 align:middle line:84%
It's safe to feel
these feelings.

00:04:36.255 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Side of the eye.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's safe to let them go.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.170 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:90%
Under the eye.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.200 align:middle line:84%
Releasing all this
stress in my body.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.980 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Under the nose.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.425 align:middle line:90%
Feeling calm and relaxed.

00:04:55.425 --> 00:05:00.030 align:middle line:90%


00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.020 align:middle line:90%
Under the mouth.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.830 align:middle line:90%
Letting go.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.770 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Collarbone.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.100 align:middle line:90%
From every cell in my body.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:90%
Under the arm.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.430 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.520 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:90%
Top of the head.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:18.440 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can gently stop
tapping and take a breath in,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.932 align:middle line:90%
and let it go.

00:05:27.932 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:90%
So that was two quick rounds.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.440 align:middle line:90%
And now we just tune back in.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.810 align:middle line:84%
So you go, OK, I was
anxious about this.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Let me think about it again.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:90%
It was a seven.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a six,
a five, or a four.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And we also pay attention to
what happened in that process.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:90%
So we begin to connect the dots.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.083 align:middle line:90%
That's the exploration process.

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:46.500 align:middle line:84%
These are the
things in our lives.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.850 align:middle line:90%
These are the connections.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.940 align:middle line:84%
This is the exploration that
we do with tapping, to go,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.837 align:middle line:84%
what is really
happening in our lives?

00:05:52.837 --> 00:05:53.670 align:middle line:90%
Cause we don't know.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.870 align:middle line:90%
We think we know.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.703 align:middle line:84%
And that's one of the
challenges that we go,

00:05:56.703 --> 00:05:59.100 align:middle line:84%
well, I have sciatica pain,
because I went for a run.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.270 align:middle line:90%
And it just acted up.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's just the way it is.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.670 align:middle line:90%
I have sciatica pain.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we explore this work
stress, and the pain goes away.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's an opportunity,
especially when

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:84%
the body and the brain is
relaxed, when you begin to let

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.220 align:middle line:84%
go of that anxiety,
that anger, that pain.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.350 align:middle line:84%
Then we can begin to open up
the brain for that healing, that

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.150 align:middle line:90%
thought of healing.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.108 align:middle line:90%
And these are emotions.

00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:21.600 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
practice these things.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.400 align:middle line:84%
If we haven't felt
hope in a long time,

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.282 align:middle line:84%
if we haven't felt
happiness or joy,

00:06:25.282 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that
I love doing, especially

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.060 align:middle line:84%
as we go deeper in
tapping meditations

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:90%
is practice joy right now.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.240 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel
like to feel joy?

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.990 align:middle line:84%
And as you do the
tapping, create that joy.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.220 align:middle line:84%
We think that joy just
happens spontaneously.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.390 align:middle line:84%
But if it's not an experience
that we've had often,

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.000 align:middle line:84%
if it's not a chemical
pathway that we're used

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:90%
to having, we got to practice.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:90%
What would it feel like?

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.140 align:middle line:90%
It seems so silly.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.940 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.900 align:middle line:84%
It feels like this
is the basics.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.510 align:middle line:84%
But this is the basics of life
that we haven't been taught.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.530 align:middle line:84%
If you want to experience
joy in your life,

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.680 align:middle line:84%
let go of that anger, the
anxiety, the overwhelm,

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.660 align:middle line:84%
and then close your
eyes and imagine,

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.137 align:middle line:84%
what would it feel
like to be joyful?

00:07:03.137 --> 00:07:04.720 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel
like to be hopeful?

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.570 align:middle line:84%
What would it feel
like to feel love?

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.820 align:middle line:84%
For a lot of people
whose hearts are closed,

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.810 align:middle line:84%
if I say close your eyes
and feel love, they go, no.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.940 align:middle line:90%
My heart is closed.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.080 align:middle line:90%
I've been hurt.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.010 align:middle line:84%
I have felt so much
pain in my life.

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.260 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to feel this.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.590 align:middle line:84%
But if we first
acknowledge that pain,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.750 align:middle line:84%
if the body begins to feel
that it's safe, and then I go,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.230 align:middle line:84%
all right, imagine
if you could feel

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.700 align:middle line:90%
love, what would it feel like?

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:84%
And people start going,
OK, I get a little bit.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.290 align:middle line:90%
And then we start slowly.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.250 align:middle line:90%
We're like kids.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.490 align:middle line:84%
We really are emotional
children in a lot of ways.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:42.385 align:middle line:84%
I'm still learning every day
about these glorious bodies,

00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:44.010 align:middle line:84%
our brains, and how
they work together,

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
and how to effect
transformation in people.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.380 align:middle line:84%
I think we're just at the
beginning of a lot of learning.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
And we've got to practice
these things, practice love,

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.790 align:middle line:90%
and practice joy.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:56.540 align:middle line:10%
