00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I describe meditation as
paying undistractible attention

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.980 align:middle line:90%
to reality--

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.480 align:middle line:84%
capital R, not
passing phenomena.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.610 align:middle line:84%
And so you establish your
intention to wake up,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.910 align:middle line:84%
to expand your awareness
to who and what you are.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.960 align:middle line:84%
And so the moment
of meditation is

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%
when you have that moment
of connectedness to life

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.400 align:middle line:84%
and you learn how to pay
undistractible attention to it.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
all manner of debris--

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.610 align:middle line:84%
thought forms, whatever may
be flowing through your mind--

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.570 align:middle line:84%
but you're learning to have
dominion over your attention,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.000 align:middle line:84%
so that as the
insight is occurring,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.370 align:middle line:84%
you're able to be
aware of it and have

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.960 align:middle line:84%
a level of
stabilization around it.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.690 align:middle line:90%
So that's meditation.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.099 align:middle line:84%
Now, there are many, let's
say, techniques of meditation.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But primarily, meditation
is about paying

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:84%
undistractible
attention to reality.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So you have
contemplative meditation.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.000 align:middle line:90%
You have existential meditation.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.190 align:middle line:90%
You have spiritual meditation.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Contemplative meditation
is when you read,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.490 align:middle line:84%
you read Rumi, you read Dr.
Howard Thurman, you read--

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.430 align:middle line:84%
and you contemplate it,
meditate it until you get--

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.330 align:middle line:84%
you distill the
truths out of it.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It becomes a part of
you, ooh, you know?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.440 align:middle line:84%
And then there's existential
meditation, where

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.900 align:middle line:90%
you meditate on your existence.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.810 align:middle line:90%
Who am I?

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:90%
You know, the W's--

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:84%
who am I, why am I, where
am I, when am I, you know,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:84%
until you start to be
taught not just to believe,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
but you start to have
an insight, who am I?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm an emanation
of the great what?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.030 align:middle line:90%
What am I?

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm a unique expression
of the holy presence.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800 align:middle line:90%
Why am I?

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.560 align:middle line:84%
To reflect and to
reveal this presence,

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.820 align:middle line:90%
according to my uniqueness.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.900 align:middle line:90%
When am I?

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.900 align:middle line:90%
Right now.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.937 align:middle line:90%
You know, so that's existential.

00:02:08.937 --> 00:02:10.729 align:middle line:84%
And the spiritual
meditation is when you're

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.630 align:middle line:90%
meditating simply to wake up.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.765 align:middle line:84%
You know, you're establishing
your intention to wake up,

00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:19.640 align:middle line:84%
to have a greater
realization of your oneness

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.780 align:middle line:84%
with life, whether you call
life "god" or "the presence"

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.850 align:middle line:90%
or "love" or "intelligence."

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.110 align:middle line:84%
But whatever the technique
is, it's fundamental.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:90%
It's fundamental.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And then affirmative prayer
is not begging or beseeching.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.440 align:middle line:84%
You're actually praying to
have a realization of what

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.790 align:middle line:90%
you're praying for.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.620 align:middle line:90%
You already have it.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:46.810 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:84%
So we enter into a
state of gratitude.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we begin to recognize
the presence that's everywhere.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.000 align:middle line:84%
We begin to feel our
unity with this presence.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And then we proclaim
or declare what

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.500 align:middle line:84%
is so, whether it's about
our abundance or our health.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.960 align:middle line:84%
We give thanks that
it's already done,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.580 align:middle line:90%
and we release it into the law.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.122 align:middle line:90%
It becomes our new law of being.

00:03:12.122 --> 00:03:14.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, of course I went through
those stages very fast.

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:84%
But the individual
would sit and actually

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.880 align:middle line:90%
pray to have that awareness.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.950 align:middle line:84%
There's the life
visioning process,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.520 align:middle line:84%
the process by which we use to
bring agape into incarnation.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.710 align:middle line:84%
Nonprofits and corporations
and individuals

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.560 align:middle line:84%
use the life visioning
process all around the world

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.840 align:middle line:84%
to actually get a sense of,
what is it within us that's

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:90%
trying to come forward?

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.960 align:middle line:84%
It's different
from visualization.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:84%
Visualization is
a good practice.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.630 align:middle line:84%
It's an entry-level practice
of seeing what you want,

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:84%
feeling it, declaring
it, articulating it,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.230 align:middle line:84%
coming into a resonance
with it until it manifests.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.350 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, people
are visualizing things

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.345 align:middle line:84%
that society told them they
should want to be happy.

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Assuming they get it,
they're not happy.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.820 align:middle line:90%
So visioning is different.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Visioning is an
awareness that there's

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
something intrinsic
within you that no one

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:90%
else has the way you have it.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.350 align:middle line:84%
And so you're-- going back to
empowering questions, you know,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.600 align:middle line:84%
you're able to ask,
what is the vision?

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.570 align:middle line:84%
And you sit until
you're able to feel

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.880 align:middle line:90%
it or hear it or articulate it.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
You ask, what is it
that I need to become

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.620 align:middle line:90%
to manifest this vision?

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:90%
That's growing edge.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.030 align:middle line:84%
How do I-- where do I
need to grow in my life?

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:84%
What do I already have that can
be in service to the vision?

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.470 align:middle line:84%
What do I need to let go
of that no longer serves

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.233 align:middle line:84%
my moving forward, to tap
into a sense of willingness?

00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:84%
This is all a part
of the life visioning

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.690 align:middle line:84%
process, which is saying, in
substance, you take an avocado

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:90%
seed.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.920 align:middle line:84%
The avocado seed can't become
a daffodil, a magnolia.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.670 align:middle line:84%
What's intrinsic to the avocado
seed is an avocado tree.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.550 align:middle line:84%
So there's something within
us that's intrinsic within us.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And we ask until we begin
to see, what is my gift?

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.750 align:middle line:90%
What is my passion?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.220 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.370 align:middle line:90%
And we walk in that direction.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.360 align:middle line:84%
So life visioning
is very important.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.875 align:middle line:84%
You want to develop a
practice of high conversation.

00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
talk about what

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.440 align:middle line:90%
you don't want to experience.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.820 align:middle line:90%
So that eliminates gossip.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.770 align:middle line:84%
It eliminates
complaining, you see?

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to
have conversations

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.930 align:middle line:84%
with high-minded people
about vision and possibility,

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.180 align:middle line:90%
or you be quiet, you know?

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.050 align:middle line:84%
You don't get caught in the
rough-and-tumble nastiness

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.660 align:middle line:84%
that human beings get caught
up in talking about each other,

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.820 align:middle line:84%
putting people down, or tearing
people apart, or passing rumors

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.800 align:middle line:90%
along.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.810 align:middle line:84%
That dirt is going to
get on the person that's

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:90%
doing that, you see?

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And so there's
right conversation.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:08.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's all manner of
spiritual practice, you see?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
Affirmation and
declaration, and it's

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:84%
all a part of honing
our attention so we're

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.620 align:middle line:84%
able to see better, so
we're not just seeing life

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
through the filters that we've
inherited from the imprints,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.020 align:middle line:84%
but we're starting
to see life as it is.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:90%
It's pristine.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:27.480 align:middle line:90%
It's beautiful.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.280 align:middle line:90%
It's luminous.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.320 align:middle line:84%
It's full of infinite
possibilities,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.660 align:middle line:90%
infinite opportunities.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.410 align:middle line:84%
We can just see
it the way it is.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And then we walk
in that direction.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:90%
Things appear.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.310 align:middle line:90%
Opportunities show up.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Doors open.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:84%
We meet the right people
at the right time,

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:50.130 align:middle line:90%
the divine conspiracy.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:90%
We become a part of it.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.610 align:middle line:10%
