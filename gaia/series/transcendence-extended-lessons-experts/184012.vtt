00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.120 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are 10 keys for
unlocking your full potential.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.010 align:middle line:90%
Number 1 is a good diet.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.060 align:middle line:90%
You are what you eat.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Literally what you
eat becomes you.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.820 align:middle line:84%
So eat the best
brain foods ever.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Number 2 is killing ANTs.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.280 align:middle line:84%
Killing ANTs is actually
clinically proven

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.620 align:middle line:90%
to unlock your potential.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.900 align:middle line:84%
ANTs stands for Automatic
Negative Thoughts.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the truth is yes,
you are what you eat,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.323 align:middle line:90%
but you also are your thoughts.

00:00:29.323 --> 00:00:30.865 align:middle line:84%
And so you want to
keep them positive

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:32.448 align:middle line:84%
and you want to keep
them encouraging.

00:00:32.448 --> 00:00:34.570 align:middle line:84%
There are studies that
suggest that pessimists

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.120 align:middle line:84%
are more accurate,
they're right more often,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.030 align:middle line:84%
but optimists
achieve a lot more.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.830 align:middle line:90%
And think about it.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.210 align:middle line:84%
Because pessimists are
really risk adverse

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.250 align:middle line:84%
so they play it
safe and so they're

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.320 align:middle line:84%
not getting as much
done and accomplished,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:84%
but optimists are
taking more risks.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:84%
And with those
risks come rewards.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.650 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes to getting
rid of negative thoughts, what

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.840 align:middle line:84%
I would tell people is
this, is remember magic.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.860 align:middle line:90%
Use your magic.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.280 align:middle line:84%
ABRA-- A-B-R-A.
Remember Abracadabra?

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Abracadabra is all about taking
words and changing things

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.060 align:middle line:90%
with transformational words.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.352 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a negative
talk, negative self talk,

00:01:07.352 --> 00:01:09.310 align:middle line:84%
and negative limiting
belief, what I want to do

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.720 align:middle line:90%
are four simple things.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.145 align:middle line:90%
The A in ABRA says Acknowledge.

00:01:13.145 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:90%
You acknowledge that.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So maybe you say something like,
oh, you know, I'm just too old

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.470 align:middle line:90%
or, oh, I'm just--

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.252 align:middle line:84%
this doesn't run in
my family or, oh, I'm

00:01:22.252 --> 00:01:24.460 align:middle line:84%
just not smart enough or
good enough, acknowledge it.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Don't resist it.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.330 align:middle line:84%
Because if you fight it,
what you resist persists.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.640 align:middle line:90%
So just acknowledge it.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.580 align:middle line:84%
The B in ABRA
stands for Breathe.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:90%
It stands for Breath.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.413 align:middle line:84%
Because what you do
is you breathe in--

00:01:36.413 --> 00:01:38.080 align:middle line:84%
and when I'm breathing,
I'm visualizing.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.955 align:middle line:84%
We're talking about
breath and visualization.

00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:41.570 align:middle line:90%
I breathe in potential.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:90%
I breathe in intelligence.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:90%
I breathe in limitless.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.190 align:middle line:84%
And I breathe into
the place in my body,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.210 align:middle line:84%
whether it's pain I'm suffering
from or struggling with

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:84%
or an idea in my mind, I
breathe into that space.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And then the R in
ABRA is I Release.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.500 align:middle line:90%
I release.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:84%
I release that
negative thought, that

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.860 align:middle line:90%
automatic negative thought.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.330 align:middle line:90%
I release that pain.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.400 align:middle line:90%
I release limits out.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the last A
in ABRA stands for Align.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Align.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.800 align:middle line:90%
I reset.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.000 align:middle line:90%
I do zero base.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Like, what's the opposite
of what I was feeling,

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:84%
or what's the opposite of
what I was saying to myself?

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.690 align:middle line:84%
What's my true
fullest potential?

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.805 align:middle line:84%
And I align more
to my true nature.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.680 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you could
do to be able to lock

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.930 align:middle line:84%
your full potential
is exercise, right?

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So exercise, really
good for the brain.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.980 align:middle line:84%
As your body moves,
your brain grooves.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.010 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't know
this, but the primary function

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.913 align:middle line:84%
of our brain is to
control our movement.

00:02:32.913 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And here's what
the latest science

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.208 align:middle line:84%
is saying-- is just
there's not only

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:37.750 align:middle line:84%
just a brain-body
connection, there's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:90%
a body-brain connection.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.010 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is we're so
sedentary all the time, right?

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.810 align:middle line:84%
We live a very
sedentary culture.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
They say sitting
is the new smoking.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And I encourage people
to take brain breaks.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.980 align:middle line:84%
The Pomodoro Technique
says that our focus,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.440 align:middle line:84%
we can only maintain high
focus for about 25 minutes.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.833 align:middle line:84%
After that, there's
a sharp decline.

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:57.250 align:middle line:84%
And so what I do
is I set an alarm

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.228 align:middle line:84%
to go off every 25 to 30
minutes, maybe an hour tops.

00:03:00.228 --> 00:03:02.020 align:middle line:84%
And then what I do is
I take a little brain

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.340 align:middle line:84%
break, a 5-minute brain
break, to do three things.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.410 align:middle line:90%
Number 1, I hydrate.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:90%
Number 2, I do deep breathing.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.180 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
I do is I move.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.378 align:middle line:84%
As your body moves,
your brain grooves.

00:03:13.378 --> 00:03:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Another thing you could do
that maximize your potential

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.562 align:middle line:84%
are supplements,
nutrients, especially when

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:18.520 align:middle line:90%
it comes to your brain.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.880 align:middle line:90%
You could do all the techniques.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.927 align:middle line:84%
But if you're deficient in
DHAs, omegas, your B vitamins,

00:03:23.927 --> 00:03:25.510 align:middle line:84%
it's going to affect
your performance.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.950 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not
getting the best diet,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.850 align:middle line:90%
you could supplement.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.310 align:middle line:84%
Number 5 is a
positive peer group.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
Positive peer group is
really key to living

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.260 align:middle line:84%
your full potential because you
are who you spend time with.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Literally who you spend
time with is who you become.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.478 align:middle line:84%
After that, I would say
a clean environment.

00:03:40.478 --> 00:03:42.520 align:middle line:84%
A clean environment's
really good for your brain,

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.320 align:middle line:84%
for you living your
fullest potential,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.400 align:middle line:90%
because-- you know this.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.470 align:middle line:84%
If you ever clean your
desk or your laptop,

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.790 align:middle line:90%
don't you have more sharpness?

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.710 align:middle line:84%
Don't you have
clarity of thought?

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.960 align:middle line:84%
So a clean environment
is reflective of clarity

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.830 align:middle line:90%
of thought.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.420 align:middle line:90%
Number 7 is sleep.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.880 align:middle line:84%
You need sleep, especially
for your mental performance

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.810 align:middle line:90%
for two reasons.

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Number 1, it's where
you consolidate

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.540 align:middle line:90%
short to long-term memory.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.340 align:middle line:90%
That's really key.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.215 align:middle line:84%
You need to consolidate
short to long memory.

00:04:04.215 --> 00:04:05.470 align:middle line:90%
That happens when you sleep.

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Number 2, though, is where
you're cleaning out the plaque

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.990 align:middle line:84%
that leads to dementia
and Alzheimer's.

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.490 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when you sleep is
when you're actually doing that.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
reason, a bonus reason,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.610 align:middle line:90%
is it's when you dream.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.550 align:middle line:84%
The eighth key, another key to
unlocking your full potential,

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:90%
is to protect your brain.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean?

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.635 align:middle line:90%
Wear a helmet.

00:04:21.635 --> 00:04:23.260 align:middle line:84%
Your brain-- note,
coming from somebody

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.140 align:middle line:84%
who's had many traumatic brain
injuries falling off roofs,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.720 align:middle line:84%
headfirst into radiators,
your brain is resilient,

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.130 align:middle line:90%
but it's also very fragile.

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.190 align:middle line:84%
So with you and your kids,
avoid the extreme sports,

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.320 align:middle line:84%
wear a helmet, you know,
wear your seat belt--

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:84%
all those things to
protect your brain.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.090 align:middle line:84%
And the next key for unlocking
your full mental potential

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.260 align:middle line:90%
is new learnings.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Commit yourself to
lifelong learnings.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.970 align:middle line:84%
There was a study done
on [? supernuns. ?]

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.680 align:middle line:84%
It was on the cover
of "Time" magazine.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.360 align:middle line:84%
And they wanted to find out how
these women were living 80, 90,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.478 align:middle line:90%
and above in age.

00:04:50.478 --> 00:04:53.020 align:middle line:84%
And they found out half of it
had to do with their gratitude,

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.700 align:middle line:84%
going back to
gratitude and faith.

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.070 align:middle line:84%
The other half, though,
had to do with they

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.520 align:middle line:90%
were lifelong learners.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.460 align:middle line:84%
They were committed
to lifelong learning,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.225 align:middle line:90%
learning every single day.

00:05:02.225 --> 00:05:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Because we've discovered
more about the human brain

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.110 align:middle line:84%
more in the past 20 years
than the previous 2,000 years.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.000 align:middle line:84%
And with studies
done on neurogenesis

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.490 align:middle line:84%
and neuroplasticity,
neurogenesis says--

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
"neuro" meaning the
brain, "genesis" meaning

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.930 align:middle line:84%
birth-- you could give birth
to new brain cells to the day

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:16.940 align:middle line:90%
you die.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
Neuroplasticity-- this
is really exciting-- says

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:84%
that your brain is like
plastic in a positive way,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.300 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's very malleable,
that having a new thought

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.660 align:middle line:90%
creates new connections.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.560 align:middle line:84%
So for example, Einstein's brain
wasn't any bigger than anybody

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.360 align:middle line:90%
else's.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:90%
If anything, it's smaller.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.760 align:middle line:84%
But there are certain
parts of his brain

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.520 align:middle line:84%
that are extremely
dense because he

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.740 align:middle line:84%
wired his brain through
his, what he called, thought

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.540 align:middle line:90%
experiments.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:40.897 align:middle line:84%
He would visualize himself
riding a beam of light,

00:05:40.897 --> 00:05:43.230 align:middle line:84%
looking at something and
wondering what that thing would

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:44.767 align:middle line:90%
look like going at light speed.

00:05:44.767 --> 00:05:46.350 align:middle line:84%
He would do these
thought experiments.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
He's the one that
said, "Imagination is

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.190 align:middle line:90%
more powerful than knowledge."

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.650 align:middle line:84%
Because knowledge is
what is, but imagination

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.420 align:middle line:90%
is what things could be.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.190 align:middle line:84%
So commit yourself
to lifelong learning.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And what stimulates neurogenesis
and neuroplasticity,

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:90%
two things--

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.610 align:middle line:90%
novelty and nutrition.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.133 align:middle line:90%
Novelty and nutrition.

00:06:04.133 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:84%
It's just like if you want to
build your physical muscles.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.675 align:middle line:84%
If you want to build a
muscle, you give it novelty,

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.790 align:middle line:84%
or you work it out,
you give it exercise.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you give it
nutrients to feed it.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Same thing with your
mental muscles--

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.900 align:middle line:84%
give it novelty, new
things, and then give it

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.760 align:middle line:84%
the nutrients it
needs to develop.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the last
key for unlocking

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.100 align:middle line:84%
your full mental potential
is stress management.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is a huge one,
because a lot of people--

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.760 align:middle line:84%
because we live in
such stressed lives.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.560 align:middle line:90%
We're like fish.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.602 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the water
because we're in the water

00:06:30.602 --> 00:06:33.780 align:middle line:84%
all the time, and we are living
in that sympathetic state.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:84%
And it's so important for
your brain to down regulate,

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.880 align:middle line:84%
to spend time in those
parasympathetic places

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.885 align:middle line:84%
where you rest and you
recover and you restore.

00:06:41.885 --> 00:06:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of
stress management,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.180 align:middle line:84%
what kind of
practices do we have?

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.860 align:middle line:90%
Whether it's massage, whether--

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.570 align:middle line:90%
for me, it's meditation.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is a
very powerful way.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.920 align:middle line:84%
When you meditate, you go
into this brainwave state

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.030 align:middle line:90%
called alpha.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.187 align:middle line:84%
Alpha state is the state
of a relaxed awareness.

00:06:57.187 --> 00:06:59.520 align:middle line:84%
And relaxed awareness is where
you could train yourself,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.350 align:middle line:84%
actually, to learn
a language faster,

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.170 align:middle line:84%
to be able to learn rapidly,
because your conscious mind is

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.290 align:middle line:84%
actually set aside and you
just absorb information faster.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:10.530 align:middle line:84%
You know what puts you
into an alpha state is TV--

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.490 align:middle line:90%
television.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:13.680 align:middle line:84%
They call it television
programming for a reason.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.347 align:middle line:84%
And you know this
because if you've ever

00:07:15.347 --> 00:07:18.457 align:middle line:84%
seen somebody so enthralled with
a TV show or a sporting event

00:07:18.457 --> 00:07:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and you're trying to talk to
them or have a conversation

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:21.990 align:middle line:90%
and they're just entranced--

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
literally they don't
hear you-- it's

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:25.140 align:middle line:84%
because their conscious
mind is set aside

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.265 align:middle line:84%
and they're just absorbing
what's in front of them.

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:84%
And there are many ways to get
into an alpha state by design.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.850 align:middle line:84%
And I would recommend use
all three learning styles--

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle line:84%
visual, auditory,
and kinesthetic.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.520 align:middle line:84%
So when you visualize things and
you exercise your imagination,

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.480 align:middle line:84%
it actually puts you
into an alpha state,

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:90%
a relaxed state of awareness.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.860 align:middle line:84%
And even if you can't
imagine something

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:84%
when you're imagining,
just imagine

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:90%
you can imagine it, right?

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.650 align:middle line:90%
The auditory part is music.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.600 align:middle line:84%
Certain sounds
like nature sounds

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.370 align:middle line:84%
will put you into
an alpha state.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.920 align:middle line:84%
Certain sounds like
classical music, especially

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Baroque classical music--

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.410 align:middle line:84%
Vivaldi, Handel, because
it's 60 beats per minute

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and it harmonizes with
the resting heart rate.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.910 align:middle line:84%
So 60 beats per
minute Baroque music

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:08.400 align:middle line:84%
will help put you into a
meditative alpha state.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And finally visual
auditory kinesthetic.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.320 align:middle line:84%
Kinesthetic, I would
say deep breathing.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.133 align:middle line:84%
Deep, diaphragmic,
conscious breathing.

00:08:16.133 --> 00:08:18.300 align:middle line:84%
And even when you're not
meditating, a lot of people

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.177 align:middle line:90%
have bad posture.

00:08:19.177 --> 00:08:21.510 align:middle line:84%
And when they're reading
something and they're studying,

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:22.830 align:middle line:84%
you can't live
your full potential

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.300 align:middle line:84%
if you're crouched
down like this.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
have poor posture,

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.570 align:middle line:90%
you collapse your lungs, right?

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And the lower 1/3 of your lungs
absorbs 2/3 of the oxygen.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.530 align:middle line:84%
And what's most important is
that oxygen gets to your brain.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.380 align:middle line:84%
So if you suffer from
mental fatigue or brain fog,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
the number one
thing you could do

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.010 align:middle line:84%
is do deep
diaphragmatic breathing.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:90%
