00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:06.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.560 align:middle line:84%
>> The simpler the food, the
healthier the food for you.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Convenience foods and
convenience packaging

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.450 align:middle line:90%
are useful at times.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.230 align:middle line:84%
But living a life of convenience
food just sets us up.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.560 align:middle line:84%
It sets us up to have
dysfunction wherever

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.930 align:middle line:90%
the weak link in our chain is.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.420 align:middle line:84%
Here's the way to
get the big picture

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.970 align:middle line:90%
about intestinal permeability.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.430 align:middle line:90%
Permeability is not bad for you.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.040 align:middle line:84%
It's how we absorb our
vitamins and minerals.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.030 align:middle line:84%
It's excessive permeability
that's bad for you.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.650 align:middle line:84%
Intestinal
permeability is normal.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Excessive intestinal
permeability is abnormal.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.290 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.090 align:middle line:90%
Your intestines are a tube.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.220 align:middle line:90%
The tube is 20, 25 feet long.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:84%
Starts at the mouth,
goes to the other end.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.000 align:middle line:84%
Kind of winds around
in the abdomen,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.560 align:middle line:90%
twists around in there.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.960 align:middle line:84%
The inside-- if you think of
your intestines like a donut,

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.173 align:middle line:84%
and if you could just
stretch the donut out,

00:01:03.173 --> 00:01:04.840 align:middle line:84%
and you look down the
hole of the donut,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.330 align:middle line:90%
it's one big long donut, right?

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.960 align:middle line:90%
It's one big long tube.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.410 align:middle line:84%
So when we eat food,
it's not yet in our body.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.460 align:middle line:90%
It's in the donut.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's got to go through
the walls of the donut

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:84%
to get into the bloodstream
so we can use the vitamins

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.750 align:middle line:84%
and minerals to make new
brain cells, and muscle cells,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.500 align:middle line:84%
The inside of the tube is
lined with shag carpeting,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.360 align:middle line:90%
big thick shags of carpeting.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.810 align:middle line:84%
They're called the villi
and the microvilli.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
The microvilli are coated
with a cheese cloth.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And our grandmothers
used to pour gravy

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
into a cheesecloth and the
liquid would come through.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.280 align:middle line:84%
And the clumps of flour and
stuff that didn't break down

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:84%
would stay on the
other side so the gravy

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:84%
was very smooth to pour on
the pot roast and everything.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.282 align:middle line:90%
That's cheesecloth.

00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Our shags in the intestines
have cheesecloth.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:84%
That's why your intestines
are 20 to 25 feet long.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.169 align:middle line:84%
One reason is because some
foods break down really quickly.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.690 align:middle line:84%
Other foods take a long
time to break down.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:84%
They have to go further
down the intestines.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Proteins are like
a pearl necklace.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Hydrochloric acid
made in your stomach

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.710 align:middle line:84%
undoes the clasp of
the pearl necklace.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.810 align:middle line:90%
Now you have a string of pearls.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Our enzymes act as
scissors to break off

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.450 align:middle line:84%
each pearl of the
pearl necklace.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.130 align:middle line:90%
They're called amino acids.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.840 align:middle line:84%
They're really
tiny little pearls.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And they go right
through the cheesecloth

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.130 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Bigger clumps of pearls can't
get through the cheesecloth.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:84%
They have to go further
down the intestines

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.550 align:middle line:84%
to be broken down small enough
to get through the cheesecloth

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.180 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.690 align:middle line:84%
That's how we absorb our
vitamins, our minerals,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.990 align:middle line:84%
our proteins, our fats is that
they get broken down, broken

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.450 align:middle line:84%
down, broken down, until
they're small enough to go right

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.630 align:middle line:90%
through the cheesecloth.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
humans eat wheat?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.380 align:middle line:84%
Every human that eats
wheat, not just the celiacs,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.970 align:middle line:84%
but every human that
eats wheat, it's

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.190 align:middle line:84%
tears in the cheesecloth every
time they're exposed to wheat.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.600 align:middle line:84%
But we have an entire new
body every seven years, right?

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:84%
Some cells turn
over very quickly,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.470 align:middle line:84%
like the inside
lining of the gut.

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Every three to seven days
you have a whole new lining

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.550 align:middle line:90%
to your gut.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:90%
It's like the skin of a snake.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:90%
Just kind of sheds right off.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.810 align:middle line:84%
And some cells, like
your bone cells,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:90%
are very slow to rebuild.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.550 align:middle line:84%
So every seven years
you have a new body.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.820 align:middle line:84%
So you eat wheat, you tear
the cheesecloth but it heals.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.948 align:middle line:84%
Fastest growing
cells in the body.

00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:40.240 align:middle line:90%
So you had toast for breakfast.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.960 align:middle line:90%
It heals.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.070 align:middle line:90%
You have a sandwich for lunch.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.910 align:middle line:90%
It heals.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Pasta for dinner, it heals.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.650 align:middle line:90%
Croutons on your salad.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.450 align:middle line:90%
It heals.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.250 align:middle line:90%
A cookie.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:84%
But it heals day
after week after month

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:84%
after year after year after
year until one day you

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:90%
don't heal anymore.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:84%
Now when you don't heal, you
get tears in the cheesecloth.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.930 align:middle line:84%
That's pathogenic
intestinal permeability.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Now what happens you've got
these pearl necklaces of food

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.230 align:middle line:84%
being clipped into
small pieces going down

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.345 align:middle line:84%
the tube of the intestines,
down the donut, all the way

00:04:11.345 --> 00:04:13.720 align:middle line:84%
until they're small enough to
go through the cheesecloth.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:84%
But now some of these
larger clumps of food

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
get through the tears
of the cheesecloth

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:90%
into the bloodstream.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.920 align:middle line:90%
They're not supposed to.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.640 align:middle line:84%
They're called
macromolecules, big molecules.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.280 align:middle line:84%
They're not supposed
to get through.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.013 align:middle line:84%
But tears in the
cheesecloth occur.

00:04:29.013 --> 00:04:30.430 align:middle line:84%
And these tears
in the cheesecloth

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.580 align:middle line:90%
can occur and stay torn.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:84%
When you lose tolerance,
you don't heal anymore

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.180 align:middle line:84%
when you're two years old,
22 years old, 72 years old.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.180 align:middle line:84%
It just depends on when you
cross that threshold as to when

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:90%
this happens.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:90%
But it happens for everyone.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.530 align:middle line:84%
So now you've got the tears in
cheesecloth that don't heal.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.890 align:middle line:84%
The macromolecules get
through into the bloodstream.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.800 align:middle line:84%
And your immune system
says, whoa, what's this?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:84%
This is not something
that's good for me.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.010 align:middle line:90%
I better fight this.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.890 align:middle line:84%
I can't make new brain cells
or new muscle cells out

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:90%
of this raw material.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.210 align:middle line:90%
I better fight this.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And now you make antibodies
to that macromolecule.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.240 align:middle line:84%
And if it was a tomato, now
you're sensitive to tomatoes,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
or now you're
sensitive to chicken,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.290 align:middle line:84%
or now you're sensitive
to beef, or to bananas.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.850 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:84%
If you get macromolecules
getting into the bloodstream,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
your immune system
trying to protect you

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:90%
says I got to fight this thing.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.760 align:middle line:90%
This is not good for me.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the person that
gets a 90 food IgG blood

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.200 align:middle line:90%
test done for sensitivities.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And it comes back, they're
sensitive to 20, 25 foods.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
They say, oh my god,
that's everything I eat.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it is.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.780 align:middle line:84%
Your immune system's
trying to protect you.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So you don't shut down
the immune system.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:84%
You stop throwing
gasoline on the fire

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.240 align:middle line:84%
and allow the tears in
the cheesecloth to heal.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.840 align:middle line:84%
Then six months to a year later,
you do the blood test again.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Now you're sensitive to
two foods, maybe three.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So you want to have a healthy
environment of your gut, that's

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:84%
called the microbiome,
because when

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.140 align:middle line:84%
you have a bad
environment, you tear

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.830 align:middle line:84%
the cheesecloth just because of
a bad environment in your gut.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:84%
So it's not only wheat
that tears the cheesecloth.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:90%
There are many, many things.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.800 align:middle line:84%
GMO foods will tear
the cheesecloth.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.070 align:middle line:84%
The glyphosate and the
inert ingredients in Roundup

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.600 align:middle line:90%
will tear the cheesecloth.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.370 align:middle line:84%
Chlorine will tear
the cheesecloth.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
different compounds

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.610 align:middle line:90%
that can tear the cheesecloth.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.320 align:middle line:84%
We just know for a fact that
all humans tear the cheesecloth

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.520 align:middle line:90%
when they eat wheat--

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.960 align:middle line:90%
every time they eat wheat.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.770 align:middle line:84%
So when you cross
that threshold and you

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.740 align:middle line:84%
can't compensate anymore
and heal the cheesecloth,

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:84%
then you get pathogenic
intestinal permeability.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.860 align:middle line:84%
Remember intestinal permeability
is normal but excessive

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.330 align:middle line:90%
permeability is not.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.480 align:middle line:84%
So now you get pathogenic
intestinal permeability.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:90%
It gets into your bloodstream.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Your body makes antibodies
to that food, whatever it is.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.300 align:middle line:84%
And then there's a mechanism
called crossreactivity.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So let's take the
example of wheat.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The most common clump
of the pearl necklace

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.750 align:middle line:84%
that your immune system
will make antibodies to

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.795 align:middle line:90%
is 33 amino acids long.

00:07:05.795 --> 00:07:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And every laboratory
in the world

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.230 align:middle line:84%
will check for that one to see
if you make antibodies to that.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:84%
There are many other clumps
of the pearl necklace.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.870 align:middle line:84%
But in most labs don't check
the others, which they should.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:84%
We know there are 62
different clumps of the pearl

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.910 align:middle line:84%
necklace in wheat that
have been identified

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.620 align:middle line:84%
that the immune
system may react to.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.480 align:middle line:84%
But every lab checks
for the big one, the 33.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.115 align:middle line:84%
So if you have antibodies to
that 33 amino acid peptide--

00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:33.270 align:middle line:90%
it's called a peptide.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to refer
to it as AABCD.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.488 align:middle line:84%
Now it's 33 letters long,
but let's just say AABCD.

00:07:39.488 --> 00:07:42.030 align:middle line:84%
So now you have the antibodies
going through your bloodstream

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:43.540 align:middle line:90%
looking for AABCD.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.340 align:middle line:90%
Over there.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:90%
Over there.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.920 align:middle line:84%
And they're firing
these chemical bullets

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.170 align:middle line:84%
to destroy this macromolecule
that's in your bloodstream.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
What our immunologists
tell us is

00:07:54.680 --> 00:08:00.830 align:middle line:84%
that it only takes eight amino
acids of the 33, only eight.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.430 align:middle line:84%
That sequence of the eight
amino acids of the 33

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.060 align:middle line:84%
that the antibodies
are being made to--

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.080 align:middle line:84%
when your blood's
going past the thyroid,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.250 align:middle line:84%
for example, the surface of the
thyroid facing the bloodstream

00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.870 align:middle line:90%
as the blood's going by--

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.540 align:middle line:84%
the surface of the thyroid
facing the bloodstream

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:90%
is made up of proteins and fats.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.190 align:middle line:84%
Proteins are made up of a
lot of amino acids, hundreds

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:90%
of amino acids.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.330 align:middle line:84%
Some of the amino acid
sequences in the surface

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:84%
of the thyroid facing the
bloodstream include AABCD--

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:90%
eight amino acids of AABCD.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.480 align:middle line:84%
So the antibodies
that are looking

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.120 align:middle line:84%
for the weak molecules
in your bloodstream

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.950 align:middle line:90%
see [INAUDIBLE] look over there.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.640 align:middle line:84%
And they fire a
chemical bullet at AABCD

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.040 align:middle line:84%
on the surface of your thyroid
facing the bloodstream.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.500 align:middle line:90%
That's called molecular mimicry.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.640 align:middle line:84%
When our antibodies to
wheat fire a chemical bullet

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.760 align:middle line:84%
at the thyroid in this
example, or your brain cells--

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
and the studies are very clear
on this stuff that it happens--

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:90%
or your brain cells--

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.460 align:middle line:84%
when it fires a chemical bullet,
it damages that thyroid cell.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.840 align:middle line:84%
Now the immune system
makes thyroid antibodies

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.220 align:middle line:84%
in general to clean up
the old thyroid cells.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.395 align:middle line:84%
So you get rid of
the old thyroid

00:09:15.395 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:84%
cells to make room
for new cells to grow.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why you have a
normal level of antibodies

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.215 align:middle line:84%
to your brain, and to your
thyroid, and your heart,

00:09:22.215 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:84%
because we're getting rid
of the old damaged cells,

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.070 align:middle line:84%
making room for
new cells to grow.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.403 align:middle line:90%
So kind of a wash out process. .

00:09:27.403 --> 00:09:28.203 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:28.203 --> 00:09:29.290 align:middle line:90%
That's normal.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.655 align:middle line:84%
But now you've got these
extra antibodies to AABCD

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:33.655 align:middle line:90%
going after the thyroid.

00:09:33.655 --> 00:09:36.340 align:middle line:90%


00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Now you make more
antibodies to your thyroid

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:40.490 align:middle line:84%
to get rid of these
extra damaged cells.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:41.290 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a problem except
you had toast for breakfast,

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.860 align:middle line:84%
a sandwich for lunch, pasta for
dinner, croutons on your salad.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.050 align:middle line:84%
There is gluten in
the makeup in lipstick

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
that you use, in your
shampoo, so you're

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.070 align:middle line:84%
getting exposure day
after day after week

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:56.320 align:middle line:84%
after month after year
after year after year.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:84%
And if the weak link in
your chain is your thyroid,

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.460 align:middle line:90%
it's going after your thyroid.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
The antibodies to wheat are
also going after your thyroid.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
You make more thyroid
antibodies to get rid

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.090 align:middle line:90%
of those damaged cells.

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's called a
self-perpetuating mechanism.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
At some point, it
continues on its own.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:17.530 align:middle line:84%
Now you develop Hashimoto's
autoimmune thyroid disease.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
That's why there are
so many studies that

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.570 align:middle line:84%
say when you get off of
wheat, your thyroid antibodies

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.380 align:middle line:90%
may go down.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the mechanism.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same
mechanism for the brain.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.720 align:middle line:84%
It's the same mechanism
for the heart.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.170 align:middle line:84%
That's why the studies I
referred to earlier, Mayo

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.870 align:middle line:84%
Clinic with cardiomyopathy
and irregular heartbeats,

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
get them off wheat and their
cardiomyopathy calms down

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and their heart starts
functioning better.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.790 align:middle line:84%
If we just wake up to this
and we start checking for it--

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:44.560 align:middle line:84%
remember body
language never lies.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.810 align:middle line:84%
You just have to learn
how to speak body.

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So you have to
have the laboratory

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.250 align:middle line:84%
tests that are
properly looking to see

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:90%
is this going on for you.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.850 align:middle line:84%
And if it's going on, OK, then
let's see why it's going on.

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
rid of the trigger,

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.560 align:middle line:90%
the gasoline on the fire.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.680 align:middle line:84%
And then many times, not
always but many times,

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.560 align:middle line:84%
the rheumatoid
arthritis calms down.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:90%
The psoriasis calms down.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:90%
The lupus calms down.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:90%
The migraines calm down.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
The attention deficit that
children suffer with calm down.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.910 align:middle line:84%
In the "Journal of Attention
Disorders" in 2006,

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.430 align:middle line:84%
they took 130 kids with gluten
sensitivity and attention

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.230 align:middle line:90%
deficit.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:84%
They put them on a
gluten free diet.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Every child or their
parents, all 130 of them

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:84%
or their parents,
reported significant--

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.040 align:middle line:90%
that's the big word--

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:40.780 align:middle line:84%
significant improvement in all
12 attention deficit markers.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Fails to pay attention,
interrupts frequently, blurts

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.640 align:middle line:90%
out answers, can't sit still.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Every marker improved
in every child

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.010 align:middle line:84%
within six months on
a wheat-free diet.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.810 align:middle line:84%
And there are a couple
of recommendations

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.660 align:middle line:84%
I do give to everyone
to do right now.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:84%
The first one is we have
health food stores here

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.030 align:middle line:90%
in the US called Whole Foods.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And they're in some
other countries also.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:05.470 align:middle line:84%
But they tend to
be healthier foods.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:06.570 align:middle line:90%
Go to Whole Foods.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Buy five different kinds
of fermented vegetables.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Just make sure they're
not pasteurized,

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:84%
because pasteurization
kills bacteria.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:17.140 align:middle line:84%
That you want the
fermented vegetables

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
because when vegetables
ferment, they

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.620 align:middle line:84%
make the bacteria that are
the families in your gut.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.210 align:middle line:84%
We've got thousands
and thousands

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:90%
of families in your gut.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:30.040 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't matter how
much of one particular family

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:90%
you've got.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.270 align:middle line:84%
What matters is how balanced
are all the families.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.860 align:middle line:90%
Is it a community?

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And is your gut in a
community working together?

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.180 align:middle line:90%
So you eat.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.740 align:middle line:84%
Walk by your
refrigerator every day.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Just take one forkful of one
of the fermented vegetables,

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:46.260 align:middle line:90%
just one of them.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.710 align:middle line:90%
And every day switch them out.

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.610 align:middle line:84%
So they've got
sauerkraut, kimchi,

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:90%
curry flavored, Italian flavor.

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Just get any-- get
a bunch of them.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.380 align:middle line:84%
And you take one forkful a
day, because every vegetable

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:84%
that ferments is producing
different families

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.900 align:middle line:90%
of good bacteria for you.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.270 align:middle line:90%
So you're inoculating every day.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:09.230 align:middle line:90%
That's the first thing you do.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.470 align:middle line:84%
The second thing is go
online, go to Google,

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:14.590 align:middle line:84%
and type in list
of prebiotic foods.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:84%
And every day you
make sure to have

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.850 align:middle line:90%
at least two prebiotic foods.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:90%
Not probiotic.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.730 align:middle line:90%
Prebiotic.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.930 align:middle line:84%
Because the prebiotic foods feed
the good bacteria in your gut.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.790 align:middle line:84%
They won't feed
the bad bacteria.

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:84%
They feed the good
bacteria in your gut.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.310 align:middle line:84%
So you're inoculating
every day with a little bit

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:34.300 align:middle line:90%
of good bacteria.

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:84%
You're varying it so you're
not getting a dominance of one.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:38.740 align:middle line:90%
You're varying it every day.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.480 align:middle line:84%
And then every day
you're feeding it

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.160 align:middle line:90%
with some of the good bacteria.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.660 align:middle line:90%
And you change it out.

Just read the science.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:03.610 align:middle line:84%
It's really clear, because the
Chinese yams and bitter melon,

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:84%
those two together
feed good bacteria

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:84%
in the gut that help
you lose weight.

being careful and they're
not losing weight,

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:84%
it's because they've
created an environment

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.600 align:middle line:84%
in the gut of bacteria that's
hoarding calories, storing

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.650 align:middle line:90%
calories.
