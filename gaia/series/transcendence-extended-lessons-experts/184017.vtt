00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.000 align:middle line:90%

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So if somebody wants
to level-up their learning

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and level up their life, really
uncover their deep potential,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.380 align:middle line:84%
really a big part of it comes
down to routines and habits

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.740 align:middle line:84%
because anywhere from 40% to
60% of our day is spent doing

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.320 align:middle line:84%
routines, doing
things unconsciously.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And so I believe that
first we create our habits.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.702 align:middle line:84%
And then our habits
create us, right.

00:00:24.702 --> 00:00:27.160 align:middle line:84%
We create our habits and their
habits create us right back.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:84%
But how many people
actually sat down

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.520 align:middle line:84%
to design the habits
that really can help them

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.360 align:middle line:90%
live their fullest potential?

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.300 align:middle line:84%
The habits that are
most important to me

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.250 align:middle line:84%
are those habits first
thing in the morning.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:84%
Because as they say, if
you want to win the day,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.700 align:middle line:84%
you have to win that
first hour of the day.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.360 align:middle line:84%
And so every single morning
I have specific habits

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.740 align:middle line:90%
to really jump start my mind.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.680 align:middle line:84%
To conquer my mind, to
master my mind if you will,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.683 align:middle line:84%
because that's going to
control everything else.

00:00:49.683 --> 00:00:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
the first thing I

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.340 align:middle line:84%
do when I wake up in the
morning is I remember my dreams.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.352 align:middle line:84%
I have a process for
remembering all my dreams.

00:00:56.352 --> 00:00:58.060 align:middle line:84%
And you're like, Jim,
what does that have

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:84%
to do with human potential,
and being your best,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.660 align:middle line:84%
and being a leading
mental performer?

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people
don't know this,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:84%
but you go through your
day learning all day.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.671 align:middle line:84%
You go through your day trying
to figure out challenges

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:09.762 align:middle line:84%
as an entrepreneur
or as a parent.

00:01:09.762 --> 00:01:12.220 align:middle line:84%
And here's the thing, your
brain doesn't shut off at night.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.770 align:middle line:84%
If anything, your brain
is more active at night.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.960 align:middle line:84%
So many times you'll come
up with answers at night.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.210 align:middle line:90%
You'll come up with solutions.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.142 align:middle line:84%
You come up with inventions,
works of art in your mind.

00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is when
you wake up the next day,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.390 align:middle line:90%
you forget those things.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.567 align:middle line:90%
And that's a big challenge.

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, a
lot of people don't

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:84%
know a lot of
literature, culture,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.090 align:middle line:90%
art was created in dream states.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.900 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, Mary Shelley
came up with "Frankenstein"

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.950 align:middle line:90%
in her dreams.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.060 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that amazing?

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Paul McCartney came up with
"Yesterday" in his dream.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Elias Howe created the
sewing machine in his dream.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.150 align:middle line:84%
The periodic table came
to a chemist in his dream.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:84%
And so what are you dreaming
about late at night,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.340 align:middle line:84%
that you forget about the
first thing in the morning?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.298 align:middle line:84%
So you want to be able
to remember your dreams.

00:01:53.298 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:84%
The second thing I do is,
when I talk about habits,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.073 align:middle line:84%
and routines, and being
extra best, is I make my bed.

00:01:58.073 --> 00:02:00.490 align:middle line:84%
You're like, Jim, what does
that have to do with anything?

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.510 align:middle line:90%
Make your bed?

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.930 align:middle line:90%
And the reason why is twofold.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Number one, I believe
how you do anything

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.805 align:middle line:90%
is how you do everything.

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:08.680 align:middle line:84%
How you do anything is
how you do everything.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.300 align:middle line:90%
And success breeds success.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.520 align:middle line:90%
And why not start with a win?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.330 align:middle line:84%
That only takes you one or two
minutes to be able to do that.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And the other reason you do this
is how wonderful is the feeling

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.300 align:middle line:84%
that you come back
after a hard day's work

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:90%
and you come back to success.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:84%
You come back to
your bed, right.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.802 align:middle line:90%
So you go full circle.

00:02:23.802 --> 00:02:26.260 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I do every single
morning in terms of habits,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
routine, is I brush my teeth
with the opposite hand,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.330 align:middle line:90%
with the opposite hand.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.190 align:middle line:84%
You're like, Jim, what does
that have to do with anything?

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Why would you use
your opposite hand?

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.080 align:middle line:90%
It's more difficult.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.180 align:middle line:84%
That is the reason why
because you train yourself.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.280 align:middle line:84%
How you do anything is
how you do everything.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.710 align:middle line:84%
So you want to get comfortable
being uncomfortable.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.025 align:middle line:90%
Because if you put limits--

00:02:43.025 --> 00:02:44.150 align:middle line:90%
Bruce Lee says this phrase.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So he says, if you put
limits on any of your life,

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.970 align:middle line:84%
then it's going to pervade
other areas your life.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.750 align:middle line:84%
So I want to challenge
myself constantly.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.930 align:middle line:84%
But the other reason you
use the opposite hand is it

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
engages the opposite
side of your brain

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.530 align:middle line:84%
and actually builds
brain muscles.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Because as your body
moves, your brain grooves.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.910 align:middle line:84%
They did a study at
Oxford University

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.190 align:middle line:90%
where they had jugglers.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.360 align:middle line:84%
They found that jugglers
actually had bigger brains.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.742 align:middle line:84%
They created more white
matter in their brains

00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:84%
because as you move your
body, it actually stimulates

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:90%
different parts of your brain.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not just the
brain/body connection,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.510 align:middle line:90%
it's a body/brain connection.

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
science is telling us.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.040 align:middle line:84%
Another thing I do every single
morning is I take cold showers.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.950 align:middle line:84%
If you're thinking, Jim,
I love this up to now.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.660 align:middle line:90%
Why do you say cold showers?

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.750 align:middle line:84%
But we know cold therapy is
something that's very powerful.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of high achievers do that,
including Wim Hof because it

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.760 align:middle line:90%
reset your nervous system.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.810 align:middle line:84%
It lowers inflammation
in your body.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.582 align:middle line:84%
So whether it's a cold shower or
cryotherapy, I like-- you know,

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:38.290 align:middle line:84%
you hit your knee and
you what do you do?

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.880 align:middle line:84%
You put ice on it
because it reduces

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.130 align:middle line:90%
the swelling and inflammation.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.090 align:middle line:84%
The same thing with your
body and your brain.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.798 align:middle line:84%
The other reason why
I take cold showers,

00:03:44.798 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:84%
besides the
physiological effects,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.490 align:middle line:90%
is the psychological effects.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.925 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by that?

00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:51.800 align:middle line:84%
How you do anything is
how you do everything.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But when you put yourself in
difficult situations, something

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.183 align:middle line:84%
that's uncomfortable, but
still not life-threatening,

00:03:57.183 --> 00:03:58.100 align:middle line:90%
and you push yourself.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.950 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of times in
that shower, even to this day,

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.450 align:middle line:84%
I'm like, I want
to get out of this.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:90%
My body is screaming, get out.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Get out of this.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But when you calm yourself, and
you bring centeredness to it,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.250 align:middle line:84%
and you resist that,
then all of a sudden

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.160 align:middle line:84%
that pervades other
areas of your life.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.540 align:middle line:84%
It have allows you to have
more confidence, and more

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.930 align:middle line:84%
resilience, and more grit when
you're at your job, when you're

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.610 align:middle line:84%
onstage teaching
something, when you

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.620 align:middle line:84%
need to be there constantly with
your child, that really shows

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:90%
up.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.207 align:middle line:84%
So you do it for physiological
reasons, for inflammation.

00:04:25.207 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
But you also do it for
psychological reasons

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.498 align:middle line:84%
because you're
building resilience.

00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:30.380 align:middle line:84%
You're building
grit also, as well.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.405 align:middle line:84%
And so when we're talking about
habits, a lot of my habits

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:35.280 align:middle line:84%
get me in a place where
I feel uncomfortable.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And I want to feel comfortable
being uncomfortable.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.020 align:middle line:84%
So another thing I do is I
have a tall glass of water

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.360 align:middle line:90%
because your body is 70% water.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.423 align:middle line:90%
Your brain is 70% water.

00:04:44.423 --> 00:04:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And you want to be
able to hydrate that.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.640 align:middle line:84%
Your brain is only about
2% of your body mass,

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.810 align:middle line:84%
but it requires 20%
of the nutrients.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:51.810 align:middle line:90%
And so it requires that.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.450 align:middle line:84%
But make sure you're
completely hydrated.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'll do that and some of
my probiotics, and so on.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.765 align:middle line:84%
And then I have a
brain power smoothie.

00:04:57.765 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
And you're thinking, what's
a brain power smoothie?

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have my top 10
favorite brain foods

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.890 align:middle line:90%
because you are what you eat.

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:90%
You are what you ate.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.700 align:middle line:84%
Literally what you eat becomes
you, especially the things

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.620 align:middle line:84%
that you can actually
assimilate, not the food

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.130 align:middle line:90%
that you can't assimilate you.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
And so maybe you are what you
assimilate and can actually

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:90%
absorb, right.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.200 align:middle line:90%
But you are what you eat.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:90%
And so eat a good brain diet.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.542 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk about
the brain, again it's

00:05:20.542 --> 00:05:23.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's the control
center for your relationships,

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.630 align:middle line:84%
for your career, for your
mission, for all the things

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:90%
that are important in your life.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.990 align:middle line:84%
And so some of my top
10 favorite brain foods,

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.720 align:middle line:84%
avocados very, very
good for your brain.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Number two, I would
say blueberries.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.490 align:middle line:90%
I call them brain berries.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.900 align:middle line:84%
Number three,
broccoli, you know.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Your mom was right.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
Broccoli is very
good for your brain.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.940 align:middle line:84%
After that, coconut oil, very,
very good for your brain.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Eggs, very good for your brain.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.510 align:middle line:84%
You get essential
fatty acids, DHA.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Green leafy vegetables,
very neuroprotective.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Fish oils, as I would
say, wild salmon,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.880 align:middle line:84%
sardines, very
good for the brain.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Turmeric, extremely good for the
brain, very anti-inflammatory.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
I like to make a golden
tea, if you will,

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.792 align:middle line:90%
or a golden milk using turmeric.

00:06:08.792 --> 00:06:10.250 align:middle line:84%
You always put some
pepper in there

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.670 align:middle line:84%
because that helps you
to be able to absorb it

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:12.550 align:middle line:90%
better as well.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:84%
Some people like honey, some
almond as a base, very good.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.048 align:middle line:84%
Another great food for the
brain are actually walnuts.

00:06:19.048 --> 00:06:20.590 align:middle line:84%
Walnuts are very
good for your brain.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:84%
And even if you notice,
when you look at a walnut,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.010 align:middle line:90%
it looks like what?

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.630 align:middle line:90%
It looks like the human brain.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Actually in nature, is
there's certain foods

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
that they actually communicate
what organs they serve.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.980 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if you take
a carrot and you cut it,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.502 align:middle line:84%
it actually looks
like an eyeball.

00:06:35.502 --> 00:06:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And so it's an interesting
signature that nature has,

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.540 align:middle line:90%
a signature, a sign of nature.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:84%
They tell you the sign of
what it's going to heal.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.810 align:middle line:84%
Dark chocolate, I saved
the best for last.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.793 align:middle line:84%
Dark chocolate, the
darker the better.

00:06:47.793 --> 00:06:49.710 align:middle line:84%
Anything that's going
to be good for your mood

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.830 align:middle line:84%
generally is going to be good
for your mind also, as well.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:84%
So what I'll do
every morning is I'll

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.082 align:middle line:84%
take some of my
favorite brain foods.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And I'll throw them
into a blender.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.123 align:middle line:90%
So I'll put the avocados.

00:06:59.123 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:84%
I'll put the
blueberries in there.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:01.998 align:middle line:84%
I'll put some
coconut oil in there.

00:07:01.998 --> 00:07:04.470 align:middle line:84%
I'll put some green leafy
vegetables in there.

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.790 align:middle line:84%
I'll put some soaked walnuts
in there, some dark chocolate.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:84%
I won't put the wild salmon
in there or the eggs.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.440 align:middle line:84%
But I make a
brainpower smoothie.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And when I'm drinking
my brainpower smoothie,

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:17.450 align:middle line:84%
now what I'm doing
is I'm journaling.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And this is where I take time.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.373 align:middle line:84%
And my journaling has to do
with a lot around gratitude.

00:07:22.373 --> 00:07:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I'll list the
things that I'm most

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:26.850 align:middle line:84%
grateful for because gratitude,
again, requires the brain.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Because what you tend to
appreciate, appreciates.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.210 align:middle line:84%
What you appreciate appreciates
and grows in your life.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.280 align:middle line:84%
And so I write
those things down.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything from the
fact that I could see,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.060 align:middle line:84%
the things with my
physiology, my health,

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:84%
the people my mission,
the people I'm

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.200 align:middle line:90%
helping also, as well.

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.580 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing my gratitude journal.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.040 align:middle line:84%
And I'm also listing
also the things

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.203 align:middle line:90%
that I want to do that day.

00:07:51.203 --> 00:07:53.620 align:middle line:84%
I do three things personally,
three things professionally.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.320 align:middle line:90%
Those are my wins for the day.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And notice, I don't
even check my email

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.400 align:middle line:84%
because one of the worst
habits people could have,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.380 align:middle line:84%
if they want to be an
elite mental performer

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.338 align:middle line:84%
and they want to reach
their fullest potential,

00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:05.550 align:middle line:84%
do not touch your phone
the first hour of the day.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.140 align:middle line:90%
And people-- and I'll say this.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of people--

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.400 align:middle line:84%
because we're all addicted
to our digital devices--

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.060 align:middle line:90%
is because for two reasons.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.667 align:middle line:84%
It rewires your brain,
number one, for distraction.

00:08:15.667 --> 00:08:17.500 align:middle line:84%
When you wake up first
thing in the morning,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.140 align:middle line:84%
you're in this brainwave
state called alpha/theta.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:84%
Alpha/theta states are the
states of relaxed awareness.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:25.290 align:middle line:90%
You're extremely impressionable.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And when you're going on your
smart devices, and every time

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.330 align:middle line:84%
you get a like, or a
share, or a comment,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.970 align:middle line:84%
or you're watching another
cat video, whatever, you're

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.659 align:middle line:90%
getting this flood of dopamine.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's training you
to be more distracted.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.120 align:middle line:84%
And we know this because
we live in a world

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.000 align:middle line:84%
full of distractions, app
notifications, social media

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.500 align:middle line:90%
alerts, Instagram.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And this is an app that we're
opening up 150, 200 times

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:84%
a day, highly addictive,
highly obituary.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Dr. BJ Fogg, who
runs the Influence

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Lab in Stanford University,
one of his students

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:90%
actually created Instagram.

00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.370 align:middle line:84%
But his expertise is in this
area of habit, habit creation

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:01.170 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
He has this formula called
B MAT, B equals MAT.

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:84%
If you want to change
your habit, it starts--

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.145 align:middle line:84%
the behavior is
the habit itself.

00:09:09.145 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Now in order to be
able to change that,

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
what creates a
habit or a behavior,

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.870 align:middle line:84%
is M-A-T. M is
motivation because you

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.910 align:middle line:84%
can't change a habit unless
you're motivated to do so.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:23.100 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, if you want to
make exercise a habit, eating

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.940 align:middle line:84%
right a habit, journaling
or meditating a habit,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.690 align:middle line:84%
you need to check in
with your motivation.

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.210 align:middle line:84%
On a scale of 0 to
10, where are you

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:84%
in your level of
motivation, your drive

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.410 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do that,
that activity if you will?

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:84%
And the good thing about this
is if it's a 5, ask yourself,

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:84%
well, what do I need to do in
my mind to make it a 6 or a 7?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.872 align:middle line:84%
And you could play these
little brain hack games,

00:09:42.872 --> 00:09:44.247 align:middle line:84%
to be able to
level up, like it's

00:09:44.247 --> 00:09:45.750 align:middle line:90%
a video game inside your mind.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The A in this formula
stands for ability, ability.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.690 align:middle line:84%
And you have
training in that area

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.297 align:middle line:90%
to be able to do that behavior.

00:09:53.297 --> 00:09:55.130 align:middle line:84%
So going back to, so
let's say your behavior

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:57.130 align:middle line:84%
is you want to be able
to read every single day.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Do you have the ability to read?

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Do you have
opportunities to read?

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And finally, the T-- this is
the big one in the formula--

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:06.530 align:middle line:84%
the T and B equals M-A-T.
When creating new habits,

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:08.450 align:middle line:90%
it stands for trigger.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.360 align:middle line:84%
And triggers are important to
me in my work as a memory expert

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.860 align:middle line:84%
because everything
serves as a reminder.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.810 align:middle line:84%
You can forget something
during the day.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.790 align:middle line:84%
You're like, what
was that actor's name

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.897 align:middle line:90%
or what did I need to do?

00:10:17.897 --> 00:10:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And later on, you're
driving your car.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.647 align:middle line:90%
All of sudden, what happens?

00:10:20.647 --> 00:10:21.890 align:middle line:90%
It just pops in your mind.

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:23.595 align:middle line:84%
Usually there's an
unconscious trigger.

00:10:23.595 --> 00:10:25.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a song that
goes off or something

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.440 align:middle line:84%
you see on the side road, that
unconsciously reminded you

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.690 align:middle line:84%
of the thing that you know
that's inside of your mind,

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:31.232 align:middle line:84%
that you needed to
be able to recall.

00:10:31.232 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
But the trigger is
basically saying,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
what prompts you
to do that habit?

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.740 align:middle line:84%
So, for example, I don't
like digital devices so much.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.490 align:middle line:84%
They're convenient,
but they also cripple.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.290 align:middle line:84%
We have this thing
called digital dementia,

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:45.030 align:middle line:84%
where we're outsourcing our
brains to our smart devices.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Think about how many phone
numbers you knew growing up.

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.380 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.340 align:middle line:90%
All of them, right.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.885 align:middle line:84%
How many phone numbers do you
know right now, one, maybe two.

00:10:52.885 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge
is that I don't

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.310 align:middle line:84%
want to memorize hundreds
of phone numbers.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But we've lost the ability
just to memorize one.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
They call it digital
dementia, meaning

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.840 align:middle line:84%
that we're using our smart
devices so much to keep

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.570 align:middle line:84%
our to-dos, our schedules,
our grocery list,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.210 align:middle line:84%
do simple math for us,
remember all the phone numbers.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:84%
So our brain's lost
the ability to be

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.720 align:middle line:90%
able to do those tasks ourself.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:90%
It's just like GPS.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.880 align:middle line:84%
I was talking to Dr. Daniel
Amen, the famous brain doctor.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:19.880 align:middle line:84%
He says Jim, with GPS, we're
not getting early detection

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.130 align:middle line:84%
of dementia because
if you're relying

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.837 align:middle line:84%
on a piece of technology to
tell you where and when to turn,

00:11:24.837 --> 00:11:27.170 align:middle line:84%
you're not realizing when you
would have a memory lapse.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:29.295 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to
doctors to get checked out.

00:11:29.295 --> 00:11:31.670 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
three major challenges

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.370 align:middle line:84%
that the world's never faced
before in this digital age.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:36.470 align:middle line:84%
Number one's, digital
overload, too much

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.730 align:middle line:90%
information, too little time.

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.427 align:middle line:84%
The amount of information is
doubling at dizzying speeds.

00:11:40.427 --> 00:11:43.010 align:middle line:84%
The chairman of Google says that
the amount information that's

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.990 align:middle line:84%
been created from
the dawn of humanity

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.870 align:middle line:84%
to the year 2003, which is
only about a decade and a half

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:84%
ago, that amount of information
now is created every two

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.800 align:middle line:90%
days online.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, think about
all the podcasts,

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.700 align:middle line:84%
and all the blog posts,
and all the YouTube videos,

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and all the books, everything,
so much information.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
So it's doubling
at dizzying speeds.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.720 align:middle line:84%
But how we learn it,
has that changed?

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.240 align:middle line:84%
How we learn it, how we
read it, how we recall it,

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.510 align:middle line:90%
has that changed, not at all.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.170 align:middle line:84%
So that growing gap creates
a big health concern

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:11.900 align:middle line:84%
called information
anxiety, higher blood

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:15.800 align:middle line:84%
pressure, compression of leisure
time, more sleeplessness.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Even if people have some free
time and something frees up

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:20.238 align:middle line:84%
in their life, a
meeting gets canceled,

00:12:20.238 --> 00:12:22.280 align:middle line:84%
they can't even enjoy
because their mind is still

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.620 align:middle line:84%
multitasking and
thinking of other things

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:26.203 align:middle line:90%
because we're wired to be busy.

00:12:26.203 --> 00:12:27.620 align:middle line:84%
Because people,
all the time, they

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.110 align:middle line:84%
say-- you're used to saying,
I'm so busy, and how's today?

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm just so busy.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And they're using that
as a badge of honor,

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:90%
meaning it's an identity.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Because here's the
unconscious message

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.760 align:middle line:90%
you're sending to somebody.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.343 align:middle line:84%
When you're saying
you're busy, you're

00:12:39.343 --> 00:12:40.580 align:middle line:90%
getting secondary gain and.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.350 align:middle line:84%
That's secondary
gain is sympathy

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.930 align:middle line:84%
or it's a feeling
of your significant.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.360 align:middle line:84%
Because you're so busy,
you must be important.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.800 align:middle line:90%
And it's fulfilling these needs.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And so we are always
wanting to be busy,

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:51.920 align:middle line:90%
if that's your identity.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.130 align:middle line:84%
But here's the disservice
you give yourself, is this.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.290 align:middle line:84%
If you're always
identifying with being busy,

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.780 align:middle line:84%
you are going to organize
your life to always be busy.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.792 align:middle line:84%
And you wonder why you
don't have peace of mind.

00:13:01.792 --> 00:13:03.500 align:middle line:84%
You wonder why you
don't have a calmness.

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Because I really think
that's the real currency,

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
is your attention,
is your presence,

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.720 align:middle line:84%
is your confidence, and
a level of calmness,

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.350 align:middle line:84%
in an age of, like, storms,
with digital distractions.

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So number one, digital overload
creates the information

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:18.610 align:middle line:90%
anxiety.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why learning how to
learn faster is so important.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.640 align:middle line:84%
The other digital concern I
have is digital distraction.

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.780 align:middle line:84%
This idea, like nobody
can concentrate.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.090 align:middle line:84%
They say that human beings
now have less attention span

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.427 align:middle line:90%
than a goldfish.

00:13:30.427 --> 00:13:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's a big challenge
because how are you going

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:33.680 align:middle line:90%
to build a quality of life?

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.610 align:middle line:84%
How are you going
to get things that

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.650 align:middle line:84%
are most important
done if you can't even

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.478 align:middle line:84%
focus on the thing
that's in front of you?

00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:40.520 align:middle line:84%
How many of us read a page
in a book, get to end,

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.930 align:middle line:90%
just forgot what we just read?

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.430 align:middle line:84%
How many people are
meeting somebody

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:84%
for the first time
and they don't

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.940 align:middle line:84%
remember a name, not because
they don't have a great memory.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
It's because they're
looking over their shoulder

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.110 align:middle line:84%
to see who else is important,
because they're not present.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.360 align:middle line:84%
How many people here, they're
not even looking around.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.820 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're
looking at you, they're

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:84%
not really there because
they're talking to themselves.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.877 align:middle line:90%
They're not listening.

00:13:57.877 --> 00:14:00.078 align:middle line:84%
They're waiting for
their turn to speak

00:14:00.078 --> 00:14:02.370 align:middle line:84%
or they're thinking about
how they're going to respond.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And one of my very
favorite books

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:84%
is by Dr. Stephen
Covey, "The 7 Habits

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.787 align:middle line:90%
of Highly Effective People."

00:14:07.787 --> 00:14:08.870 align:middle line:90%
And these are the habits--

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.578 align:middle line:84%
we're going back to
habits and routines--

00:14:10.578 --> 00:14:11.870 align:middle line:90%
of the most effective people.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:14.670 align:middle line:84%
One of them says, seek
first to understand,

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:16.260 align:middle line:90%
then to be understood.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.470 align:middle line:84%
Seek first to understand,
then to be understood.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
remembering names,

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that's one the biggest
challenges, memory challenges,

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:22.670 align:middle line:90%
people have.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.040 align:middle line:84%
And really, it's
not your retention.

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.960 align:middle line:90%
It's your attention.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.220 align:middle line:90%
It's your observation.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And when we're talking about,
like, even just boosting

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.080 align:middle line:84%
our memory, we're talking about
being motivated, going back

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:90%
to motivation.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.780 align:middle line:84%
Ask yourself, why do you
want to remember this?

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.670 align:middle line:84%
Why do I want to remember
this person's name?

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's to make a
connection, make a new friend,

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.817 align:middle line:84%
or create a business
relationship.

00:14:42.817 --> 00:14:44.900 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's to practice
these techniques I learned.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.525 align:middle line:84%
Because here's the thing, if you
can't come up with one reason,

00:14:47.525 --> 00:14:48.740 align:middle line:90%
you won't remember things.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:53.000 align:middle line:84%
Because reasons reap results,
reasons reap results.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.680 align:middle line:84%
I think there's a
success formula.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.580 align:middle line:90%
I call it H-cubed.

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.670 align:middle line:84%
It goes from your head, to
your heart, to your hands.

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:84%
So we could visualize
things all day.

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.820 align:middle line:90%
We could set goals all day.

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.220 align:middle line:84%
We could have our
dreams and our mind.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:06.890 align:middle line:84%
But if we're not acting with
our hands, something's going on.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:08.270 align:middle line:90%
Something is missing.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Because we're self-sabotaging
or we're procrastinating.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.760 align:middle line:84%
Why are we acting with our
hands when it's in our head?

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Usually what's missing is a
second H, which is the heart.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.210 align:middle line:84%
The heart is a symbol of
emotion, the energy of motion.

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't steer
a car that has no fuel.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.890 align:middle line:90%
So where's the fuel?

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.120 align:middle line:90%
You want to start with why.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:90%
And so we go back to motivation.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.930 align:middle line:84%
Because here's the thing, a
lot of people know what to do.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But they don't do what they
know because common sense is not

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:34.257 align:middle line:90%
often common practice.

00:15:34.257 --> 00:15:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And usually what's missing,
if you procrastinate and put

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.900 align:middle line:84%
things off, is
understanding your emotions,

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.760 align:middle line:84%
tapping into what's
most important to you,

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.400 align:middle line:84%
going back to your values,
going back to your beliefs,

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.390 align:middle line:90%
going to things--

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:47.990 align:middle line:84%
even sometimes it's their
fears that drive people,

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the things that
they're moving away from

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.270 align:middle line:84%
or the things that they're
moving towards also, as well.
