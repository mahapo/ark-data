00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.590 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so important to keep
your brain functioning at its

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.250 align:middle line:84%
very, very best, primarily
because there is no alternative.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.780 align:middle line:90%
There is no fallback plan.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.230 align:middle line:84%
We don't have anything
that will help

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.630 align:middle line:84%
us take care of
this problem if we

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.370 align:middle line:84%
don't act as our own
arbiters of brain health.

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So many of our lifestyle
choices reflect on

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
whether the brain is
going to work well or not.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.190 align:middle line:84%
We are the arbiters of
our brains' destiny.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's a bit heady
because it hits the ball back

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.248 align:middle line:84%
to our side of the
net for us to play.

00:00:47.248 --> 00:00:49.040 align:middle line:84%
We sort of live in a
world where we kind of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.640 align:middle line:84%
think we should offload
our destiny to the doctors

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:84%
to take care of this
problem or that problem

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.400 align:middle line:90%
once it has already arisen.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And the reality is that
we are setting the stage

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.200 align:middle line:84%
throughout our lifetimes
for how our brains are going

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.029 align:middle line:90%
to function later in life.

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:09.750 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.730 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk then about the
biggest threats to brain health,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:84%
the biggest risks that are
unfortunately so commonly parts

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.470 align:middle line:90%
of our lives these days.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And not in any
particular order, but I

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.600 align:middle line:84%
would say that keeping your
blood sugar under control

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.000 align:middle line:84%
is a big, important
goal for brain health.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.590 align:middle line:84%
Another not so often talked
about threat to brain health

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:84%
is not getting enough
restorative sleep.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.820 align:middle line:90%
Who knew?

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.320 align:middle line:84%
Not getting enough
restorative sleep

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%
threatens the brain through
a number of mechanisms.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.250 align:middle line:84%
It is associated
with inflammation.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.230 align:middle line:84%
It's associated with
elevated uric acid.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:84%
It's associated with
increased risk of obesity.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And it is associated with
elevation of blood sugar

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.960 align:middle line:90%
like we just talked about.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So I really think there
needs to be so much more

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.620 align:middle line:84%
emphasis on people reigning in
what's going on with their sleep

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.510 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.020 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be
productive, if you

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.480 align:middle line:84%
want to have a highly
functioning brain, then

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.300 align:middle line:84%
by all means, pay
attention to your sleep.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.210 align:middle line:84%
Pay attention to not
just the quantity,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.880 align:middle line:84%
but the quality of
your sleep as well.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.160 align:middle line:84%
People who exercise have a
dramatically reduced risk

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:84%
of developing Alzheimer's
disease, a disease for which we

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.890 align:middle line:84%
have no pharmaceutical
treatment.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.480 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, in 2017 in one of
our best peer-reviewed neurology

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.050 align:middle line:84%
journals was a fascinating
study that was a practice

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.920 align:middle line:90%
guide for a neurologist.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:84%
And it asked a simple question,
what is the best treatment?

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:10%
What is the best intervention
we can offer patients

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.250 align:middle line:10%
who have developed mild
cognitive impairment, MCI,

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.870 align:middle line:10%
harbinger for future
Alzheimer's disease?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
You have a patient who has
been diagnosed with MCI,

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.710 align:middle line:84%
you know they're going to
move on to Alzheimer's sooner

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:54.560 align:middle line:90%
or later.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.930 align:middle line:90%
What should we do?

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.640 align:middle line:84%
And it went through 14
different possibilities.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:84%
This drug, that drug, every
drug you can think of.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.730 align:middle line:84%
And they settled on only
one validated recommendation

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.750 align:middle line:90%
from the neurology journal.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:84%
And it said the best thing you
can do for these patients is

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:90%
tell them to exercise.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.980 align:middle line:90%
That was the drug.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.950 align:middle line:90%
So exercise is profound.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.090 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Exercise does two
things in the body.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.830 align:middle line:10%
There's a teeter totter between
the growth of new brain cells.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.300 align:middle line:10%
And on the other side, you may
have guessed it, inflammation.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.890 align:middle line:84%
Higher levels of inflammation,
less growth of new brain cells.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.900 align:middle line:84%
We want to do everything we
can to turn on new brain cell

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.950 align:middle line:90%
formation in our brains.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And beyond that, we want to
turn on the way our brain

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:90%
cells connect to each other.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.210 align:middle line:10%
That's how the brain works.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.810 align:middle line:90%
It's how we form memories.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.630 align:middle line:90%
We want to keep that going.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.730 align:middle line:10%
And that happens
under the influence

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.770 align:middle line:10%
of a very important chemical
that goes by the initials BDNF.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.650 align:middle line:84%
For anyone who wants to know,
it's Brain-Derived Neurotrophic

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Factor.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
It's basically Miracle-Gro
for your brain cells.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.890 align:middle line:90%
How do you have more BDNF?

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:90%
You exercise.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:90%
Dramatically increases BDNF.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.700 align:middle line:84%
You grow new brain
cells, especially

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.089 align:middle line:84%
in the brain's memory center,
and you cause more connections

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.000 align:middle line:90%
to form in your brain.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:84%
We've got to do everything we
can to give people the tools

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.150 align:middle line:84%
to prevent this
godawful situation, not

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.490 align:middle line:84%
just for the patients,
but for their families

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.000 align:middle line:90%
and loved ones as well.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is six million
people in America

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
right now, with that number
predicted to triple by 2050.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.815 align:middle line:84%
One interesting study from
2017 published in the Journal

00:04:44.815 --> 00:04:51.940 align:middle line:84%
of Neurology looked at 6,583
individuals and measured

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
their sagittal
abdominal diameter.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.820 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a cat
scan measurement

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.970 align:middle line:90%
of how big is your belly.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:10%
Followed these
people for 36 years.

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.780 align:middle line:10%
And what did they find?

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.040 align:middle line:10%
They found that those
individuals who had a bigger

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.690 align:middle line:10%
belly 36 years ago had
a three-fold increased

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.840 align:middle line:10%
risk of being demented when they
finally went back and followed

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.690 align:middle line:10%
these people.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.240 align:middle line:84%
That means that we've
got to pay attention

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.363 align:middle line:84%
to these important lifestyle
factors like our body weight,

00:05:26.363 --> 00:05:28.280 align:middle line:84%
like our blood pressure,
like our blood sugar,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.200 align:middle line:84%
like our uric acid levels
far in advance of suddenly

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.780 align:middle line:84%
not being able to
remember the Wi-Fi code.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.040 align:middle line:84%
These are players that are
instructive for us in our 20s,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.420 align:middle line:90%
in our 30s.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.180 align:middle line:84%
That's the target
population that

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:84%
needs to wake up and realize
that they are already

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:90%
charting their brain destiny.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So we used to talk
about this thing called

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.970 align:middle line:84%
age-related dementia,
as if that's just

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.260 align:middle line:90%
what happens as you get older.

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.600 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some people don't
call it Alzheimer's disease.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.510 align:middle line:84%
They call it old
timer's disease.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And I would submit
that you do not

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:84%
have to accept the notion
that your brain function is

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.650 align:middle line:90%
going to decline with age.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.750 align:middle line:84%
If you engage in the right
lifestyle activities,

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:84%
making sure you're sleeping,
making sure you're exercising,

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.930 align:middle line:84%
making sure that your diet is
designed to keep your blood

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.180 align:middle line:84%
sugar in check,
you should expect

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.420 align:middle line:84%
that your brain function is
going to be preserved well

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:90%
into your older age.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you were to ask
me, what are the top tips

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.230 align:middle line:90%
from a neurologist?

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:31.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to give you it from
the perspective of a neurologist

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:84%
and from a family member of
somebody dying of Alzheimer's

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.820 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.850 align:middle line:84%
And it would be
number one, diet.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.010 align:middle line:84%
Number one, pay
attention to your diet.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Number two, exercise
is hugely valuable.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:84%
One year of exercise
has been demonstrated

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.530 align:middle line:84%
to be associated with actually
an increased size of the brain's

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.200 align:middle line:84%
memory center called the
hippocampus, as opposed

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.410 align:middle line:84%
to a reduction in size in
people who simply stretched.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
And the third thing
would be, hey, you

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.430 align:middle line:84%
need to learn about the quality
and quantity of your sleep.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
It means go and
get a sleep study

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.390 align:middle line:84%
or much more conveniently,
buy a wearable device

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:84%
and learn what's going on
in your body in your brain

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.260 align:middle line:84%
at night when you think
you're sleeping well.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:84%
There's always the discussion
of the brain superfoods.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I would
say among my favorites

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:28.940 align:middle line:84%
are fish or basically
fish oil for people who

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.990 align:middle line:90%
are not wanting to eat fish.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.410 align:middle line:84%
And primarily what we're
talking about there is the DHA,

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:37.410 align:middle line:84%
the omega three that
is found in fish oil.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's even
vegetarian-sourced DHA.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.190 align:middle line:84%
That is a powerful,
powerful brain tonic.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.270 align:middle line:84%
It turns on this BDNF
that tells the brain

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.900 align:middle line:90%
to make more brain cells.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.870 align:middle line:84%
It leads to protecting
brain cells.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.100 align:middle line:84%
It helps to reduce inflammation
quite dramatically.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And it even helps how one
brain cell can communicate

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:00.150 align:middle line:90%
to the next brain cell.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.480 align:middle line:84%
So anything that's giving
somebody DHA, I'm all in.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of
research on olive oil.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.500 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact,
the PREDIMED study,

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:84%
one very large
study out of Spain,

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:15.130 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated that
consumption of olive oil

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:19.350 align:middle line:84%
is associated directly with
reduced Alzheimer's risk.

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:22.060 align:middle line:84%
More olive oil
consumption, lower risk

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.320 align:middle line:90%
for Alzheimer's disease.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:29.070 align:middle line:84%
I like the berry idea, the
ideas of eating blueberries,

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.010 align:middle line:84%
for example, because first,
they're low in sugar,

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.760 align:middle line:84%
but they're good in
phytonutrients that help reduce

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.760 align:middle line:84%
inflammation, can actually
help reduce uric acid,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.169 align:middle line:84%
and have a blood sugar
balancing effect as well.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.850 align:middle line:84%
We've talked about
walnuts in the past,

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.980 align:middle line:84%
and no one really
has fully explained

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.620 align:middle line:84%
why walnuts seem to be
so effective in terms

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.320 align:middle line:90%
of being good for the brain.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.880 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that the
newer literature on walnuts

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.090 align:middle line:84%
shows that walnuts actually
are associated with a pretty

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.430 align:middle line:90%
dramatic drop in uric acid.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:84%
That's got to be
good for the brain.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.120 align:middle line:84%
Uric acid elevation, raises
blood sugar, blood pressure,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.470 align:middle line:84%
and certainly
threatens the brain.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.860 align:middle line:10%
Other foods that I think
are really important, not

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.450 align:middle line:10%
necessarily foods, but spices.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.840 align:middle line:84%
For example, turmeric
has long been

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.950 align:middle line:84%
one of my favorites because of
its powerful anti-inflammatory

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:19.770 align:middle line:90%
activity.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
But turmeric, like DHA, turns
on the production of BDNF,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.880 align:middle line:90%
the Miracle-Gro for the brain.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.380 align:middle line:10%
And turmeric also
activates a pathway

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:10%
that dramatically increases
the body's own antioxidant

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:10%
and detoxification pathways.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:84%
So it's really quite
handy in terms of the way

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.060 align:middle line:90%
that it's able to do that.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.530 align:middle line:84%
Cinnamon is worthwhile because
cinnamon helps balance blood

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:90%
sugar.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, garlic does
activate certain detoxification

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.340 align:middle line:90%
pathways.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:57.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's certainly on the
list of herbs and spices

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:90%
that we certainly recommend.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.600 align:middle line:84%
It looks like there is an
association, a pretty dramatic

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
association with respect to wine
consumption with lowered risk

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:84%
of Alzheimer's, developing
Alzheimer's, but in a very

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.520 align:middle line:90%
narrow range.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.370 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
one glass of wine

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.650 align:middle line:84%
per day for women
and only up to two

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.720 align:middle line:90%
glasses of wine per day in men.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:90%
Lower than that, higher risk.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:90%
Higher than that, higher risk.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.740 align:middle line:84%
We call this a U-shaped curve,
meaning there's a sweet spot,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.510 align:middle line:84%
meaning there's a
perfect amount--

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.630 align:middle line:84%
not perfect-- but an
ideal amount of alcohol,

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:34.350 align:middle line:84%
in this case, wine
specifically, consumption

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:37.460 align:middle line:84%
that would be beneficial, we
would think, for the brain.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:42.010 align:middle line:90%


00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
most valuable things

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.853 align:middle line:84%
to consider if you're wanting
to engage some form of activity

00:10:47.853 --> 00:10:49.270 align:middle line:84%
that you think is
going to be good

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:53.330 align:middle line:84%
for your brain is to get into
something that is two-handed.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.310 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.370 align:middle line:84%
Because that is a process
by which information

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.780 align:middle line:84%
has to go from one
side to the other.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot
of incorporation

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.590 align:middle line:84%
of data that has to happen when
you're involved in fingering

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
the chords on your
left hand while you're

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.130 align:middle line:84%
picking on the right
hand, playing the piano,

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.130 align:middle line:84%
doing things that
involve two sides.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
I think that diet is probably
the most important input

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.430 align:middle line:84%
as it relates to charting
our brains' destiny.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.690 align:middle line:84%
There are obviously lots
of brain superfoods,

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.710 align:middle line:84%
but I think in our
modern times, it's

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:31.040 align:middle line:84%
more about what you
choose to avoid.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.920 align:middle line:84%
It's more about
recognizing what foods

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.590 align:middle line:84%
are most threatening for
brain health and heart

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.480 align:middle line:84%
health and endocrine health and
metabolic health, all the same.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:43.150 align:middle line:84%
There's no brain healthy diet
that's not good for your heart.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.650 align:middle line:84%
There's no brain
healthy diet that's

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.490 align:middle line:84%
going to not necessarily
be good for your diabetes.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.310 align:middle line:90%
It's all the same.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.000 align:middle line:90%
How could it be otherwise?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000 align:middle line:90%
So food is the biggest input.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.960 align:middle line:84%
And you cannot exercise
away a crappy diet.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm telling you, exercise
is fundamentally important,

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:00.690 align:middle line:84%
but it's not on the
top of the list.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.810 align:middle line:90%
We do need to exercise.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.450 align:middle line:84%
We do need to pay attention to
all these parameters like sleep,

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.330 align:middle line:84%
like exercise, like
limiting stress.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:11.210 align:middle line:84%
But diet is on the
top of the list.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:17.130 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.730 align:middle line:84%
But now we know that
seemingly disparate parts

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.540 align:middle line:84%
of the body like the
gut and the brain

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:23.550 align:middle line:90%
are actually intimately related.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.990 align:middle line:84%
We're just beginning to gain an
understanding as to how intimate

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:84%
that relationship really is
to think that we can leverage

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:35.000 align:middle line:84%
interventions related to the
gut to have an outcome that

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.330 align:middle line:90%
can relate to mood.
