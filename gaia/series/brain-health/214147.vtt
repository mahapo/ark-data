separately and not interrelated

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.240 align:middle line:90%
at all.

It's a Descartes kind
of machine-based idea

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.730 align:middle line:90%
about how the body works.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.940 align:middle line:84%
But now, we know that seemingly
disparate parts of the body,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.290 align:middle line:84%
like the gut and the brain, are
actually intimately related.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
The gut is influencing
the brain constantly.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.060 align:middle line:84%
And truly, what comes
out of the brain

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.750 align:middle line:90%
influences how the gut works.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And that comes
from, for example,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.310 align:middle line:84%
the various
microorganisms that live

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.500 align:middle line:84%
within the gut and the various
chemicals that they produce,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.610 align:middle line:84%
as well as direct connections
of the gut to the brain.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
We're just beginning to gain an
understanding as to how intimate

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.110 align:middle line:84%
that relationship really
is, from an evolutionary

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.620 align:middle line:84%
perspective, and how our
modern world is reflected

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.400 align:middle line:90%

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.250 align:middle line:84%
We know, for example, that
depression is primarily

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.690 align:middle line:90%
an inflammatory disease.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:84%
As such, we can begin
to look at depression

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and lump it into
other categories

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
like cardiovascular
disease, certainly

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.740 align:middle line:84%

Alzheimer's type, type II

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.630 align:middle line:90%
diabetes, obesity, overweight.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.200 align:middle line:84%
These are all primarily
inflammatory disorders.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.670 align:middle line:84%
When we recognize then that
depression, for example,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.350 align:middle line:84%
is primarily inflammatory,
it explains to us

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
a lot of things--
why people who have

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.430 align:middle line:84%
underlying
gastrointestinal issues

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.310 align:middle line:84%
are far more prone
to inflammation

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.270 align:middle line:90%
and, therefore, depression.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.820 align:middle line:10%
So this notion that depression
is so highly influenced

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.200 align:middle line:10%
by inflammation and inflammation
can have its genesis in the gut,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.160 align:middle line:10%
really begins to
open the door for us

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:10%
to think that we can leverage
interventions related to the gut

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.513 align:middle line:10%
to have an outcome that
can relate to mood.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's is fundamentally
an inflammatory disorder

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.470 align:middle line:84%
of the brain and clearly
is related to disturbances

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.230 align:middle line:90%
in the gut bacteria.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So as we try to
explore and understand

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.750 align:middle line:84%
this relationship between the
gut bacteria and something far

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.540 align:middle line:84%
apart, the brain and how
the brain is functioning

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.240 align:middle line:84%
and how the brain may be
resistant to developing

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.360 align:middle line:84%
Alzheimer's or may be at
risk for Alzheimer's, it's

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.940 align:middle line:84%
a bit of a stretch
for a lot of people.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.670 align:middle line:84%
We tended to, again, want to
compartmentalize body parts,

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.600 align:middle line:84%
but the reality is that
what is going on in the gut

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.460 align:middle line:84%
is influencing every
part of the body.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And as it relates to that
fundamental mechanism called

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.610 align:middle line:84%
inflammation, probably,
there's no organ

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
in the body that is much as
sensitive to inflammation

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.260 align:middle line:90%
as is the brain.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:84%
So to connect two
very important dots,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.050 align:middle line:84%
our brain health, our
risk for Alzheimer's, is

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
very much dependent upon
the health, functionality,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.140 align:middle line:84%
and diversity of
our gut bacteria.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.470 align:middle line:84%
And once we get our arms
around that understanding,

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.500 align:middle line:84%
then we have a
platform from which

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
we can understand things
like, for example,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.540 align:middle line:84%
the dramatic increase risk of
developing Alzheimer's in people

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.020 align:middle line:84%
who are aggressively toxifying
their gut by taking drugs,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.355 align:middle line:84%
for example, like
proton pump inhibitors.

00:03:37.355 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:10%

people seem to think they need

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.380 align:middle line:10%
to be taking have a dramatic,
damaging effect upon the gut

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.850 align:middle line:10%
bacteria and are dramatically
associated with an increased

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:10%
risk for the development of a
disease for which we have no

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.890 align:middle line:10%

more interesting thing

about these proton pump
inhibiting drugs that, again,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.730 align:middle line:84%

can eat crappy food.

I mean, that's the
messaging that we get.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.460 align:middle line:10%
And new research
demonstrates that there

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.480 align:middle line:10%
is a pretty robust increase in
the body of a chemical called

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.220 align:middle line:10%
uric acid.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:10%
Well, we now recognize that uric
acid is profoundly inflammatory

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.460 align:middle line:10%
in the human body, compromises
mitochondrial function--

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:10%

they simply measured
the uric acid levels

and then followed these
people for 12 years.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:84%

would do a cognitive assessment

of these individuals.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.530 align:middle line:84%
And what they found after the
12-year study done in Japan was

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.370 align:middle line:84%
that those individuals who had
a higher level of uric acid

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:84%
at the very beginning of the
study were found to have about

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.080 align:middle line:84%

developing full-blown

increased risk of developing

room at the time of being
delivered by c-section.

significant increased risk

of immune-related issues in
children born by c-section.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.510 align:middle line:84%

much higher levels of risk as it

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And we actually
treated this young man

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.400 align:middle line:84%
by taking away
something from his gut

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.970 align:middle line:84%
that was leading to issues
in the gut with respect

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.590 align:middle line:84%
to inflammation, increased
gut permeability.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And what we ended up doing for
him was taking out a chemical

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.140 align:middle line:90%
called gluten.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Who knew?

00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Gluten is very disruptive
in many people,

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.410 align:middle line:84%
not just in people
with celiac disease.

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:16.370 align:middle line:84%
But there's a large
segment of our population

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.090 align:middle line:84%
who has what has been
called non-celiac gluten

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:84%
sensitivity, described in the
Journal of the American Medical

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Association.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.050 align:middle line:84%
I think it's so
valuable to understand

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:30.830 align:middle line:84%
that we have such a
powerful tool in our toolbox

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:84%
that's largely been
ignored, as it relates

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.350 align:middle line:84%
to keeping the brain able
to do what our brains need

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:38.870 align:middle line:84%
to do so we can
involve ourselves

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:84%
day-to-day in our worlds, and
that is pay attention to what's

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.440 align:middle line:90%
going on in the gut.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, it relates to
the health of our gut bacteria.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.940 align:middle line:84%
Anything that can
threaten the gut bacteria

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.740 align:middle line:84%
will ultimately
play out in terms

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.070 align:middle line:84%
of threatening a person's
ability to cognitively

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:56.700 align:middle line:90%
participate in life.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to be very
careful about the drugs

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.150 align:middle line:84%
that we take, the foods that we
choose to consume, and recognize

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:84%
that these gut bacteria
are holding our brain

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.492 align:middle line:90%
function in their little hands.

00:10:08.492 --> 00:10:11.796 align:middle line:90%
[CALM MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:11.796 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.460 align:middle line:84%
Gluten, specifically, the
alpha-gliadin part of gluten,

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.260 align:middle line:90%
causes gut permeability.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:23.420 align:middle line:90%
That's the big issue here.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:27.000 align:middle line:90%
