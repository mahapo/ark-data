[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:23.335 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.335 --> 00:00:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing that made me get
into juicing above anything

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.830 align:middle line:90%
else was my own health.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Most people in this
industry, you'll find,

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.450 align:middle line:90%
are not here by accident.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.533 align:middle line:84%
But they're here because
they were ill themselves.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.002 align:middle line:84%
And I had some
chronic conditions.

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:36.210 align:middle line:84%
I was covered from head to
foot, literally, in a skin

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.922 align:middle line:90%
disorder called psoriasis.

00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to the point-- it's
hard to imagine now, of course,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.887 align:middle line:84%
because my skin is
very, very clear--

00:00:42.887 --> 00:00:44.970 align:middle line:84%
but I couldn't even wear
a pair of jeans otherwise

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.703 align:middle line:90%
my skin would crack.

00:00:46.703 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:90%
It was to that extent.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it was hard to
find clear patches of skin.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.135 align:middle line:84%
It covered my neck,
all of my face.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And it was hard to live with
because people didn't really

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.790 align:middle line:84%
understand the condition,
and even today, they don't.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle line:90%
I also had quite bad eczema.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:84%
Eczema and psoriasis are seen
as different kind of diseases,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:90%
if you will.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.519 align:middle line:84%
And that covered the back of my
knees more than anything else.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.050 align:middle line:84%
The challenge that
I had with that

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.940 align:middle line:84%
was, the body tends to repair a
lot quicker overnight than when

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.570 align:middle line:84%
you're running around
during the day.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.175 align:middle line:84%
So I would sometimes sleep, and
my knees would kind of curl.

00:01:17.175 --> 00:01:19.050 align:middle line:84%
And then, unfortunately,
that would heal over

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:90%
during the night.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.520 align:middle line:84%
So I'd wake up in the morning
and straighten my leg,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and it would just
crack and and pus.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.330 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, as if I hadn't
already got enough problems,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.580 align:middle line:84%
they decided to give
me asthma as well.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:90%
But not just asthma.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, again, there are
varying degrees of all diseases.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.480 align:middle line:84%
I had very severe
asthma to the point

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.080 align:middle line:84%
I was taking the ventolin
inhaler, the asthma spray,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.510 align:middle line:84%
anything up to 14 to
16 times every day.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.452 align:middle line:90%
That was the blue one.

00:01:46.452 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
But I also had the
brown mom, which

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:90%
was the steroid-based one.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.180 align:middle line:90%
On top of the asthma--

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.570 align:middle line:84%
so of course, I couldn't
breathe, if I moved,

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.670 align:middle line:90%
my skin would crack.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.580 align:middle line:84%
On top of that, I
also had hay fever.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, for anybody who
thinks hay fever is just

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.573 align:middle line:84%
this slightly itchy eye
kind of ailment or disease,

00:02:06.573 --> 00:02:07.740 align:middle line:90%
there is a massive spectrum.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.930 align:middle line:90%
I had real hay fever.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I mean real hay
fever to the point

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.450 align:middle line:90%
where you can't go outside.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.640 align:middle line:84%
You have to lock yourself
in a room airtight,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.290 align:middle line:84%
try and find a public
building with air conditioning

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.170 align:middle line:84%
because you're streaming,
your head is muzzy,

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.823 align:middle line:90%
you can't even move.

00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't help
myself, of course,

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:90%
because I was a heavy smoker.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I would smoke anything
from 40 to 60 cigarettes

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.480 align:middle line:90%
every single day.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.950 align:middle line:90%
I was also a very heavy drinker.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm from Britain.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So you know, roll
with the punch.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I also eat anything providing
it wasn't green, genuinely.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
Anything that looked green
or remotely healthy for you,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.675 align:middle line:84%
I had this preconceived idea
that it wouldn't taste good,

00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:51.475 align:middle line:90%
for one.

00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:52.680 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't satisfy me any.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.600 align:middle line:90%
And life's too short.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.810 align:middle line:84%
So that combination, the
whole thing combined,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
led me to eventually do
something about my condition.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:84%
One of the main reasons why
obesity has gotten out of hand

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:84%
completely, not just in
America, but throughout most

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:90%
of Western society--

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.500 align:middle line:84%
and as you know, it is
penetrating areas of the globe

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.840 align:middle line:84%
that it never used
to penetrate before.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.610 align:middle line:84%
The main reason,
above all else-- yes,

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.400 align:middle line:90%
you can cite lack of exercise.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:84%
You can cite the fact that
we are eating more on the go.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.230 align:middle line:84%
But fundamentally, the biggest
cause of obesity bar none

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:90%
is the food itself.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Or, when I say food, what I
mean is, quote unquote, food.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.780 align:middle line:84%
We have been conditioned to
believe that providing it

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.360 align:middle line:90%
contains certain elements--

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:84%
usually protein, carbohydrates
and the right fats--

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:90%
that that deems as food.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.870 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, like
the tobacco companies,

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:84%
if you go back in the
late 60s, early 70s,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.530 align:middle line:84%
and they knowingly added more
nicotine to cigarettes in order

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.000 align:middle line:90%
to make them addictive.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.460 align:middle line:84%
And the way that
cigarettes are addictive

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.097 align:middle line:84%
is much in the same way that
certain foods are addictive.

00:04:10.097 --> 00:04:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Because you've got
highly intelligent people

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.250 align:middle line:84%
throughout the entire globe
who are getting morbidly obese.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.140 align:middle line:84%
They know full well that the
foods that they are consuming

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.550 align:middle line:90%
will kill them.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.580 align:middle line:84%
And that's not just eventually,
but on a daily basis,

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:84%
they are dying a
very slow death.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.670 align:middle line:84%
These are, as I reiterate,
highly intelligent individuals.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.140 align:middle line:90%
Why are they doing this?

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.000 align:middle line:84%
They know why they
shouldn't do it,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.320 align:middle line:84%
but they have no idea
why they are doing it.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.200 align:middle line:90%
And I want to clarify something.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean let's look back
to when I was five or six

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.910 align:middle line:84%
years old, or seven
years old, what

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
was the true causes of me
reaching for this chocolate

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.020 align:middle line:90%
bar?

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.860 align:middle line:90%
It is so simple.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Look, I used to smoke 40
to 60 cigarettes a day.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.200 align:middle line:90%
Why did I?

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, I started smoking
when I was at school.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.070 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.060 align:middle line:90%
Because I had a bad day?

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I didn't come back to
my mom and say, hey mom,

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I had a bad day at school,
can I have a cigarette?

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.890 align:middle line:90%
That never occurred.

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I started because other
people around me were doing it

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:84%
and it looked cool,
for cigarettes.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.255 align:middle line:84%
One cigarette led
to a chain reaction,

00:05:10.255 --> 00:05:12.630 align:middle line:84%
that then led to another one
and another one and another.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, look, I said to
people, look, the reason

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.610 align:middle line:84%
why I smoke is
because I enjoy it.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Because I love it.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.670 align:middle line:84%
But I would hit my
head on the pillow

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
praying that I'd wake up and
become a non-smoker every day.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Every smoker on earth would
love to not want cigarettes

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.780 align:middle line:90%
if they could.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.000 align:middle line:84%
There is an invisible
prison, if you will,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.658 align:middle line:84%
that captures people
in the nicotine trap.

00:05:31.658 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:84%
The need for a cigarette is
only caused by the last one

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:84%
because, when you
have a cigarette,

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:84%
nicotine goes in
your system, nicotine

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.000 align:middle line:84%
has to get out of your
system or you will die.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.577 align:middle line:84%
The nicotine content from
just one single cigarette,

00:05:43.577 --> 00:05:45.410 align:middle line:84%
if it was injected
directly into your brain,

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.493 align:middle line:90%
will kill you immediately.

00:05:46.493 --> 00:05:48.327 align:middle line:84%
But they don't want to
kill you immediately.

00:05:48.327 --> 00:05:50.570 align:middle line:84%
They want to draw out the
process for at least 60,

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:84%
70 years to get as
much money as they can.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, look, I'm talking
about cigarettes.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.928 align:middle line:90%
Clearly, this is about food.

00:05:56.928 --> 00:05:59.220 align:middle line:84%
However, you need to understand
the nature of addiction

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.768 align:middle line:84%
so that we can go
on to the food.

00:06:01.768 --> 00:06:03.560 align:middle line:84%
When somebody has a
cigarette after they're

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.900 align:middle line:90%
withdrawing from nicotine.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.200 align:middle line:84%
They light a cigarette, it
replaces the nicotine back

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.820 align:middle line:90%
into their bloodstream.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:90%
And they feel better.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:12.890 align:middle line:90%
They feel good.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.930 align:middle line:84%
But that's like putting
on a pair of tight shoes

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.580 align:middle line:84%
to get the pleasure
of taking them off.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.118 align:middle line:84%
Look, when you take off tight
shoes, it's pleasurable.

00:06:20.118 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:84%
But nobody in their right
mind would deliberately

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:84%
walk around in tight shoes
just to get the pleasure

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:90%
of taking them off.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.413 align:middle line:84%
Now, food is so subtle,
nobody knows what's going on.

00:06:29.413 --> 00:06:30.830 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, what
people are doing

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.640 align:middle line:84%
is causing themselves massive
amounts of aggravation.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.260 align:middle line:84%
Look, if I was in
the food industry,

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.490 align:middle line:90%
what am I looking to do?

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:90%
I want to sell you more food.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.190 align:middle line:90%
That's all I want to do.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, how can I do that?

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine I'm selling
nuts to squirrels.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.200 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.637 align:middle line:84%
I set up a little
stool, then I'm

00:06:46.637 --> 00:06:48.470 align:middle line:84%
going to go and sell
some nuts to squirrels.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:49.270 align:middle line:90%
How can I do this?

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, I can either make
them run for 20 hours a day

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:84%
so they get hungrier, because
they're burning more fuel.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Or cleverly, I can manipulate
it--this is the point--

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.950 align:middle line:84%
I can manipulate the chemical
structure of their food

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.140 align:middle line:84%
so it now becomes not
fulfilling, but empty.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.910 align:middle line:84%
But gives the impression when
they very first ingest it

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.130 align:middle line:84%
that it is the most fulfilling
thing they've ever had.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a loss that feels
like they're winning.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.992 align:middle line:84%
So when a smoker has a
cigarette, they feel better.

00:07:18.992 --> 00:07:20.450 align:middle line:84%
All they're doing
is ending the low

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.980 align:middle line:90%
the previous cigarette created.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.010 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all smokers
are only smoking

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.493 align:middle line:84%
to feel like a
non-smoker already feels.

00:07:27.493 --> 00:07:29.660 align:middle line:84%
They're trying to get back
to the same position they

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.860 align:middle line:90%
were in before they started.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.600 align:middle line:84%
The challenge we have with
food, or in particular, sugar,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.520 align:middle line:84%
is because it's illegal to
give a child a cigarette

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:90%
and so it should be.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.250 align:middle line:84%
It is illegal to
give a child alcohol.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:44.630 align:middle line:84%
It's not illegal to give a child
white refined sugar or refined

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:90%
fat.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.950 align:middle line:84%
Food, as far as I'm
concerned, kills more people

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.560 align:middle line:84%
than all drugs on
earth combined.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And, again, to go back to the
beginning, people know this.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Why are highly intelligent
people not stopping?

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.050 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't know
the nature of the trap.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.692 align:middle line:84%
They believe when they stop,
they're giving something up.

00:08:02.692 --> 00:08:04.400 align:middle line:84%
And if they believe
they're giving it up,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.960 align:middle line:90%
they're making a sacrifice.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:84%
So look, if I'm causing
you an aggravation,

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.600 align:middle line:90%
a massive aggravation--

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.780 align:middle line:90%
I give you an apple.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.310 align:middle line:90%
You've got low blood sugar.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.555 align:middle line:84%
I give you an apple,
it won't touch you.

00:08:15.555 --> 00:08:16.430 align:middle line:90%
It won't do anything.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.840 align:middle line:90%
You'll eat, you'll go--

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.940 align:middle line:84%
there are so many people
that look in the fridge,

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.820 align:middle line:84%
they see salad, they
even see lean proteins.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.863 align:middle line:84%
And they think there
is no food in it

00:08:24.863 --> 00:08:26.280 align:middle line:84%
because that's not
what they want.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.250 align:middle line:90%
It's like a drug.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.500 align:middle line:90%
And it's not just like a drug.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It is a drug, but
it's a subtle drug.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.262 align:middle line:84%
And the vast majority of
the Western world's society

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:90%
are hooked on the drug.

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:37.923 align:middle line:84%
What they need are not lectures
on what they already know.

00:08:37.923 --> 00:08:40.090 align:middle line:84%
All they need is a route
out of the trap they're in.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:45.170 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:49.632 align:middle line:84%
The main reason, above all, why
diets fundamentally don't work,

00:08:49.632 --> 00:08:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and cannot work for the
vast majority of people

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:55.610 align:middle line:84%
in the world, is because people
consider diet to be the food

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:84%
that they're consuming
rather than the mentality.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:84%
If you go from-- and
this is how simple it is.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
If you cut down on
any food, regardless

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.340 align:middle line:84%
of what the food is, if
you say, as of Monday--

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:07.340 align:middle line:90%
it's always a Monday.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.510 align:middle line:84%
Everyone's always going
on a diet on a Monday.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:13.430 align:middle line:84%
They tend to consume enormous
amounts of food which

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:15.500 align:middle line:90%
from Friday to the Sunday.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.925 align:middle line:84%
Sunday, they tend
to go shopping,

00:09:18.925 --> 00:09:21.050 align:middle line:84%
and they put in stuff that
they wouldn't ordinarily

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:24.797 align:middle line:84%
have ever put in, fruits and
vegetables, as an example.

00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:84%
Even though, it's funny, because
I've been on a million diets.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And in the past, when
I went on those diets,

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle line:84%
and I was overweight myself, I
would arrive at the checkout.

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.720 align:middle line:84%
And when I'd get there, on the
day before my diet would begin,

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
I would have so
much healthy stuff.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:90%
I'd be so proud of my trolley.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:84%
And I'd want the checkout
person to say something.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.540 align:middle line:90%
Look, this isn't ordinary.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Look at how much fruit
and veg I've got.

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.190 align:middle line:84%
I would then start on
the Monday morning.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.820 align:middle line:84%
And I would immediately
start to feel deprived.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:55.048 align:middle line:84%
And I think about this, listen,
I could have gone sometimes

00:09:55.048 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:84%
until 2 o'clock in the afternoon
not even thinking about food

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:01.010 align:middle line:84%
when I wasn't on a diet, without
consuming any food sometimes.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd grab some water,
or sometimes nothing.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:90%
I hadn't thought about it.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:10.400 align:middle line:84%
But the very second I told my
brain that I was on a diet,

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.330 align:middle line:90%
I went into the mode of can't.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.580 align:middle line:90%
What I mean by can't is this--

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:84%
C-A-N-T. Constant and
Never-Ending Tantrum.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:90%
It's all it is.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:84%
It's constant and it's never
ending, is the tantrum.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:26.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you go through, I
want that, but I can't have it

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:28.760 align:middle line:84%
to I can have it,
but I don't want it,

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.107 align:middle line:84%
there's a massive
paradigm shift.

00:10:31.107 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, look, if I say,
here's a box of chocolates,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.240 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And let's just say you want
to stop eating chocolates.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.510 align:middle line:84%
But you started having the odd
one in front of me like this.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.340 align:middle line:90%
No, help yourself.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:90%
And you're just eating them.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine you're
just eating them.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And then I said to you, oh my,
who gave you those chocolates?

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:84%
These were experimental
chocolates,

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.590 align:middle line:84%
they were never
meant to be there.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Listen, I got a load of
cockroaches, I minced them up.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.810 align:middle line:84%
I put them in with
a load of glass

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.410 align:middle line:84%
and a half of full of cow's
milk, I did some chemicals,

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I covered them with chocolate
I put them in a box called joy.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:84%
And then what I did is, I cut
some advertising Life Sucks

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Without Joy in it.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.830 align:middle line:84%
So you were sold on
the whole concept

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:11.155 align:middle line:90%
of this box of chocolates.

00:11:11.155 --> 00:11:12.530 align:middle line:84%
But I said to you,
fundamentally,

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:15.020 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately,
there's cockroaches

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:17.977 align:middle line:84%
is in there because
cockroaches, once ingested,

00:11:17.977 --> 00:11:20.060 align:middle line:84%
gives off a certain chemical
to make you eat more.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.852 align:middle line:84%
And I am the owner of
the biggest cockroach

00:11:21.852 --> 00:11:23.238 align:middle line:90%
farm in the entire world.

00:11:23.238 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's my interest to
make you eat cockroaches.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.738 align:middle line:84%
But you won't eat
cockroaches, so I

00:11:26.738 --> 00:11:29.000 align:middle line:84%
have to hide them in amongst
the chocolate in order

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.875 align:middle line:90%
for you to have them.

00:11:29.875 --> 00:11:31.610 align:middle line:84%
So sorry, but that's
what they are.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.340 align:middle line:84%
You ask anybody now if
they have a genuine desire

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.048 align:middle line:84%
to eat that chocolate,
they would say no.

00:11:36.048 --> 00:11:37.548 align:middle line:84%
Now here's the point
I want to make.

00:11:37.548 --> 00:11:39.920 align:middle line:84%
If it's a physical addiction--
this is what people say,

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.290 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't help it!

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, then,
therefore, they still

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.080 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't be able to
help it if they went

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.970 align:middle line:90%
for that particular chocolate.

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:48.838 align:middle line:90%
But if you remove the desire--

00:11:48.838 --> 00:11:50.380 align:middle line:84%
because it is a
point I want to make.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.610 align:middle line:90%
Diets require willpower.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.120 align:middle line:84%
If you successfully want to
change the way you eat forever,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.310 align:middle line:84%
it does not require willpower,
contrary to popular belief.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:07.450 align:middle line:84%
In fact, anything that you
think of that sounds logical

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.930 align:middle line:84%
when it comes to addiction
is the complete opposite.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:14.170 align:middle line:84%
For example, if you have
two children in a room,

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:84%
one strong-willed and
one is very weak-willed,

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and they both had
a chocolate bar.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And moreover, they both really
wanted that chocolate bar.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.630 align:middle line:84%
If you removed the
mass market chocolate

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:28.625 align:middle line:84%
bar from both of those children
and said, you can't have it,

00:12:28.625 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
who's going to keep
their tantrum going

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:33.220 align:middle line:84%
for longer at a
greater intensity

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.050 align:middle line:90%
to make sure they get it back?

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.170 align:middle line:84%
Bizarrely, it is the
stronger-willed child.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:40.360 align:middle line:84%
The weaker-willed child
will accept the situation

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.560 align:middle line:90%
a lot sooner.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:84%
So why is it, then,
strong-willed people

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.280 align:middle line:90%
have such difficulty on diets?

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:84%
It's because, look, if
it's the same two kids,

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:50.830 align:middle line:84%
there's the chocolate
in the room,

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.150 align:middle line:90%
and they had no desire for it.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.390 align:middle line:90%
They just didn't want it.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.765 align:middle line:84%
They had no desire
for it at all.

00:12:54.765 --> 00:12:56.470 align:middle line:90%
And you said, you can't have it.

00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:84%
They'd look you
and say, OK, fine.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:90%
Don't want it anyway.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.590 align:middle line:84%
If you took the chocolate
away from them and said,

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:03.940 align:middle line:90%
you're never having it.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.980 align:middle line:90%
Who would now be in a tantrum?

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:90%
None of them.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:07.900 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it doesn't
require willpower

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.110 align:middle line:90%
if you have no desire.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:15.280 align:middle line:84%
The key is, look, if you remove
the genuine desire for these

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:19.100 align:middle line:84%
jumped-up, junkie,
sugar-loaded--

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.590 align:middle line:84%
it's not food, for
crying out Bananas.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.880 align:middle line:90%
If you see it for what it is--

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.910 align:middle line:90%
I was obese.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.070 align:middle line:90%
I was overweight.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:28.600 align:middle line:90%
And I thought this was food.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:30.967 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I saw fruits and
vegetables as non-foods.

00:13:30.967 --> 00:13:32.800 align:middle line:84%
I figured you're better
off having a shorter

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:90%
life but a much happier one.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.570 align:middle line:90%
Now I can see it clearly.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:37.370 align:middle line:90%
It's a trick.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.412 align:middle line:90%
It's a very clever trick.

00:13:38.412 --> 00:13:40.360 align:middle line:84%
But once you see,
it becomes easy.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.495 align:middle line:90%
Diets are hard.

00:13:41.495 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Because every single
day, you say, I want it,

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.300 align:middle line:90%
but I can't have it.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.390 align:middle line:84%
And the theory is,
you force yourself

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.630 align:middle line:84%
into a self-imposed
mental tantrum in the hope

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:84%
that if you suffer the mental
tantrum for long enough, one

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.220 align:middle line:84%
day, time will
solve the problem,

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.502 align:middle line:90%
time will heal the wound.

00:13:55.502 --> 00:13:56.960 align:middle line:84%
And you'll eventually
reach a stage

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.960 align:middle line:84%
where you can tell the world,
have you heard the news?

00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.510 align:middle line:90%
I've done it.

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:00.310 align:middle line:90%
I've kicked it.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.450 align:middle line:90%
I'm free of the junk food.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.910 align:middle line:84%
But when does that
actually happen?

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.193 align:middle line:90%
Two days down the line?

00:14:05.193 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:84%
What are you doing, sitting
around waiting for this?

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.460 align:middle line:84%
People go to sleep to
get rid of the craving.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.960 align:middle line:84%
If the craving is only in
your mind, 95% of addiction

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:90%
is psychological.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.510 align:middle line:90%
5% is physical.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Gambling is 100%
psychological and they still

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:22.690 align:middle line:84%
go through the same
withdrawal process.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:90%
So good and bad news.

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:28.510 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is, we have the
vast majority of our world

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:35.700 align:middle line:84%
hooked on sugar-loaded food,
refined fat-loaded food,

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:84%
junkie type food that
actually, incidentally,

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.950 align:middle line:84%
they are manipulating in the
way the tobacco companies

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.050 align:middle line:90%
did many, many years ago.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.590 align:middle line:90%
And we'll find this out.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.540 align:middle line:90%
We will find this out.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.740 align:middle line:90%
We're starting to do that now.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But we will find this
out in the future.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And they'll look back,
and they'll go, hey,

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.790 align:middle line:90%
I remember hearing that.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.020 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing is going on.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.228 align:middle line:90%
That's the bad news.

00:14:54.228 --> 00:14:55.770 align:middle line:84%
We've got obesity
and everything that

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.860 align:middle line:84%
goes along with it,
from type 2 diabetes,

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.450 align:middle line:90%
and so on and so forth.

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.690 align:middle line:84%
The good news is, contrary
to what everybody thinks,

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:07.433 align:middle line:90%
it's mind-blowingly simple.

00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:08.850 align:middle line:84%
And I know that
I'll get the hairs

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:84%
on the back of some
people's necks going up,

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.040 align:middle line:84%
but it's mind-blowingly
simple to remove yourself

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:15.390 align:middle line:90%
from the diet trap.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:16.320 align:middle line:90%
And it is a trap.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.970 align:middle line:90%
Of course it's a trap.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.010 align:middle line:84%
Because it goes
against your logic.

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:90%
You can't do it.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:84%
I think very few people--
they reckon something

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.830 align:middle line:90%
like 95% of all diets fail.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.750 align:middle line:90%
That means that 5% succeed.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:29.160 align:middle line:90%
5%.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.200 align:middle line:90%
5%!

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.730 align:middle line:90%
But that's diet mentality.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.850 align:middle line:84%
You know, 100% succeed
if they're not on a diet,

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:84%
they change what
they eat and they see

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:90%
the other food for what it is.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:90%
That is true success.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.800 align:middle line:90%


00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.570 align:middle line:84%
The main reason why people come
to me more than anybody else,

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.580 align:middle line:84%
I guess, is because I've studied
addiction more than anything

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:90%
else.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.885 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not part of the
state the obvious brigade.

00:15:53.885 --> 00:15:55.760 align:middle line:84%
And so the idea is, I
don't say-- if somebody

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.220 align:middle line:84%
is overweight, the last
thing they want to hear

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.260 align:middle line:84%
is somebody saying,
by the way, you're

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:84%
overweight, as if they
don't know this fact.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:04.670 align:middle line:84%
And then, moreover,
you say to them,

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:06.470 align:middle line:84%
if you ate fruits and
vegetables, cut down

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.270 align:middle line:84%
on the rubbish and
you did more exercise,

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.740 align:middle line:90%
you would be slim and healthy.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, just because somebody
is thick physically,

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.720 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't make
them thick mentally.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And the more people
realize that these

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.523 align:middle line:84%
are normal human beings that are
simply caught in a trap, then

00:16:19.523 --> 00:16:20.323 align:middle line:90%
the better.

00:16:20.323 --> 00:16:22.370 align:middle line:84%
But of course, most people
come because they're

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:84%
suffering either
from excess weight

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.840 align:middle line:90%
or because I had psoriasis.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.150 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of you think,
well, he managed

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.072 align:middle line:84%
to clear his psoriasis, or
his eczema, or his asthma.

00:16:32.072 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:84%
A lot of these people when
they first come, they say,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.340 align:middle line:84%
give me a juice to
cure my psoriasis.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.360 align:middle line:84%
And the human body
doesn't work that way.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:90%
It is holistic, of course

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:45.460 align:middle line:84%
And you treat all
diseases as one.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:90%
And it is corny.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest,
I was so skeptical.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.058 align:middle line:84%
I would never believed,
and even what I teach.

00:16:51.058 --> 00:16:52.350 align:middle line:90%
I've got to be honest with you.

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:53.735 align:middle line:90%
I was a science kind of guy.

00:16:53.735 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:84%
I was kind of like,
well, has it been proven?

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it logical?

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And I went through God
knows how many doctors.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm not knocking doctors
at all, of course.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Far from it, in fact.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.128 align:middle line:90%
They more than have their place.

00:17:07.128 --> 00:17:09.170 align:middle line:84%
But the ones that I had,
and you can't generalize

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.837 align:middle line:84%
by whole industry, they
were part of the state

00:17:12.837 --> 00:17:13.670 align:middle line:90%
the obvious brigade.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.503 align:middle line:90%
That's all they did.

00:17:14.503 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
They said, Jason, you've
got severe asthma.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.810 align:middle line:90%
And you're a smoker.

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:20.329 align:middle line:84%
If you stop smoking, your
asthma would improve.

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:21.290 align:middle line:90%
Oh, really?

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.062 align:middle line:90%
You friggin' genius!

00:17:23.062 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:90%
You know, I'm addicted.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:26.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm dying to stop smoking.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:29.450 align:middle line:84%
And this guy tells me as if I
[? hadn't ?] [? cocked ?] it.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I hadn't realized!

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And the amount of
people that do that--

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.825 align:middle line:84%
they say, I'm eating too much,
I'm smoking, I'm drinking.

00:17:35.825 --> 00:17:36.700 align:middle line:90%
That was another one.

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.213 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you're drinking
heavily, Jason.

00:17:38.213 --> 00:17:40.130 align:middle line:84%
Do you know that's like
a fire in your system,

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:42.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's causing some of
your skin to be on fire.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:44.110 align:middle line:90%
Just stop drinking.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.340 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes, again, silly me.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:47.780 align:middle line:90%
I'll just stop drinking alcohol.

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.060 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not an addictive
substance, I'll just stop it.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.268 align:middle line:90%
And the same with cigarettes.

00:17:51.268 --> 00:17:53.540 align:middle line:84%
But more with food, they do
it all the time with food.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:57.110 align:middle line:84%
So people, I think,
come to see me--

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.322 align:middle line:90%
thank the lord they do--

00:17:58.322 --> 00:18:00.280 align:middle line:84%
because I don't treat
them like they're idiots.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I say, look, by the way, I
know what you're going through.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.360 align:middle line:84%
And listen, we're
not going to go back

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.130 align:middle line:84%
and redress to what
happened when you were five

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.350 align:middle line:84%
and you turned to a burger
because you got told off.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:84%
That's not the reason why
you're eating burgers!

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.990 align:middle line:84%
The reason why
you're eating burgers

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.175 align:middle line:84%
is because they're
loaded with fat, salt

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:14.990 align:middle line:84%
and sugar, and a certain
combination which

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.995 align:middle line:90%
manipulates your mind.

00:18:15.995 --> 00:18:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And you don't understand
why you're doing it.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:18.760 align:middle line:84%
You know why you
shouldn't do it,

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:84%
but you don't know
why you are doing it.

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So they get a little
bit of respite.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I do the practical
stuff to say, look, here's

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.000 align:middle line:90%
the fruits and veg.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:84%
But they know-- this is the
point-- they know there's not

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:30.140 align:middle line:84%
a person watching this that
couldn't write themselves

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:33.080 align:middle line:90%
their own perfect diet plan.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.010 align:middle line:90%
Everybody can.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.600 align:middle line:90%
They know what to do.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.910 align:middle line:84%
They don't do what they know,
not because they're lazy,

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.860 align:middle line:84%
not because they're
pigs, or anything else.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.450 align:middle line:84%
It's because they're in this
subtle, genius confidence trick

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:90%
that deludes so many people.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.873 align:middle line:84%
And it's like a Rubik's cube,
that little cube in the 80s,

00:18:49.873 --> 00:18:51.290 align:middle line:84%
that you had to
get all the sides.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.820 align:middle line:90%
It seems impossible.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.370 align:middle line:84%
Because everybody's trying
to do it the same way.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.070 align:middle line:84%
But the very second you
have the instructions

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and you decide to
follow them, then it

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:01.850 align:middle line:90%
becomes incredibly easy.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I
suppose, if anything,

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.150 align:middle line:90%
I show them the easy way.

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Stop driving yourself cuckoo.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.410 align:middle line:90%
And don't take it too serious.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.950 align:middle line:90%
And we don't over-study.

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.360 align:middle line:90%
That's the key as well.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.340 align:middle line:84%
Listen, even the top
scientists in the world

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:17.810 align:middle line:84%
can only tell you, roughly, 30%
to 40% of what's in an apple.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.060 align:middle line:84%
And they'll try and
name that stuff too.

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:21.750 align:middle line:90%
They got some great names too--

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:23.810 align:middle line:90%
bioflavonoids, riboflavin.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:25.760 align:middle line:84%
And they'll have
vitamins and minerals.

00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.210 align:middle line:84%
And because so many
people can gurgitate,

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.300 align:middle line:84%
and they've read books
upon books upon books,

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.390 align:middle line:84%
they think that they know more
about this apple than whoever

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:37.900 align:middle line:90%
created the damn apple.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.350 align:middle line:90%
You will never ever know.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:40.807 align:middle line:90%
It works synergistically.

00:19:40.807 --> 00:19:42.515 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I teach
sometimes-- people

00:19:42.515 --> 00:19:44.450 align:middle line:84%
say, well, if it's so
perfect, why do you juice?

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.658 align:middle line:84%
Because, look, it's not so
much you are what you eat.

00:19:46.658 --> 00:19:48.333 align:middle line:84%
It's you are what
you manage to absorb.

00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:50.750 align:middle line:84%
And the vast majority of people
have a beaten-up digestive

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:90%
system through years of rubbish.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.980 align:middle line:84%
And so we just show them, look,
it is the juice of the fiber

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.000 align:middle line:84%
that feeds you--
of course it is--

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:84%
In the vast majority of
fruits and vegetables.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So if we can remove
that juice and make

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.130 align:middle line:84%
it flow through the
blood, then you're

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:84%
feeding yourself on
a cellular level.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And to be honest, most people
are overfed and undernourished.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:84%
They're overfed
and undernourished.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.900 align:middle line:84%
If I'm feeding myself tons
of junk, and my body says,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.473 align:middle line:90%
hey, I asked for some food.

00:20:17.473 --> 00:20:19.390 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, I thought
I just gave it to you.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:20.600 align:middle line:84%
That's according
to the advertisers.

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.250 align:middle line:84%
The conditioners, the
brain-washers, and also

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
the people that
manipulate the food.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
So I put this stuff
in and it says, look,

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.217 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have to
turn this into something.

00:20:27.217 --> 00:20:28.790 align:middle line:84%
So it starts talking
to each other.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:30.748 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine how much
goes into the stomach.

00:20:30.748 --> 00:20:32.390 align:middle line:90%
The stomach wants an apple, man.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.480 align:middle line:84%
You put Christmas
dinner in there!

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.080 align:middle line:84%
This is what on
earth are you doing?

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.830 align:middle line:84%
It then has to try
and shove it into 30

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:42.033 align:middle line:90%
foot worth of intestinal tract.

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:43.700 align:middle line:84%
So it pushes it down
into the intestine.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Intestine says to the
stomach, what are you doing?

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.170 align:middle line:84%
This is not my fault,
talk to head office.

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:49.712 align:middle line:84%
So head office then
goes, look, we're

00:20:49.712 --> 00:20:51.480 align:middle line:84%
trying to ask him for
some decent stuff,

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.270 align:middle line:84%
but this other stuff
keeps coming in.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.800 align:middle line:90%
The whole thing is a mess.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So the idea is to give
the body what it needs,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.660 align:middle line:84%
but to do in a way
that's easy for you.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:03.367 align:middle line:84%
So I said, look, if you
can't eat, I couldn't eat it.

00:21:03.367 --> 00:21:04.700 align:middle line:90%
That's why I've gone to juicing.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.620 align:middle line:84%
People say, you know, you
should eat some cabbage.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.310 align:middle line:90%
Never!

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.110 align:middle line:90%
I hate it.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.200 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.840 align:middle line:84%
Listen, even after a long day at
work now, I still don't think,

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I can't wait to get home
to eat some raw broccoli.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:90%
Call me Mr. Picky.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:17.350 align:middle line:90%
It's never going to happen.

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And for the vast majority of the
living, breathing real world,

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.870 align:middle line:90%
that's not going to happen.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:24.990 align:middle line:84%
So I say if you can't
eat it, drink it.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.440 align:middle line:84%
And because the vast majority
is water-rich, organic content

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.240 align:middle line:90%
food.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.470 align:middle line:84%
You feed your body on a cellular
level, you're no longer hungry.

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I didn't go on a
diet in the end.

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
All that happened was, I
went, how come I'm not hungry?

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:37.580 align:middle line:90%
I don't get it.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.250 align:middle line:84%
I'm having a couple of these
juices a day, and they're rich.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, hang on, I
was overfed, undernourished.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.150 align:middle line:84%
Feed the body what
it needs, you're

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:84%
no longer as hungry as
you were, so you eat less.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.598 align:middle line:84%
So the chances are
that you live longer.

00:21:50.598 --> 00:21:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And when I say live longer,
I don't mean how long

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:90%
you may live, but I mean today.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.550 align:middle line:84%
If your day ends at 5:00 PM, you
have a short life expectancy.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.070 align:middle line:84%
Because, to me, life
expectancy means what do

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:90%
I expect to do in my life today.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And if I expect to fall asleep
at 6:00 in front of the telly

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.390 align:middle line:84%
and watch 4:00 hours
of TV, I already

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.682 align:middle line:90%
have a short life expectancy.

00:22:09.682 --> 00:22:12.140 align:middle line:84%
It's not about how you can get
run over by a bus next week,

00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:13.307 align:middle line:90%
it's what we're doing today.

00:22:13.307 --> 00:22:18.260 align:middle line:90%


00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.450 align:middle line:84%
Juicing is important
for two main reasons.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.230 align:middle line:84%
People often say to me, well,
why don't we just eat it?

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:25.800 align:middle line:84%
That's a good
question, first of all.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.850 align:middle line:90%
Why don't we just eat it?

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:27.650 align:middle line:90%
We don't.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.067 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
thing to address.

00:22:29.067 --> 00:22:30.800 align:middle line:84%
The point is is that
most people don't

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.140 align:middle line:84%
consume enough raw
fruits and vegetables

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.290 align:middle line:90%
and a spectrum of colors.

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:90%
So that's the number one.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, most
people are overfed

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.820 align:middle line:90%
and they're undernourished.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.540 align:middle line:84%
And their digestive
system is beaten up

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:48.260 align:middle line:84%
over years and years of years
of trying to digest, extract

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.210 align:middle line:84%
the nutrients and
dispose of the waste

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:90%
of the wrong kind of foods.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:84%
As I said, you have 30 feet
worth of intestinal track.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:59.950 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of that now has got,
literally, crap, if you will,

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:00.750 align:middle line:90%
stuck to it.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So when people say, hey,
you're full of it, man, often,

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.313 align:middle line:84%
they really are
literally full of it.

00:23:06.313 --> 00:23:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And it affects the
way they think.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:09.063 align:middle line:90%
It affects everything about you.

00:23:09.063 --> 00:23:11.330 align:middle line:84%
When you feel light, you
feel you feel kind of good.

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.830 align:middle line:84%
But if you've got
all that blockage,

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.920 align:middle line:84%
and your cells are crying out
for genuine vitamins, minerals

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:84%
macro and micro-nutrients,
and what's coming in

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.960 align:middle line:84%
are not the things it's is
asking for, it will turn.

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.870 align:middle line:84%
Because it's an ingenious
survival machine,

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.990 align:middle line:84%
it will turn it
into usable fuel.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:90%
But at what cost to the body?

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:32.180 align:middle line:84%
Moreover, though, it hasn't
been fed efficiently.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:90%
So what will happen is.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Although you feel
bloated, you can

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:39.323 align:middle line:84%
feel hungry at the same
time as feeling bloated.

00:23:39.323 --> 00:23:41.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's why you can't
really understand it,

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.260 align:middle line:90%
the average person.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.750 align:middle line:84%
How come I'm still
hungry is a question

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:84%
that people keep on
asking themselves?

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.330 align:middle line:90%
I should be full.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:48.380 align:middle line:90%
I'm obese.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.250 align:middle line:90%
I'm overweight.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just because
the stomach is expanding,

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.250 align:middle line:90%
you need to fill the stomach.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:54.170 align:middle line:84%
It isn't because the
nutrients contained

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.390 align:middle line:84%
in those kind of
foods are lacking.

00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And until you give the body
what it fundamentally requires,

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
it will keep sending
signals to the brain saying

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.470 align:middle line:90%
that I'm hungry.

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:06.320 align:middle line:84%
So what I found was,
when I lived on--

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I lived on nothing
but juice for a long time.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.260 align:middle line:84%
But raw food diet, if
you will, or a majority,

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.870 align:middle line:84%
you find that after a very
short period of time--

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and the biggest question
that people asked me,

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:20.740 align:middle line:84%
one is, how come
I wasn't hungry?

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.330 align:middle line:84%
I was on juices for seven
days, hungry for the first two

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:24.410 align:middle line:90%
or three days.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.590 align:middle line:84%
That was withdrawal from
the drug-like like food.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Once that was gone and
they had a genuine hunger,

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.750 align:middle line:90%
then it became very easy.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:37.240 align:middle line:84%
Juicing is important as well
because it's easy to absorb.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.900 align:middle line:90%
It's the ultimate fast food.

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
People say, I want
a fast food diet?

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Get juicing.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.660 align:middle line:84%
Because if you think
the average dinner

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:48.350 align:middle line:84%
will take anything from 4 to
16 hours to leave the stomach

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.560 align:middle line:84%
and for the body
to try and digest.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.980 align:middle line:84%
Freshly extracted juice is a
15 minute nutrient expresse

00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:56.780 align:middle line:90%
to health.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:57.602 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:24:57.602 --> 00:24:59.060 align:middle line:84%
It goes into your
stomach, requires

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.710 align:middle line:90%
15 minutes, into your cells.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And also, let's
be fair, you will

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.175 align:middle line:84%
consume far more raw
fresh vegetables--

00:25:06.175 --> 00:25:08.300 align:middle line:84%
the kind of vegetables you
wouldn't ordinarily eat.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:10.430 align:middle line:90%
Brussels sprouts, for example.

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:12.920 align:middle line:84%
I hate them, some
people like them.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
They've got a natural
insulin regulator,

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.740 align:middle line:84%
very good for diabetes,
as an example.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.220 align:middle line:84%
Juiced mixed with a
little bit of pineapple,

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.390 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of lime.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.860 align:middle line:84%
You can jazz up some of these
juices so they taste divine.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:30.035 align:middle line:90%


00:25:30.035 --> 00:25:31.660 align:middle line:84%
This almost seems
like an exaggeration.

00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.320 align:middle line:84%
The level of
improvements that people

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.110 align:middle line:84%
have when they go on nothing
but a juice cleanse-- and it's

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:38.890 align:middle line:90%
not a juice fast.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.288 align:middle line:90%
You can only fast on water.

00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:41.830 align:middle line:84%
You've got to
remember, this is food.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.205 align:middle line:84%
People say, oh,
is it like a meal

00:25:43.205 --> 00:25:46.320 align:middle line:84%
when they have an avocado-based
vegetable smoothie.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.780 align:middle line:90%
Is this a meal replacement?

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.200 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a meal.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.000 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.042 align:middle line:90%
How do you define a meal?

00:25:52.042 --> 00:25:53.040 align:middle line:90%
It's nutrients.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:56.580 align:middle line:84%
Once they're living on nothing
but that for seven days,

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I have seen, I would say,
just about everything.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And I know it like an
exaggeration, but everything.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.220 align:middle line:84%
We're talking from
irritable bowel syndrome,

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Crohn's disease, skin improving,
asthma getting better,

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.380 align:middle line:90%
hay fever.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.830 align:middle line:84%
You almost name the
disease of the body, name

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:15.690 align:middle line:90%
the element, whatever it is.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:18.290 align:middle line:90%
The body only wants to heal.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.200 align:middle line:90%
It's crying out to heal.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.450 align:middle line:90%
That's what it wants to do.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:23.880 align:middle line:90%
It wants to naturally detoxify.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Only the body can
detoxify itself providing

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.280 align:middle line:90%
there's no toxicity coming in.

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise there's
a little backlog.

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:84%
So can you imagine, you remove
refined sugars, refined fats,

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.120 align:middle line:84%
junkie type foods, all
the wheat, the breads,

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.910 align:middle line:84%
the man-made foods
going into your body.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
sudden overnight, you

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.890 align:middle line:84%
replace it with high water
content-- that's what it is.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Pure high water content.

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.570 align:middle line:84%
Organic, rich, mineral,
vitamin-rich fuel

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:54.270 align:middle line:84%
going into every single
cell in your body

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.690 align:middle line:84%
in the most easy to
digest and absorb form,

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.810 align:middle line:84%
and with a spectrum of
colors, with everything

00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.330 align:middle line:90%
the body requires.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.080 align:middle line:84%
What do you think the
body is going to do?

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.700 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to
reject this at all.

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.690 align:middle line:84%
It's going to look and
say, now I'm on board.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.190 align:middle line:90%
Now you're good to me?

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Let me shine for you.

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And it will literally feed
the body, remove the toxicity.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.710 align:middle line:90%
The skin starts to glow.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.180 align:middle line:90%
The eyes start to shine.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.565 align:middle line:84%
The hair starts
to grow and shine.

00:27:23.565 --> 00:27:24.440 align:middle line:90%
I've seen everything.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.780 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we have had three
different letters over

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:30.090 align:middle line:84%
the years-- not that
many, but three of these--

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:32.430 align:middle line:84%
where we had people
in their latter years

00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:35.700 align:middle line:84%
who said that their hair
started to turn back from gray

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.240 align:middle line:90%
to black.

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.630 align:middle line:84%
Now I had to phone these
people because I thought, no, I

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:41.050 align:middle line:90%
don't believe that.

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.870 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to just
buy any of this stuff.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I need to find out,
is this happening?

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, we run retreats,
and we live on nothing

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:48.450 align:middle line:90%
but juice for seven days.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And I'm on the retreat a
hell of a lot of the time.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:52.880 align:middle line:90%
I see people that come--

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.063 align:middle line:84%
I saw a woman with
arthritis, couldn't walk.

00:27:55.063 --> 00:27:55.980 align:middle line:90%
I mean, barely walked.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.780 align:middle line:84%
She came to the family
as the last resort.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.400 align:middle line:90%
We're always the last resort.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.590 align:middle line:90%
We're the alternative.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:03.240 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the last
resort is, what?

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.482 align:middle line:84%
Nature's finest fruits and
vegetables is the last resort?

00:28:06.482 --> 00:28:07.440 align:middle line:90%
The world's gone crazy.

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.310 align:middle line:90%
Seriously.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.685 align:middle line:84%
But, whatever,
we're last resort.

00:28:09.685 --> 00:28:11.610 align:middle line:90%
[? She comes, ?] and this lady--

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:13.900 align:middle line:84%
in fact, the mountain
that we now use

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:17.490 align:middle line:84%
is a relatively small mountain
on this private island

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.020 align:middle line:90%
that we had at the time.

00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And we now name it
Monica's Mountain.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Because by the end
of just seven days--

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.260 align:middle line:84%
this is a woman that could
barely walk, barely move--

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.650 align:middle line:84%
she walked up to this
mountain to the top.

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:34.135 align:middle line:84%
It's now called Monica's
Mountain because of Monica!

00:28:34.135 --> 00:28:35.010 align:middle line:90%
I've seen everything.

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:36.680 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, skin
improving, this.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.320 align:middle line:84%
But you know, it's the
unquantifiable stuff.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.670 align:middle line:84%
It's the unquantifiable
stuff that, really, science

00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:43.470 align:middle line:90%
can't gauge it.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.547 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can see
if skin is improved.

00:28:45.547 --> 00:28:47.130 align:middle line:84%
You can see if
somebody's lost weight.

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.410 align:middle line:90%
That's a given by the way.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:49.620 align:middle line:90%
That's an absolute given.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, listen,
people will always

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.140 align:middle line:84%
lose in between seven to 14
pounds in weight within a week.

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Because the body just says,
get rid of this junk now.

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:01.770 align:middle line:84%
It might not all be fat,
but that's what they do.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.420 align:middle line:84%
You can tell if
someone's lost weight.

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.580 align:middle line:84%
You can tell if their
skin condition is gone,

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.167 align:middle line:84%
or if their arthritis is in
hands have started to improve.

00:29:08.167 --> 00:29:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Irritable bowel
syndrome has improved.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:12.370 align:middle line:84%
Their Crohn's
disease, everything.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:14.740 align:middle line:90%
But it's the spark, man.

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.480 align:middle line:84%
Genuinely, that
spark, that life,

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.730 align:middle line:84%
that fire that we
had when we were

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.150 align:middle line:84%
kids that just affects
every single element

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:23.740 align:middle line:90%
of your world and your glow.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:27.850 align:middle line:90%


00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.685 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, there's just
one single sentence

00:29:30.685 --> 00:29:31.810 align:middle line:90%
that can change everything.

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.760 align:middle line:84%
You can go to a
million seminars.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.160 align:middle line:90%
You can read 10,000 books.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, one
sentence does it all.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:39.910 align:middle line:90%
And it did for me.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.310 align:middle line:84%
There was an
87-year-old man living

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.270 align:middle line:90%
on the streets of London.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:47.290 align:middle line:84%
He was homeless,
effectively a tramp.

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:48.890 align:middle line:90%
They did a documentary on him.

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:49.690 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.140 align:middle line:90%
Because he looked amazing.

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.650 align:middle line:90%
87 years old.

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.120 align:middle line:90%
He had all his own hair.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.423 align:middle line:90%
He had all his own teeth.

00:29:56.423 --> 00:29:58.090 align:middle line:84%
He kept them in a
bag-- no, he still had

00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.980 align:middle line:84%
[? those ?] on his
head and in his mouth.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.363 align:middle line:90%
This guy looked incredible.

00:30:01.363 --> 00:30:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
what's your secret?

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.405 align:middle line:84%
Because he was always
whistling around,

00:30:04.405 --> 00:30:08.740 align:middle line:84%
he got really well-known around
Barrack Street area in London.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And they said,
what's your secret?

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:14.020 align:middle line:84%
He said, I never,
ever eat junk food.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And they looked at
him like he was crazy.

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.140 align:middle line:90%
This guy is homeless.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And they said, what do you
mean you never eat junk food?

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, I could see where
the documentary filmmaker

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.990 align:middle line:90%
was going, first of all.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.640 align:middle line:84%
He was looking,
like, in disbelief.

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Like, first of all,
I don't believe you

00:30:28.870 --> 00:30:30.828 align:middle line:84%
because you're homeless,
you don't have choice.

00:30:30.828 --> 00:30:32.800 align:middle line:84%
He said to him, you
don't have the choice.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:34.330 align:middle line:90%
He said, I do have the choice.

00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:36.250 align:middle line:90%
He said, I have all this choice.

00:30:36.250 --> 00:30:38.230 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten to know the
people down the market.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:39.647 align:middle line:84%
They give me fruits
and vegetables

00:30:39.647 --> 00:30:40.564 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the day.

00:30:40.564 --> 00:30:42.314 align:middle line:84%
I've gotten to know
the restaurant people,

00:30:42.314 --> 00:30:43.600 align:middle line:90%
they give me lean proteins.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And they said, I suppose when
bread is delivered at 4 o'clock

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.120 align:middle line:84%
in the morning to shops,
you steal a loaf of bread.

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.330 align:middle line:84%
He said, I never steal, ever
steal, and I don't eat bread.

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:56.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, I told you,
I don't eat junk food.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And then, he came from the usual
perspective, the perspective

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:03.425 align:middle line:84%
of the vast majority of people
out there, thinking, OK, look,

00:31:03.425 --> 00:31:05.050 align:middle line:84%
I understand you're
in a position where

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.750 align:middle line:90%
you can choose what to eat.

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So you can choose
not to eat junk food.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.190 align:middle line:90%
But then he asked him, but why?

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:16.440 align:middle line:84%
As if all the fun is consuming
the junk and the rubbish.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.730 align:middle line:84%
He said, come on,
you're homeless?

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Come on, you might as
well enjoy yourself a bit.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, well what
on earth makes you

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.710 align:middle line:90%
think I'm not enjoying myself?

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:25.510 align:middle line:90%
I love my life.

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:27.730 align:middle line:84%
And you're filming
me so don't forget.

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.225 align:middle line:90%
Because I look good.

00:31:29.225 --> 00:31:31.350 align:middle line:84%
He said, I look good because
I don't eat junk food.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And then this 80 year old
man said this sentence.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.620 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.365 align:middle line:90%
It changed my world completely.

00:31:38.365 --> 00:31:40.240 align:middle line:84%
He looked at him, he
said, I'll tell you why.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:44.620 align:middle line:84%
The one fundamental reason why
I never, ever eat junk food

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.650 align:middle line:84%
is because, unless I
look after my body,

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:50.420 align:middle line:90%
I'll have nowhere to live.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And I remember [? to ?]
to hear that again.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:84%
He said, unless I
look after my body,

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:56.010 align:middle line:90%
I'll have nowhere to live.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:59.210 align:middle line:84%
I'll have somewhere to
survive, but nowhere to live.

00:31:59.210 --> 00:32:01.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is the world
we got caught up in now.

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Because people, now
they're thinking,

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.360 align:middle line:84%
I want to own the
biggest mansion.

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.220 align:middle line:90%
You own nothing!

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.190 align:middle line:90%
It's a 90 year holiday.

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Don't get deluded into
thinking you own the car,

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.390 align:middle line:90%
you own the house.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.120 align:middle line:84%
It's all part of this
mass game is all it is.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.540 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that determines
where you live is here.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.620 align:middle line:90%
You live in your head.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.800 align:middle line:90%
You live in your body.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.850 align:middle line:84%
I know billionaires that
would gladly trade every ounce

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:25.760 align:middle line:84%
of money they had if I could
just turn the clock back

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.358 align:middle line:90%
in order to get their health.

00:32:27.358 --> 00:32:29.150 align:middle line:84%
People say, if you
haven't got your health,

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:30.050 align:middle line:90%
you've got nothing--

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.510 align:middle line:90%
as they eat another burger.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:34.367 align:middle line:84%
The thing is, talking
about it is one thing,

00:32:34.367 --> 00:32:35.450 align:middle line:90%
doing it is another thing.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:37.533 align:middle line:84%
But remember, if you don't
look after your body,

00:32:37.533 --> 00:32:38.700 align:middle line:90%
you'll have nowhere to live.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:43.380 align:middle line:90%


00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.180 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to illustrate why
detoxing is so important,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.170 align:middle line:84%
and the difference between
health and disease.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:51.510 align:middle line:84%
Whether you've got a
medical background or not,

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.063 align:middle line:84%
this is the simplest
way I can think

00:32:53.063 --> 00:32:55.230 align:middle line:84%
of for showing the difference
in health and disease,

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and why detoxification
is imperative,

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.610 align:middle line:84%
and to remove the pollution
of my environment.

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:01.410 align:middle line:90%
So here we go.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Look, we've got fish in
some clear water here.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Just imagine the fish is
in its own environment

00:33:05.670 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:90%
its natural environment.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.503 align:middle line:84%
This clearly is not its
natural environment,

00:33:08.503 --> 00:33:10.290 align:middle line:84%
but you you can use
your imagination.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's going
about its business,

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.623 align:middle line:84%
eating what it is meant
to eat, going around

00:33:13.623 --> 00:33:14.940 align:middle line:90%
in this clean environment.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.250 align:middle line:90%
Happy little fish.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.340 align:middle line:84%
But then, what happens
if we start pouring in,

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.660 align:middle line:84%
for example, some
white refined sugar?

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we start pouring
in some different fats.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we start adding
in-- you get the idea.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Imagine, the
burgers, the fries--

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:35.340 align:middle line:84%
the years upon years of neglect,
and cigarettes, and alcohol,

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:36.720 align:middle line:90%
and all kinds of stuff.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine we now change
that and it becomes very, very

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:41.880 align:middle line:90%
dirty.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.370 align:middle line:90%
The fish is a survival machine.

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:47.790 align:middle line:84%
It is designed to
survive above all else.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Health comes second.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:51.552 align:middle line:90%
Survival is number one.

00:33:51.552 --> 00:33:53.760 align:middle line:84%
So what will happen if it's
swimming around like this

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.030 align:middle line:84%
and it started, for example,
to get a little cough.

00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:58.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the weird thing.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:02.222 align:middle line:84%
If it started to cough, it
would go and see a doctor.

00:34:02.222 --> 00:34:03.930 align:middle line:84%
So it goes and sees
a little fish doctor.

00:34:03.930 --> 00:34:07.700 align:middle line:84%
The fish doctor says, you
need some syrup for the cough.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.219 align:middle line:84%
Now, one look at the
cause of the problem,

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.110 align:middle line:90%
just looking at the symptom.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:15.290 align:middle line:84%
Then, after a little while,
you put some syrup in,

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:16.350 align:middle line:90%
it stops coughing.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:17.820 align:middle line:90%
The fish is happy again.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.903 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't understand there
is any problem at all.

00:34:19.903 --> 00:34:22.050 align:middle line:84%
It starts swimming around
in all the crap again.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:24.217 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is,
the little fin at the back

00:34:24.217 --> 00:34:25.710 align:middle line:90%
now can't move properly.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.918 align:middle line:84%
It's got kind of
arthritis at the back.

00:34:27.918 --> 00:34:29.460 align:middle line:84%
So he goes along to
his doctor again.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.909 align:middle line:84%
He says, hey, doctor,
look, I can't move my fin.

00:34:32.909 --> 00:34:35.580 align:middle line:84%
He says, that's OK,
here's some cortisone.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.339 align:middle line:84%
I'm just going to inject your
fin, and now it can move again.

00:34:38.339 --> 00:34:39.139 align:middle line:90%
Oh, thank you.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.040 align:middle line:90%
Thank you very much, doctor.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.929 align:middle line:84%
What happens if it
starts to bloat up?

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:46.350 align:middle line:84%
What happens if it starts to
get psoriasis on the skin?

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:48.389 align:middle line:84%
Look, the point I'm
making is this--

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:51.449 align:middle line:84%
this analogy usually
takes a lot longer.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:52.800 align:middle line:90%
The point is this though--

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:56.730 align:middle line:84%
if it's swimming around
in a polluted environment,

00:34:56.730 --> 00:35:01.260 align:middle line:84%
then the body will use its
filtration system to survive.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.810 align:middle line:84%
But at what cost to
his daily health?

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:07.070 align:middle line:84%
But then, we're not
looking at the symptom.

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.270 align:middle line:84%
So we're not looking at
the cause of the problem.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:11.270 align:middle line:84%
What we're doing is trying
to treat the symptom.

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:13.380 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is, if
it gets really bad, then

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.650 align:middle line:90%
we go to the doctor.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:16.380 align:middle line:84%
The doctor will get
some tablets and then

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:19.200 align:middle line:84%
the tablets will then go
into the bowl as well.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.070 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that all
medical drugs are toxic.

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:24.570 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they
are, to some degree.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:26.410 align:middle line:84%
They're all poisons
to some degree.

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So you add to the
whole environment--

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.560 align:middle line:84%
Look, I've done talks with
the little goldfish in schools

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.930 align:middle line:90%
with children as young as six.

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And I say, if you want to help
this fish out, to get better,

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.370 align:middle line:90%
what would you do?

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:42.780 align:middle line:84%
And they all shout in
unison, clean the water!

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.360 align:middle line:90%
It seems so blatantly obvious.

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.940 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:49.740 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.930 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible to slow
down the aging process.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:53.070 align:middle line:90%
It's impossible.

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:84%
The amount of people trying to
do that with different creams,

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.575 align:middle line:84%
and sauces, and
everything else--

00:35:56.575 --> 00:35:57.930 align:middle line:90%
even with natural foods.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:00.930 align:middle line:84%
They make claims to say,
this will help slow down

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:01.950 align:middle line:90%
the aging process.

00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:04.290 align:middle line:84%
I have never nor
will I ever say that

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:06.930 align:middle line:84%
any particular organic,
rich juice will ever

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:08.370 align:middle line:90%
slow down the aging process.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.240 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.890 align:middle line:84%
Because all you can do is do a
million things to speed it up.

00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.008 align:middle line:84%
You can't do anything
to slow it down.

00:36:14.008 --> 00:36:16.050 align:middle line:84%
And that's why people are
trying to slow it down.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.008 align:middle line:84%
Because they do too many
things to speed it up.

00:36:18.008 --> 00:36:20.730 align:middle line:84%
You drink caffeine, you
have white, refined sugar,

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:23.910 align:middle line:84%
you have these full stimulants,
speed up the adrenal glands.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:25.020 align:middle line:90%
It's fight or flight.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.990 align:middle line:84%
Your body thinks it's been
attacked all the time.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.380 align:middle line:84%
Of course it's going to
speed up the aging process.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.047 align:middle line:84%
But you can't really
do anything to slow

00:36:32.047 --> 00:36:33.870 align:middle line:84%
it down other
than, have a guess,

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.330 align:middle line:84%
getting rid of the rubbish
and then having what

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:37.770 align:middle line:90%
the body fundamentally requires.

00:36:37.770 --> 00:36:38.570 align:middle line:90%
It's that easy.

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:42.570 align:middle line:90%


00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:43.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:36:43.370 --> 00:36:45.770 align:middle line:84%
The right mental state
is of vital importance.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But not positive mental
attitude so much.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.368 align:middle line:84%
That plays a part,
of course it does.

00:36:51.368 --> 00:36:53.285 align:middle line:84%
You really need to see
the nature of the traps

00:36:53.285 --> 00:36:55.370 align:middle line:84%
for what they are, and
then you're already

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:56.690 align:middle line:90%
in the right frame of mind.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Let me give an example.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:00.860 align:middle line:84%
To take an old analogy
and go one stage further--

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.230 align:middle line:84%
a fly trying to
get out of a room.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:05.480 align:middle line:84%
The window is open,
slightly ajar.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:10.220 align:middle line:84%
The stupid fly will go along
and hit the window over and over

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.790 align:middle line:90%
and over and over again.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, anybody watching the fly
would say, you're a stupid fly.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:17.340 align:middle line:90%
There's clearly another way.

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.240 align:middle line:84%
However, the fly doesn't
see the other way.

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.660 align:middle line:84%
What, though, if the advice
that you gave the fly was this--

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.250 align:middle line:84%
you're clearly not
positive enough.

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.220 align:middle line:90%
You need to change your mindset.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:29.600 align:middle line:90%
I know what I'll do.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you get on a plane and
come to a positive thinking fly

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:34.760 align:middle line:90%
seminar.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:37.900 align:middle line:84%
What I want you to do,
Mr. Fly, is walk along

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:42.340 align:middle line:84%
2000 degrees of burning hot
coals, yelling some mantra.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.590 align:middle line:84%
And at the end, jump up and down
like you can achieve anything.

00:37:45.590 --> 00:37:47.600 align:middle line:90%
Then, go back to the glass.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.680 align:middle line:90%
Now the fly is pumped.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:50.480 align:middle line:90%
It's ready.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.350 align:middle line:90%
It's booming.

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:54.290 align:middle line:84%
It's in a state
like never before.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:57.710 align:middle line:84%
It goes up to the window,
hits the glass over and over

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.420 align:middle line:84%
and over again, says
that seminar was rubbish.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.020 align:middle line:84%
What the seminar didn't
necessarily teach the fly--

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.740 align:middle line:84%
getting to a
positive state, yes.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.308 align:middle line:84%
But if you're still going
about something the right way,

00:38:09.308 --> 00:38:10.850 align:middle line:84%
you're still not
going to achieve it.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I can get in the best frame of
mind possible to do the Rubik's

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:15.940 align:middle line:90%
cube.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.107 align:middle line:90%
That's not going to help me.

00:38:17.107 --> 00:38:18.190 align:middle line:90%
I need the instructions.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:20.973 align:middle line:84%
I may be in this frame where
I think, yes, I can do it.

00:38:20.973 --> 00:38:22.390 align:middle line:84%
But all you need
to do is realize,

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.800 align:middle line:90%
there's always another way.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's the key thing
above anything else.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:27.760 align:middle line:90%
There is always another way.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Think, not hard, but smart.

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:32.590 align:middle line:84%
There's always an
easy way to do it

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:34.010 align:middle line:90%
if you know what you're doing.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.220 align:middle line:84%
So yes, attitude is
very, very important.

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.180 align:middle line:90%
Of course it is.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.460 align:middle line:84%
But you need the right
attitude to find the right way.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.260 align:middle line:90%
Not just the positive attitude.

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.690 align:middle line:84%
That alone very rarely,
if ever, succeeds.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:48.650 align:middle line:90%


00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:50.160 align:middle line:84%
It seems really odd
in today's world

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.930 align:middle line:84%
that we have more
than ever before,

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.780 align:middle line:84%
and yet we think in
a very lax state.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.420 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by that is,
there is a world of abundance

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.370 align:middle line:90%
and an attitude of lack.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.545 align:middle line:84%
And the challenge when you
have an attitude of lack

00:39:01.545 --> 00:39:03.420 align:middle line:84%
is that you never feel
grateful for anything.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.090 align:middle line:84%
If you don't feel grateful for
anything, you feel unfulfilled.

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And most people are
bitching and moaning

00:39:08.670 --> 00:39:10.933 align:middle line:84%
about having to do
certain things instead

00:39:10.933 --> 00:39:13.350 align:middle line:84%
of getting the opportunity
to-- in fact, even just saying.

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Even when I say it,
I feel different.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.050 align:middle line:84%
If I say, I have to go and
eat fruits or vegetables today

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.450 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to, I get the
opportunity to go to any shop

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:23.250 align:middle line:90%
that I want.

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.917 align:middle line:84%
I know I live in a
world where I can get

00:39:24.917 --> 00:39:26.084 align:middle line:90%
the finest produce on earth.

00:39:26.084 --> 00:39:27.625 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even going
to think about it.

00:39:27.625 --> 00:39:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to walk 20
miles to go and get it.

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:30.780 align:middle line:90%
I can just get in my car.

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:32.110 align:middle line:90%
I can walk and get on my bike.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:33.510 align:middle line:90%
I can just go and grab it.

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And I can come home and I've
got the amenities to juice it,

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:38.790 align:middle line:84%
or to eat it, or to steam
it, or whatever it is.

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:40.440 align:middle line:84%
But it's there on
a plate for me.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.360 align:middle line:84%
So I get excited because I
get the opportunity to do it.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.510 align:middle line:90%
Same with moving my body.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:48.730 align:middle line:90%


00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm very fortunate now
that I live my life by a I

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:55.220 align:middle line:84%
get-the-opportunity-to
attitude rather than I can't be

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:56.770 align:middle line:84%
bothered, or I
have to, attitude.

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And the man that really
shaped that for me

00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:59.812 align:middle line:90%
was the late Christopher Reeve.

00:39:59.812 --> 00:40:02.267 align:middle line:84%
This guy was an
incredible mentor

00:40:02.267 --> 00:40:04.100 align:middle line:84%
for many people around
the world, and for me

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.180 align:middle line:90%
in particular.

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.590 align:middle line:84%
I always used to
have an attitude

00:40:06.590 --> 00:40:10.820 align:middle line:84%
with exercising of, oh, well
an hour a day is too much.

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Or I wouldn't exercise
for two or three days.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Since I watched the
late Christopher

00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:17.720 align:middle line:84%
Reeve say a couple
of sentences, I've

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.900 align:middle line:84%
moved my body genuinely
every single day.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.490 align:middle line:84%
In fact, there
won't be a day now

00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:23.860 align:middle line:90%
that I will not move my body.

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.980 align:middle line:90%
What he said was this--

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:27.862 align:middle line:84%
60% of the population
at the time,

00:40:27.862 --> 00:40:29.570 align:middle line:84%
when he was being
interviewed in America,

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:33.180 align:middle line:84%
had just been classed as
either overweight or obese.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And he said the one
thing these people can do

00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:40.340 align:middle line:84%
is the one thing that I go
to bed every night and dream

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.300 align:middle line:90%
and pray that I could do.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.330 align:middle line:90%
And that is to move my body.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:47.360 align:middle line:84%
He said, if you've got the
gift of physical movement

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.080 align:middle line:84%
but you don't use it, he
said, that is an insult to me

00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:53.640 align:middle line:84%
and those people like me
who have lost that gift.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.440 align:middle line:90%
And it is a gift.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.098 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen
as a gift before.

00:40:56.098 --> 00:40:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Normally, it's only
when you lose something

00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:58.960 align:middle line:90%
that you crave it.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.960 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I'm not going
to wait till I lose it.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.768 align:middle line:84%
It's when I wake
up and I can move,

00:41:02.768 --> 00:41:04.310 align:middle line:84%
and I can bounce on
a mini trampoline

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:08.320 align:middle line:84%
or I can play a game of tennis,
I'm so grateful, genuinely.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.390 align:middle line:90%


00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:13.420 align:middle line:90%
Is TV making us fatter?

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.220 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.250 align:middle line:90%
There's no question.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:16.050 align:middle line:90%
Of course it is.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Listen, I've got a theory on
the TV and obesity, genuine.

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.805 align:middle line:90%
It's not so much--

00:41:22.805 --> 00:41:24.180 align:middle line:84%
if you look at it
away from food.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.970 align:middle line:84%
If you just look at it
from a science perspective

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:31.530 align:middle line:84%
on just TVs, and the size--
it's my theory-- the size of TVs

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.330 align:middle line:90%
and the size of human beings.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back in time.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:37.680 align:middle line:84%
So listen, when there
were one channel, two,

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.770 align:middle line:84%
three different TV channels,
and a television screen

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:45.270 align:middle line:84%
was this big, then human
beings were so big.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:48.300 align:middle line:84%
And then what happened was,
we had four or five channels,

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:50.220 align:middle line:90%
then we went to 10 channels.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And then the TV's
got slightly larger.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:84%
We started seeing things
like 22-inch screens.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:middle line:90%
And humans got bigger.

00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, we had more
and more channels.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.810 align:middle line:90%
We are cable TV.

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:04.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we had TV's
that were 40 inches.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:07.185 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is the same as
the waist size of a man that

00:42:07.185 --> 00:42:08.970 align:middle line:90%
was starting to go up and up.

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:11.370 align:middle line:84%
So they went from
like a 32 waist,

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:13.170 align:middle line:84%
and then it's like
they're to 40 inch.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Now, we have TV's, normal.

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Television, not
cinema, this isn't

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.880 align:middle line:84%
in the cinema, normal
televisions that are 60 inches.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:22.310 align:middle line:90%
Some even bigger than that.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.360 align:middle line:84%
But 60 inches in
your front room.

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, I call it
furniture disease.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.380 align:middle line:84%
All we're doing is we're
sitting on furniture, watching

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.960 align:middle line:90%
little bits of furniture.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.280 align:middle line:90%
It's furniture disease.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.623 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody is
overweight and obese, yes,

00:42:34.623 --> 00:42:36.540 align:middle line:84%
it's got something to
do with the food we eat.

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:38.830 align:middle line:84%
But they have fundamental
furniture disease.

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:40.080 align:middle line:90%
What a weird world we live in.

00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.122 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing today?

00:42:41.122 --> 00:42:42.570 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to sell furniture.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:43.530 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing after work?

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm going to sit on
some more furniture instead

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.440 align:middle line:90%
of some more furniture.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:47.690 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing after that?

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:48.400 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm going to
go back into work

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.983 align:middle line:84%
and sit on some more furniture
instead of some more furniture.

00:42:50.983 --> 00:42:53.085 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to do
anything else this weekend?

00:42:53.085 --> 00:42:54.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, I thought I'd go out.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:55.950 align:middle line:84%
Oh, where are you
going out to the cinema

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.117 align:middle line:84%
we can do that I'm going
to sit on on some furniture

00:42:58.117 --> 00:42:59.610 align:middle line:84%
and go watch some
more furniture.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.920 align:middle line:84%
Listen, the body was
designed to move.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.530 align:middle line:84%
Listen, the thing that makes
us sit down more than anything

00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:06.340 align:middle line:90%
else is television.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.730 align:middle line:84%
And we tend to eat more
when we're watching TV too.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:12.690 align:middle line:84%
We get into hypnosis
when we're watching TV.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.610 align:middle line:90%
I don't mean to ban TV at all.

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.310 align:middle line:84%
But there is no question,
there is a direct correlation,

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:21.771 align:middle line:84%
without any question, between
TV watching and obesity.

00:43:21.771 --> 00:43:26.010 align:middle line:90%


00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.560 align:middle line:84%
You already know the best
way for you to lose weight.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, in a way, I could ask,
why have you come to see me?

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.700 align:middle line:84%
I can give you a
pen and paper now.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:34.837 align:middle line:84%
You could write the
ideal exercise plan.

00:43:34.837 --> 00:43:36.420 align:middle line:84%
And you could write
down-- you already

00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:37.925 align:middle line:84%
know that certain
foods are bad for you.

00:43:37.925 --> 00:43:38.920 align:middle line:84%
You know that certain
foods are good for you.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.295 align:middle line:84%
You know if you
cut down on them,

00:43:40.295 --> 00:43:41.740 align:middle line:90%
you're going to lose weight.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:43.365 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, I'm
not going to give you

00:43:43.365 --> 00:43:45.930 align:middle line:84%
just a list of what you need
to do in terms of eating or not

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:46.730 align:middle line:90%
eating.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:47.670 align:middle line:84%
What you need to
is win is to get

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:49.410 align:middle line:84%
your brain into the
right frame, then

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:51.202 align:middle line:84%
we will get your body
into the right frame.

00:43:51.202 --> 00:43:55.940 align:middle line:90%


00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.850 align:middle line:84%
Your body can deal
with those toxins.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.520 align:middle line:90%
You know, normal toxins.

00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But not the level of
toxicity that most people

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:04.065 align:middle line:90%
are shoving in their body.

00:44:04.065 --> 00:44:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I know your history
once we run through it,

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.050 align:middle line:84%
I will guarantee you
that your body is not

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.390 align:middle line:84%
liking the level of
pollution that's coming in.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:14.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's screaming for you to
help it with the detoxification

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.220 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's all it wants.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.970 align:middle line:90%


00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.840 align:middle line:84%
My definition of
addiction is simply this.

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:23.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.230 align:middle line:84%
If the thought of
never doing it again

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:32.120 align:middle line:84%
fills you with an abnormal
fear, then you are hooked.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.430 align:middle line:90%
If it doesn't, you're not.

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:40.880 align:middle line:84%
Example, if my GP said
to me that bananas--

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.150 align:middle line:84%
and I'll tell you
now I love bananas--

00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:48.110 align:middle line:84%
but if he said bananas
caused psoriasis,

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.740 align:middle line:90%
eczema, asthma, obesity.

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.010 align:middle line:84%
And he said I found the cause
of all of your problems,

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:59.310 align:middle line:84%
all you have to do is
stop eating bananas.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would have no
difficulty whatsoever

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:03.720 align:middle line:90%
stopping eating bananas.

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.100 align:middle line:84%
I would be disappointed
because I like them.

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't have
an emotional pull.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.320 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say, have
you heard the news?

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.390 align:middle line:84%
I've managed to go two days
without eating a banana.

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:16.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I said those
words, I've gone two days

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:18.360 align:middle line:90%
without eating a banana.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.233 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't prove I'm in
control of my banana intake.

00:45:21.233 --> 00:45:23.900 align:middle line:84%
It means I have a massive banana
problem by the mere fact I even

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:25.050 align:middle line:90%
have to say it.

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:26.640 align:middle line:84%
You know yourself
if you're addicted

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:30.240 align:middle line:84%
or not by the mere
fact, if you say,

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.370 align:middle line:90%
I find it difficult to stop.

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Here's another statement
you need to understand.

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.210 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have freedom
of genuine choice without

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:41.680 align:middle line:90%
the freedom to also refuse.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.760 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have freedom
of genuine choice without

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.530 align:middle line:90%
the freedom to also refuse.

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you're not free to
refuse sugar on a long term

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.770 align:middle line:84%
basis, and you
feel that there is

00:45:52.770 --> 00:45:56.550 align:middle line:84%
an emotional pull towards that
chocolate towards [? her, ?]

00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:00.220 align:middle line:84%
and you feel there is emotional
pull towards the sugar,

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.410 align:middle line:90%
then you are hooked.

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, it is an invisible prison.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Physically hooked, but
you are mentally hooked.

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:middle line:84%
You become unhooked
the very second

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:11.440 align:middle line:84%
you see it for what it is,
and you don't give it up.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.600 align:middle line:90%
But you get rid of it.

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.850 align:middle line:84%
So there's no sacrifice
being made whatsoever.

00:46:14.850 --> 00:46:19.880 align:middle line:90%


00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.300 align:middle line:84%
Sugar is without question the
cocaine of the food world.

00:46:23.300 --> 00:46:25.850 align:middle line:84%
It is highly addictive, one
of the most highly addictive

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:26.810 align:middle line:90%
drug-like substances.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:28.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's a trick
because, of course,

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.590 align:middle line:90%
we need sugar in its right form.

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.690 align:middle line:84%
So they kind of get away
with hiding that drug

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:34.120 align:middle line:90%
within, quote unquote, food.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.620 align:middle line:84%
And when I say,
quote unquote, food,

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.703 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about just
the white refined sugar

00:46:37.703 --> 00:46:39.770 align:middle line:84%
you add into things,
or on top of things.

00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:42.537 align:middle line:84%
Most things contain sugar
or are sugar, in fact.

00:46:42.537 --> 00:46:44.495 align:middle line:84%
You think of something
like a croissant-- there

00:46:44.495 --> 00:46:46.453 align:middle line:84%
are many people I know
that just say, you know,

00:46:46.453 --> 00:46:47.835 align:middle line:90%
I've gone on a sugar-free diet.

00:46:47.835 --> 00:46:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And they're sitting
there eating a croissant.

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:51.080 align:middle line:90%
And I think, that's sugar.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:52.622 align:middle line:84%
What do you think
is going to happen?

00:46:52.622 --> 00:46:54.860 align:middle line:84%
As soon as it enters the
bloodstream, that is sugar,

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:56.330 align:middle line:90%
or white bread, you know.

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:59.210 align:middle line:84%
Which, white bread,
incidentally, only cockroaches

00:46:59.210 --> 00:47:02.215 align:middle line:84%
will eat white bread in
emergency circumstances.

00:47:02.215 --> 00:47:03.590 align:middle line:84%
You know, this is
quite worrying.

00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:04.390 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go near
something the cockroach is

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.510 align:middle line:90%
on the verge about eating.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:12.240 align:middle line:84%
White bread, certain
pasta, some white rice--

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.450 align:middle line:84%
sugar sugar sugar
is in everything.

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:16.130 align:middle line:90%
And refined fats, of course.

00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:18.980 align:middle line:84%
They want a nice combination
between the two in order

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:20.270 align:middle line:90%
so that you will be hooked.

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:22.070 align:middle line:84%
But that's what causes
you to feel hungry

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:23.028 align:middle line:90%
that you normally feel.

00:47:23.028 --> 00:47:27.590 align:middle line:90%


00:47:27.590 --> 00:47:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So many people are
completely deluded these days

00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:32.390 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that
they are eating

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:34.048 align:middle line:84%
or drinking healthfully
because of how

00:47:34.048 --> 00:47:35.840 align:middle line:84%
they have been conditioned
by, what I call,

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.880 align:middle line:90%
big food and big drink.

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:39.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's very clever, of course.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:41.450 align:middle line:84%
They produce a diet
option of a drink,

00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:43.640 align:middle line:84%
or a diet option
of a certain food.

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.250 align:middle line:84%
Fat free is a label that
came around in the '80s,

00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:50.155 align:middle line:84%
and it's never really gone
away, the anti-fat propaganda.

00:47:50.155 --> 00:47:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got the sugar-free
because people are now

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.170 align:middle line:90%
realizing sugar is just as bad.

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:55.100 align:middle line:90%
Here's a few tips.

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:58.160 align:middle line:84%
If it says
sugar-free, it usually

00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:01.128 align:middle line:84%
means it is loaded with
artificial sweeteners.

00:48:01.128 --> 00:48:02.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean that
it's any better.

00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:04.675 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in many
cases, often worse.

00:48:04.675 --> 00:48:06.050 align:middle line:84%
Some of the
artificial sweeteners

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:08.270 align:middle line:84%
have been proven, not
only to have horrific side

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:10.370 align:middle line:84%
effects over a
long period of use,

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:13.940 align:middle line:84%
but they cause
carbohydrate cravings.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.665 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody
has a diet drink

00:48:15.665 --> 00:48:17.540 align:middle line:84%
and then wonder why
they're not getting thin,

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and why they're craving
even more carbohydrates,

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:23.570 align:middle line:84%
it's because those substances
have been very, very carefully

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:25.408 align:middle line:90%
designed, not to help you--

00:48:25.408 --> 00:48:27.700 align:middle line:84%
you don't honestly think they
want to help you, do you?

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.360 align:middle line:90%
You must not be deluded here.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:32.240 align:middle line:84%
They're into just
selling and marketing.

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.660 align:middle line:84%
Fat-free normally means
it's loaded with sugar.

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:39.890 align:middle line:84%
I can get a two pound bag
of sugar in my hand now,

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and I can put a label
that says 100% fat-free.

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:45.980 align:middle line:84%
The fact that, once
the sugar is ingested,

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.460 align:middle line:84%
it will turn into fat in
the body because, why?

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Because it says the
sugar level is sky high.

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:53.810 align:middle line:90%
And what does the pancreas do?

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:55.700 align:middle line:84%
It has to secrete
insulin in order

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:57.650 align:middle line:84%
to bring that down
so you don't die.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Insulin is the
fat-producing hormone.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.026 align:middle line:84%
So the two pound bag
of sugar that they

00:49:04.026 --> 00:49:07.820 align:middle line:84%
put 100% percent fat-free,
although factually correct,

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.170 align:middle line:90%
is unbelievably misleading.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:12.350 align:middle line:84%
So all this excess energy
comes along and says,

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:13.550 align:middle line:90%
where can we store it?

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:16.752 align:middle line:90%
Short-term places, liver.

00:49:16.752 --> 00:49:17.960 align:middle line:90%
But what do we do the excess?

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.070 align:middle line:90%
I know what we'll do.

00:49:19.070 --> 00:49:21.750 align:middle line:84%
We'll produce some fat
cells, store them in there,

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:22.550 align:middle line:90%
use them later.

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.230 align:middle line:84%
Problem is, there's
never a later.

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:29.240 align:middle line:90%


00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.717 align:middle line:84%
Listen, you start your day with
an orange juice from a cart.

00:49:32.717 --> 00:49:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And first thing in the morning,
are you doing the wrong thing?

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.160 align:middle line:90%
Well, compared compared to who?

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Are you doing the
right thing compared

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.280 align:middle line:90%
to many of the people I see?

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.120 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.540 align:middle line:84%
Listen, any juice that you
buy in a carton or a bottle,

00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:48.410 align:middle line:84%
even if it's 100% organic,
it has been heat-treated.

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:50.120 align:middle line:90%
It has been pasteurized.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.640 align:middle line:84%
Some will say it's been
likely pasteurized.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:54.700 align:middle line:90%
What possible harm can that do?

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:55.700 align:middle line:90%
Let's try an experiment.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Put your head in an oven for
one minute at 1,000 degrees

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:03.213 align:middle line:84%
Fahrenheit, take it out, see
if you haven't been destroyed.

00:50:03.213 --> 00:50:05.630 align:middle line:84%
It will destroy the life force
contained within the fruits

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:06.530 align:middle line:90%
and vegetables.

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:08.578 align:middle line:84%
It will lower some of
the vitamin content

00:50:08.578 --> 00:50:09.620 align:middle line:90%
and some of the minerals.

00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:11.662 align:middle line:84%
The minerals aren't affected
that much by heat, ,

00:50:11.662 --> 00:50:13.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's changed the
molecular structure.

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:15.500 align:middle line:90%
Here's an experiment to do.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:16.582 align:middle line:90%
Get some apple juice.

00:50:16.582 --> 00:50:19.040 align:middle line:84%
When you pour it out, it looks
like urine, if we're honest.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:19.980 align:middle line:90%
The cooked stuff.

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It looks like your urine.

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:21.670 align:middle line:90%
It's cooked juice.

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Make some freshly extracted
apple juice next to it

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and you will see they
are worlds apart.

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:30.020 align:middle line:84%
So the answer is, are you
doing a terrible thing

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.160 align:middle line:90%
by having carton juice?

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:31.960 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Is it better than
a soda, of course.

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:35.955 align:middle line:84%
But where do you want
your health to be?

00:50:35.955 --> 00:50:37.080 align:middle line:90%
Which division do you want?

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:39.497 align:middle line:84%
Do you want fourth division,
if you're on a football team?

00:50:39.497 --> 00:50:40.800 align:middle line:90%
Or do you want the premiership?

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.717 align:middle line:84%
If you want to go
premiership, you need fresh.

00:50:42.717 --> 00:50:45.885 align:middle line:84%
It's by far and away a
different animal to anything

00:50:45.885 --> 00:50:46.760 align:middle line:90%
you can buy in-store.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:51.300 align:middle line:90%


00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.830 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
anti-fat propaganda

00:50:52.830 --> 00:50:54.505 align:middle line:84%
has been going
since the early 80s.

00:50:54.505 --> 00:50:55.380 align:middle line:90%
You know, fat is bad.

00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.800 align:middle line:90%
Fat will make you fat.

00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.150 align:middle line:90%
And fat doesn't make you fat.

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:01.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if anything, if you
went on a zero fat-free diet,

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:02.340 align:middle line:90%
first of all, you'd be dead.

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:05.760 align:middle line:84%
But secondly, if you're on
a low-fat diet of some kind,

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.260 align:middle line:90%
you are constantly hungry.

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Because you need the correct
fats and proteins to feel

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:11.940 align:middle line:90%
satiated.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And so therefore, if you
negate that side of what

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:17.400 align:middle line:84%
the body is crying
out for, you'll

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.640 align:middle line:90%
be constantly looking for it.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And if you're looking for that,
by the way, in carbohydrates,

00:51:21.330 --> 00:51:22.590 align:middle line:90%
you're never going to find it.

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:24.480 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, you
need the avocados,

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.830 align:middle line:84%
you need the olive
oils for avocado.

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:29.580 align:middle line:84%
In fact, avocado is
the only food on earth

00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:31.800 align:middle line:84%
that you could live
on exclusively.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.270 align:middle line:90%
Because it contains everything.

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:34.800 align:middle line:90%
All the human needs.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.200 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't particularly want
to live on it exclusively,

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:38.310 align:middle line:90%
I'd have no friends.

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:39.110 align:middle line:90%
But you could.

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:40.680 align:middle line:90%
You need the right fats.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:42.004 align:middle line:90%
Do not avoid them.

00:51:42.004 --> 00:51:46.360 align:middle line:90%


00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Essential fatty
acids above all else.

00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:52.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, you need the right
balance of omega 3, 6 and 9

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:52.960 align:middle line:90%
oils.

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.790 align:middle line:84%
I used to be covered
from head to foot

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:56.710 align:middle line:90%
in psoriasis and eczema.

00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:58.850 align:middle line:84%
The missing link above
all else with zinc,

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:02.950 align:middle line:84%
selenium, the right kind
of essential fatty acids,

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:04.657 align:middle line:84%
things like lesser
[? thin ?] granules.

00:52:04.657 --> 00:52:06.490 align:middle line:84%
Water-- obviously you
need to keep hydrated.

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:07.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, you've
got to remember,

00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:10.150 align:middle line:84%
some of the best health experts
in the world, some of the best

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:12.580 align:middle line:84%
juice pioneers, never
even drank water.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:14.140 align:middle line:90%
And he was completely hydrated.

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Never had any cracked
skin or dry skin.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.345 align:middle line:84%
They were getting all of
their water-rich nutrients

00:52:19.345 --> 00:52:20.470 align:middle line:90%
from fruits and vegetables.

00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:23.410 align:middle line:84%
We shouldn't really feel
anywhere near as dehydrated

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:25.340 align:middle line:90%
as we ordinarily do.

00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:28.780 align:middle line:84%
But because we live
in a man-made world,

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:29.880 align:middle line:90%
we've got central heating.

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.850 align:middle line:90%
We've got aeroplanes.

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:32.740 align:middle line:90%
We've got abnormal environments.

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.380 align:middle line:84%
Not everybody can live
by a lake in the sun.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.630 align:middle line:84%
So taking that in mind, we
need to hydrate, obviously,

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:39.580 align:middle line:90%
as much as we can.

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:41.620 align:middle line:84%
But all the right
food will hydrate you

00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:43.150 align:middle line:90%
in exactly the right way.

00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:46.150 align:middle line:84%
But you may need some essential
fatty acids on top of that.

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:51.550 align:middle line:90%
Omega 3 6 and 9

00:52:51.550 --> 00:52:52.350 align:middle line:90%
Cooked.

00:52:52.350 --> 00:52:55.770 align:middle line:84%
Foods versus raw if we use our
intuition and our commonsense,

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:58.470 align:middle line:84%
we are the only
creatures on planet Earth

00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:59.563 align:middle line:90%
that cook our food.

00:52:59.563 --> 00:53:01.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't see a gorilla
with a barbecue.

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:03.750 align:middle line:84%
So listen, I don't
take notice of science,

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:06.030 align:middle line:84%
how much I should have of
this, this scientific study

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:06.960 align:middle line:90%
says this.

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.250 align:middle line:90%
I just look at that.

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:10.130 align:middle line:84%
We're the only creatures
that cook our food.

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:11.588 align:middle line:84%
And we're the only
ones that suffer

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:13.920 align:middle line:84%
from the tremendous amounts
of disease that we do.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The only other animals
that have cooked food

00:53:16.170 --> 00:53:19.488 align:middle line:84%
are the animals that we feed,
either in a zoo or in pets.

00:53:19.488 --> 00:53:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And these animals are getting
exactly the same diseases

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:22.650 align:middle line:90%
that we are.

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:28.170 align:middle line:84%
Raw food must, must play
a part in your daily life

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:30.930 align:middle line:90%
incidentally, your daily meal.

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:33.060 align:middle line:84%
Don't just think I'll
have a certain percentage

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:36.570 align:middle line:84%
and just have a raw food meal at
night, cooked and then cooked.

00:53:36.570 --> 00:53:38.250 align:middle line:84%
You need the right
ratio throughout.

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:41.940 align:middle line:84%
Your body wants raw on
every meal where possible.

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And if you can't
eat it, drink it.

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:45.900 align:middle line:84%
That's why I'll often
have a beautiful vegetable

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:50.100 align:middle line:84%
juice and a nice wine glass,
treat it like it's a god.

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'll have that either
as a starter for a meal

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:53.190 align:middle line:90%
or with a meal.

00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:54.930 align:middle line:84%
Just chew it gently
and you're getting

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:57.670 align:middle line:84%
all those live nutrients into
your body at every single meal.

00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:02.008 align:middle line:90%


00:54:02.008 --> 00:54:04.050 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that when it
comes to thinning hair,

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.220 align:middle line:84%
receding hair, it's
the holy grail.

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:07.020 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:09.840 align:middle line:84%
The cure for baldness
is what everybody wants.

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.780 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's prevention
rather than cure.

00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I think genetics clearly
plays a part in this as well.

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:17.845 align:middle line:84%
It's not all down to just
pure nutrition, of course.

00:54:17.845 --> 00:54:20.220 align:middle line:84%
I think those that say that
putting a little bit of wheat

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:22.863 align:middle line:84%
grass juice on your head and
the follicles will grow back,

00:54:22.863 --> 00:54:24.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm quite skeptical of that.

00:54:24.030 --> 00:54:27.630 align:middle line:90%
Even as the juice guy.

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:29.982 align:middle line:84%
I have had cases where
people's hair has got thicker

00:54:29.982 --> 00:54:31.440 align:middle line:84%
through having the
right nutrients.

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.870 align:middle line:84%
I've had cases where people's
have gone from gray back

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.130 align:middle line:90%
to black.

00:54:35.130 --> 00:54:38.040 align:middle line:84%
However, there isn't one
specific juice that will do.

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:40.080 align:middle line:84%
I just think the
earlier that we can

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.240 align:middle line:84%
grab the right nutrients--
of course, follicles,

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:43.560 align:middle line:90%
they need nutrients.

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:47.880 align:middle line:84%
So it seems to make common
sense that, as long as you're

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.770 align:middle line:84%
providing the body
with what it needs,

00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:51.755 align:middle line:90%
it's less likely to recede.

00:54:51.755 --> 00:54:53.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean
it's a guarantee,

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:54.632 align:middle line:90%
but it's less likely to.

00:54:54.632 --> 00:54:57.090 align:middle line:84%
My common sense and intuition
tells me that above all else.

00:54:57.090 --> 00:55:01.550 align:middle line:90%


00:55:01.550 --> 00:55:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Never ever count calories.

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.850 align:middle line:84%
Listen, one way to waste
your life, count calories.

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:06.650 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:07.830 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing that for?

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:08.705 align:middle line:90%
Who made up calories?

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:11.190 align:middle line:84%
What are we doing here
counting calories.

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:13.320 align:middle line:84%
You know, one grape
has nine calories in.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:14.840 align:middle line:90%
So we work that out!

00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.800 align:middle line:90%
What are you doing?

00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.620 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a
squirrel on earth that

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:20.370 align:middle line:84%
ever looks at its nuts,
so to speak, and thinks,

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how many
calories are in this nut?

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.230 align:middle line:90%
It hasn't got to worry.

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:27.650 align:middle line:84%
If you're eating the right
foods, then all that happens

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:30.060 align:middle line:84%
is the body says, I've
had enough to eat.

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.340 align:middle line:90%
So stop eating.

00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:34.450 align:middle line:84%
If you're eating
manipulated food,

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:37.250 align:middle line:84%
they are designing food to make
you hungrier than you normally

00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:38.090 align:middle line:90%
feel.

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:39.298 align:middle line:90%
So therefore, you don't know.

00:55:39.298 --> 00:55:40.690 align:middle line:90%
They create additional hungers.

00:55:40.690 --> 00:55:43.190 align:middle line:84%
So of course, as soon as you
have some of that kind of food,

00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:44.540 align:middle line:90%
you go, oh, I feel good.

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:44.770 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:46.220 align:middle line:90%
Because you've ended a hunger.

00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:48.140 align:middle line:84%
Ending a hunger was
meant to feel good.

00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But not these abnormal hungers,
like a million of them.

00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:55:54.840 --> 00:56:00.110 align:middle line:84%
Now I think just my own
opinion, and this is an opinion,

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:04.460 align:middle line:84%
that you've been told that
the sun is bad for you.

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:08.540 align:middle line:84%
It could be by some people
who've done experiments

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.320 align:middle line:84%
into showing why
you'd need sunblock,

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:14.448 align:middle line:84%
the sunblock that
perhaps they sell.

00:56:14.448 --> 00:56:16.490 align:middle line:84%
You've got to remember,
some of the highest cases

00:56:16.490 --> 00:56:20.630 align:middle line:84%
of skin cancers in the world
are wear sunblock is used.

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Not so much where the
sun is at its highest.

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:28.610 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to sun, we need
vitamin D. We need sunshine.

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Our body craves sunshine.

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:31.550 align:middle line:90%
We feel better in sunshine.

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:33.080 align:middle line:84%
People look better
with sunshine.

00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:34.700 align:middle line:90%
They look great with a color.

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Should you lie in 50
degree temperatures all day

00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:38.420 align:middle line:90%
long with baby oil on?

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:40.590 align:middle line:90%
Hello, McFly, clearly not.

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:41.390 align:middle line:90%
Nobody would.

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:42.682 align:middle line:90%
That's just common sense.

00:56:42.682 --> 00:56:44.390 align:middle line:84%
Do we need a little
bit of sun every day?

00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:47.320 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes in the morning,
20 minutes at night.

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:48.120 align:middle line:90%
I love the sun.

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm a bit of a sun worshipper.

00:56:50.810 --> 00:56:52.530 align:middle line:84%
I love lying in the
sun, reading a book.

00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:53.572 align:middle line:90%
And I always feel better.

00:56:53.572 --> 00:56:58.110 align:middle line:90%


00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:01.920 align:middle line:84%
It takes more energy to try and
digest the wrong kinds of foods

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.080 align:middle line:90%
than anything else you will do.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.660 align:middle line:84%
When somebody finishes
running a marathon,

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:08.795 align:middle line:84%
even when they're 87
years old-- there's

00:57:08.795 --> 00:57:10.860 align:middle line:84%
a lady in the London
Marathon last year.

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.760 align:middle line:84%
At the end of
running 26.2 miles,

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.340 align:middle line:90%
they got an interview from her.

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.130 align:middle line:84%
She had the energy
for an interview.

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:19.800 align:middle line:84%
You try interviewing somebody
after they've finished

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:21.900 align:middle line:90%
eating their Christmas dinner.

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:24.120 align:middle line:90%
They are in a coma.

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Because the body doesn't
have enough energy

00:57:26.790 --> 00:57:30.270 align:middle line:84%
to keep them alive and
awake at the same time.

00:57:30.270 --> 00:57:31.320 align:middle line:90%
I wish I was joking.

00:57:31.320 --> 00:57:33.270 align:middle line:90%
So it shuts down all the system.

00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, it does that to a lesser
degree with every single meal

00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:41.790 align:middle line:84%
that you have if it doesn't have
the right nutrients contained.

00:57:41.790 --> 00:57:45.330 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't feel tired
after lunchtime at all.

00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:46.380 align:middle line:90%
You only feel tired--

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:48.700 align:middle line:84%
Would you ever feel tired
after you've eaten an apple?

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:49.500 align:middle line:90%
An orange?

00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:50.670 align:middle line:90%
A banana?

00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:53.280 align:middle line:84%
You can't feel tired
after you eat a salad.

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.980 align:middle line:84%
You only get tired after you've
eaten wrong kinds of foods,

00:57:55.980 --> 00:58:00.210 align:middle line:84%
simply because it takes more
nerve energy to try and digest

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:03.000 align:middle line:84%
the wrong kind of foods than
anything else you will do.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.290 align:middle line:90%
You want more energy?

00:58:04.290 --> 00:58:05.377 align:middle line:90%
Eat less.

00:58:05.377 --> 00:58:06.291 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:58:06.291 --> 00:58:09.950 align:middle line:90%


00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Listen, I hated
being overweight.

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.130 align:middle line:84%
There isn't a person out there
that says that they're fat

00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:14.930 align:middle line:90%
and they're happy.

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:16.520 align:middle line:84%
They say it externally
in the same way

00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:18.860 align:middle line:84%
that a smoker would say,
I enjoy my cigarettes.

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:22.280 align:middle line:84%
But you know secretly everybody
who's obese or overweight

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.200 align:middle line:84%
would love to wake
up the next morning

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:27.130 align:middle line:84%
and be slim and healthy, and to
be able to wear what they want.

00:58:27.130 --> 00:58:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I was frustrated because it did
affect my skin as well, what

00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:30.430 align:middle line:90%
I was eating.

00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And asthma as well, and eczema.

00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:35.370 align:middle line:84%
But the obesity really
got to me, the overweight.

00:58:35.370 --> 00:58:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I had bigger breasts
than my mother,

00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:39.500 align:middle line:84%
which is never a good
look for a guy, you know.

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:41.360 align:middle line:90%
I wouldn't take off my shirt.

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.030 align:middle line:84%
To not be able to
wear what you want,

00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:46.090 align:middle line:84%
people don't focus
on that enough.

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:47.840 align:middle line:84%
But to be able to just
go to your wardrobe

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and don't think about it,
to be able to wear anything,

00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:54.590 align:middle line:84%
is one of the joys of managing
to get my diet the way

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:55.700 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted it.

00:58:55.700 --> 00:59:02.720 align:middle line:84%
I knew what I needed to do
to change my diet in terms

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:03.590 align:middle line:90%
of what to eat.

00:59:03.590 --> 00:59:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I knew that fruits and
vegetables were good for me.

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:07.280 align:middle line:90%
I knew that salads were great.

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.740 align:middle line:84%
I knew the junk was
rubbish for me I knew.

00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:11.390 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was
causing my obesity.

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:15.020 align:middle line:84%
But I just didn't seem to be
able to stop consuming it.

00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:17.000 align:middle line:90%
And I never understood why.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And it was only when I
understood that I wasn't eating

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:22.580 align:middle line:90%
as a response to emotion.

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I was eating certain things
as a response to emotion.

00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:30.470 align:middle line:84%
So I never said, I've had a bad
day at work, I need a grape.

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:33.230 align:middle line:84%
I've had a bad day today
because I crashed my car,

00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:35.160 align:middle line:90%
somebody give me a mango.

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.717 align:middle line:84%
It was always fat,
salt and sugar.

00:59:36.717 --> 00:59:38.300 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, there
is a distinction.

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes!

00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:41.950 align:middle line:84%
I stopped smoking, stopped
drinking, but I thought,

00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:43.010 align:middle line:90%
I can't stop eating.

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:44.468 align:middle line:84%
That was the last
one, the obesity.

00:59:44.468 --> 00:59:46.760 align:middle line:84%
But I can't stop eating,
that was my excuse.

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:49.550 align:middle line:84%
Yes, but is there a category
between normal foods and drug

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:50.780 align:middle line:90%
foods?

00:59:50.780 --> 00:59:52.280 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I was
the first person,

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:56.080 align:middle line:84%
when the book was released
back in early 2000,

00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.220 align:middle line:90%
to coin the phrase drug food.

00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:01.820 align:middle line:84%
Michael Jacobson, in 1972,
termed the phrase junk food,

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.610 align:middle line:84%
a term that was never
used before 1972.

01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And since I invented,
if you will, or created,

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:10.400 align:middle line:84%
the expression, drug food is
now being used more and more.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:13.310 align:middle line:84%
There isn't such thing as
junk food, there's junk i.e.

01:00:13.310 --> 01:00:14.777 align:middle line:90%
It's junkie food.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
rational thinking person,

01:00:16.610 --> 01:00:19.520 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself to be a
relatively intelligent person.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.410 align:middle line:84%
I knew what I was doing
I was killing myself

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:22.880 align:middle line:90%
with my knife and fork.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.150 align:middle line:90%
But why couldn't I stop?

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Was I stupid?

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:25.310 align:middle line:90%
No.

01:00:25.310 --> 01:00:27.727 align:middle line:84%
I was caught in what I now
call the diet trap and the food

01:00:27.727 --> 01:00:28.670 align:middle line:90%
trap.

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm blessed that, not
only did I find a way out,

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.480 align:middle line:90%
and it was easy.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.792 align:middle line:84%
But I now have the good
fortune to travel the world,

01:00:34.792 --> 01:00:36.500 align:middle line:84%
travel the globe, and
show as many people

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.110 align:middle line:84%
as possible this very
simple food trick.

Once understood,
