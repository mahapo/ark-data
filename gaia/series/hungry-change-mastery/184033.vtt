[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:23.700 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I used to
be in technology.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.180 align:middle line:84%
I started a software
company in the '90s,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.860 align:middle line:90%
which is still going today.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I
was 30 years old,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
I was borderline
obese, diabetic,

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.650 align:middle line:84%
suffering from chronic
pain and depression--

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.750 align:middle line:84%
a lot of problems--
health problems.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.450 align:middle line:84%
And I decided that
that wasn't the way

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to live my life,
that I wanted to be healthy.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.030 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't find
any answers, really,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.630 align:middle line:90%
from my conventional doctors.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.340 align:middle line:84%
They even questioned the
existence of hypoglycemia,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:84%
which I was suffering from
at the time, where you eat

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.310 align:middle line:84%
breakfast, and then a
few hours later, you

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.580 align:middle line:84%
feel like you're
going to pass out.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.260 align:middle line:84%
And I almost did pass out
one time because of low blood

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.880 align:middle line:90%
sugar, so I began reading books.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.790 align:middle line:84%
And as I read books,
I learned more,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.010 align:middle line:84%
and I began to use
that information.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.970 align:middle line:90%
Changed my diet.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.820 align:middle line:90%
Changed my lifestyle.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.010 align:middle line:84%
Lost 50 pounds of body
fat in six months.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Got rid of the sugar.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:84%
Got rid of the cheese
and dairy and--

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.940 align:middle line:84%
all meats at that time,
although now I eat some fish.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.970 align:middle line:84%
But I just cleaned up
my diet, and the changes

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.070 align:middle line:90%
happened automatically.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.380 align:middle line:84%
That's the beautiful
thing about the human body

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:90%
and its ability to heal itself--

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.700 align:middle line:84%
is if you do the
right things, the body

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:84%
will heal itself
automatically, while you sleep,

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.700 align:middle line:84%
and you can't even
help but heal yourself

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.100 align:middle line:84%
if you follow the right steps
and get in tune with nature.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.520 align:middle line:84%
That's what I did, and
that's what I now hope

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.320 align:middle line:90%
to keep teaching others to do.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.137 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.137 --> 00:01:55.720 align:middle line:84%
I think there are
two main reasons why

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.810 align:middle line:84%
we're seeing such high levels
of obesity in the West.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.350 align:middle line:84%
We've got this processed junk
food diet that people are on,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:84%
but it's also combined
with this new--

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.139 align:middle line:84%
relatively new--
indoor lifestyle.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies were not
designed to sit at desks

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.230 align:middle line:84%
under fluorescent lights
in an office cubicle

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:84%
and chow down processed
junk food all day

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:90%
long without getting exercise.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.940 align:middle line:84%
And if you do just
one of these things,

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:84%
it may not be so bad, but
by combining them both,

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.710 align:middle line:84%
then you end up
with a disaster when

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:84%
you've got way too many
calories, not enough

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.322 align:middle line:84%
nutrients, and not enough
use of those calories.

00:02:33.322 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean to simplify
where it's just calories in,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.330 align:middle line:90%
calories out.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.780 align:middle line:84%
It's actually, as you
know, a lot more than that.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.600 align:middle line:84%
But those are the
two main reasons

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
why we have such a big
problem with obesity today.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.060 align:middle line:90%


00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.860 align:middle line:84%
The marketing that
people are subjected

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.980 align:middle line:84%
to today in the food
industry is extremely

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle line:90%
manipulative and destructive.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.730 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the marketing
essentially lies to you,

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.970 align:middle line:84%
because it presents you with
this image of a can of soda,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.420 align:middle line:84%
let's say, and it doesn't
tell you what's in the can.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.920 align:middle line:90%
What it says is that this can--

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.900 align:middle line:84%
if you drink it, it's
going to bring you

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.790 align:middle line:90%
these benefits by association.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be cool.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.020 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be sexy.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:16.062 align:middle line:90%
You're going to be happy.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.860 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
surrounded by friends,

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:90%
wearing skimpy bikinis--

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.190 align:middle line:84%
or whatever their
message happens to be.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:90%
But this is a lie.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.150 align:middle line:84%
The truth is if you
drink that soda,

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.340 align:middle line:84%
you're going to lose bone
mineral density because

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.140 align:middle line:84%
of the fast phosphoric
acid it contains.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.130 align:middle line:84%
If it's a diet soda, you may
suffer neurological problems

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.960 align:middle line:90%
due to the chemical sweeteners.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not a
diet soda, it probably

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.340 align:middle line:84%
is made with high
fructose corn syrup

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.250 align:middle line:84%
in North America and
elsewhere around the world,

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and that's going to
promote diabetes--

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.960 align:middle line:90%
type II-- and obesity.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.680 align:middle line:84%
So on one hand,
here's the promise--

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.090 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be sexy
and popular and cool.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.680 align:middle line:84%
But in reality,
you're going to be

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.260 align:middle line:84%
obese and miserable
and unhealthy and sick.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.880 align:middle line:84%
The marketers are telling you
this, but what they deliver

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.990 align:middle line:90%
is this.

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.130 align:middle line:84%
And in between that, that's the
dishonesty gap, right there.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we have to
watch out for today when

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.860 align:middle line:84%
we look at the way food and
beverages are marketed to us.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to watch out for all
of these distortions that

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:84%
are very carefully
planned and engineered

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:84%
to make us want something
that will actually harm us.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So what they're really
delivering to you

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.620 align:middle line:84%
is chronic disease and sickness
and suffering and pain,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:30.950 align:middle line:90%
and even an early death.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.710 align:middle line:84%
Many of these foods
promote heart disease

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:84%
and promote diabetes
and promote cancer.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.310 align:middle line:84%
But they want you to think
that it's in your interest,

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.780 align:middle line:84%
somehow, to keep
buying that product--

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.970 align:middle line:84%
and usually at a
very high price.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 500%, 1,000% higher than
the cost of the ingredients.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.100 align:middle line:84%
So the business of marketing
is the business of convincing

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.360 align:middle line:84%
people to take actions that
are betraying themselves,

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.300 align:middle line:84%
if you think about it-- in
the food industry especially--

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.700 align:middle line:84%
because to act with
congruence, to love yourself,

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.000 align:middle line:84%
and to consume food
and beverages that

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.850 align:middle line:84%
are good for you means you
have to turn off the marketing

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
messages completely,
and you have

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.000 align:middle line:84%
to go to the things
that are never marketed.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.630 align:middle line:90%
A head of cabbage--

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.570 align:middle line:90%
who's advertising cabbage?

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.850 align:middle line:90%
Nobody.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's one of the best
things you can possibly eat.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And if you really are in tune
with what your body needs,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.190 align:middle line:84%
you're going to go for the
fresh produce, the fresh fruits,

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.050 align:middle line:90%
the roots, the nuts, the seeds.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.790 align:middle line:84%
Those are the things that are
going to make you healthy,

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and those are the things that
are rarely, if ever, promoted.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.900 align:middle line:84%
The food companies engineer
addictions, I believe,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.650 align:middle line:84%
into many of the
foods so that a food--

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.350 align:middle line:84%
let's say a
process-refined sugar food,

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:84%
or a soda made with high
fructose corn syrup--

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.990 align:middle line:84%
it will deliver something--
a biochemical change

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.790 align:middle line:90%
in your brain.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.810 align:middle line:84%
It will make you momentarily
uplifted, or momentarily happy.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.120 align:middle line:84%
And people-- they get
used to that feeling,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:84%
and they want to slam
cookies or cake or soda

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.740 align:middle line:84%
to get that momentary
feeling of feeling elated.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.820 align:middle line:84%
But then that feeling soon--
very quickly-- drops off,

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.660 align:middle line:90%
and you're left empty.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:90%
Where's the food?

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.990 align:middle line:90%
Where's the nutrients?

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:84%
Where are the things that the
body and the mind really crave?

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And the answer, from the food
companies' point of view,

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:84%
is to go back and
buy another can.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Buy another bag of chips.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And MSG, I believe, is
one of the ingredients

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:90%
that is very, very addictive.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.050 align:middle line:84%
And once people are used to
MSG, they tend to crave it.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And you find it in a
lot of snack chips.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.330 align:middle line:84%
Caffeine, obviously,
is highly addictive.

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And I've worked with people
to get off of addictive sodas.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:84%
Just to go to clear soda
from a caffeine soda--

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.330 align:middle line:84%
that almost takes a
miracle, sometimes,

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.000 align:middle line:84%
for people, because it's
so incredibly addictive.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
So we know that
the food companies

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.940 align:middle line:84%
realize that many of their
ingredients are very addictive.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And the tobacco companies
did it for decades.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.740 align:middle line:90%
They're still doing it.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.100 align:middle line:84%
If you addict a customer,
you have a customer for life.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Food companies do much the same
thing with different chemicals.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.870 align:middle line:90%
It's not nicotine.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.130 align:middle line:90%
It's the MSG.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:90%
It's the processed sugars.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:15.740 align:middle line:90%
It's the aspartames.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.940 align:middle line:90%
It's these other chemicals.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.770 align:middle line:90%
But it's the same idea.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just like
selling cigarettes.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:23.650 align:middle line:84%
You're selling food
that's harmful,

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and you want people
to keep coming back,

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.975 align:middle line:84%
so you put in those
chemicals that make

00:07:26.975 --> 00:07:28.950 align:middle line:90%
them want it again and again.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.950 align:middle line:84%
It's like turning human
beings into a little lab

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.280 align:middle line:84%
rats, which is very
condescending and very--

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.620 align:middle line:84%
it's a great disservice
to humankind.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.433 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.433 --> 00:07:43.850 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to high fructose
corn syrup, a lot of people

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.480 align:middle line:84%
don't realize the dangers of
refining and concentrating

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.730 align:middle line:90%
ingredients from a product.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.170 align:middle line:84%
So high fructose corn
syrup comes from corn--

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.260 align:middle line:84%
obviously-- but
it's not natural,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.600 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
concentrated and so refined.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.100 align:middle line:90%
It's an isolated nutrient.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.940 align:middle line:84%
For example, cocaine is probably
not good for your health,

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:90%
but it comes from the Coca leaf.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And Coca leaf tea is perfectly
safe for your health.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:84%
I drank it when I was hiking
in the Andes Mountains,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.970 align:middle line:84%
and it's used throughout
the culture there.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.070 align:middle line:84%
It's a very important
nutraceutical medicinal plant

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.000 align:middle line:84%
that's used throughout
South America.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:84%
And there's no harm
in drinking Coca tea,

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.920 align:middle line:84%
and it's not addictive,
nothing like that.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.650 align:middle line:84%
But you wouldn't want to
snort cocaine from the highly

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.760 align:middle line:90%
refined coca tea.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, eating high fructose
corn syrup, in my view,

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:31.490 align:middle line:90%
is a lot like snorting cocaine.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.490 align:middle line:84%
It is the highly refined,
isolated, concentrated,

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.520 align:middle line:84%
chemically manipulated
version of something

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:84%
that's found in corn
and grown in corn.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.592 align:middle line:90%
But if you eat corn, it's fine.

00:08:43.592 --> 00:08:46.050 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to get that
much high fructose corn syrup.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.900 align:middle line:84%
But if you take it all
out and concentrate it,

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.580 align:middle line:84%
then it becomes a
danger to your body.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, why?

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Why is it dangerous?

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Because then your body doesn't
recognize it as a natural food.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.970 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of just
the glycemic index,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:03.350 align:middle line:84%
high fructose corn syrup is
like jet fuel for your body.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
If you pour jet
fuel into your car,

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.637 align:middle line:84%
into your car's
gasoline tank, you're

00:09:07.637 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:90%
going to ruin your engine.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.070 align:middle line:90%
You'll burn it out.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Much the same thing
happens in the human body.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:18.710 align:middle line:84%
You overuse the carbohydrate
conversion biology in your body

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.620 align:middle line:84%
to the point where your
pancreatic cells, for example,

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:23.810 align:middle line:84%
can't generate insulin
the way they used to,

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:26.510 align:middle line:84%
or the insulin isn't working
the way it's supposed to.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.100 align:middle line:84%
You have reduced
insulin sensitivity.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:84%
So these isolated ingredients
from all over the plant world--

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.990 align:middle line:84%
when they're in nature and
full spectrum, they're safe.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.290 align:middle line:84%
But when you isolate them,
they become very dangerous.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.665 align:middle line:84%
And there are many
other examples

00:09:40.665 --> 00:09:42.530 align:middle line:84%
of that throughout
the food supply--

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.810 align:middle line:90%
MSG, for example.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.480 align:middle line:84%
You can concentrate yeast
extract out of yeast,

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and that becomes another
dangerous food ingredient.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.130 align:middle line:90%
Stay away from the isolates.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Stay away from high
fructose corn syrup.

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.880 align:middle line:84%
Stay away from anything that
is an unnatural and highly

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.220 align:middle line:84%
concentrated chemical
from a plant that

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.940 align:middle line:84%
should be consumed in its
full spectrum, bioavailable,

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.620 align:middle line:90%
nutrient complexity.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the way nature delivers
food-- as a nutrient complex,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.780 align:middle line:90%
not as one, isolated nutrient.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:16.810 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.330 align:middle line:84%
You can find high fructose
corn syrup in so many products

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.130 align:middle line:90%
in the stores.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:90%
It would amaze you.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
If you turned them around and
looked at the ingredients,

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:90%
no way.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.970 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it's in here.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.155 align:middle line:90%
Salad dressings will have it.

00:10:29.155 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
You'll have high
fructose fructose corn

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:90%
syrup in pasta sauces.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:84%
And pizza sauce, especially,
is loaded with it.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.830 align:middle line:84%
You really have to watch out
for everything in the grocery

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:39.630 align:middle line:90%
store.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Read it, make sure it doesn't
contain this high fructose corn

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:84%
syrup and other ingredients
that are dangerous--

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:48.570 align:middle line:84%
such as, for example,
yeast extract.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.510 align:middle line:84%
They're putting yeast
extract in fresh meat.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's incredible--
fresh meat.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.420 align:middle line:84%
You used to think that
the processed meat was

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.390 align:middle line:84%
the dangerous stuff,
and the fresh meat

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:02.850 align:middle line:84%
didn't have any chemical
additives in it at all.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, I was at a grocery
store in the United States

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.380 align:middle line:84%
recently looking at
the meat, because I

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.110 align:middle line:90%
had to buy some from my dog--

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.050 align:middle line:84%
because I feed my dog
really healthy, fresh meats.

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:14.850 align:middle line:84%
And I was looking at
the meat products,

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:17.240 align:middle line:84%
and I turned one over,
and in the ingredients

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:90%
it says yeast extract.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.460 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:22.415 align:middle line:84%
So now even the
fresh meats, you have

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:84%
to be careful about what's
in them, because they're

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.550 align:middle line:84%
putting additives in that
to make it taste better.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:90%
It's crazy.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.620 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.560 align:middle line:84%
When you're reading
food labels, make sure

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:84%
that you actually read the
Ingredients section that lists

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.947 align:middle line:90%
the words of what goes into it.

00:11:39.947 --> 00:11:41.530 align:middle line:84%
And there are some
things to watch out

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:42.998 align:middle line:84%
for that you don't
want to purchase

00:11:42.998 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:84%
if you want to be
healthy, especially

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:84%
for your family
and your children.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.170 align:middle line:84%
You want to watch out for
artificial food colors.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.283 align:middle line:84%
FD&C red number 40, blue
number 2-- anything like that.

00:11:53.283 --> 00:11:54.700 align:middle line:84%
If it's an artificial
color, it'll

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.790 align:middle line:84%
have a number and a color name,
like red, blue, whatever--

00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:90%
yellow.

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:84%
You don't want
those for your kids.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.560 align:middle line:84%
You also don't want yeast
extract or torula yeast.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.780 align:middle line:90%
That's another form of MSG.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.500 align:middle line:84%
They contain free
glutamic acid, which is--

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.870 align:middle line:90%
it's called an excitotoxin.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.833 align:middle line:84%
Some doctors say
it's a neurotoxin.

00:12:15.833 --> 00:12:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's highly
addictive, and makes you

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:90%
want to eat more of that food.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.940 align:middle line:84%
It's an artificial
chemical taste enhancer.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And watch out for foods that
contain high fructose corn

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.080 align:middle line:90%
syrup-- of course--

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.750 align:middle line:84%
but also artificial
chemical sweeteners--

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.690 align:middle line:84%
such as acesulfame
potassium, sometimes

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.360 align:middle line:84%
called acesulfame
K. Also, there's

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.760 align:middle line:84%
saccharin that's still
used not just in foods,

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.920 align:middle line:84%
but in your children's
cough medicines.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:84%
In all the children's
medicines, a lot of them

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:90%
contain saccharin still.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.340 align:middle line:84%
And of course, aspartame--
that's a big one

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.450 align:middle line:84%
to avoid, both in the foods
and in the medicines as well.

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we could talk for
hours about the stuff that's

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
in the over-the-counter
medicine.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.320 align:middle line:90%
And a lot of it's for kids.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.530 align:middle line:90%
I can't believe it.

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.390 align:middle line:84%
You'd be amazed at
what they put in this

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.871 align:middle line:84%
with the artificial colors
and the artificial sweeteners.

00:13:00.871 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.400 align:middle line:84%
When you're shopping for
sugar-free foods, watch out,

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
because most sugar-free
foods have replaced it--

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.350 align:middle line:90%
replaced the sugar--

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.810 align:middle line:84%
with other artificial
chemical sweeteners,

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:20.030 align:middle line:84%
such as sucralose or aspartame
or acesulfame K. Usually when

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.180 align:middle line:84%
you give up the sugar, you're
getting a chemical instead,

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:24.260 align:middle line:90%
and that chemical--

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.320 align:middle line:84%
that could be worse for
you than natural sugar.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.260 align:middle line:84%
I don't mind eating natural
sugar if it's from sugar cane

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:84%
and it's not highly refined
and it's not bleached.

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So a genuine, real brown sugar--
like evaporated cane juice

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.180 align:middle line:84%
crystals-- fine for you, as
long as the rest of your diet

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.050 align:middle line:90%
is healthy too.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:46.160 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want to be eating
or drinking chemical sweeteners.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.140 align:middle line:84%
And when you look
at sugar-free foods,

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.680 align:middle line:84%
they'll either use those,
or they'll use fructose--

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:55.850 align:middle line:84%
an isolated, extracted,
powdered fructose--

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.070 align:middle line:84%
which they say is lower
on the glycemic index,

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.240 align:middle line:90%
and that's true.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.030 align:middle line:84%
But it still can
promote diabetes

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.970 align:middle line:84%
and metabolic disorders,
because it's highly refined,

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:08.502 align:middle line:84%
highly concentrated, and it
still has a high glycemic load.

00:14:08.502 --> 00:14:10.460 align:middle line:84%
So just because it says
sugar-free doesn't mean

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:90%
it's healthy.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I could go into
a grocery store right now,

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.740 align:middle line:84%
and we could go to the
sugar-free section,

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
and we could find some
very unhealthy foods there

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
that most people don't realize
are really bad for them.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.600 align:middle line:84%
They think they're
shopping for healthy foods.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.670 align:middle line:84%
This is the other thing--
a lot of consumers,

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.640 align:middle line:90%
when they buy sugar-free--

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.720 align:middle line:84%
when consumers are
buying sugar-free foods

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:84%
or fat-free foods, they don't
realize that a lot of those

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:90%
are very unhealthy.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.930 align:middle line:90%
They're fooled.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.600 align:middle line:84%
It's not due to any
fault of their own.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:84%
They've been tricked
by the food companies

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that
because of the labels--

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:84%
sugar-free, fat-free,
all natural--

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:90%
that it must be good for them.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.840 align:middle line:84%
And the truth is a
lot of these products

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:84%
contain very questionable,
and maybe even

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.910 align:middle line:84%
toxic ingredients
that I wouldn't

00:14:55.910 --> 00:15:00.028 align:middle line:84%
want to feed to any human being,
or even an animal, frankly.

00:15:00.028 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:90%
They're that bad for you.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:90%


00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.230 align:middle line:84%
If you're still looking
for fat-free products,

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.950 align:middle line:84%
then I think you've
been misinformed--

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:84%
perhaps by a physician who
isn't up to speed on the latest

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.250 align:middle line:84%
research, which shows that
fat is really good for you

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:90%
if it's the right kind of fat.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's the key-- it's
getting the right kind of fat

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.290 align:middle line:90%
in your body.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.430 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
cheap, low-grade fats,

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:28.200 align:middle line:84%
such as soybean oil and even
canola oil and the corn oils--

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.860 align:middle line:84%
these are not healthy for you
to consume in large quantities

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:90%
over the long term.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The worst kinds of fats are the
partially hydrogenated fats.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.180 align:middle line:84%
These are the
hydrogenated oils that

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.880 align:middle line:84%
are used in many baked items
and crackers and cookies,

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.880 align:middle line:90%
and margarine spreads--

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.880 align:middle line:90%
the butter spreads.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.583 align:middle line:84%
Oh, those are some of the worst
foods you could possibly eat.

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
If you want healthy
fats, then you

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:84%
got to get into the natural,
plant-based fats from avocados,

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.540 align:middle line:84%
and chia seeds, and flax
seeds, and even the healthy fat

00:15:57.540 --> 00:16:00.090 align:middle line:84%
from salmon--
wild-caught salmon.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.800 align:middle line:90%
That's a healthy fat for you.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.320 align:middle line:90%
There are healthy fats in fish--

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.070 align:middle line:84%
if you can avoid the
mercury content which

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
is in a lot of fish
from the oceans today.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.473 align:middle line:84%
But if you're
looking for fat-free,

00:16:09.473 --> 00:16:10.890 align:middle line:84%
most people who
are doing that are

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.050 align:middle line:84%
doing that on the advice
of their physician.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Maybe they had a heart
attack, and a physician

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.520 align:middle line:84%
said you need to eat
fewer than, let's say,

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:90%
10 grams of fat a day.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've known people
who were on those diets

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.840 align:middle line:84%
after a heart attack, and
they passed away very quickly.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.110 align:middle line:84%
They did not live very long,
because their body wasn't

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:29.700 align:middle line:84%
getting the fat
that they needed.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.852 align:middle line:90%
I eat a lot of fat, every day.

00:16:31.852 --> 00:16:33.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what percentage
of my diet is fat,

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.130 align:middle line:90%
but I eat a lot of fat.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.230 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a fat person--

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.180 align:middle line:90%
to use that crude phrase.

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
people I know who

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.900 align:middle line:90%
are fit and thin and healthy--

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:46.310 align:middle line:84%
they eat a lot of fats, but
they're the right kind of fat.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.015 align:middle line:84%
They're the plant-based
fats from avocados and chia

00:16:49.015 --> 00:16:49.890 align:middle line:90%
seeds and flax seeds.

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
They're not cheap corn
oil, soybean oil--

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:54.780 align:middle line:90%
one of the worst--

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.530 align:middle line:90%
or even canola oil.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Olive oil is one that's
sort of in the middle.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.560 align:middle line:84%
I know that it's a big part of
the Mediterranean diet, which

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.952 align:middle line:90%
is very healthy.

00:17:02.952 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
cook with an oil,

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.650 align:middle line:84%
choose olive oil-- or
better yet, coconut oil.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.990 align:middle line:84%
That's the best one
of all for cooking,

00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:13.517 align:middle line:84%
because it has a very high
temperature tolerance.

00:17:13.517 --> 00:17:17.500 align:middle line:90%


00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the most
important realizations

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:21.345 align:middle line:84%
that people need
to get onto here--

00:17:21.345 --> 00:17:22.720 align:middle line:84%
when they're
shopping or eating--

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.010 align:middle line:84%
is that the breads and
any of these fluffy

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.840 align:middle line:84%
carbohydrates--
they're converted

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.640 align:middle line:90%
into sugar right in your body.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.765 align:middle line:84%
So within minutes after you
eat them, they become sugar.

00:17:33.765 --> 00:17:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of people
say, well, I'm

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.598 align:middle line:84%
avoiding sugar,
because they're not

00:17:36.598 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:84%
eating crystallized
sugar in that form,

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:90%
or drinking liquid sugar.

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.890 align:middle line:84%
But they're eating
a bread, or they're

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.830 align:middle line:84%
eating a pancake, or a
muffin, or a cornbread.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.650 align:middle line:84%
Cornbread used to be made
out of corn and not sugar.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:49.540 align:middle line:90%
Now it's like corn cake.

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.460 align:middle line:90%
It's sugarized corn cake.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.490 align:middle line:84%
And when you eat that, that
becomes sugar internally.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.230 align:middle line:84%
It has a very high
glycemic index,

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:57.670 align:middle line:90%
and a high glycemic load.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.130 align:middle line:84%
So when you're thinking
about what to eat,

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.070 align:middle line:84%
if you're working to
reduce your sugars,

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:07.030 align:middle line:84%
your definition of what is
sugar really needs to expand.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.340 align:middle line:84%
It's more than just
the white powder.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.460 align:middle line:84%
It's all of these things
in your possible diet

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.440 align:middle line:84%
that get converted
into blood sugar

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:84%
very quickly once you swallow
them and start to digest them.

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And that is a much bigger
pool of possible foods

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.885 align:middle line:90%
than what people are used to.

00:18:21.885 --> 00:18:24.010 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people, again,
when it comes to things

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:25.330 align:middle line:90%
like bagels--

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:28.030 align:middle line:84%
they think bagels
are a healthy food.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, not really.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:31.510 align:middle line:84%
It's just a different-shaped
piece of bread--

00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:34.120 align:middle line:84%
usually with fake
blueberries in it, too.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:38.020 align:middle line:84%
I've seen people go to
these frozen yogurt stores,

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:84%
and they think frozen
yogurt is healthy.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's really ice
cream with a little bit

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.320 align:middle line:90%
of probiotic powder on it.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.370 align:middle line:84%
That's milk sugar
that's called yogurt.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not any better for
you than ice cream, really.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.030 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a little bit
of probiotics in it,

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.850 align:middle line:90%
but that's not a healthy food.

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:57.100 align:middle line:84%
People's idea of what's
healthy and what's not healthy

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:01.720 align:middle line:84%
is really at odds with
biological reality.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.250 align:middle line:84%
And so things that are
not sugar are the celery.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:08.770 align:middle line:90%
Celery is not sugar.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.170 align:middle line:90%
The fresh produce is not sugar.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And even if you get sugar
in the form of an apple,

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.170 align:middle line:84%
that is a slow sugar,
a lower glycemic sugar

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.550 align:middle line:84%
that's locked into the
natural fibers of the apple.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:84%
So it will take your body time
to digest them and break them

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.000 align:middle line:84%
down and release the
sugar, and that's

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.820 align:middle line:84%
what you want-- is a
slow, steady energy that's

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.950 align:middle line:84%
delivered by fruits and
nuts and vegetables,

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:33.520 align:middle line:84%
not the high-octane,
burn-you-out type of sugar

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.130 align:middle line:84%
that you get from
breads and pretzels

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.360 align:middle line:84%
and carbonated soft drinks
and things like that.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So watch out for
all those things.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.770 align:middle line:90%


00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Many of the food labels
at the grocery store

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.970 align:middle line:90%
are very deceptive.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.890 align:middle line:84%
For example, there's
a cereal made

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:57.020 align:middle line:84%
by General Mills called Total
Blueberry Pomegranate Cereal.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.690 align:middle line:84%
It contains no blueberries
and no pomegranates.

00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of food labels
will imply that they

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.908 align:middle line:90%
contain certain ingredients.

00:20:03.908 --> 00:20:05.450 align:middle line:84%
They'll have pictures
of blueberries,

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:84%
or pictures of
fruit, or they even

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.140 align:middle line:84%
use names of
different ingredients

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.930 align:middle line:84%
in the name of the product--
like pomegranate something,

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:13.820 align:middle line:90%
or super berry something.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
on the ingredients,

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:90%
those ingredients aren't there.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And the naming of food
products often is a little

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.710 align:middle line:90%
too loose and creative.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.020 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if they're
naming these products--

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.150 align:middle line:84%
and this is from the
major food companies

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:84%
whose products are in
every major grocery store

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:32.648 align:middle line:90%
all around the world.

00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as if
they're naming them

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:39.020 align:middle line:84%
based on what they hope you
might imagine you're eating,

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:42.080 align:middle line:84%
rather than what's
really in the box,

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.300 align:middle line:84%
because a lot of times
it's not in there.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And then there's stuff that is
in there that they don't want

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.460 align:middle line:84%
you to see on the label,
so they don't put it

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.990 align:middle line:84%
on the label, such
as propylene glycol.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:84%
This chemical is used in a
lot of blueberry muffins.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.080 align:middle line:84%
It's part of what makes
up the blueberry bits that

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:90%
aren't blueberries.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.250 align:middle line:84%
They're made of propylene
glycol, partially hydrogenated

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:07.590 align:middle line:84%
oils, liquid sugars,
and artificial colors.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:11.360 align:middle line:84%
You can also use propylene
glycol to winterize your RV.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.780 align:middle line:84%
It prevents the pipes from
freezing in the winter.

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:17.900 align:middle line:84%
It's also use to clean out your
colon before a colonoscopy.

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So multiple uses
for this ingredient

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:21.980 align:middle line:84%
that you get in your
blueberry muffins.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.920 align:middle line:84%
Watch out for a lot of the
cereals sold in grocery stores.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a cereal by
General Mills called Total,

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.950 align:middle line:84%
and this is Total Blueberry
Pomegranate Cereal.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the name right
on the front of the box.

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you look
at the ingredients,

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:37.940 align:middle line:84%
you find that this cereal
contains no blueberries

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.770 align:middle line:90%
and no pomegranates.

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So the label is misleading,
because it's not in the cereal.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Why would they name a
product blueberry pomegranate

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.270 align:middle line:84%
if there are no blueberries
and pomegranates in it?

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
answers might be

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:55.040 align:middle line:84%
that people are learning that
blueberries are good for you,

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.930 align:middle line:84%
and pomegranates
are good for you,

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:00.890 align:middle line:84%
and consumers are going to pay
more and buy more products that

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:84%
claim to have those
ingredients in them,

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.290 align:middle line:84%
but most consumers won't
read the ingredients list.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.540 align:middle line:90%
So they're being hoodwinked.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:10.910 align:middle line:84%
They think they're
buying these fruits,

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:84%
but they're not getting them
in the cereal, in this case.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is true across
many products, including

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.877 align:middle line:84%
fruit juices and punches and
fake orange juice products

00:22:20.877 --> 00:22:22.460 align:middle line:84%
that you can buy in
the grocery store.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.950 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of fake
products in the stores

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.690 align:middle line:84%
that will use very
clever labeling

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:29.540 align:middle line:84%
to imply that they're
real, or that they

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:30.890 align:middle line:90%
contain real ingredients.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But if you really investigated
and just read the label,

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:36.530 align:middle line:84%
you'll find that they're
exaggerating things,

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:38.213 align:middle line:84%
or basically just
being deceptive.

00:22:38.213 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
It's very common throughout
the food industry.

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:44.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:49.040 align:middle line:84%
There is suspicion that the
yellow artificial colors are

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.590 align:middle line:84%
linked to a diagnosis of ADHD,
or Attention Deficit Disorders.

00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But as a general
rule, you should avoid

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.910 align:middle line:90%
all of the artificial colors.

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:04.010 align:middle line:84%
Some people say yellow's
more bad than red or blue,

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:05.570 align:middle line:90%
or the blue's safe.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.800 align:middle line:90%
The truth is the FDA--

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:84%
even in the United States--
has banned food colors

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.440 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
history of the agency.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So some colors that were on
the market are now illegal.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And without question,
some colors that are legal

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:84%
now are going to be
illegal in another decade.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:25.280 align:middle line:84%
So do you want to play Russian
roulette with your kid's life

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.230 align:middle line:84%
and find out which color's going
to be legal 10 years from now?

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:29.030 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.770 align:middle line:90%
Take them all out of their diet.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.810 align:middle line:84%
Don't let them eat
petrochemical colors--

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:33.610 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:23:33.610 --> 00:23:37.870 align:middle line:90%


00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.410 align:middle line:84%
I don't recommend that people
use microwave to heat anything

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:90%
that they're going to consume.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.790 align:middle line:84%
Microwaves alter--
they chemically alter--

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:48.250 align:middle line:90%
the molecules of your food--

00:23:48.250 --> 00:23:51.470 align:middle line:84%
both the fat molecules
and the water molecules.

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.200 align:middle line:90%
Now, how do they alter them?

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.840 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's one example.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Scientific tests have shown that
broccoli, when it's microwaved,

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:03.190 align:middle line:84%
will lose up to 98%
of its phytonutrients.

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.770 align:middle line:84%
Those are its
plant-based nutrients.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:06.610 align:middle line:90%
That's the medicine.

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:09.010 align:middle line:84%
That's why broccoli
is anti-cancer,

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.357 align:middle line:84%
and that's why it's good to
eat broccoli and cauliflower

00:24:12.357 --> 00:24:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and cabbage, because it
has an anti-cancer effect.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.290 align:middle line:84%
It's very powerful at helping
prevent breast cancer.

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.300 align:middle line:84%
But if you microwave
your broccoli,

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.720 align:middle line:84%
you're eating dead,
inert broccoli.

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.650 align:middle line:84%
You might as well be eating
broccoli-colored cardboard.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.720 align:middle line:84%
It's not the same anymore
after the microwave.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to the
trouble of buying your food

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:34.090 align:middle line:84%
and preparing your food,
don't kill your food

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:35.530 align:middle line:90%
in your microwave.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:38.200 align:middle line:84%
Eat it raw, or prepare
it in some other way that

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.470 align:middle line:84%
doesn't destroy the
natural medicinal benefit,

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:45.010 align:middle line:84%
and you will benefit from eating
it in its more natural state.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:90%


00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.480 align:middle line:84%
The promotion of
weight loss surgery

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.870 align:middle line:84%
is very rampant
in America today,

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.110 align:middle line:84%
and it's really a
reflection of the culture.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:02.800 align:middle line:84%
The American culture is give me
the results without the effort.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.995 align:middle line:84%
I'm sad to say, because
I'm an American,

00:25:04.995 --> 00:25:06.950 align:middle line:90%
and I'm a patriotic American.

00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:08.700 align:middle line:84%
I love many things
about American culture.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:84%
But this idea that
you can just somehow

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.940 align:middle line:84%
lose weight without altering
your diet, that you can just

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.830 align:middle line:84%
rip out part of your
digestive system

00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:19.522 align:middle line:84%
and keep eating ice cream,
just in smaller amounts,

00:25:19.522 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:90%
doesn't make any sense to me.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I think
it's a medical fraud.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
I know that's a
harsh word, but I

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.465 align:middle line:84%
think people are dying
from these surgeries.

00:25:28.465 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
And the surgeries
don't work any better

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:32.520 align:middle line:84%
than just limiting
your calories anyway.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.420 align:middle line:84%
You could limit your calories
and still keep your stomach.

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.190 align:middle line:90%
It's workable.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:42.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I saw billboards that
said, tired of taking pills?

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.440 align:middle line:90%
Weight loss surgery.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.772 align:middle line:90%
Well, what's it saying?

00:25:44.772 --> 00:25:46.230 align:middle line:84%
It's saying, tired
of taking pills?

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:90%
Rip out half your stomach.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.550 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't make
any sense to me.

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:54.240 align:middle line:84%
How about tired of
surgery and being cut open

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.090 align:middle line:84%
and having your organs partially
removed or stapled shut?

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.500 align:middle line:90%
I would be tired of that.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.020 align:middle line:84%
I would say, why
not do some juicing?

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:02.430 align:middle line:90%
Why not eat some fresh produce?

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:07.300 align:middle line:84%
Why not eat real food, or
even begin to walk around,

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:12.925 align:middle line:84%
do a little exercise, and keep
your stomach, keep your organs?

00:26:12.925 --> 00:26:14.050 align:middle line:90%
They're there for a reason.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:17.850 align:middle line:84%
You weren't born with extra
stomach parts, extra digestive

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.490 align:middle line:84%
parts, that should
just be removed.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:22.180 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't make any sense.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.190 align:middle line:90%
So this whole thing--

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's crazy, in
America, that people

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:28.480 align:middle line:84%
think that this is going
to solve their problems.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.040 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't solve their problems.

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:32.290 align:middle line:84%
First of all, if they keep
eating the way that they've

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.357 align:middle line:84%
been eating, they're not
getting the nutrition,

00:26:34.357 --> 00:26:36.690 align:middle line:84%
so they're not they're not
going to be preventing cancer

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:40.290 align:middle line:84%
or preventing diabetes or
preventing heart disease or any

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:41.880 align:middle line:90%
of these other diseases.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:46.110 align:middle line:84%
The body weight-- and I've
been overweight before.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.520 align:middle line:84%
I was nearly obese,
so I've been there.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.770 align:middle line:90%
I know what I'm talking about.

00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:84%
The body weight is
not the disease.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:56.900 align:middle line:84%
It's a symptom of something much
deeper, and much more complex

00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:57.700 align:middle line:90%
that's going on.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:02.220 align:middle line:84%
It's a symptom that
the whole direction

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.550 align:middle line:84%
of your diet and your exercise
and your mindset about honoring

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.010 align:middle line:84%
your health is off
track and needs

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.650 align:middle line:84%
to be realigned to
get back on track,

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:14.610 align:middle line:84%
because if you do all
the other things right--

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:16.860 align:middle line:84%
in choosing your foods,
in choosing your diet,

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and choosing your exercise,
and treating your body

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:90%
with a sense of sacredness--

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.167 align:middle line:84%
then the body weight
problem will solve itself.

00:27:28.167 --> 00:27:29.750 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have
to think about it.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.160 align:middle line:84%
You're doing other things
right, your body will heal.

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.140 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, you
will heal chronic degenerative

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:35.940 align:middle line:90%
disease.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.530 align:middle line:90%
You will prevent cancer.

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.720 align:middle line:90%
You will prevent heart disease.

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.320 align:middle line:84%
The body fat will just
fade away over time

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.290 align:middle line:84%
as you're making the right
decisions about your foods

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.522 align:middle line:90%
and your exercise.

00:27:47.522 --> 00:27:51.860 align:middle line:90%


00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:54.260 align:middle line:84%
You really can
eat yourself sexy.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.150 align:middle line:84%
You really can,
because nutrition

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.800 align:middle line:90%
gives you vibrant skin.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.480 align:middle line:90%
It gives you healthy hair.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.220 align:middle line:90%
It gives you a healthy glow.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, every
system in your body

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:07.370 align:middle line:84%
is improved, both internally
and externally-- cosmetically--

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:11.270 align:middle line:84%
through proper nutrition,
because when people

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:15.410 align:middle line:84%
look at other potential mates
or partners-- girlfriends,

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.080 align:middle line:84%
boyfriends, whatever-- there
are a lot of visual cues

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.890 align:middle line:84%
to health that we pick
up on unconsciously.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.900 align:middle line:90%
People look for symmetry.

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.020 align:middle line:90%
They look for skin tone--

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.650 align:middle line:84%
steady skin tone and not
a lot of splotchy type

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:31.860 align:middle line:90%
of colors on your skin.

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Why is this built into
our definition of beauty?

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Why does the beauty
industry spend

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.160 align:middle line:84%
so much time trying
to create products

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.170 align:middle line:84%
that they put on your
skin to make your skin

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:45.035 align:middle line:90%
look artificially monotone?

00:28:45.035 --> 00:28:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Well, the answer's
because those are the cues

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:50.290 align:middle line:84%
that we pick up on that makes
you look younger or sexier.

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But those things
can be accomplished

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:53.180 align:middle line:90%
through nutrition--

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.390 align:middle line:84%
through juicing, especially,
and by avoiding fried foods

00:28:56.390 --> 00:28:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and avoiding the
highly oxidative foods

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.990 align:middle line:84%
that destroy your skin and
destroy your internal organs.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Fried foods are the worst, in
my opinion, and barbecued foods.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they're
highly toxic, loaded

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.370 align:middle line:90%
with carcinogenic chemicals.

00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.400 align:middle line:84%
If you can avoid those, or
at least greatly reduce those

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.950 align:middle line:84%
and increase your
intake of superfoods--

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:20.150 align:middle line:84%
chlorella and spirulina,
fresh juice from vegetables

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:23.330 align:middle line:84%
and fruits that you make in your
own kitchen, then your skin,

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.980 align:middle line:90%
within 30 days--

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.420 align:middle line:90%
it will turn around completely.

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:29.520 align:middle line:84%
Your friends will ask
you, what's your secret?

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:32.750 align:middle line:84%
And when you tell them, I've
been juicing fresh produce,

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.750 align:middle line:84%
they'll say, well, I'm just
going to buy a skin cream--

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.970 align:middle line:84%
because they want
the easier way.

00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.890 align:middle line:84%
But if you have
good friends, they

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.190 align:middle line:84%
might start juicing with
you, because your juice

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.730 align:middle line:84%
beats their skin cream
in terms of the effects.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:48.050 align:middle line:90%
And also, remember this--

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.570 align:middle line:84%
the skin creams that
you buy are almost all

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.870 align:middle line:90%
loaded with toxic chemicals.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.760 align:middle line:84%
I mean, most of them
contain fragrance chemicals.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.200 align:middle line:84%
We did a lab analysis of a
popular perfume product--

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.860 align:middle line:84%
haven't even
published this yet--

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and it showed that it contains
21 different toxic, potentially

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:09.650 align:middle line:84%
carcinogenic chemicals-- none of
which are listed on the label.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.585 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about it,
how do you want healthy skin?

00:30:12.585 --> 00:30:14.030 align:middle line:90%
Do you want healthy--

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, do you want your skin
to be treated with nutrition

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.850 align:middle line:84%
from the inside-out, or
do you want to coat it

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.880 align:middle line:84%
with petrochemicals
and toxic chemicals

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.350 align:middle line:84%
and artificial
fragrance products

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:27.392 align:middle line:84%
from the outside, which
will be absorbed in,

00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:29.600 align:middle line:84%
and then they will get into
your liver and your heart

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and your kidneys and your brain,
and they will cause disease

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.740 align:middle line:90%
inside?

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.440 align:middle line:84%
Which way would you rather
deal with your skin health?

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Which way is going to make you
look better in the long run?

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Which way are you
going to be sexier?

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.250 align:middle line:84%
The answer's from
the inside-out.

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.222 align:middle line:90%
And that comes through foods.

00:30:45.222 --> 00:30:46.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
people who are going

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:50.480 align:middle line:84%
to a class reunion or a
family picnic or a wedding--

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.370 align:middle line:84%
or whatever event
they're going to where

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:53.745 align:middle line:84%
they want to look
good, they want

00:30:53.745 --> 00:30:55.880 align:middle line:84%
to look great and sexy
and young and vibrant--

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.530 align:middle line:84%
they know the secret,
now, that people

00:30:57.530 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:84%
are learning is they'll
start juicing 30 or 60

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.620 align:middle line:90%
days before your event.

00:31:01.620 --> 00:31:03.370 align:middle line:84%
And by the time your
event comes around,

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:90%
you're going to look fantastic.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.720 align:middle line:90%
So stick with it.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.330 align:middle line:90%


00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.880 align:middle line:84%
There are so many great
products to choose from in terms

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.100 align:middle line:84%
of superfoods that have a very
cleansing effect, and also

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.060 align:middle line:90%
a disease-preventive effect.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:21.070 align:middle line:90%
Chlorella is one of my top ones.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.878 align:middle line:84%
Spirulina, astaxanthin-- I
know these are long names,

00:31:23.878 --> 00:31:26.170 align:middle line:84%
but they're actually-- once
you get familiar with them,

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:27.520 align:middle line:90%
they're easy to remember.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:32.500 align:middle line:84%
But the blue-green algaes,
other microalgae products,

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:33.500 align:middle line:90%
are very healthy.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.780 align:middle line:84%
But if that's too
complicated, don't worry.

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:84%
You can just go down
to your grocery store,

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and you can juice up celery,
cucumbers, apples, pears,

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.847 align:middle line:84%
and even some citrus
fruits with, maybe,

00:31:45.847 --> 00:31:47.680 align:middle line:84%
some beets that some
greens or some lettuce.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.320 align:middle line:84%
You could just take salad
lettuce, like Romaine lettuce,

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.560 align:middle line:84%
and put it in the
juicer, juice it all up.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.290 align:middle line:84%
If it's not sweet enough,
throw another apple in there.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.180 align:middle line:84%
You don't need sugar
or anything like that.

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.940 align:middle line:84%
That is hugely
helpful for detoxing.

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want to mention two other
ingredients that are especially

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.740 align:middle line:90%
useful for detox.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.490 align:middle line:90%
That is parsley and cilantro.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:13.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, parsley cleanses
your entire blood supply,

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.417 align:middle line:84%
and it also gives
you fresh breath.

00:32:16.417 --> 00:32:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Parsley has so much
chlorophyll that it just

00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:20.020 align:middle line:90%
cleanses your old system.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And cilantro binds
with heavy metals.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.990 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people are
getting mercury, especially,

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:27.670 align:middle line:84%
through the fish
that they're eating,

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.590 align:middle line:84%
or through their
dental fillings.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you eat cilantro,
it can bind with that

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.200 align:middle line:84%
and remove it from your system
so that the mercury doesn't get

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.850 align:middle line:90%
lodged in your body's cells.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And mercury, as you
know, is very toxic.

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.857 align:middle line:90%
It's a neurotoxin.

00:32:42.857 --> 00:32:45.190 align:middle line:84%
You don't want that anywhere
in your brain cells, right?

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:49.538 align:middle line:84%
So parsley, cilantro,
and just juice

00:32:49.538 --> 00:32:51.580 align:middle line:84%
it in together with all
the fruits and vegetables

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.830 align:middle line:84%
that you love and enjoy,
and it's a delicious

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:55.570 align:middle line:90%
drink, something that--

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:58.120 align:middle line:84%
I recommend juicing
that way every day.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:02.873 align:middle line:90%


00:33:02.873 --> 00:33:04.290 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
the food pyramid,

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:05.970 align:middle line:84%
I think what people
really need to know

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:10.480 align:middle line:84%
is that the old food pyramid
was really a pyramid scheme.

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:13.410 align:middle line:84%
It was making the food
companies rich at the very top,

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:18.120 align:middle line:84%
and the consumers getting harmed
and ripped off at the bottom.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.160 align:middle line:84%
They tried to say,
well, you should

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:22.970 align:middle line:84%
eat more grains and more
meats and more milk and more

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:23.770 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:25.890 align:middle line:84%
It was about just
eat yourselves silly.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:29.610 align:middle line:84%
That was really the official
position of the USDA--

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.460 align:middle line:84%
which was fine, maybe, in
the 1940s and the '50s when

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.410 align:middle line:84%
they first thought
about this pyramid,

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.390 align:middle line:90%
because people were starving.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:40.150 align:middle line:84%
In many cases, they
suffered from malnutrition.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.330 align:middle line:84%
So the idea was
everybody eat more.

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was a great
message for the industry.

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:47.370 align:middle line:84%
The pig industry wanted
to sell more ham.

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:50.190 align:middle line:84%
The milk industry wanted to sell
more milk, and so on-- cheese

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.590 align:middle line:90%
and meat and corn and wheat.

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was everybody just
eat more of everything.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, clearly that doesn't
work in the long-term,

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.140 align:middle line:84%
because now we
have too much food,

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.967 align:middle line:90%
and we still have a pyramid.

00:34:02.967 --> 00:34:04.800 align:middle line:84%
And the pyramid is still
the same structure.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Again, the food companies
on the top making the money,

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and the consumers on
the bottom suffering

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:11.070 align:middle line:84%
from chronic
degenerative disease.

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:12.659 align:middle line:90%
So throw out the pyramid.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.310 align:middle line:90%
It's no longer a pyramid.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Today it's a food sphere.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.340 align:middle line:90%
Change the shape.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:18.239 align:middle line:90%
It's a food sphere.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:20.460 align:middle line:84%
It's your sphere
of food influence.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:24.719 align:middle line:84%
What food is influencing
your body and your mind,

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:26.570 align:middle line:90%
and where's it coming from?

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:29.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you start to look at
the nature of the foods--

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:32.514 align:middle line:84%
where it comes from,
what kind of attitude

00:34:32.514 --> 00:34:34.139 align:middle line:84%
does the food have,
so to speak, if you

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.199 align:middle line:90%
were to give it a personality?

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:42.719 align:middle line:84%
Food that's from a local farmer,
an organic farm, is happy food,

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's healthy food,
and it's not processed.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's good for
your food sphere.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Food that's trucked from
1,000 miles away, that's

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.460 align:middle line:84%
been through a food factory,
that's been altered,

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:58.170 align:middle line:84%
that's been hydrogenated,
pasteurized or homogenized--

00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.970 align:middle line:90%
any of these other alterations--

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.300 align:middle line:84%
well, that's unhappy,
factory food.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not fun to go
through a factory.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:07.620 align:middle line:84%
So you don't want unhappy,
unhealthy processed food

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.060 align:middle line:84%
in your sphere, because
that's going to alter you.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.720 align:middle line:84%
That's, like, your
internal environment.

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.180 align:middle line:84%
You want the happy,
healthy, natural food

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.940 align:middle line:84%
that's from local farms, and
that's grown in real soil--

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.810 align:middle line:84%
real probiotic soil-- that's
got actual, living organisms

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:25.350 align:middle line:84%
in the soil, and it hasn't been
just killed by all the chemical

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:28.320 align:middle line:84%
pesticides-- which is what they
do in conventional agriculture

00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.430 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:35.100 align:middle line:84%
So you can improve your life
and your mind and your mindset--

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:38.890 align:middle line:84%
your outlook on life can improve
by altering your food sphere.

00:35:38.890 --> 00:35:41.790 align:middle line:84%
You've got to ask just basically
three simple questions.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.920 align:middle line:90%
Where does my food come from?

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:48.510 align:middle line:84%
What went into the food in terms
of attitude or care or love

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:49.980 align:middle line:90%
or compassion?

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.290 align:middle line:84%
And then thirdly,
what is my intention

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:55.080 align:middle line:90%
of doing with the food?

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Is the food to support me,
you, for a good purpose,

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.200 align:middle line:90%
to do something productive?

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.330 align:middle line:90%
Or is it just entertainment?

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.270 align:middle line:84%
You see, a lot of people look
at food as entertainment.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.250 align:middle line:84%
They think about food
as only occupying

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:10.230 align:middle line:90%
this section of their body.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:13.430 align:middle line:84%
It's like their tongue
is an amusement park,

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:16.470 align:middle line:84%
and they just want to have
a ride for 30 seconds--

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:19.750 align:middle line:84%
get the taste sensations in
there, the chemical enhancers,

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.700 align:middle line:90%
the MSG, the salt, the spices--

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:22.500 align:middle line:90%
whatever.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.700 align:middle line:84%
And then they swallow
it and forget about it.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Well, that food is in
your body for the next,

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.460 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, 24 hours--
or in some people's cases,

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.540 align:middle line:84%
over 100 hours depending
on the situation.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:35.820 align:middle line:84%
It's only here for a short
time, and it's all the way

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:37.720 align:middle line:90%
through for a long time.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:40.590 align:middle line:84%
So if you think about food as
short-term entertainment rather

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.720 align:middle line:84%
than long-term
nourishment, you're

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.170 align:middle line:84%
missing out on the
big picture here.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:50.910 align:middle line:84%
You should eat food for
what it does from here down,

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:53.220 align:middle line:84%
all the way through
your system, not what

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.020 align:middle line:90%
it's doing just in your mouth.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Don't treat your mouth
like an amusement park

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.780 align:middle line:90%
if you want to be healthy.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:06.112 align:middle line:90%
