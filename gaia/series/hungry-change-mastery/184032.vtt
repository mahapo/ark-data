00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.450 align:middle line:84%
>> What made me interested in
nutrition was I was diagnosed

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.990 align:middle line:84%
with a rare disease, a
rare cancer, in 2003.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.558 align:middle line:84%
And it was stage IV
when they found it,

00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:35.100 align:middle line:84%
and I was told that
there was no cure

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.225 align:middle line:90%
and there was no treatment.

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:38.640 align:middle line:84%
So basically, no
treatment means no chemo,

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.020 align:middle line:90%
no radiation, no surgery.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And the first oncologist
suggested that I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.150 align:middle line:90%
get a triple organ transplant.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So taking out both of
my lungs and my liver

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.650 align:middle line:90%
and putting somebody else's in.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
much at the time,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.330 align:middle line:84%
but I knew that that was
not a really good idea.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I thought it
was a pretty silly idea.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And then as I went on
the journey looking

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.680 align:middle line:84%
for the doctor who would know
the most about my disease,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.460 align:middle line:84%
I met different
people along the way.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And I was given the
expiration date by one person.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And then finally I
found a great oncologist

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.840 align:middle line:90%
who I could work with.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And he and I decided
not to do anything.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm lucky, in one
sense, even though my disease is

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.510 align:middle line:84%
advanced, it's a stage IV
cancer, it's sort of chronic,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.510 align:middle line:90%
and it's currently stable.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:84%
So we decided to watch and
wait, and wait for cancer

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:90%
to make the first move.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.080 align:middle line:84%
And what I decided to do is
watch and live, and do my best,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.390 align:middle line:84%
anything that was in my
power, so that cancer

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.770 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't make the first move.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's when I got really
curious about nutrition.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.760 align:middle line:84%
But not just nutrition, it
was what I eat, what I drink,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.390 align:middle line:90%
and what I think.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And first off was learning
how to feed myself,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.900 align:middle line:90%
how to take care of myself.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.440 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.583 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not something
you're taught in school.

00:02:00.583 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
It's not something I
was taught at home,

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.070 align:middle line:84%
though I have very
well-meaning parents.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.405 align:middle line:90%
They were and are entrepreneurs.

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:84%
And so it was, like, get the
food on the table as quickly

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.730 align:middle line:84%
as possible with fast
food and take out,

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.700 align:middle line:84%
anything that could just
feed us because everybody

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.540 align:middle line:84%
was working such long
hours in complicated jobs.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.770 align:middle line:84%
And so on step one was just
going back and understanding,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.140 align:middle line:90%
how do I take care of myself?

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:84%
What do I put in this body that
is compromised at this point?

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.900 align:middle line:90%
How do I boost my immune system?

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.752 align:middle line:90%
How do I increase my longevity?

00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:36.210 align:middle line:84%
And again, that comes back to
what you eat, what you drink,

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.010 align:middle line:90%
and what you think.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.888 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.888 --> 00:02:43.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really
sad that we don't learn

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.570 align:middle line:90%
these things earlier in life.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.390 align:middle line:84%
I was 31 when I realized, I
don't know what I'm doing.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to
take care of myself.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:90%
And I am sick.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And so I had to stop everything,
not only find the best doctor

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.060 align:middle line:84%
and reinvent my life, but
I had to go back and learn

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.830 align:middle line:84%
all the things that
I wish I had known

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.550 align:middle line:84%
as a child, as a teenager,
as a young adult.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.020 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the only
way to put even a minor dent

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.723 align:middle line:84%
into the disease situation that
we're experiencing, certainly

00:03:16.723 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
in the States, but
throughout the world,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.970 align:middle line:84%
is to teach kids
at a younger age

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.570 align:middle line:90%
how to take care of themselves.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.340 align:middle line:90%
Prevention is the cure.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.680 align:middle line:90%
Prevention is the cure.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is coming from a woman
who has a stage IV disease.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And I would love it if there
was a cure for what I had.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:90%
I think that would be fantastic.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I do think early
detection does save lives.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.630 align:middle line:84%
New drugs and new treatments
and new surgeries,

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.890 align:middle line:90%
they do make a difference.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps, if there was
a cure for what I had,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.450 align:middle line:84%
perhaps I would
decide to use it.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.145 align:middle line:84%
However, I would
be very careful.

00:04:02.145 --> 00:04:04.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.500 align:middle line:84%
How will it
compromise my system?

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.230 align:middle line:84%
Will I set myself up
for a different cancer

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.020 align:middle line:84%
down the road that's
more aggressive?

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.380 align:middle line:84%
How will it affect my
overall well-being?

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.959 align:middle line:84%
Not just cut it up, take
it out, and oh, boom, you

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.143 align:middle line:90%
can have your old life back.

00:04:20.143 --> 00:04:21.560 align:middle line:84%
That old life that
you didn't even

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:90%
really like in the first place.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.840 align:middle line:90%
Here you go.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.710 align:middle line:84%
So because I believe that
prevention is the cure,

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.010 align:middle line:84%
I think that we have to
spend more time teaching

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.740 align:middle line:90%
people how to stay well.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.752 align:middle line:84%
And certainly teaching
children and teaching

00:04:36.752 --> 00:04:38.460 align:middle line:84%
our friends, our
families, our neighbors,

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.470 align:middle line:90%
how can you participate?

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
I think what's so great is to
create a grassroots movement so

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that change happens
from the bottom up,

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.170 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to waiting
for the powers that

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:90%
be to change things.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Because they aren't, right?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.658 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I like to do.

00:04:54.658 --> 00:04:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I go out into the world,
I go out into the field.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I use my story and say,
you don't have to get sick.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's so
cool about epigenetics.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.270 align:middle line:84%
Epigenetics teaches us that
our genes are not our destiny.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can have a
gene for a specific disease

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.070 align:middle line:90%
and it might not present itself.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.110 align:middle line:90%
And how can we participate?

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:84%
Diet, lifestyle, reducing the
amount of stress in our lives.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.440 align:middle line:84%
You know, certainly things
like environmental toxins

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.720 align:middle line:84%
we might not be able to
control, but how can we

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.300 align:middle line:84%
create a cleaner,
happier, greener existence

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.820 align:middle line:84%
so that we can stack
the odds in our favor?

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.160 align:middle line:84%
I often call it, making
energy deposits instead

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.300 align:middle line:90%
of constant withdrawals.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Because we are on the verge
of physical and emotional

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.650 align:middle line:90%
bankruptcy.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.140 align:middle line:84%
And the only way to stop
that is to make the deposits,

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.900 align:middle line:84%
and to teach ourselves
how to be well, how

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:90%
to live well, how to stay well.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.590 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong with
a moderate sweet tooth.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.370 align:middle line:84%
But I think we need to
understand what moderation is.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.560 align:middle line:84%
I think we have lost our
basic concept of moderation.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:84%
So for example,
in America, we're

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:06.240 align:middle line:84%
eating about 150 pounds of
sugar per year, each person.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.290 align:middle line:84%
79 pounds of high
fructose corn syrup.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.370 align:middle line:84%
That's about 22
teaspoons of sugar a day.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing
moderate about that.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.830 align:middle line:90%
Sugar is in everything.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.300 align:middle line:84%
Everything from cough
syrup to crackers to sushi.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.240 align:middle line:90%
It's very hard to avoid.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.210 align:middle line:84%
The more sugar that
we're consuming

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.570 align:middle line:84%
the more increase of chronic
disease we're experiencing.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And also, these incredible
ups and downs in mood

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:90%
swings and whatnot.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:84%
But when I got started
to research sugar,

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:84%
I was coming from the
perspective of a cancer

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:90%
patient.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.650 align:middle line:84%
And what I found to
be so interesting

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.660 align:middle line:90%
was sugar feeds cancer.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.310 align:middle line:84%
Now that's a very
broad statement,

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.580 align:middle line:84%
and I'm just going to kind of
sum it up in layman's terms.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.400 align:middle line:90%
So cancer cells are very hungry.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.080 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is an
inefficient disease.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like a Hummer
versus a Prius, right?

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.920 align:middle line:84%
And so the fuel for
all cells is glucose.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:84%
But cancer cells
need a lot of it.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And the quickest way that
they can get nourished

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.280 align:middle line:90%
is by simple sugars.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.160 align:middle line:84%
And the more sugar
that's coursing

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:84%
through your body, the more
glucose, the more insulin.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.670 align:middle line:90%
Insulin is a growth hormone.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.330 align:middle line:84%
The more IGF growth factor
1, another growth hormone,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.810 align:middle line:90%
the more cancer cells grow.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.340 align:middle line:90%
So I was thinking, wow, OK.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So if sugar is going to give
cancer cells that I have

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:84%
in my body you the quick
fuel that they need,

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.270 align:middle line:84%
what does that do
to a healthy person?

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:84%
If it's not good for me, how
can it be possibly good for you?

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.750 align:middle line:84%
Now do you have to cut all
the sugar out of your diet?

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:50.550 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.650 align:middle line:84%
But I think we have to
make better choices.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.240 align:middle line:84%
The whole point is to
make better choices.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.450 align:middle line:90%
So the white stuff.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:58.918 align:middle line:84%
The stuff that
makes your pancreas

00:07:58.918 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
freak out and flood
your body with insulin.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.010 align:middle line:84%
And make you go up and down,
and all these crazy peaks

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.025 align:middle line:90%
and valleys.

00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:07.650 align:middle line:84%
That's where we want
to move away from.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And eating more of the
fruits and the veggies,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.640 align:middle line:84%
and the foods that contain fiber
that balance the blood sugar.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.930 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of simple, but
it's become very difficult

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.080 align:middle line:84%
because, as I said,
sugar is in everything.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.982 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to
get addicted to it.

00:08:21.982 --> 00:08:23.940 align:middle line:84%
I was speaking on our
radio show the other day.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, what if
you remove these substances

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:90%
from your diet?

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.050 align:middle line:84%
Would you experience
withdrawal symptoms?

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.659 align:middle line:84%
And I was speaking specifically
about sugar and caffeine.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:90%
And the caller said, absolutely.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So anything that
you would experience

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.870 align:middle line:84%
significant withdrawal
symptoms from,

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:45.960 align:middle line:84%
is that something that should be
like the main stay, the center

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.670 align:middle line:90%
stage, of your diet?

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:50.940 align:middle line:90%
To me, common sense says no.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.010 align:middle line:84%
So I really do look
at the amount of sugar

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.040 align:middle line:84%
that I'm consuming, as
somebody who is living well

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.510 align:middle line:90%
with a chronic disease.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.800 align:middle line:84%
And I choose low glycemic
fruits and veggies, and even

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.870 align:middle line:84%
desserts from time
to time, as opposed

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.210 align:middle line:84%
to high glycemic
choices, which, again,

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.160 align:middle line:84%
are going to spike
my blood sugar

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and flood my body
with growth hormones.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.180 align:middle line:90%
I don't need that.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.980 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.170 align:middle line:84%
When you're investigating
sugar or any of these things,

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.880 align:middle line:84%
it's really important to be
a detective and get curious.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.130 align:middle line:90%
It's not about being scared.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.978 align:middle line:84%
Like, oh gosh, there's
sugar in everything.

00:09:26.978 --> 00:09:29.020 align:middle line:84%
Oh, there's trans fats,
oh, there's too much fat,

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.220 align:middle line:90%
there's too much salt.

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.570 align:middle line:90%
Just get curious.

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.130 align:middle line:90%
Be a detective.

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.500 align:middle line:90%
Look at it like an adventure.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.670 align:middle line:90%
Follow the trail.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.490 align:middle line:84%
For me, I just I read
labels and understand

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.810 align:middle line:84%
fructose and
high-fructose corn syrup

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:46.480 align:middle line:84%
and all of these
different terms for sugar.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.780 align:middle line:90%
It's sugar.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at a label,
the first three things listed,

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.190 align:middle line:84%
that's the most in
the product, right?

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.780 align:middle line:84%
So if it's sugar,
sugar, sugar, then

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.988 align:middle line:90%
that product is full of what?

00:09:56.988 --> 00:09:58.270 align:middle line:90%
Sugar.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:00.880 align:middle line:84%
And you look at things
like energy drinks or sodas

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.030 align:middle line:84%
or even products that
are called natural,

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:09.363 align:middle line:84%
or they're supposedly
super-green green juices.

00:10:09.363 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:84%
And you look at
them and they have

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.090 align:middle line:90%
an enormous amount of sugar.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So educating yourself is the
best thing that you could do.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:22.600 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Well, like anything
else, I think

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
the way to get over
addiction is just

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.380 align:middle line:90%
really start to investigate it.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And to experience and to be
willing to play with your diet

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:34.960 align:middle line:90%
and lifestyle.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.480 align:middle line:84%
What is it like to
go through a detox?

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Are you open to that?

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
Will you go 21
days without eating

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:84%
your favorite candies and
chocolates and cookies

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:47.380 align:middle line:84%
and cakes and
muffins and all that?

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.000 align:middle line:90%
How will you feel?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.830 align:middle line:90%
You have to experiment.

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:54.640 align:middle line:84%
For me, I didn't realize
that I was a total sugar

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.910 align:middle line:84%
junkie until I got
sick and I decided

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.050 align:middle line:84%
I was going to use
food as medicine.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.170 align:middle line:90%
So I cut out animal products.

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And by animal products,
I mean flesh and milk.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:90%
And I cut out the white stuff.

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And I cut out sugars, except
for fruit and some sweets

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.680 align:middle line:84%
that I make for myself
using stevia and sometimes

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.410 align:middle line:90%
a little bit of agave.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And it was amazing with
the withdrawal symptoms

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.800 align:middle line:90%
that I felt.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Also, I cut out
caffeine and alcohol.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.060 align:middle line:90%
And at first I felt awful.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.980 align:middle line:84%
I mean terrible,
because I was having

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.150 align:middle line:84%
such a reaction from decades
of eating an inverted diet,

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:39.350 align:middle line:84%
from decades of being addicted
and being used to sugar, fat,

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:40.750 align:middle line:90%
and salt.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.670 align:middle line:84%
So my palate was
wigging out, and I

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.900 align:middle line:90%
couldn't taste simple foods.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:84%
And then the cleaner I
got over time doing things

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:49.773 align:middle line:90%
like periodic juice fasts.

00:11:49.773 --> 00:11:51.190 align:middle line:84%
And when I mean
juice fast, I mean

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.120 align:middle line:90%
a lot of green juice nutrition.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:84%
None of these crazy,
wacky, liquid water

00:11:56.310 --> 00:12:00.160 align:middle line:84%
fasts, with sweets
and pepper in it.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.340 align:middle line:84%
I am sorry, but I just don't
think that that's healthy.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.530 align:middle line:84%
Drinking green juice was
an enormous way for me

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:84%
to flood my body with vitamins,
minerals, enzymes, oxygen,

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:84%
phytonutrients, and all
of these wonderful things.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.630 align:middle line:84%
And bringing my body
back into balance

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.820 align:middle line:90%
by choosing a plant-based diet.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:84%
Lots of fiber, antioxidants,
all of the goodies.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And slowly over time, my palate
almost came back to life.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And then a simple peach
feels like a explosion

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:36.280 align:middle line:84%
of joy in your mouth, as
opposed to some of the products

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.320 align:middle line:84%
that I used to have
before that I would

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.123 align:middle line:90%
need more of to be satisfied.

00:12:41.123 --> 00:12:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's where it
becomes like a drug,

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:46.570 align:middle line:84%
like nicotine, caffeine,
cocaine, heroin.

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.720 align:middle line:84%
The more you have, the more
you want to hit that button.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.330 align:middle line:84%
You want it because
your brain wants it.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:54.530 align:middle line:90%
It's a similar reaction.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.940 align:middle line:84%
And so being willing to try,
there's no magic bullet.

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.740 align:middle line:84%
There's no like, oh,
here's the solution, here's

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.020 align:middle line:90%
the golden goose.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:07.660 align:middle line:84%
No, you have to
start to reduce it.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And then eliminate the
things that don't serve you.

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.417 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean that they
should be gone for ever?

00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:84%
You can never have a
piece of birthday cake?

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:20.290 align:middle line:84%
You can never dip your spoon
in somebody else's whatever?

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.480 align:middle line:84%
No, but you're not doing
it on a regular basis,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.990 align:middle line:84%
every single day, one, two,
three, four, 10 times a day,

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.690 align:middle line:84%
so that your body
doesn't know normal.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:31.690 align:middle line:84%
Balance is a very
important word.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:90%
But let's be clear.

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.810 align:middle line:90%
Balance takes action.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.470 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't just happen.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not just one day,
poof, you have balance.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.250 align:middle line:84%
If you look at it
that way, that also

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.880 align:middle line:84%
can set you up
for some laziness.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.460 align:middle line:84%
And when I say moderation,
I don't mean give yourself

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.230 align:middle line:90%
an excuse and be lazy.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Active balance, active.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.080 align:middle line:90%
I'm actively pursuing it.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:55.905 align:middle line:90%
And that's how it happens.

00:13:55.905 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:84%
I was addicted to
many things prior

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:07.613 align:middle line:84%
to changing to this
plant-based diet and lifestyle.

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was addicted to alcohol,
I was addicted to caffeine,

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:84%
I was addicted to cigarettes,
and some recreational drugs

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.730 align:middle line:90%
from time to time.

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:19.420 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
decided to pursue this

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and be very
consistent about it--

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Because consistency is
what gets you there.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.730 align:middle line:90%
Not perfection, consistency.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.855 align:middle line:84%
So every day I'm
making a deposit.

00:14:29.855 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:90%
I'm on the healthy highway.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.390 align:middle line:84%
If I diverge and take
a scenic view from time

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:35.898 align:middle line:90%
to time, no problem.

00:14:35.898 --> 00:14:36.940 align:middle line:90%
Then I'm getting back on.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.770 align:middle line:84%
And that consistency
is what gets me

00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.210 align:middle line:84%
to my goal, which is
health, spiritual wealth,

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:42.010 align:middle line:90%
and happiness.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:90%
Balance, active balance.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:50.410 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized was,
wow, it feels so much better

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:55.180 align:middle line:84%
to feel good than to
feel like crap, right?

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of those things,
they give you an instant hit,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.060 align:middle line:90%
but then you fall so far.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:05.380 align:middle line:84%
You can't get back to that place
of, oh, this feels so good.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.830 align:middle line:84%
That first drag, that first
sip, that first snort,

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:10.750 align:middle line:84%
where you're like, oh,
that feels so good.

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.880 align:middle line:84%
That first bad relationship
where you're like, oh, I

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.680 align:middle line:90%
feel so good.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:19.340 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.810 align:middle line:84%
You know, one of
the things that I

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:24.980 align:middle line:84%
find to be very true from my
life is perfection is beige.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Perfection is beige, and I
want to live a red hot life.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And the way for me to do
it is to be consistent.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But not to be
tight and neurotic.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.418 align:middle line:84%
In the beginning, I was tight
and neurotic because I thought,

00:15:37.418 --> 00:15:39.710 align:middle line:84%
I have to do exactly what
these people are teaching me,

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.410 align:middle line:84%
depending on who I was
following at the time.

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.170 align:middle line:90%
It's their way or you're out.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.020 align:middle line:84%
And what I find to be
true for the masses,

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and certainly for myself,
is variety is key.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.490 align:middle line:90%
The healthy highway is the goal.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:57.830 align:middle line:84%
So every day I'm
being consistent.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm making an energy
deposit instead

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.090 align:middle line:90%
of a constant withdrawal.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:03.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm traveling on
the healthy highway,

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.960 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean
that I can't stop and take

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:84%
a little side trip and look at
this beautiful scenic vista,

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:11.990 align:middle line:84%
and then get back
on the highway.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
The point is to get
back on the highway

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and to make all of these daily
actions that add up over time,

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.990 align:middle line:84%
add up over a lifetime,
that bring you

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:25.520 align:middle line:84%
towards longevity
and optimum health.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.490 align:middle line:84%
And when we get caught
up in all of the details

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:84%
is when we can create a
lot of stress in the body.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.620 align:middle line:84%
And you know the
basis of my diet

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:84%
is it's an anti-inflammatory
diet and lifestyle.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
So inflammation is the root
cause of most, if not all,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:90%
chronic diseases.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.350 align:middle line:90%
Inflammation is stress.

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Stress from the outside world,
stress from the environment,

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.980 align:middle line:84%
stress from the cubbies,
the issues in the tissues,

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:84%
the places that need
a flashlight shined

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.430 align:middle line:84%
on them to release
some of the old crap.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.800 align:middle line:90%
But also from what we're eating.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So you can create
stress and inflammation

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.980 align:middle line:90%
in the body three times a day.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:90%
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.450 align:middle line:90%
You choose.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:09.589 align:middle line:84%
But again, we can't be so
rigid and dogmatic about this

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:14.030 align:middle line:84%
that we miss the overall
point, which is happiness.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:84%
Before I was sick, I
thought, without my health

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:18.500 align:middle line:90%
I have nothing.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Without my health
I have nothing.

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.732 align:middle line:90%
Then I got sick.

00:17:21.732 --> 00:17:22.940 align:middle line:90%
And you know what I realized?

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.849 align:middle line:84%
Without my happiness
I have nothing.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Really, zilch.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So if this lifestyle
makes you so unhappy,

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.150 align:middle line:90%
what's the frickin' point?

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.630 align:middle line:84%
If we can then look at it
and say, OK, this feels good.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:37.430 align:middle line:90%
I feel better.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
On a daily basis, I am
making an improvement.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.440 align:middle line:90%
And wow, I'm feeling it.

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.240 align:middle line:90%
Wonderful.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.050 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to have a
little bit of birthday cake?

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to have a shot
of tequila from time to time?

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:47.870 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:49.412 align:middle line:84%
Maybe if that's your
thing, you will.

00:17:49.412 --> 00:17:52.800 align:middle line:84%
But are you going to have a
green juice back the next day?

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.120 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to go yoga?

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Are you going to have
a beautiful salad?

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.800 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
make it work for you?

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.850 align:middle line:84%
Because if you don't figure out
how to make it work for you,

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:03.020 align:middle line:90%
you're missing the point.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:08.160 align:middle line:90%


00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.850 align:middle line:84%
I think we crave processed foods
and fast foods because they're

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.630 align:middle line:84%
high in sugar, they're high in
fat, and they're high in salt.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of them are
genetically manipulated.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.310 align:middle line:90%
They're addictive for a reason.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.250 align:middle line:90%
And they're not real foods.

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.950 align:middle line:84%
And I think that what's
important to understand

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.728 align:middle line:84%
is that if it's not
made in a garden,

00:18:31.728 --> 00:18:34.020 align:middle line:84%
it's probably something that
you should stay away from.

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.980 align:middle line:84%
If it's created in
a laboratory, it

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:43.760 align:middle line:90%
takes a laboratory to digest.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.860 align:middle line:84%
If it has a shelf life longer
than you, don't eat it.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.150 align:middle line:90%
It's just common sense.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:51.390 align:middle line:84%
And we could get into the
details of how food is made

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and who's back with the test
tubes tinkering and making it.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.873 align:middle line:84%
Oh, let's add this
flavor, and then people

00:18:56.873 --> 00:18:57.790 align:middle line:90%
will be more addicted.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:01.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's add this and people
will be really hungry for it.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:06.180 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.645 align:middle line:84%
Again, let's just
keep it simple.

00:19:08.645 --> 00:19:10.770 align:middle line:84%
If it's made in the garden,
it's probably something

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:11.640 align:middle line:90%
that we should eat.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:20.580 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's back to nature
and it's back to the garden.

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And if it's made in a
garden, then I eat it.

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:84%
If it's made in a lab,
it takes a lab to digest.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:84%
If it has a shelf life longer
than me, I don't eat it.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:33.150 align:middle line:90%
That's just common sense.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.160 align:middle line:84%
The simpler I get,
the healthier I get.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:40.490 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:90%
I crave different foods today.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:48.120 align:middle line:84%
I don't crave the quick fix of
alcohol, caffeine, nicotine,

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and the rest, because it feels
so good to satisfy myself

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:90%
with a green drink.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So cucumbers, celery, kale,
romaine, a little bit of pear.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is
something that I crave.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Also, the center of
my plate is plants.

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:11.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's where
I'm the happiest.

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.340 align:middle line:84%
I get everything I
need from good fats

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:19.090 align:middle line:84%
from avocados, from beans, from
tempeh, from sweet potatoes.

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.300 align:middle line:90%
I love my salads.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.980 align:middle line:90%
I love my sautees.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.660 align:middle line:90%
I get such great food.

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And thing about it is
it's nutrient-dense foods,

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:28.490 align:middle line:90%
so I eat a lot less.

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And so my weight has
naturally come into balance.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Whereas before, I struggled
with food addictions.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:35.310 align:middle line:84%
And the sort of yo-yo
dieting of being a ballerina,

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:37.310 align:middle line:84%
and being somebody who
is in front of the camera

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:84%
all the time and had to
stay thin for her job.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:84%
But I could go up 10
pounds and down 10 pounds.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.540 align:middle line:90%
And mostly up and up and up.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:51.790 align:middle line:84%
And so now it's just so easy
for me to stay fit and thin,

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.730 align:middle line:84%
where my body
should naturally be.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:90%
So I crave different foods now.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.190 align:middle line:90%
And again, I crave nutrition.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I will literally look at an
avocado and start to salivate,

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:06.342 align:middle line:84%
or look at a green juice
and just be, like, oh,

00:21:06.342 --> 00:21:07.550 align:middle line:90%
that's going to be quenching.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.310 align:middle line:90%
I can't wait to drink that.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
Does that mean I never have
a piece of dark chocolate?

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:90%
No, it's great.

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.290 align:middle line:84%
But I'll have this much of
it, as opposed to one bar

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:20.180 align:middle line:84%
and then the next bar
and then a third bar.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:84%
And I used to be so addicted
to sugar that I would literally

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.390 align:middle line:84%
throw my food out and
dig through the garbage.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
So I'd go get ice cream and
Ben and Jerry's and donuts,

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.597 align:middle line:90%
and I'd have a pig-out fest.

00:21:32.597 --> 00:21:34.430 align:middle line:84%
And I would to throw
my food in the garbage.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And then I got to a point where
I would dig through the garbage

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.167 align:middle line:90%
and get the sugar.

00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:84%
And then I got to a
point where the only way

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.417 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't dig
through the garbage

00:21:42.417 --> 00:21:44.270 align:middle line:90%
was to spray it with Windex.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.600 align:middle line:84%
So you tell me that that's
healthy and in balance.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.100 align:middle line:84%
Now I can look at a candy bar
or a piece of dark chocolate

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.400 align:middle line:84%
that's good quality, like
a raw chocolate or cacao,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and I could look at that just
have a little tiny piece of it

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.930 align:middle line:90%
and be so satisfied.

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:03.200 align:middle line:84%
So many women that I know
can't have it in their house.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:05.660 align:middle line:84%
If I have a relationship with
food where I can't have it

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:07.520 align:middle line:84%
in the house, then I
have to look at what's

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.690 align:middle line:90%
really going on in my life.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:10.640 align:middle line:84%
Because it has nothing
to do with the food.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.495 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:22:11.495 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not just what
you're eating,

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:14.600 align:middle line:90%
it's also what's eating you.

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:84%
So where is the sweetness
missing in your life?

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:19.355 align:middle line:90%
What else is going on?

00:22:19.355 --> 00:22:21.230 align:middle line:84%
What kind of suffering
are you going through?

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:24.380 align:middle line:84%
What's going on between
this ear and this ear?

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.240 align:middle line:84%
That's where the
addiction really is.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And certainly foods
can exacerbate that.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's a chemical
reason why they can.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.020 align:middle line:84%
But let's look at where
you're not satisfied.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:34.190 align:middle line:90%
Are you in a dead-end job?

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:84%
Are you married to somebody
who treats you like crap?

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.910 align:middle line:84%
Are you suffocating under the
weight of too much pressure

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:90%
in your life?

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:47.090 align:middle line:84%
Are there some old
residual traumas and dramas

00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:49.670 align:middle line:84%
that need to be attended to,
some unfinished business,

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.670 align:middle line:84%
that's getting you
stuck and making you

00:22:52.670 --> 00:22:55.790 align:middle line:84%
keep spinning your wheels
that will ultimately encourage

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.980 align:middle line:90%
you to make poor food choices?

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.010 align:middle line:90%
It's holistic.

00:22:59.010 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:90%
It's connected.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:03.860 align:middle line:84%
I am an ecosystem made up of
rivers, lakes, dreams, oceans,

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:06.410 align:middle line:84%
thoughts, memories,
all of those things.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't address
it in a holistic way,

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:90%
then I can't truly heal.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.190 align:middle line:90%
I can't live a long life.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:15.260 align:middle line:84%
And that's the piece
of allopathic medicine

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:20.102 align:middle line:90%
that can be sort of frustrating.

00:23:20.102 --> 00:23:22.310 align:middle line:84%
If I just pull it apart and
look under the microscope

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and just focus on
this one tiny thing

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and miss how it
all connects, then

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that that is
truly good, sound medicine.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:36.080 align:middle line:90%


00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.330 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people,
when they're stressed or sad,

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:42.020 align:middle line:84%
they turn to food for
comfort, especially old foods

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:44.300 align:middle line:90%
that they ate growing up.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Meatloaf, mashed potatoes, cake,
cookies, all of those things

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.140 align:middle line:84%
that you ate or you
got from your mom.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.660 align:middle line:84%
And it goes back to
that time of being

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.870 align:middle line:84%
nurtured and
nourished and whatnot.

00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.940 align:middle line:84%
One of the best pieces
of advice I ever got

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:84%
from a spiritual teacher was
if you're upset, don't eat.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:06.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's so profound
because oftentimes when

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.740 align:middle line:84%
we're upset, we have
no connection to

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.950 align:middle line:84%
whether or not we're satiated or
not, whether or not we're full.

00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Because we're trying
to fill a void

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.220 align:middle line:84%
that can never be
filled with food.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.230 align:middle line:84%
And so that's the
time where I actually

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.570 align:middle line:84%
will sit and take a deep
breath, and go for a walk

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.440 align:middle line:84%
or do a 20-minute
meditation practice.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm new to Emotional
Freedom Technique,

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.460 align:middle line:84%
but I absolutely love it
because I think it works.

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.070 align:middle line:84%
I've been on the
couch for decades.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:35.060 align:middle line:90%
Did I say decades?

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:90%
I did.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'd like
that money back.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.630 align:middle line:84%
But Emotional Freedom
Technique, for me,

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:46.550 align:middle line:84%
I can tap into the place and
move that energy so quickly.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.600 align:middle line:84%
So finding other ways
to tune your instrument.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.510 align:middle line:84%
My instrument is beautiful
and it's incredibly unique.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.717 align:middle line:84%
Yours is absolutely
different from mine.

00:24:55.717 --> 00:24:57.800 align:middle line:84%
But there might be things
that we share in common,

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
be it meditation,
EFT, journaling.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.720 align:middle line:84%
And not just journaling, dear
diary, today I feel very sad

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.620 align:middle line:90%
and I want to eat everything.

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.670 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:12.770 align:middle line:90%
What is your thing, baby?

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:14.180 align:middle line:90%
What's happening for you?

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.940 align:middle line:84%
So I might start a journal entry
with, hey, Kris, what's up?

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Anything new?

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.960 align:middle line:84%
And then I will write
what is going on.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.380 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't have the ability
to figure out a solution,

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.750 align:middle line:84%
I might say, what
if you did know?

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.108 align:middle line:84%
What if your best
friend, who is you,

00:25:29.108 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
could give you some
advice right now?

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.060 align:middle line:90%
What would she say?

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.430 align:middle line:84%
She would say, you
need to sleep more.

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:37.340 align:middle line:84%
This deal that looks
so enticing is probably

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.020 align:middle line:84%
going to suck you
dry, and you're not

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.150 align:middle line:90%
going to have time for play.

00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:42.740 align:middle line:84%
If I don't have
time to have fun,

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.870 align:middle line:84%
what's the point
of working so hard?

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Life is too short
to be too serious.

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:52.630 align:middle line:90%


00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:55.070 align:middle line:84%
Again, stress is the
root cause of most

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.140 align:middle line:90%
of our issues in our tissues.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Or, as I call them,
the shit pickles.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:02.100 align:middle line:84%
And so how do we
deal with stress?

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:90%
Each person has a unique makeup.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.070 align:middle line:90%
And again, a unique instrument.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And what might work for me
maybe doesn't work for you.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.690 align:middle line:84%
But some of the
things that I can say,

00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:14.750 align:middle line:84%
that I have seen work for myself
and countless other people,

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.840 align:middle line:84%
is really changing our diet and
lifestyle, first and foremost.

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.440 align:middle line:84%
So eating less of
the acidic foods,

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.700 align:middle line:90%
more of the alkaline foods.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.810 align:middle line:84%
More of the plant kingdom,
less of the animal kingdom.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And really focusing on what
we're putting in our body

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and how it creates
stress and inflammation.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.390 align:middle line:84%
So the things that create
stress and inflammation

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:39.140 align:middle line:84%
are wheat, sugar, processed
foods, refined foods,

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.272 align:middle line:84%
animal products,
meaning meat and dairy.

00:26:42.272 --> 00:26:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mentioned
wheat, so gluten.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.580 align:middle line:90%
Things like that.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:50.790 align:middle line:84%
But stress and food is
just one part of it.

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:52.460 align:middle line:90%
So what's eating you?

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.200 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:84%
How can we move through some
of the sticky emotional traumas

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.150 align:middle line:90%
and dramas in our lives?

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:84%
And yoga, meditation,
a long walk

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.690 align:middle line:84%
in the woods,
journaling, as I said,

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Emotional Freedom Technique.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.893 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps a checkup
from the neck up.

00:27:12.893 --> 00:27:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I've done it for
many, many years.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.040 align:middle line:84%
But a lot of people,
they're so nervous.

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.040 align:middle line:84%
What's it going to be
like going to a therapist?

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.207 align:middle line:90%
Is that going to be awkward?

00:27:20.207 --> 00:27:21.410 align:middle line:90%
Does that mean I'm crazy?

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.390 align:middle line:84%
No, it means you
need somebody to talk

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.130 align:middle line:90%
to to bounce some ideas off of.

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:28.400 align:middle line:84%
There's pieces of your
life that are stuck.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Would you like to move forward?

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.390 align:middle line:90%
Because you need to.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.790 align:middle line:84%
So understanding that there's
all of these different ways

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:36.740 align:middle line:84%
that we can reduce
stress in our lives.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.380 align:middle line:84%
A good old hot bath with
baking soda and Epsom

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:44.000 align:middle line:84%
salt and a little bit of
lavender can do wonders.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.380 align:middle line:90%
A massage.

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Oftentimes, people think massage
is a great birthday present.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:52.590 align:middle line:84%
I'll give somebody a gift
certificate for a massage.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:56.270 align:middle line:84%
A massage for me is
actually a weekly necessity.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.330 align:middle line:84%
And I course-correct
my financial situation

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.670 align:middle line:84%
to make sure there's
room for that.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:03.980 align:middle line:84%
I will have less
of one thing that I

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.230 align:middle line:84%
would like to have in
favor of getting a massage.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Because it tunes my
instrument and it reduces

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:84%
stress in my life so that I
can go out there in the world

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.710 align:middle line:84%
and give speeches in front of
hundreds and hundreds of people

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:18.470 align:middle line:84%
and encouraging them to change
their diet and lifestyles.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.535 align:middle line:90%
I have to stay in tune.

00:28:21.535 --> 00:28:22.910 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
different things,

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:25.730 align:middle line:84%
which are really simple
things that can help us just

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:26.900 align:middle line:90%
be happier, really.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:32.043 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Everything that I
have gotten in my life

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.930 align:middle line:90%
is because I saw it first.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when I was told
that there wasn't a cure

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:41.120 align:middle line:84%
and there was
nothing I could do,

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.460 align:middle line:84%
that was a really hard
thing to sit with.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But the nothing I could
do part didn't feel right.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:49.010 align:middle line:84%
And I started to
see what I could do.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:52.620 align:middle line:84%
And then making "Crazy Sexy
Cancer" and people said,

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:55.940 align:middle line:84%
nobody's ever going to
buy a film like that

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.950 align:middle line:90%
with that kind of title.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.680 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, I can see it.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.900 align:middle line:84%
I can see it, and I can
see where it can live.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Or being on "Oprah,"
people said, OK,

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:09.180 align:middle line:84%
not only are you're not going to
sell that film with that title,

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.390 align:middle line:84%
but you are not going
to sit with that lady.

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.860 align:middle line:84%
And I could see it
and I could feel it.

00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.980 align:middle line:84%
And now that doesn't
mean that I'm

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.320 align:middle line:84%
saying that if you want a
diamond necklace, just see it

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.090 align:middle line:90%
and it will materialize.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:23.630 align:middle line:84%
I think clarity is key because
clarity will give you focus.

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Focus, commitment,
and follow through.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.000 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not clear, how
can you go out into the world

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.610 align:middle line:90%
and create your dream?

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:35.300 align:middle line:84%
And visualization and
manifesting, that really to me

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.550 align:middle line:90%
is clarity and direction.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:84%
Where am I going to put
my time and my energy?

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.230 align:middle line:84%
Because there isn't a lot of
time and energy to go around.

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:84%
So where am I going
to channel it so

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.910 align:middle line:90%
that I can get the most reward?

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:50.450 align:middle line:84%
But also what's very key
is space in your life.

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:52.570 align:middle line:84%
If your life is
so packed and you

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.490 align:middle line:84%
are scheduled within
a hair of yourself,

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.580 align:middle line:84%
there's no way
that you can build

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.550 align:middle line:90%
a life that includes a dream.

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.890 align:middle line:84%
So creating space in
your life, which also

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.810 align:middle line:90%
reduces inflammation.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Creating space
allows for vision.

00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And when you have vision,
you can become a visionary.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:15.200 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't have space and
you don't have vision, baby,

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.670 align:middle line:84%
you ain't going to
be no visionary.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:90%


00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was
interesting for me when

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.843 align:middle line:84%
I decided to really
take charge of my diet.

00:30:27.843 --> 00:30:29.260 align:middle line:84%
I started to just
take a step back

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.280 align:middle line:84%
and say, well, I didn't come
to this planet with a chart.

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't like
have to understand

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.860 align:middle line:84%
what my blood type was before I
could go to the grocery store.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:40.960 align:middle line:84%
I just think that gets
really complicated.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.660 align:middle line:84%
And the great gods or goddesses,
or whoever is up there,

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:48.460 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, Elvis, who
knows, wouldn't put

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.040 align:middle line:90%
that kind of pressure on me.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.710 align:middle line:84%
And I would have come here
prepared if that was the case.

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not one for counting
calories or fat grams,

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:01.930 align:middle line:84%
partially because I was
wired with a food addiction

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and I struggled with anorexia
and bulimia for my teens

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.170 align:middle line:90%
because I was a performer.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And so if I took all of
that into consideration,

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:13.310 align:middle line:84%
and everything I learned
about inflammation

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:17.830 align:middle line:84%
and a plant-based diet,
what made more sense to me

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:22.150 align:middle line:84%
was eating from the garden
but also looking at the foods

00:31:22.150 --> 00:31:25.450 align:middle line:90%
and saying, OK, well, pH.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.950 align:middle line:90%
This is an interesting thing.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And the pH scale goes from
0 to 14, and 7 is neutral.

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:33.530 align:middle line:90%
And around 7.365 or 7.4--

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:36.790 align:middle line:84%
or slightly alkaline-- is
where our body wants to be.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.950 align:middle line:84%
So if that's where
our bodies want to be,

00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:41.590 align:middle line:84%
perhaps I should be eating
more of the alkaline foods that

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:44.110 align:middle line:84%
create that lovely
alkaline environment.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.360 align:middle line:84%
When I ate more of the
acidic foods, foods

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.780 align:middle line:84%
like the white stuff and
meat and dairy and sugar

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and processed foods and
trans fats and things

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:54.802 align:middle line:84%
like that, those things
are highly acidic.

00:31:54.802 --> 00:31:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So the body is
going to do anything

00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.470 align:middle line:90%
to maintain proper pH balance.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And the pH of the blood
is what matters the most.

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And certainly the blood doesn't
really vary because it can't.

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So what the body has to do
is it has to mine minerals--

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:12.070 align:middle line:84%
magnesium potassium, calcium--
to then neutralize those acids.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.860 align:middle line:84%
And it goes through this
cascade of chemical reactions,

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.410 align:middle line:84%
and it creates a lot of
imbalance in the body,

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:22.420 align:middle line:84%
draining our reserves, making
the energy withdrawals,

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:25.760 align:middle line:84%
leading us to
physical bankruptcy.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.900 align:middle line:84%
And so what was
really interesting

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.180 align:middle line:84%
about this was when I
started to do it with myself,

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.555 align:middle line:84%
and then started to teach a
lot of other people to do it,

00:32:33.555 --> 00:32:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and certainly with
my books, weight loss

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:37.480 align:middle line:90%
was just really simple.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.280 align:middle line:90%
So are we eating fats?

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.808 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, but we're eating good
fats, natural fats, whole fats,

00:32:42.808 --> 00:32:44.850 align:middle line:84%
for the most part, that
haven't been manipulated.

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So avocados, nuts, and seeds,
even some cold-press oils,

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.720 align:middle line:84%
organic oils, from time to
time in small quantities.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.690 align:middle line:90%
But enough to be satisfied.

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:58.910 align:middle line:90%
And the same thing with protein.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:01.060 align:middle line:84%
And are we getting all
the protein that we need?

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:05.080 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely, but we're getting it
from a varied plant-based diet.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.330 align:middle line:90%
And so it's a lot healthier.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The protein contains
antioxidants, phytonutrients,

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.390 align:middle line:84%
fiber, as opposed to
saturated fat and all

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:17.260 align:middle line:84%
of the hormones, herbicides,
pesticides, fungicides,

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and the like that
we get, especially

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.790 align:middle line:90%
from the factory farm system.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the more I start to
research alkalinity and pH,

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:27.523 align:middle line:84%
the more my body just
naturally came into balance.

00:33:27.523 --> 00:33:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I saw
with a lot of my clients

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.510 align:middle line:84%
and also with my
fans and followers

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:33.340 align:middle line:90%
who have been reading my books.

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.280 align:middle line:84%
I just led a 21-day
cleanse online.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:41.770 align:middle line:84%
And on average, people were
losing 10, 15 pounds easily.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:45.250 align:middle line:84%
And people who had more weight
to lose, they were losing more.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.850 align:middle line:84%
But we're doing
it in a slow way.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.850 align:middle line:84%
And some of those people
have been going longer,

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:51.277 align:middle line:90%
so it's not that quickly.

00:33:51.277 --> 00:33:53.110 align:middle line:84%
But certainly if you're
coming into balance,

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:56.470 align:middle line:84%
it's kind of amazing how
fast it will fall off.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:34:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And I just think it
can be a lot easier.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.430 align:middle line:84%
That's why I don't
count calories,

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:04.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't count fat grams.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:07.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I understand the notion
calories in, calories out.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:10.580 align:middle line:84%
We have to exercise and we have
to watch how much we're eating.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.600 align:middle line:84%
But what's really interesting
about a nutrient-dense diet

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:16.750 align:middle line:84%
is you get full, as
opposed to a diet that's

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:21.730 align:middle line:84%
full of low-fat
foods, fake foods, all

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.170 align:middle line:84%
of the fake sweeteners, and
all of that kind of stuff.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.389 align:middle line:90%
You don't feel full.

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:28.150 align:middle line:84%
The satiation button
doesn't get hit.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So you keep going for
more and more and more.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:33.010 align:middle line:84%
This endless hunger that
will never be met as you

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:36.159 align:middle line:84%
get fatter and fatter and
fatter, and more malnourished,

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:90%
by the way.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So how interesting is
it that we are suffering

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:43.000 align:middle line:90%
from an obesity epidemic?

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And yet most of those
people are malnourished.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.110 align:middle line:84%
It makes no sense,
and yet it does.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:53.989 align:middle line:90%


00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:58.700 align:middle line:84%
The thing is that
none of this is 100%.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So there are shades of
gray with everything.

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And I know from
myself when I started

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:06.750 align:middle line:84%
to become more interested in
alkaline foods, I thought,

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:09.440 align:middle line:84%
well, wouldn't it be better
if I ate only alkaline foods?

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.285 align:middle line:84%
The truth is that
you can't, really,

00:35:11.285 --> 00:35:13.040 align:middle line:84%
to have a healthy
diet, because we

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.380 align:middle line:84%
need some of the
slightly acidic foods,

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.930 align:middle line:90%
the beans, the healthy grains--

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, I would prefer
gluten-free grains,

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.600 align:middle line:84%
like quinoa, millet,
buckwheat, brown rice.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.210 align:middle line:84%
And the nuts and the
seeds, and things that

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.770 align:middle line:90%
can be slightly acidifying.

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.410 align:middle line:84%
We need those for
proper nutrition.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:32.600 align:middle line:90%
So it can't be black and white.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And when people make it black
or white, it's either/or,

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:36.140 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't work.

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:36.950 align:middle line:90%
It's an and.

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.120 align:middle line:90%
It's always and.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.620 align:middle line:84%
You and I are going
to come together

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.730 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
change the world.

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And so with alkaline
foods, don't get so

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.600 align:middle line:84%
caught up on the fact that
it has to be all alkaline.

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.300 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're basically
robbing your body.

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:53.780 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't think that it's
possible to eat a 100% alkaline

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.120 align:middle line:84%
diet and get the
nutrition that you need.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:01.130 align:middle line:90%


00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:02.870 align:middle line:90%
A lot people talk about 80-20.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:06.105 align:middle line:84%
So 80% of my foods are
coming from plants.

00:36:06.105 --> 00:36:08.060 align:middle line:90%
Or if I just look at my plate.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.040 align:middle line:84%
And even to make it even
simpler for somebody

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.180 align:middle line:90%
who's just starting out.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.890 align:middle line:84%
Look at your plate,
cut it in half.

00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:15.390 align:middle line:90%
50% of it, greens and veggies.

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:16.950 align:middle line:90%
Just start there.

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.740 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
50%, if you're still

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:21.170 align:middle line:90%
eating animal products, reduce.

00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Can you do it two to three
times per week as opposed

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.880 align:middle line:90%
to two to three times per day?

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Creating all of these
problems in your body,

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.980 align:middle line:90%
not setting you up for success.

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.010 align:middle line:84%
So if we're eating
animal products,

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:35.810 align:middle line:84%
we're reducing the
amount we're eating.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:38.120 align:middle line:84%
Now we're choosing
healthier proteins.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:41.900 align:middle line:84%
We're choosing our nuts, our
seeds, our beans, our rice,

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:44.320 align:middle line:84%
all of these wonderful
things, and grains.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.590 align:middle line:90%
And even soy in moderation.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.290 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
really down on soy.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:50.083 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a lot
of soy in my diet,

00:36:50.083 --> 00:36:52.250 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's a great
transition food for people.

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:55.760 align:middle line:84%
It creates mucus and
allergies, and it can just

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.010 align:middle line:90%
disrupt the endocrine system.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people
who say, yea soy, nay soy.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Where I fall is
condiment portion.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.230 align:middle line:84%
Condiment portion from time
to time as a way to sort

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.340 align:middle line:90%
of transition.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.230 align:middle line:84%
But meat should be
condiment portion, too.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:12.440 align:middle line:84%
If that's what you're consuming,
it should be condiment portion.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:14.450 align:middle line:84%
And the whole idea
that we have to have

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:16.010 align:middle line:84%
a complete protein
otherwise we're

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:17.990 align:middle line:90%
going to wither away and die.

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:20.270 align:middle line:90%
That's a load of crap.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:22.820 align:middle line:84%
So even the recommended
daily allowance

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.680 align:middle line:84%
for a woman who
weighs 130 pounds

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:84%
is about 47 grams
of protein per day.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.450 align:middle line:84%
On average, Americans
are consuming

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:33.940 align:middle line:84%
between 100 to 120 grams
of protein per day.

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.760 align:middle line:84%
The more protein that we consume
from animal products and animal

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:40.880 align:middle line:84%
sources, the higher our
rate of chronic disease.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.870 align:middle line:84%
We are not malnourished
in that extent.

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:45.950 align:middle line:90%
We are obese.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.800 align:middle line:84%
We are a malnourished
obese people.

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.790 align:middle line:90%
That is what's going on.

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:53.000 align:middle line:84%
And the myth of the
complete protein

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.180 align:middle line:84%
is what also gets us
into so much trouble.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:00.560 align:middle line:84%
When plants can often be
just missing one amino acid.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.930 align:middle line:84%
And if we are having a
very plant-based diet,

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:04.730 align:middle line:84%
we're getting
everything that we need.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:07.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's all frickin'
propaganda, and we know

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.480 align:middle line:90%
exactly where it's coming from.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So much of the literature in
our schools came from where?

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.760 align:middle line:90%
The American Dairy Council.

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:17.660 align:middle line:90%
Where?

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Big agribusiness.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.040 align:middle line:84%
So whenever I hear these
things, I'm always wondering.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.310 align:middle line:84%
Consider the source,
follow the trail.

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Because there's no special
interests in broccoli.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.170 align:middle line:90%
And there's no subsidies either.

00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:35.000 align:middle line:84%
And there should be,
there really should be.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Part of the problem
is our agribusiness,

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:40.700 align:middle line:84%
our pharmaceutical business,
all of these things coming

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:41.510 align:middle line:90%
together--

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.420 align:middle line:84%
The factory farm system,
which is so toxic

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:48.260 align:middle line:90%
and so disease-ridden--

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And if we don't look at
the system as a whole,

00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:54.590 align:middle line:84%
and if we don't examine
our food sources, then

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:59.910 align:middle line:84%
how can we possibly take control
of our lives and our health?

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:04.370 align:middle line:84%
So if somebody is eating a
certified humane product,

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.920 align:middle line:84%
that's going to be a
much better choice.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.900 align:middle line:84%
And why I choose a
certified humane seal

00:39:08.900 --> 00:39:10.760 align:middle line:90%
is because I trust it.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Because so many of these
seals are not regulated.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:15.160 align:middle line:90%
The certified humane seal is.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.030 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be a
healthier choice for you.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Those animals were cared
for as best as they can.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:23.030 align:middle line:84%
They're still going
to be slaughtered,

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:26.540 align:middle line:84%
but they're also not
being fed a diet that

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:30.110 align:middle line:90%
is unnatural to themselves.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.190 align:middle line:84%
And they're not getting
the hormones, herbicides,

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:33.620 align:middle line:90%
pesticides, all of those things.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:38.110 align:middle line:90%


00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.390 align:middle line:84%
So make juice not war
is one of my mottoes

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:42.940 align:middle line:84%
because I don't want
to make war in my body.

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.075 align:middle line:84%
So instead of drinking
things like soda,

00:39:49.075 --> 00:39:52.300 align:middle line:84%
and energy drinks, and
a lot of caffeine--

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:56.000 align:middle line:84%
certainly coffee, which is
America's favorite drink--

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and alcohol, I'm making
green juices every day.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm getting them once a
day, twice a day, and that

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.772 align:middle line:90%
is giving me real energy.

00:40:04.772 --> 00:40:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So when other people are
going through that dip

00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:08.680 align:middle line:84%
in the afternoon, I'm
having that green juice

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.480 align:middle line:90%
and just flying, soaring.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.590 align:middle line:90%
That is the medicine.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:12.560 align:middle line:90%
That is the juice.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.410 align:middle line:90%
That is the life force.

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:15.880 align:middle line:90%
It's a good motto to have.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:19.330 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we all started
to eat healthier foods

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:23.590 align:middle line:84%
and drink healthier foods and
feel the benefits of that,

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:26.010 align:middle line:84%
prevention is just
going to grow and soar.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes a
movement that's hip to be

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:30.040 align:middle line:84%
a part of, as opposed to
something that's like crunchy,

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.582 align:middle line:84%
granola, deal with
when you're older.

00:40:31.582 --> 00:40:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Ugh, fiber.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.490 align:middle line:90%
God, when I'm 50.

00:40:33.490 --> 00:40:34.322 align:middle line:90%
Give me a break.

00:40:34.322 --> 00:40:35.530 align:middle line:90%
Right now I gotta go, go, go.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:36.617 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going, baby?

00:40:36.617 --> 00:40:37.450 align:middle line:90%
Where are you going?

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:38.850 align:middle line:84%
Because wherever
that is, you're going

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:39.850 align:middle line:90%
to get there a lot faster.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:41.142 align:middle line:90%
And more likely it's the grave.

00:40:41.142 --> 00:40:46.160 align:middle line:90%


00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.440 align:middle line:84%
Is it possible to
eat yourself sexy?

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.730 align:middle line:90%
That sounds so kinky.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.270 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Look at you guys.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.538 align:middle line:84%
You guys are some
of the prettiest,

00:40:55.538 --> 00:40:58.140 align:middle line:84%
healthiest, glowiest, hottest
people I've met in a long time.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.690 align:middle line:90%
And you're living proof.

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.680 align:middle line:84%
You're eating well and
you're living well.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.780 align:middle line:90%
And there is a glow.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And people talk about the glow,
and sometimes that can sort of

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:06.200 align:middle line:90%
be cheesy, like, get the glow.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:08.420 align:middle line:90%
But you see it in those people.

00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.530 align:middle line:84%
You do have clearer eyes and
better skin and better health

00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:13.910 align:middle line:90%
and prettier hair.

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:15.392 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you're
going for, I think

00:41:15.392 --> 00:41:16.850 align:middle line:84%
that you can
ultimately get it when

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:19.397 align:middle line:84%
you start to change
your diet and lifestyle.

00:41:19.397 --> 00:41:21.230 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people look
at me and they're like,

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:22.640 align:middle line:90%
you must be in your 20s.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.110 align:middle line:90%
Well, no, I'm not.

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:26.310 align:middle line:84%
And that's always
a nice compliment.

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.880 align:middle line:84%
I love hearing that people think
I'm a lot younger than I am,

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.170 align:middle line:90%
and heading into my 40s.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:33.920 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, I think
that this lifestyle

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.280 align:middle line:84%
has helped me not only
live with a chronic disease

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.060 align:middle line:84%
but also feel young,
be young in my skin,

00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:43.460 align:middle line:84%
and, depending on the lighting,
look pretty good, too.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:49.690 align:middle line:90%


00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So our green juice
recipes basically

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:54.880 align:middle line:84%
are how we start our
day, and it's our fuel.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:59.192 align:middle line:84%
And it always varies, but the
base is cucumber and celery.

00:41:59.192 --> 00:42:01.150 align:middle line:84%
And then, depending on
whatever greens we have,

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:04.690 align:middle line:84%
maybe we have kale, or
spinach, or romaine.

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:06.455 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we have a
little bit of parsley.

00:42:06.455 --> 00:42:09.040 align:middle line:84%
And then we have and
amazing green in there.

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.560 align:middle line:84%
And we use a little bit
of fruit to sweeten it.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:16.680 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a big fan of fruits
and overdoing it with fruits.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Actually, fruits are
fantastic, but you just

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:20.020 align:middle line:90%
don't want to overdo it.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And so we might use a
pear or a green apple

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.380 align:middle line:84%
to sweeten it, between the two
of us, my husband and myself.

00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:27.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:28.930 align:middle line:90%
That's the juice.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:29.770 align:middle line:90%
That's the secret.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:30.610 align:middle line:90%
It's that simple.

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's the flu
shot, by the way.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So many people run out
and get a flu shot.

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Get a juice.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Make it a part of
your daily life.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.020 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee that you will
not get as many colds

00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.210 align:middle line:90%
as you're used to getting.

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:44.500 align:middle line:84%
When everybody else is
going around the office,

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.290 align:middle line:84%
watercooler-sneezing,
like, don't come near me,

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:48.970 align:middle line:90%
you've got your green juice.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.950 align:middle line:90%
It's OK, baby.

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:57.000 align:middle line:90%
