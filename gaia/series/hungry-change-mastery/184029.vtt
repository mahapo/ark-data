[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:23.910 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>> My life changed
radically in 2000,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.070 align:middle line:84%
actually in the
new year of 2000.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And I was diagnosed by a
holistic practitioner who

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.170 align:middle line:84%
first time said, listen,
there's something

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.580 align:middle line:84%
wrong with your abdominal
area, with the ovaries.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:90%
Go and get tested here.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.050 align:middle line:90%
And also she noticed that--

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.430 align:middle line:84%
she scanned my
body energetically

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.922 align:middle line:84%
and she said, you have 16 gall
bladder stones, and she said,

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.380 align:middle line:84%
if you don't take
care of yourself,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.490 align:middle line:90%
you might have diabetes.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:90%
And I was, like--

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.172 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know what
is she talking about.

00:00:56.172 --> 00:00:57.630 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what
is gall bladder.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what is
diabetes and so on.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't care at all
for health in that time.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.450 align:middle line:84%
And I lived in Poland,
grew up in Poland,

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.220 align:middle line:84%
so we ate a lot of Polish
food, which is kind of oily,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.790 align:middle line:84%
and all these sausages and
pierogis and stuff like this.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And then as soon as communism
collapsed in Poland,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:84%
we got the gift from
America, which is pizza,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.570 align:middle line:90%
all this fast foods and so on.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.910 align:middle line:84%
So my diet was, like,
hodgepodge of this and that.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
And there was no education about
healthy lifestyle whatsoever.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.520 align:middle line:84%
No one told us that fast
food could be bad for you.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.100 align:middle line:84%
Only now we can see-- when you
look at the Polish population,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.810 align:middle line:84%
you can see, oh, something
has happened here

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.210 align:middle line:90%
over the years, yeah?

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.410 align:middle line:84%
So when I was in my old
body, I grew up as a girl

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.010 align:middle line:84%
and I was always overweight
ever since I entered the school

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.770 align:middle line:84%
system because the school
system was kind of stressful

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.240 align:middle line:90%
probably for me.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I was
always plumpy, and I

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.780 align:middle line:84%
felt a little bit like
being wrapped in a blanket

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.160 align:middle line:84%
with three holes in it, two
to watch television and one

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.990 align:middle line:90%
to eat, and that's it.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And I could never
get the attention

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.230 align:middle line:84%
of a boy I liked when I
was a teenager because all

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.060 align:middle line:84%
those good looking
guys were just

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.190 align:middle line:90%
swept away by my girlfriends.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:90%
They wouldn't even notice me.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
So I felt I was complex, shy,
and chronically depressed.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.230 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally,
when I got married

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.440 align:middle line:84%
and I was still in the
kind of toxic mindset

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.970 align:middle line:84%
and not fulfilled at all and
we were not happy as a couple

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.147 align:middle line:84%
together, I was just, like--
my energy was just going down

00:02:39.147 --> 00:02:40.230 align:middle line:90%
the drain, down the drain.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And I would wake
up every morning,

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:84%
open my eyes with a
very strong coffee

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.770 align:middle line:84%
because I would
possibly never wake up.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Ever since I was six years
old and I went to school,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I started gaining weight,
probably because school

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.820 align:middle line:84%
was stressful, and
I felt a little bit

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.890 align:middle line:90%
like pushing a circle--

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.580 align:middle line:84%
I was a circle, and I was
being pushed into a square,

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.950 align:middle line:84%
and I had to fit in,
and I didn't like it.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And we know that when
you are stressed,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.070 align:middle line:84%
the blood pH turns acid
because of your emotions.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.570 align:middle line:84%
So when you're acidic,
you gain weight.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.370 align:middle line:90%
Now I know it.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.990 align:middle line:90%
Then I didn't.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.610 align:middle line:84%
So I was a plumpy girl, and
I had challenges exercising,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.120 align:middle line:84%
and I was always the
last one in sports.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.330 align:middle line:84%
So when they were
picking up somebody

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
to play basketball with,
I was the last girl.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.895 align:middle line:90%
Like, OK, we have to take her.

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:34.770 align:middle line:90%
Who's going to take--

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.440 align:middle line:90%
we don't want-- you know?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And always if we did
marathon or sprint running,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle line:84%
I would always have
the last score.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.540 align:middle line:84%
So the entire school was like,
look at her, she's running.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.340 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't running.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.240 align:middle line:90%
I was rolling.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.840 align:middle line:90%
It was like a snowball running.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.440 align:middle line:84%
I feel very compassionate
about women who are overweight.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's just
the secret of beauty

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.630 align:middle line:84%
is just right inside
you, just stop to nature,

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
and I want to
share that message.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And then later on
when I was married,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.020 align:middle line:84%
I was not fulfilled
with my former husband.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.280 align:middle line:90%
We were not very happy either.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Like, sex life was very
boring and not really fun.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.269 align:middle line:84%
Life was not fun
above everything.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And life was all about working
hard and eating the food

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.880 align:middle line:84%
and just watching TV and
working hard, eating the food,

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and watching TV, and
going to the supermarket,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.470 align:middle line:90%
going to the malls.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And so it's like, how
much of the same scenario

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.580 align:middle line:90%
can you do a day?

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.440 align:middle line:84%
When you realize that you are
a creative, powerful being

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
and you realize
that there's life

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.490 align:middle line:84%
out there, that the planet is
full of adventures and full

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
of amazing people that you
can meet, you're like, wow,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.990 align:middle line:90%
where have I been?

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.950 align:middle line:90%
Where have I been--

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.240 align:middle line:84%
doing the same thing, this
cookie cutter routine.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:90%
So I just felt very unfulfilled.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.210 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.500 align:middle line:84%
I was totally a sugar
junkie and coffee junkie.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And I mean, my life
was like this--

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:15.720 align:middle line:84%
that I needed certain foods
in order to stay sane,

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.180 align:middle line:90%
in order to manage my reality.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.490 align:middle line:84%
Like, for example,
I would wake up,

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and I would open my eyes
with a strong dose of coffee.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.530 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I was just
perpetually tired, drowsy.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.110 align:middle line:84%
I could not focus without
a strong dose of coffee

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.210 align:middle line:90%
loaded with sugar, of course.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And then, because of the
depression that I had

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and low energy level,
I would just look at--

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.610 align:middle line:84%
I remember-- I lived in
Warsaw then in Poland.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.470 align:middle line:90%
I would look at the window.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:90%
It was raining.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.750 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like, God,
please stop this train.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:49.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting off.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:84%
If this is called
life, I'm done.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.530 align:middle line:84%
So I was totally hooked
on coffee, sugar, then,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.500 align:middle line:84%
of course, white
bread and mayonnaise

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:84%
or just like butter and dairy,
always this yogurt and cereal.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.080 align:middle line:84%
And then only later on I
learned that actually milk

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:90%
puts you to sleep.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.160 align:middle line:84%
So now I'm thinking,
like, why would I

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.880 align:middle line:84%
even drink dairy in the
morning when in the morning

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.220 align:middle line:90%
I need energy?

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So at all, you would do
yogurt or dairy products

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.410 align:middle line:84%
in the evening when you
want to go to sleep.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm done with
dairy altogether.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, of course,
I was addicted to meat.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Many people don't
acknowledge this today

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:84%
that meat is actually a
very addictive substance.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And I would feel like
I'm getting energy

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.320 align:middle line:84%
from it, that grounding energy
to just perform during the day,

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.460 align:middle line:84%
go to work and go to compete
in corporate structures.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:84%
And I was working as
a journalist then.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.920 align:middle line:84%
And so you can imagine being a
TV reporter, delivering news,

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of stress.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And then my life changed
radically one time.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So when I was overweight,
I was, I think,

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.210 align:middle line:84%
183 pounds at the
time when I was

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.460 align:middle line:90%
diagnosed with ovarian cancer.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:84%
And I remember the
time when I could not

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:84%
bow down to pick up something
because I felt pain.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Also, I felt like something
is just eating me.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Something is breeding
itself on me.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.430 align:middle line:84%
It was a funny feeling, and
it was actually pretty scary,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.120 align:middle line:90%
another person.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it was not
comfortable to get into clothes

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.120 align:middle line:84%
that you're just like, oh,
I cannot wear that anymore.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.630 align:middle line:90%
Oh, that I cannot wear either.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was just like wondering,
why am I gaining weight?

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:90%
Why am I getting bigger?

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:84%
There was a lot of
sports I couldn't do.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.860 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't even
realize this because when

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.810 align:middle line:84%
you sit and you're a couch
potato, you just take it like,

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:90%
ah.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:84%
Life passes you by, and you
don't even know it does so.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.290 align:middle line:84%
It's only when I
lost weight, when

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.570 align:middle line:84%
I cleansed, that I was
like, where have I been?

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.820 align:middle line:90%
Where was I all this time?

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I felt pain
in the abdominal area

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.760 align:middle line:84%
and because I was advised
by a friend of mine

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.800 align:middle line:84%
to go to a doctor
and get tested,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.620 align:middle line:84%
actually I had an
ultrasound, and then

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.770 align:middle line:84%
there was a gynecologist
and an assistant,

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:33.740 align:middle line:84%
a doctor who was
practicing there,

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:37.039 align:middle line:84%
and when they scanned my body,
they were like, oh my goodness,

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.150 align:middle line:90%
where are your ovaries?

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.440 align:middle line:84%
There were tumors like
cauliflowers there.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.510 align:middle line:84%
So they said, this could be
cancerous, we need to do tests,

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.430 align:middle line:84%
So I came back for
tests the next day,

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:84%
and then we had a
long weekend, and I

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.960 align:middle line:84%
listened to a friend of mine who
said, listen, just go cleanse.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:01.340 align:middle line:84%
So coming back from
the doctor's office,

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:84%
I already went shopping
and got, like--

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:08.420 align:middle line:84%
I went to the farmer's market,
and I got bags of veggies.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.700 align:middle line:84%
I was like, how am I
going to drink this?

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.250 align:middle line:84%
I knew, I have to go
juicing for a few days.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.740 align:middle line:90%
She told me that.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.420 align:middle line:84%
And I went to a
holistic pharmacy,

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:84%
and I got enema,
like, an enema bag.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, what am
I going to do with this?

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.765 align:middle line:90%
It all sounded disgusting.

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can
imagine to a person who

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.480 align:middle line:84%
likes sweets and
coffee and pizza

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and so on suddenly to go
on drinking beet juice,

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.360 align:middle line:90%
it's like, you must be insane.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.890 align:middle line:90%
You must be kidding.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So I knew that I'm
fighting for life here.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.310 align:middle line:90%
I felt it.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And I spoke with my husband
then, and I said to him, look,

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.660 align:middle line:84%
it's possible that
I could have cancer.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.880 align:middle line:90%
That's what they say.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.390 align:middle line:90%
And he just didn't care.

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:56.600 align:middle line:84%
He just said, ah,
you will be fine.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.550 align:middle line:90%
You'll be OK.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.830 align:middle line:90%
So I was like, oh, really?

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.330 align:middle line:84%
Is this the same
guy that I would

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.910 align:middle line:84%
take care of in
so many situations

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.860 align:middle line:90%
when he just had a little fever?

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.990 align:middle line:84%
So I just had a cold
shower, like, wake up,

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:84%
I am responsible-- and I
came to the conclusion,

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.370 align:middle line:84%
I am responsible for
one life only, my own.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.240 align:middle line:84%
And I decided, in that moment
when I had that wakeup call,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.600 align:middle line:84%
I decided that from now
on, this life, my life,

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:90%
is like a wellspring.

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:28.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to come
through my fingers.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to hold
it and drink it all.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:37.610 align:middle line:84%
So what happened was that
I did a three-day cleanse--

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.500 align:middle line:84%
radical-- enema morning and
evening on cooked coffee--

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and you can find more
information about it online.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.680 align:middle line:84%
I really don't want to
give you the details--

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:54.680 align:middle line:84%
and then also drinking beetroot
juice and apple juice and lots

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.180 align:middle line:84%
of green juices or red
juices, and twice a day I

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.240 align:middle line:84%
had to drink olive
oil and lemon juice

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.730 align:middle line:84%
to detoxify my liver
because actually,

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:10.870 align:middle line:84%
also, I saw an ultrasound that
I had 16 stones in gallbladder,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.490 align:middle line:90%
lots of gall bladder stones.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, I was doing
this, and I felt horrible.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.490 align:middle line:84%
I was like, I don't know why
I'm going through this process.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.750 align:middle line:90%
It feels disgusting.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:25.640 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a sugar
junkie on a detox program.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.930 align:middle line:90%
I was vomiting.

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:27.950 align:middle line:90%
I had diarrhea.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.080 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes I had two in one.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.280 align:middle line:84%
And my husband then was
wondering, what is she up to?

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:90%
She's kind of crazy.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I had shuttered
because when you are actually

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:42.770 align:middle line:84%
addicted to a
substance, the body has

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:90%
to release this from the cells.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's just like
a lot is happening.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.040 align:middle line:84%
It was like an internal
surgery that I did to myself

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:57.260 align:middle line:84%
through juicing and drinking
the olive oil with lemon juice.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.080 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine, it's like a
salad dressing without a salad.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.670 align:middle line:90%
Where's that salad, you know?

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.010 align:middle line:84%
Just after three
days of cleanse,

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:15.910 align:middle line:84%
I lost seven kilos, which is
3.2 pounds, and my skin cleared.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:21.980 align:middle line:84%
It was first time ever that I
lost weight naturally so fast.

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.550 align:middle line:84%
I tried other weight
loss programs,

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.460 align:middle line:90%
but they never gave me results.

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.190 align:middle line:84%
So suddenly I'm like, uh oh,
my pants are getting loose,

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.500 align:middle line:90%
and skin cleared, eyes cleared.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:90%
I could hear better.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.780 align:middle line:90%
I could see better.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I went
back to the doctors.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:40.830 align:middle line:84%
With sad faces, they said,
yeah, we're very sorry.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.662 align:middle line:84%
You have cancer, and we
prepared the bed for you.

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:84%
You're going to go
for the surgery.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.250 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't work, we
have chemotherapy and so on.

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:50.140 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like, you
know what, I just

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:55.570 align:middle line:84%
lost 16 stones out
of my gallbladder

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.610 align:middle line:84%
so many toxins cleared,
and I feel fantastic.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:59.890 align:middle line:90%
I feel different in my life.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:01.500 align:middle line:90%
I want to continue this.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So they were
thinking I was crazy,

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.312 align:middle line:84%
and I was thinking
they were crazy.

00:13:05.312 --> 00:13:06.520 align:middle line:90%
So it was like a little bit--

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.250 align:middle line:90%
we tried converting each other.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.810 align:middle line:84%
I was convinced that when
I shared it with them--

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I was convinced that when
I shared with them that,

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.380 align:middle line:84%
the idea about healthy
food and so on,

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.690 align:middle line:84%
they're going to tell
all the other people.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.150 align:middle line:84%
I was actually surprised that
they wouldn't be interested

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.990 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:84%
So then what happened later
on is that I went on--

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:31.090 align:middle line:84%
because I cleansed,
my tongue started

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.120 align:middle line:84%
to be attracted to
veggies and avocado,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.810 align:middle line:84%
and I discovered whole
different flavors and tastes

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:84%
that were sugar free,
that were meat free,

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:41.340 align:middle line:90%
that were dairy free.

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, wow, this
food actually tastes.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Like, if you eat carrots
without tons of spices

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.820 align:middle line:84%
there or ketchup, there
is food out there.

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.580 align:middle line:84%
So I discovered those flavors,
those natural flavors,

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.450 align:middle line:90%
after cleansing.

00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:00.280 align:middle line:84%
And I just continued eating
primarily a lot of raw food.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:84%
I would say that today my
diet is 80% raw, 20% vegan

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:90%
food, cooked food.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.130 align:middle line:84%
After four months of continuing
healthy diet, very, very

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:19.240 align:middle line:84%
strict, very consequent,
I was cancer free.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.730 align:middle line:90%
I went back to the doctors.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.990 align:middle line:90%
I was cancer free completely.

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And then, also,
I lost 83 pounds.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine that my
friends couldn't recognize me.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.990 align:middle line:84%
I was just like a butterfly
that came out of a cocoon.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.790 align:middle line:90%
That worm, where was she?

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:90%
Where was that worm?

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to stop
friends on the street

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:90%
and say, hi, how are you?

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.555 align:middle line:90%
And they were like, it's you?

00:14:44.555 --> 00:14:45.355 align:middle line:90%
It's you?

00:14:45.355 --> 00:14:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Oh my god, you look great.

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.150 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, yeah, it's me.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I was happy, and I wanted to
share the message with people.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Listen, we need
to eat vegetables.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:56.860 align:middle line:90%
We need to go juicing.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.980 align:middle line:84%
We need to stay healthy,
not eat that thing.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:01.810 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone wanted
to listen to this.

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
But when people saw the
way I looked and how happy,

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.230 align:middle line:84%
how much energy I got suddenly,
people were very open.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:15.290 align:middle line:84%
They were like, wow, if she did
this, so can I. So as a result,

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.670 align:middle line:84%
there was a trickle effect,
and a lot of my friends

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:23.920 align:middle line:84%
also went on cleansing and
lost weight and healed,

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and it was just like my
purpose in life right

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:90%
now is to inspire people.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:34.170 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So after I healed, I
discovered my natural beauty,

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:90%
and I discovered my body.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I started to move, and I
started to feel a lot of joy

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:45.810 align:middle line:90%
doing sports.

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:48.030 align:middle line:90%
And I signed up like crazy.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:84%
I signed up for yoga, kung fu,
tai chi, fitness, swimming.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:54.407 align:middle line:84%
It was like, if people
wanted to meet me,

00:15:54.407 --> 00:15:56.740 align:middle line:84%
my friends wanted to meet me,
I was like, you know what,

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.560 align:middle line:90%
meet me in the fitness center.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for yoga together.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for a walk in the park.

00:16:03.210 --> 00:16:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And they were like, well,
let's meet at the cafe.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.540 align:middle line:90%
And I was like, cafe?

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:90%
That smell of coffee there--

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.430 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:13.150 align:middle line:84%
Those cigarettes that people
smoke and the food there--

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:13.950 align:middle line:90%
no.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:16.860 align:middle line:84%
So I would refuse
living their ways.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.034 align:middle line:84%
I dragged them into
natural lifestyle.

00:16:19.034 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:90%


00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.350 align:middle line:84%
So something miraculous--
something powerful happens

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.240 align:middle line:90%
when you take care of yourself.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.890 align:middle line:90%
You realize you're precious.

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:33.900 align:middle line:90%
You realize that you're, like--

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.460 align:middle line:84%
you become in love with
yourself basically.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.330 align:middle line:90%
And it shines.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:38.650 align:middle line:90%
It overflows to others.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.240 align:middle line:90%
It becomes contagious.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:42.880 align:middle line:84%
You give others the permission
to be in love with themselves

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:90%
and in love with life.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And also, when I was
healing, I realized

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.100 align:middle line:84%
that I am doing something that
probably none of my family

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.570 align:middle line:90%
members ever did.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.650 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, I've got a right
to live my life differently

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:00.550 align:middle line:84%
than my mom, for example, who is
overweight and sick and so on.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:84%
I realize, I don't have
to make a Xerox copy.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to repeat
the same pattern.

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:84%
So when I was
cleansing and healing,

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.630 align:middle line:84%
I gave myself permission
to live my own life,

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:84%
design it, create it
completely differently,

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and pick only what is useful,
only what works for my family

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.609 align:middle line:90%
and thank them for the rest.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:90%


00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:84%
So most people-- I realize
today that most people, when

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.680 align:middle line:84%
they hear the word "cancer,"
they kind of surrender

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:84%
their power, they get
depressed and overwhelmed,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and then their families
steps up and say,

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:84%
poor you, we will take care
of you, which is suddenly

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.510 align:middle line:84%
you received the love,
the attention, the care

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:46.290 align:middle line:90%
that you craved.

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times
there's this temptation,

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:84%
I'll just stay sick
because everybody loves me.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:57.320 align:middle line:84%
So what happened with me is
that probably I never believed

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:00.740 align:middle line:84%
that I had cancer because my
former husband-- because he

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.930 align:middle line:90%
said, oh, you'll be fine.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:84%
I had to believe
that I'll be fine.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:06.960 align:middle line:90%
I had to have faith.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:90%
I'm OK.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.680 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be great.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And I affirmed that.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:90%
I never focused on disease.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.060 align:middle line:90%
I focused on health.

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
I focused on empowering myself
with a lot of nutrients,

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:84%
a lot of great vibration,
and also on creating--

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:25.250 align:middle line:84%
I created environment
around myself--

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.610 align:middle line:90%
friends, job, family members.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:31.378 align:middle line:84%
I invited those people
that supported my healing.

00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Those people who were
toxic, they could go.

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Buh bye.

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Today I have a baby boy.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:90%
I'm a mother.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And I'm thrilled
with this because I

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:84%
know that if I listened
to doctors then

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:84%
and if I just
surrendered my powers

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:54.180 align:middle line:84%
and went for chemotherapy,
probably I would not ever

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.470 align:middle line:90%
be able to conceive a child.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:04.850 align:middle line:84%
When I was healing myself,
yoga helped tremendously

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:09.200 align:middle line:84%
and discovering martial arts,
especially tai chi, which

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.850 align:middle line:90%
I could practice in nature.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Once I learned it, I
could just go to the park

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:14.700 align:middle line:90%
and practice this.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.360 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it
was very healing

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.900 align:middle line:84%
because it was moving
energy and blood circulation

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and getting oxygen
into my system.

00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.520 align:middle line:84%
But actually my
motivation in exercise

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:84%
was not to heal myself,
but just to still

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.350 align:middle line:84%
have that joy of
being in the movement

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:84%
and having my own
body back again.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:36.050 align:middle line:84%
If you were overweight for
so long, suddenly when you

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:37.990 align:middle line:84%
are slim and when you
are getting healthy

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
is there's so much joy
in this that you're like,

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.070 align:middle line:90%
what else can I do?

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.420 align:middle line:90%
So maybe I'll go dancing.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll-- oh,
wow, I can kick.

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:49.970 align:middle line:84%
I can feel that kung
fu exercise here.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:51.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a lot of play.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:90%
It's great playtime.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.210 align:middle line:90%
