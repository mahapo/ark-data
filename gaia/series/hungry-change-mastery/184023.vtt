00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> There's an old phrase coming
from Roman times and it says,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:84%
those who resist their destiny
will be dragged by the fates,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.670 align:middle line:84%
and those who align with
their destiny will be carried

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.830 align:middle line:90%
by the fates.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think most
of my early life

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.030 align:middle line:84%
was a resistance of what
my ultimate destiny was,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.640 align:middle line:84%
which had to do with food
and had to do with medicine.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately, circumstances
being as they turned out

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.560 align:middle line:84%
brought me and lined
me up with dealing

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.920 align:middle line:84%
with all different kinds
of exotic and gourmet foods

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.400 align:middle line:84%
and raw foods and superfoods
and wonderful, beautiful foods

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.520 align:middle line:84%
and how they can relate
to people's healing,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.895 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I've been
teaching for the last 20 years.

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:08.360 align:middle line:90%


00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.190 align:middle line:84%
My mom was an anesthesiologist,
and she practiced early on

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.140 align:middle line:84%
in my life and then
essentially retired

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.090 align:middle line:90%
to support raising the kids.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.690 align:middle line:84%
My dad was in general
practice and family practice

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and also did a lot of
emergency room surgery.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.640 align:middle line:84%
He's done every kind
of surgery, actually

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:84%
and then inevitably got
into osteopathic medicine

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.370 align:middle line:84%
and spinal cord rehabilitation
as well as sports injuries.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately,
I was able to get

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.000 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of an education
on acupuncture and acupressure

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and laser acupuncture and some
of these different aspects

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.130 align:middle line:90%
of alternative healing early on.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.650 align:middle line:84%
So that did have some
influence on getting me

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:84%
into alternative and
holistic healing.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:90%


00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.590 align:middle line:84%
It's the nature of
human consciousness.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.190 align:middle line:84%
It's the nature of our own
particular philosophical

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.735 align:middle line:84%
and metaphysical and
spiritual dilemma.

00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:03.610 align:middle line:90%
It's a deep question.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.710 align:middle line:84%
It's tough to answer,
and I can answer it

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
in many different ways,
but from a very cursory,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.140 align:middle line:84%
surface perspective,
what's actually happened

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.970 align:middle line:84%
is that we left farms, we
got to living in cities,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.760 align:middle line:90%
and forgot about our instincts.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's led to
an obesity crisis,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.920 align:middle line:84%
it's led to a crisis
of misunderstanding

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.010 align:middle line:84%
of what a natural diet
includes, and it's also

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.060 align:middle line:84%
left us with a little bit
of a despair, a confusion.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.300 align:middle line:90%
We don't know what to do now.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.930 align:middle line:84%
And the healing of the nation
and the healing of the nations

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.720 align:middle line:84%
begins by getting
us back on the farm,

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.150 align:middle line:84%
getting us back into the
soil, and ultimately, I

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.370 align:middle line:84%
believe that that's where our
great future is going to lie.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.830 align:middle line:84%
We all have to take personal
responsibility for the fate

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:90%
of the entire world.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.100 align:middle line:84%
At the same time as
I say that, we've

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.180 align:middle line:84%
all been massively programmed,
in fact, indoctrinated

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.750 align:middle line:84%
by mass media and the ideas
of large food industries,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.680 align:middle line:84%
including the dairy industry,
the meat industry, the corn

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.230 align:middle line:90%
industry, the soybean lobby.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.330 align:middle line:84%
All of those industries
have particular agendas,

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and they've realized
long ago that if they

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.060 align:middle line:84%
bring those agendas to
children who have no resistance

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:84%
and get it into the public
school system, then very likely

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.970 align:middle line:84%
their agenda will play
out in a way that's

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.940 align:middle line:84%
favorable to those
particular interests.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.920 align:middle line:84%
We decided as a race to
experiment with chemicals.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.960 align:middle line:84%
We created over 75,000
synthetic chemicals since 1940.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.410 align:middle line:84%
We've released them wholesale
into the environment.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.560 align:middle line:90%
They're in the food chain.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:90%
They're in us.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.240 align:middle line:84%
They've contaminated every
single creature on Earth.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.370 align:middle line:84%
It's a massive
experiment that we're now

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.290 align:middle line:90%
reaping the results of.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:84%
The results have been
an explosion in cancer.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.930 align:middle line:84%
100 years ago, it was 1 in
8,000 people get cancer, now,

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.220 align:middle line:84%
it's 1 in 2 of every woman
and 1 in 3 of every man.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.390 align:middle line:90%
What a tremendous flip around.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.190 align:middle line:90%
What's causing it?

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.565 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's
carcinogens that we've

00:04:12.565 --> 00:04:13.860 align:middle line:90%
released in the environment.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.390 align:middle line:84%
It's hormonal mimicking
compounds, or xenoestrogens,

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.428 align:middle line:84%
that we've released
into the environment.

00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:22.470 align:middle line:84%
The most popular of which
and the most well-known

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.680 align:middle line:84%
is DDT and its metabolite
DDE, known xenoestrogens,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.670 align:middle line:84%
known carcinogens that are still
contaminating the soils of some

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.100 align:middle line:84%
of the great paradises
of our Earth,

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.800 align:middle line:84%
including many places
in the State of Hawaii,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.350 align:middle line:84%
many places in
California, many places

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
in the Midwest of
the United States,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:84%
many places across South
America and Central America.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.440 align:middle line:90%
We now have to clean up.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.470 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have to actually
turn it around and decide

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.020 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to move
away from better living

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
through chemistry and move
towards the idea of better

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.870 align:middle line:84%
living through working with
nature and natural laws.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.060 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of effects
that pesticides have on us.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of effects
that synthetic chemicals have

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:13.540 align:middle line:90%
on us.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
hormonal effects first.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.840 align:middle line:84%
Many of these chemicals like
DDT and DDE are xenoestrogens,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.640 align:middle line:84%
and they cause an
estrogen imbalance,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.550 align:middle line:84%
an accumulation of
estrogenic compounds,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.260 align:middle line:90%
which clogs up the liver.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.810 align:middle line:84%
The liver then has to try
to rectify the situation.

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:90%
It can't.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.710 align:middle line:90%
It becomes inflamed.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.370 align:middle line:84%
Progesterone in the normal
counterbalancing andogens

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.520 align:middle line:84%
like testosterone and
DHEA are no longer

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.863 align:middle line:84%
being produced well enough by
the diets that we're eating,

00:05:42.863 --> 00:05:44.530 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, we
start to suffer what's

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:90%
called estrogen dominance.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:84%
That leads to weight
gain and inevitably can

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:55.450 align:middle line:84%
spark cancer, especially breast
cancer and prostate cancer.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.790 align:middle line:84%
This is also known to be
implicated in syndrome X, which

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
is a weight gain syndrome
where everything we try

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.950 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really work,
and we can't really

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:06.790 align:middle line:90%
get the weight off.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.010 align:middle line:84%
We feel lethargic,
low in energy.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.320 align:middle line:90%
Our thyroid is malfunctioning.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.968 align:middle line:84%
Our overall state of
well-being is so low

00:06:13.968 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
that we actually don't
even really remember

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.400 align:middle line:90%
what it's like to be healthy.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.330 align:middle line:84%
There are other effects
of these chemicals.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:90%
There are neurological effects.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.120 align:middle line:84%
These chemicals can
impinge on our cognition.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.310 align:middle line:90%
They can impair our memory.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.760 align:middle line:84%
They can demyelinate
our nervous system.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.270 align:middle line:84%
They can cause us to
become hypersensitive

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.360 align:middle line:84%
to all different kinds of
stimuli, even things as simple

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.050 align:middle line:84%
as certain types of foods
or all the way to UV lights,

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and we're seeing more
and more of that.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.070 align:middle line:84%
Recent research on umbilical
cords and pesticides

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.840 align:middle line:84%
has indicated that
there are well

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.200 align:middle line:84%
over 100 different types
of synthetic chemicals

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.450 align:middle line:84%
that are contaminating
the umbilical cords

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:90%
of unborn children.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And these statistics
can be pulled up.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.425 align:middle line:84%
You simply Google umbilical cord
pesticides, those three words,

00:07:04.425 --> 00:07:06.550 align:middle line:84%
and you'll get the data on
that, and it's shocking.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.710 align:middle line:84%
Recent research
has been released

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:84%
that is indicating that
100% of pregnant women

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.930 align:middle line:84%
are contaminated by furans,
are contaminated by PCBs,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.980 align:middle line:84%
are contaminated by DDT
and DDE, are contaminated

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.640 align:middle line:84%
by flame and fire retardants and
other synthetic chemicals that

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
were released in
the environment.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.410 align:middle line:84%
So what's happening from a
developmental neurological

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.850 align:middle line:84%
perspective in unborn children
is that the child is actually

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:84%
already completely
saturated in utero,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, doesn't
ever really develop

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.950 align:middle line:84%
a highly functioning
liver as one example,

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.500 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, they're
not able to deal

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.280 align:middle line:84%
with any of the environmental
stresses that are put on them.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.170 align:middle line:90%
And instantly, they have asthma.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:58.030 align:middle line:84%
Instantly, they are
peanut allergies.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.572 align:middle line:84%
Instantly, they
have nut allergies.

00:07:59.572 --> 00:08:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Instantly, they have allergies
to all different kinds

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.130 align:middle line:90%
of wheat and gluten.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.460 align:middle line:84%
Instantly, they have allergies
to environmental stressors.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:84%
This is something that's
becoming worse and worse,

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.145 align:middle line:84%
and in fact, in its full-blown
form is actually autism.

00:08:12.145 --> 00:08:17.310 align:middle line:90%


00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.527 align:middle line:84%
You've heard before
that cancer is genetic,

00:08:20.527 --> 00:08:22.360 align:middle line:84%
but if it was genetic,
then how come we only

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.020 align:middle line:84%
had 1 in 8,000 people 100
years ago getting cancer,

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and now it's 1 out
of 2 or 1 out of 3.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:90%
It's not genetic.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.169 align:middle line:84%
There are genetic triggers
that we're triggering off

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:35.470 align:middle line:84%
by our behaviors, by
our lifestyle factors,

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.049 align:middle line:84%
and also by the toxins
we're being exposed to.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we are now seeing
an actual cohesive grouping

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:51.425 align:middle line:84%
of damaging factors
culminating in obesity.

00:08:51.425 --> 00:08:52.550 align:middle line:90%
And what do I mean by that?

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I mean that there are factors
of pesticide contamination.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.860 align:middle line:84%
There is a factor of
jet fuel contamination.

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.990 align:middle line:84%
Perchlorate, for
example, is contaminating

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:84%
every single pregnant woman
who's ever been tested for it.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.000 align:middle line:90%
There are factors of just--

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.390 align:middle line:90%


00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:13.328 align:middle line:84%
sedentary living is
also a major factor

00:09:13.328 --> 00:09:15.370 align:middle line:84%
because we're so low in
energy, we can't actually

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:16.970 align:middle line:90%
go out and do anything.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's another thing
that's involved in syndrome X.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.570 align:middle line:84%
There's also the factor of the
rubber-soled and plastic-soled

00:09:22.570 --> 00:09:26.860 align:middle line:84%
shoe, which is blocking the
natural electricity that

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.690 align:middle line:90%
connects us to the earth.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.670 align:middle line:90%
So we get no free energy.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:31.690 align:middle line:90%
We blocked it.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:90%
We blocked it off with our rugs.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.350 align:middle line:84%
We blocked it off with
our linoleum flooring.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.180 align:middle line:90%
We blocked it off with our shoe.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.390 align:middle line:84%
We're not actually getting
any of that energy anymore.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And then you put on
top of that foods that

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:90%
are really masquerading.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:84%
They're really drugs
masquerading as foods,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and those particular factors,
when combined together

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.920 align:middle line:84%
create an obesity epidemic,
they create a syndrome X,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:84%
they create a low
energy epidemic,

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.730 align:middle line:90%
they create a fog in cognition.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:84%
They create an
environment where people

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:09.220 align:middle line:84%
begin to lose the will to live
and take self-responsibility.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.830 align:middle line:84%
So then they turn it
all over to a doctor

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.430 align:middle line:84%
who's only able to prescribe
a pharmaceutical pill, which

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:middle line:84%
doesn't address the
real symptoms, which

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:90%
are varied and complex.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.150 align:middle line:84%
There's the factor of the rubber
or plastic-soled shoe, which

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.780 align:middle line:84%
blocks the natural electricity
that comes up from the earth.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.760 align:middle line:84%
The earth is an
emitter of negatively

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.650 align:middle line:84%
charged electricity or
actually alkaline electricity.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.590 align:middle line:84%
And we get that for free
every time we touch the earth

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.960 align:middle line:84%
barefoot, every time we
touch a tree, every time

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:84%
we jump into a creek,
river, stream, or the ocean,

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.010 align:middle line:90%
but we never do that anymore.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:51.050 align:middle line:90%
We're always in a shoe.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:84%
We're blocked from the
earth by linoleum floors

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:84%
or dried wooden
floors or we're up

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.740 align:middle line:84%
on the second floor
of a building,

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and we're away from the earth's
EMF field or magnetic field

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.180 align:middle line:90%
and natural electricity.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.830 align:middle line:84%
And so that causes our
electrical system to gum up.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:12.440 align:middle line:84%
There are factors of the overall
toxicity of the food choices

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.140 align:middle line:84%
that we're making, let
alone the pesticides that

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.010 align:middle line:90%
are in the food.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Let alone the
overall contamination

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.560 align:middle line:84%
of preservatives that's
in the food, just

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:90%
the food choices themselves.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:90%
We don't eat enough vegetables.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.680 align:middle line:90%
We don't eat enough fruits.

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.363 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a wide variety
of seaweeds in our diet.

00:11:30.363 --> 00:11:31.905 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we probably
never even would

00:11:31.905 --> 00:11:35.220 align:middle line:84%
have heard to seaweed if it
wasn't for sushi restaurants.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't have sprouts as much as
we should in our diet, and all

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:42.830 align:middle line:84%
these great natural raw
foods that we could have.

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:46.190 align:middle line:84%
The confluence of factors
that create syndrome X then

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:84%
is a complex education problem,
where we have to actually get

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:57.230 align:middle line:84%
to the people and inform them of
all the different factors that

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.900 align:middle line:84%
create a healthy lifestyle
and that can move them out

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.550 align:middle line:84%
of being stuck and get them back
into the flow and get them out

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:07.940 align:middle line:84%
of syndrome X into
feeling great again.

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Syndrome X is
characterized by obesity.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:84%
It's characterized
by low energy state.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.480 align:middle line:84%
It's characterized
by hypothyroidism.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.470 align:middle line:84%
It's characterized by being
lazy and not really having

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:90%
the willpower to get up and go.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.560 align:middle line:84%
It's characterized by
a sedentary lifestyle,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and it's also characterized
by a cognitive ability that's

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.760 align:middle line:90%
impaired.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.590 align:middle line:90%
Memory is foggy.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.480 align:middle line:90%
Brain doesn't quite work.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.820 align:middle line:84%
Synapses aren't firing
the way they should.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:45.510 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:51.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm always wary of phony sugars
and false sweeteners that

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.190 align:middle line:84%
are being promulgated by
corporations that are unnamed

00:12:55.190 --> 00:13:00.320 align:middle line:84%
based on science that
is illusory at best.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.530 align:middle line:84%
My feeling about introducing
any type of compound

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:84%
into the food chain is that
it would require at least 50

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
to 100 years of research
before it's ever

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.800 align:middle line:90%
released to the public.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.670 align:middle line:84%
We may have seen with aspartame
three years of research,

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:20.570 align:middle line:90%
and that was dubious at best.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:23.810 align:middle line:84%
Aspartame causes formaldehyde
buildup in the brain.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.810 align:middle line:84%
It causes frontal
lobe inflammation,

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:84%
cognitive problems,
and can, in fact,

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.640 align:middle line:84%
lead to different
types of cancers.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Aspartame is one of
the great disasters

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:41.300 align:middle line:84%
of the false sweetener, phony
sugar marketing inventions

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:90%
of the '70s, '80s, and '90s.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:48.020 align:middle line:84%
We are now coming to a
point where we are wary,

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.960 align:middle line:84%
more and more people are
wary about just falling

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.690 align:middle line:84%
into this marketing of
zero calories, no fat,

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:00.380 align:middle line:90%
no sugar types of messages.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.360 align:middle line:84%
More and more people
are becoming wary

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.770 align:middle line:84%
of the kind of phony marketing
that's being put out there.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:90%


00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:15.830 align:middle line:84%
The cosmetic industry seems to
be a wholesale dumping ground

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.960 align:middle line:84%
for just about every
single type of chemical

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:23.900 align:middle line:84%
that exists from lead compounds,
mercury compounds, compounds

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.910 align:middle line:84%
that are made from horse
urine, namely urea.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.290 align:middle line:84%
They're all different kinds
of synthetic compounds

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
that make it into the
cosmetic industry.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.310 align:middle line:84%
It's an area that is so
egregious that even as a child,

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:42.650 align:middle line:84%
I remember having fights with
my mom about the ingredients

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
like sodium lauryl sulfate
and other sudsing agents that

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:51.590 align:middle line:84%
are used in detergents, that
are used in shampoos and body

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:54.300 align:middle line:84%
lotions, all of
this kind of stuff.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:84%
I was always alarmed,
even as a child,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.440 align:middle line:84%
by the number of
different ingredients

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.560 align:middle line:84%
in these cosmetic products
that I didn't even understand.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't
be one or two, it

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:84%
would be 15 to 30
different ingredients

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.030 align:middle line:90%
that I've never heard of before.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I really believe
in the philosophy

00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:17.510 align:middle line:84%
that Warren Buffett puts
out about investing.

00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:21.020 align:middle line:84%
And his philosophy is that he
does not invest in anything

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.400 align:middle line:84%
that he does not
100% understand,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:28.340 align:middle line:84%
and that's how I feel
about food and cosmetics.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I do not invest in anything
that I do not 100% understand,

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:84%
and that's what I'd recommend
for everybody as well.

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:84%
My grandmother was from Tehran,
and she used baking soda, salt,

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.040 align:middle line:84%
and lemon juice for
all her cosmetic needs.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.050 align:middle line:90%
That was it.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.940 align:middle line:90%
That cleaned the house.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.680 align:middle line:90%
That cleaned her body.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.420 align:middle line:84%
That's what she used
to brush your teeth.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Those are the only things
in her medicine cabinet.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:01.250 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Hormones are present at
every level of biology,

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and they are signalers
that tell cells what to do.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.540 align:middle line:84%
They are the most powerful
signalers in the human body.

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:84%
They're more powerful
than neurotransmitters,

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.710 align:middle line:84%
and they consist of a grouping
of protein and fats and oils

00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:23.540 align:middle line:90%
together in a combination.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, human
growth hormone

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:30.440 align:middle line:84%
consists of 191 amino
acid chain all layered

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:33.740 align:middle line:90%
in with fats and oils.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.290 align:middle line:84%
The more common hormones
that we know about

00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:42.830 align:middle line:84%
are the estrogens, progesterone,
testosterone, and DHEA, as well

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:90%
as insulin and adrenaline.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.820 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin D is actually a
hormone, not a vitamin.

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle line:84%
When we look at what
hormones are able to do,

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.560 align:middle line:84%
they're actually
able to turn on cells

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.420 align:middle line:84%
and cause them to
replicate, or they're

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.280 align:middle line:84%
able to turn them off and
tell them not to replicate.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.890 align:middle line:84%
They're able to signal cells
to differentiate or not.

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:07.220 align:middle line:84%
They're able to
trigger healing genes.

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.599 align:middle line:84%
In the case of vitamin D,
that particular compound

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:16.520 align:middle line:84%
triggers about 3,000,
at least, genes

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.589 align:middle line:84%
that inspire healing
in the human body,

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:84%
more than any other single
substance that we know of.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.660 align:middle line:84%
Basically, vitamin D is
a product of sunlight.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.130 align:middle line:84%
So sunlight is the most
healing factor that we know of,

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:30.410 align:middle line:84%
and it's a hormonal relationship
that we have with the sun.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
Hormones are in a delicate
balance at all levels of life.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And if that balance is thrown
out of whack, for example,

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:44.360 align:middle line:84%
in some of the estuaries
in the State of Florida,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:50.240 align:middle line:84%
we may see a male crocodile
turn into a female crocodile.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.930 align:middle line:84%
We can see frogs actually
also doing the same thing,

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.690 align:middle line:84%
all becoming female frogs
and losing the ability

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.490 align:middle line:90%
to reproduce.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.950 align:middle line:84%
This research has
indicated that hormones

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:84%
can be strongly affected
by environmental factors,

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and this is, in
fact, in my opinion,

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.840 align:middle line:84%
the major environmental
factor that

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.330 align:middle line:84%
is affecting our state
of well-being moment

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.350 align:middle line:90%
to moment, day to day.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:20.330 align:middle line:90%


00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.310 align:middle line:84%
Hormones are more
powerful than any

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.010 align:middle line:84%
of the micro minerals
or even major minerals

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:29.180 align:middle line:84%
or vitamins or any protein
or any kind of macronutrient

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.370 align:middle line:90%
or micronutrient we can take in.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.860 align:middle line:84%
If you have adrenaline,
you have power.

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:84%
If you have adrenaline,
you have vitamin C.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:39.020 align:middle line:84%
If you have adrenaline, you
can move a car off of a child.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:84%
If you have progesterone,
you can stop a cancer.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.470 align:middle line:90%
You can stop a breast cancer.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:45.110 align:middle line:90%
If you don't, you can't.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.440 align:middle line:84%
If you have insulin, you can
balance your blood sugar.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.350 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, you
can't, and it ends up

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.870 align:middle line:90%
precipitating into diabetes.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.500 align:middle line:84%
Hormones are where the
game is being played,

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and there's only one thing
higher than hormones,

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.600 align:middle line:84%
and this is an area
that we haven't even

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.420 align:middle line:84%
gotten to in the
conventional sciences yet,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
and it's those very interesting
compounds that can actually

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:13.550 align:middle line:84%
flip on the telomerase
of our genetics.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:16.412 align:middle line:84%
If we can form longer
telomere chains,

00:19:16.412 --> 00:19:17.870 align:middle line:84%
then we can actually
reverse aging,

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and that flips on
everything else.

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:21.470 align:middle line:84%
However, we haven't
got there yet.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.090 align:middle line:90%
We are focusing on hormones.

00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:28.160 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle line:84%
The first thing to understand
is that the general pattern

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:34.970 align:middle line:84%
that we see in Western
civilization based

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.910 align:middle line:84%
on the toxicity, based on
the poor dietary choices

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and environmental factors is
excessive estrogen and then

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.220 align:middle line:84%
nothing to balance it, no
testosterone or no progesterone

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:84%
to balance it, so the estrogen
runs away with the show.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:51.860 align:middle line:90%
That will cause weight gain.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.560 align:middle line:84%
It can trigger off
cancers and inevitably can

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.400 align:middle line:84%
lead to low energy,
insomnia, chronic acne,

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.250 align:middle line:90%
and a whole litany of problems.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.160 align:middle line:84%
We found out recently
in the research

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.880 align:middle line:84%
that all bad estrogen does
have something in common,

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:84%
and this is an
extraordinary insight

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:13.040 align:middle line:90%
into how to detoxify ourselves.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.580 align:middle line:84%
All bad estrogens are
lacking in methyl groups,

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.080 align:middle line:84%
which is a carbon atom
with three hydrogen atoms.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.960 align:middle line:84%
And the methyl groups
are the first line

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:25.970 align:middle line:90%
of defense for our liver.

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.620 align:middle line:84%
Our liver will attach a
methyl group to a compound

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:84%
it can't break down, and
once it's done that, then it

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.920 align:middle line:90%
can start breaking it down.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:38.480 align:middle line:84%
It's been estimated that in the
Western world as much as 49%

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.100 align:middle line:84%
of the population is deficient
in a methylation process.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.820 align:middle line:84%
That means that we're not
methylating toxins properly,

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:84%
we don't methyl late
estrogen properly,

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:54.260 align:middle line:84%
and so all the estrogen starts
accumulating as bad estrogen.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Again, bad estrogens are
lacking methyl groups.

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:01.100 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
their definition.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:06.380 align:middle line:84%
Bad estrone, bad estradiol,
lacking methyl groups.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.350 align:middle line:84%
The best natural
sources of methyl groups

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:16.410 align:middle line:84%
are beets, goji berries,
almost all fresh, raw foods,

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.950 align:middle line:84%
and you can even go
to supplementation

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:22.280 align:middle line:84%
like MSM, which is
methylsulfonylmethane, has

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:27.020 align:middle line:84%
a methyl group, or
betaine trimethylglycene,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.970 align:middle line:90%
has three methyl groups.

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:84%
And if we put that
into our body,

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.380 align:middle line:84%
our liver can actually
begin to metabolize

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.480 align:middle line:84%
the accumulation of bad
estrogen and we start

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:90%
heading in the right direction.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:42.530 align:middle line:84%
That, to me, is the
first step at moving

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:48.140 align:middle line:84%
the toxicity of the excessive
levels of estrogen out.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.230 align:middle line:84%
The second step is then we
have to start looking at, OK,

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:57.050 align:middle line:84%
how do we draw off some of this
bad estrogen out of our system

00:21:57.050 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:90%
in terms of its metabolic waste?

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:84%
What we've done is, we have bad
estrogen as a natural byproduct

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.340 align:middle line:90%
of our way of life.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:05.390 align:middle line:90%
It's in our food.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.590 align:middle line:90%
We've got xenoestrogens.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:07.390 align:middle line:90%
We've got all that.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:12.440 align:middle line:84%
But also, it is a
natural aging byproduct.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.290 align:middle line:84%
So we've got to work
it from two angles.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:16.040 align:middle line:84%
One, is we've got to
get the toxicity out,

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:84%
but also we have to
fight the aging tendency

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:20.512 align:middle line:90%
to accumulate this stuff.

00:22:20.512 --> 00:22:22.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's been figured out that
there are certain compounds

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:24.260 align:middle line:90%
that help us do that.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.440 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest discoveries
is the cruciferous vegetables.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.070 align:middle line:84%
The cruciferous vegetables
clean out consistently

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.090 align:middle line:90%
all the bad estrogens.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:84%
The compound that
does that is actually

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.260 align:middle line:90%
called indole-3-carbinol.

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And indole-3-carbinol
is metabolized

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.560 align:middle line:84%
into another
compound called DIM,

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.620 align:middle line:84%
and those two together
have a profound effect

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.980 align:middle line:84%
in reducing our estrogen levels
if we take enough of them

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.740 align:middle line:90%
in as little as 30 days.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.810 align:middle line:84%
And what in particular
they're able to do

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:00.860 align:middle line:84%
is they're able to flip the
bad estrogen equation, which

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.030 align:middle line:90%
looks like this.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:08.160 align:middle line:84%
Too much estrone, too much
estradiol, no estriol.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And if we're clever and we
use the proper detoxification

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:84%
protocols and we take
in the indole-3-carbinol

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and the cruciferous
vegetables, then we

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.320 align:middle line:84%
can flip that around in
as little as 30 days.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:22.730 align:middle line:84%
And that, by the way, is
what shuts off breast cancer.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:27.320 align:middle line:84%
It has been found out that
breast cancer is always present

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.770 align:middle line:84%
when you have elevated estrone
and elevated estradiol,

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:31.910 align:middle line:90%
and no estriol.

00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:90%
These are all estrogens.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Estriol is a good
estrogen. Estradiol is

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.360 align:middle line:84%
a good estrogen in
some situations,

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.520 align:middle line:84%
but it's not good
if we're far down

00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:43.670 align:middle line:84%
the line we have too much
because estradiol can trigger

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.640 align:middle line:84%
and cause signals
of cell replication

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.030 align:middle line:84%
to occur in cancer cells
causing cancer cells to multiply

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.280 align:middle line:90%
like crazy.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.190 align:middle line:84%
We've also got to look at some
of the other compounds that

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.180 align:middle line:84%
are found in berries like
calcium-D-glucorate, which

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.010 align:middle line:84%
is found in berries,
it's found in apples,

00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:03.020 align:middle line:84%
it's found in many
different raw foods that

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:07.820 align:middle line:84%
have a similar effect of
shutting down the re-absorption

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.960 align:middle line:90%
of bad estrogen in our gut.

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes we get the estrogen
out and ends up in our gut,

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.560 align:middle line:90%
then it gets reabsorbed.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:18.600 align:middle line:84%
So we need compounds that will
block it from being reabsorbed.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Calcium-D-glucorate is
one of those compounds.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.960 align:middle line:84%
There are other compounds
that we want to look at

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and that is defatted flax and
lignin-rich, fiber-rich foods.

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:84%
Pretty much all
vegetables are fiber rich.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.610 align:middle line:84%
You can take specialty
products, for example.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:37.890 align:middle line:84%
Oats are rich in fiber
because they have this drawing

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:39.570 align:middle line:90%
power for bad estrogens.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:43.920 align:middle line:84%
We can take in defatted
flax, and this is then

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.630 align:middle line:84%
allowing the colon to detoxify
the stuff out of our system.

00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:53.080 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of other
factors in this bad estrogen

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:53.880 align:middle line:90%
equation.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.740 align:middle line:84%
We have to then move
to the next step, which

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.710 align:middle line:84%
is we've got to block
what's called aromatization.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:02.790 align:middle line:90%
What the heck is aromatization?

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.108 align:middle line:84%
So there are enzymes
that exist in some people

00:25:06.108 --> 00:25:08.400 align:middle line:84%
in excessive amounts, in some
people, moderate amounts,

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.110 align:middle line:84%
but everybody does
suffer from this

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:13.470 align:middle line:84%
as we age that will
convert a good hormone

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.293 align:middle line:84%
like a testosterone
or progesterone, which

00:25:15.293 --> 00:25:17.460 align:middle line:84%
we did all those worked and
build this good hormone.

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.630 align:middle line:90%
We've got it in there now.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens is
is that it gets aromatized

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:24.570 align:middle line:84%
or the enzyme aromatase
converts it and flips it

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:90%
into a bad estrogen.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.495 align:middle line:84%
There are certain herbs
that stop that process,

00:25:28.495 --> 00:25:30.870 align:middle line:84%
and there are certain compounds
in the natural world that

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:32.080 align:middle line:90%
stop that process.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And if we want to be
younger, we should take

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.490 align:middle line:90%
heed to this bit of advice.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Passion flower,
chamomile, resveratrol

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and its derivative source
herbal nutrients, for example,

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Japanese knotweed or grape
skins block the aromatization

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.900 align:middle line:90%
of a good hormone into a bad.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So they actually
keep us younger.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.490 align:middle line:84%
Quercetin, which
is found in onions

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.950 align:middle line:84%
and many different raw
foods, also blocks it.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:05.680 align:middle line:84%
A big one, and maybe
perhaps the reason

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.580 align:middle line:84%
why olive oil is
the number one, two,

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.650 align:middle line:84%
or three longevity
food in the world

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.250 align:middle line:90%
is that it contains oleuropein.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:17.760 align:middle line:84%
Oleuropein blocks
the aromatase enzyme,

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.810 align:middle line:84%
so olive oil helps to
hold the good hormones in.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, we've gone
through methylation

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.320 align:middle line:90%
and what that looks like.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.730 align:middle line:84%
We've gone through drawing
out the bad estrogens using

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:84%
DIM, indole-3-carbinol,
lignin-rich fibrous,

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.230 align:middle line:90%
defatted flax.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.830 align:middle line:84%
There's been a little
bit of discussion

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.840 align:middle line:84%
about passion flower
and chamomile.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Now we've got to get
into how do we build

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:90%
up now, the good androgens.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:45.970 align:middle line:90%
That's a big one.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:48.490 align:middle line:84%
Coconut products,
very important.

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:49.893 align:middle line:90%
Coconut butter.

00:26:49.893 --> 00:26:51.310 align:middle line:84%
And when I say
butter, I'm talking

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.080 align:middle line:84%
about the stuff that's
like cream cheese

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:84%
where the coconut
has been creamed.

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:01.510 align:middle line:84%
That is a very close replica
of what our precursors are

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.010 align:middle line:90%
to progesterone.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we take in, for
example, that coconut cream,

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.492 align:middle line:84%
it converts over
to pregnenolone.

00:27:07.492 --> 00:27:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Pregnenolone will
then convert over

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.590 align:middle line:84%
to progesterone
and/or testosterone,

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:12.820 align:middle line:90%
so it's already very close.

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.970 align:middle line:84%
That's why coconut products are
high in the list for producing

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.080 align:middle line:90%
healthy hormones.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Macha is one that's very good
for producing healthy hormones.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:84%
It's rich in all
the precursors that

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.290 align:middle line:84%
can be converted over into
progesterone, testosterone,

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.080 align:middle line:90%
and DHEA.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:32.620 align:middle line:84%
There are great
hormone precursors

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:35.190 align:middle line:84%
found for men in
a particular herb

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:39.430 align:middle line:84%
and a very popular herb
called tongkat ali.

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And tongkat ali can
triple or quadruple

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.860 align:middle line:84%
your testosterone
level if you're a man.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:47.470 align:middle line:84%
If you're a woman and you're
working from another angle

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.520 align:middle line:84%
and you want to build up, you
can use chasteberry or Vitex,

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.190 align:middle line:84%
and that has a progesterone
precursor in there.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:59.260 align:middle line:84%
The raw sweet potato or even
cooked sweet potato or yams

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.302 align:middle line:90%
contain hormone precursors.

00:28:01.302 --> 00:28:03.010 align:middle line:84%
Usain Bolt, the fastest
man in the world,

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:05.160 align:middle line:84%
he lives on a diet
of sweet potato.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:07.130 align:middle line:90%
And how does that affect things?

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, because the speed,
your ability to move quickly,

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:16.000 align:middle line:84%
your reflexes are all related
to your hormone levels.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.670 align:middle line:84%
We know that as those
hormone levels come down

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:22.510 align:middle line:84%
that our reflex is slow,
our musculature decreases,

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and we no longer have the
fitness level that we had,

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.540 align:middle line:84%
say, when we were 25, when all
those hormones were pumping.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:30.130 align:middle line:84%
If we're smart and
we're clever, we

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:31.630 align:middle line:84%
can actually add
those foods in that

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:35.770 align:middle line:84%
build the androgens like
testosterone progesterone,

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:90%
and DHEA.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:43.300 align:middle line:84%
The fennel group of foods,
fennel, anise, dill,

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.510 align:middle line:84%
are excellent hormone
precursor foods,

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:49.600 align:middle line:84%
and they help us to
build up those androgens.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.940 align:middle line:84%
Another great food
that definitely

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.430 align:middle line:84%
should be included
here and is one

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.910 align:middle line:84%
of the best in the
overall mix is, of course,

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:00.250 align:middle line:90%
raw chocolate, or cacao.

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a good
saturated fat source,

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.003 align:middle line:90%
and it's hormonal by its nature.

00:29:05.003 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if you've ever studied
up on chocolate and you've

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.320 align:middle line:84%
read "Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory."

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:13.840 align:middle line:84%
for example, you've seen
that when you eat chocolate,

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.610 align:middle line:84%
it converts over to
hormones, but then you

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.068 align:middle line:84%
need a cleanup that
comes in that's

00:29:17.068 --> 00:29:19.630 align:middle line:84%
an opposite energy of chocolate,
and the opposite energy

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:21.880 align:middle line:84%
is actually cabbage,
cruciferous vegetable.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.880 align:middle line:84%
It cleans up the metabolic
waste products of the hormone

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.550 align:middle line:90%
cascade, namely bad estrogen.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:31.960 align:middle line:84%
So you'll see this interesting
dichotomy between chocolate

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.760 align:middle line:84%
on one hand and
cabbage on the other,

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.650 align:middle line:84%
hence, the whole
nature of "Charlie

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and the Chocolate Factory,"
where Charlie lives

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.550 align:middle line:90%
on a diet of cabbage soup.

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.260 align:middle line:84%
If you recall, his
family is very poor

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and they have no money,
but they really all

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.860 align:middle line:90%
want to eat chocolate.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And there is a balance of
those things in our diet.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can't really
eat them together.

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.770 align:middle line:84%
They're eaten
separately, of course.

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:55.320 align:middle line:90%


00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.840 align:middle line:84%
We know there's a relationship
between sexual dysfunction

00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.690 align:middle line:84%
in men and women and
estrogen buildup.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:03.870 align:middle line:84%
We know there's a relationship
between lack of sex drive

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:07.110 align:middle line:84%
and lack of testosterone
in men and women,

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.390 align:middle line:84%
and we know there's a
relationship in women, if you

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
have low progesterone,
that will also cause,

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:14.400 align:middle line:84%
not only lack of sex
drive, but will actually

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.890 align:middle line:84%
cause dryness of
the vaginal area,

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:21.420 align:middle line:84%
for example, an inability to
really turn on the juices.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:27.750 align:middle line:84%
The hormonal relationship
between our sex drive

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:32.890 align:middle line:84%
and our fertility is well
researched and well known.

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this is
the first area that

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:84%
was looked at when the sex
hormones were discovered, were

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:44.490 align:middle line:84%
cataloged, and assayed
and all identified.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.900 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we've
gone deeper now.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.820 align:middle line:84%
We all know that the
sex hormones also

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.220 align:middle line:84%
affect our health, they
affect our energy levels,

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.980 align:middle line:84%
they affect our heart,
they affect our liver,

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.010 align:middle line:84%
they affect every single
aspect of our cognition.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:58.330 align:middle line:84%
Everything is related
to the sex hormones.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But in particular, if
we have low sex drive,

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.820 align:middle line:84%
generally, in men, it's going
to equal low testosterone.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.250 align:middle line:84%
In women, it's going to
be low testosterone and/or

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.910 align:middle line:84%
low progesterone and
excessive estrogen.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's the same type
of dynamic at work.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.920 align:middle line:84%
We need to clean
up the bad estrogen

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and start bringing in
the opposing androgens--

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.922 align:middle line:84%
testosterone, DHEA,
and progesterone.

00:31:24.922 --> 00:31:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And there are many herbal
approaches that work.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.040 align:middle line:84%
People ask me all the
time this question.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.870 align:middle line:90%
How do I know it's working?

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:33.420 align:middle line:84%
How do I know that the herbal
program you've put me on

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.640 align:middle line:84%
is working and it's
improving my hormones?

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:40.027 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, because
you start having a sex drive.

00:31:40.027 --> 00:31:40.860 align:middle line:90%
That's how you know.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:46.090 align:middle line:90%


00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.950 align:middle line:90%
It's a signal, isn't it?

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.280 align:middle line:84%
If you lose your sex drive,
it's a signal that you're aging.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you regain
your sex drive,

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.030 align:middle line:84%
it's a signal that
you're becoming younger.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:57.940 align:middle line:84%
The traditional yogic
theory behind it

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.280 align:middle line:84%
was that you would build
up your sexual energy

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.600 align:middle line:90%
and then drive it up.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.850 align:middle line:84%
You drive it up in your
different chakras, eventually,

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:06.130 align:middle line:84%
into your brain and
activate genius.

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:08.510 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say that
I believe in that.

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:10.270 align:middle line:84%
I think that's
actually the truth.

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:13.120 align:middle line:84%
If you can activate
aphrodisiacs, really get

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:16.720 align:middle line:84%
your sex drive going,
but not spill your seed

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.170 align:middle line:84%
or have what is called jing
leakage, then what can happen

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:23.440 align:middle line:84%
is you can drive that energy
up and activate genius

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.410 align:middle line:84%
by using the power
of the sex hormones.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:30.420 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:34.290 align:middle line:84%
Buckminster Fuller said
start at the beginning.

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.570 align:middle line:84%
We have to realistically
look at our lives

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.480 align:middle line:84%
and decide what we're going
to do for our health, what

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.560 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to do.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:42.330 align:middle line:90%
What's realistic for us?

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:45.600 align:middle line:84%
I know, for example, I love to
drink fresh vegetable juice.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.720 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely amazing.

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.220 align:middle line:84%
I feel amazing when I have it,
but I hate cleaning juicers.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.060 align:middle line:84%
I know I'm not going
to clean the juicer.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.320 align:middle line:84%
So I've realized
that at home I've

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.890 align:middle line:84%
got to do something different
that I will actually

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.575 align:middle line:84%
do every day, which
is blended stuff.

00:33:00.575 --> 00:33:01.950 align:middle line:84%
I love blending
things, so that's

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.200 align:middle line:90%
something I will actually do.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.390 align:middle line:84%
We need to look at the
different health disciplines

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:08.400 align:middle line:84%
out there, the
different ideas that

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.530 align:middle line:84%
are being proposed by
different people out there,

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.150 align:middle line:84%
and find out which
one of those things

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:15.330 align:middle line:84%
we're actually going to
do, and then turn it on.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.280 align:middle line:90%
That's where we start.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's a step-by-step process.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:21.510 align:middle line:84%
If it's in the
food area, I really

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.690 align:middle line:84%
strongly recommend finding
your own local co-op,

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:28.110 align:middle line:84%
your own local
farmer's market, and/or

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:31.080 align:middle line:84%
your own local
organic food store,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:35.940 align:middle line:84%
walking into the produce aisle
and taking massive raw foods

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.560 align:middle line:90%
action.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.170 align:middle line:84%
Just grabbing this, that,
the other thing, everything

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:43.230 align:middle line:84%
you can get your hands on,
and eating it, juicing it,

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:46.570 align:middle line:84%
making things you never made
before, trying new stuff out.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:49.560 align:middle line:84%
That's how I got started,
and it was a lot of fun.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.950 align:middle line:84%
A lot of that got blended
up, a lot of it got juiced,

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:57.000 align:middle line:84%
but it brought me a level
of well-being and good times

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.330 align:middle line:84%
in that process that
is still with me.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:05.130 align:middle line:84%
I still remember with
great detail the times

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.840 align:middle line:84%
that I had with
old friends when we

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.850 align:middle line:84%
were making 60 ounces
of vegetable juice

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:10.620 align:middle line:84%
on a given night
and drinking that

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.110 align:middle line:84%
instead of going out and
drinking beer, for example.

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And when we would have juice
parties at my cousin's house

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.270 align:middle line:84%
and all of us would
get together and we'd

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:20.370 align:middle line:84%
invite a bunch of people
over and we'd just make juice

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.020 align:middle line:84%
after juice after
juice after juice,

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.690 align:middle line:84%
and we'd all be
massively juiced up

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:30.120 align:middle line:84%
on cabbage juice, lettuce juice,
carrot juice, and even garlic

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.120 align:middle line:84%
juice, which I don't
recommend in massive amounts

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.860 align:middle line:84%
if you want to have a rational
lifestyle or keep your job.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:42.730 align:middle line:90%


00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.219 align:middle line:84%
I've always been a fan of
every kind of fitness protocol,

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.800 align:middle line:84%
and I think every kind of
diet does have some benefit

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.120 align:middle line:90%
if you can lose the weight.

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.909 align:middle line:84%
We know that the fat
cell carries the toxins.

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:55.840 align:middle line:84%
There are 300, 400, 500, 600
different synthetic chemicals

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.710 align:middle line:84%
being found in the fat cells
of the average American today.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:03.010 align:middle line:84%
There is even deeper layers
of toxicity in the bones

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:07.270 align:middle line:84%
that must be addressed by a
holistic process that involves

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:11.320 align:middle line:84%
supplementation, natural
foods, super foods, herbalism,

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.700 align:middle line:84%
exercise, infrared
sauna, rebounding,

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.285 align:middle line:90%
a whole bunch of stuff.

00:35:17.285 --> 00:35:18.160 align:middle line:90%
We don't start there.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.130 align:middle line:84%
We have to start somewhere,
something we can get a hold of,

00:35:21.130 --> 00:35:24.100 align:middle line:84%
and if it's an exercise program,
I think it's a good start.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:28.180 align:middle line:84%
Is that ultimately the solution
to just exercise so hard

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:29.980 align:middle line:84%
till we drop that
the fat comes off?

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.930 align:middle line:90%
And the answer is, probably not.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.960 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the weight loss I've
seen that really stays off

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:38.440 align:middle line:84%
is when people have excreted the
waste out of their colon, when

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.530 align:middle line:84%
it's been dropped out through
the digestive process instead

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.030 align:middle line:90%
of being sweated out.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And the colon is a primary
detoxification pathway for us.

00:35:46.690 --> 00:35:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Our skin isn't very
good by comparison.

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:51.670 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, what
can we actually

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.290 align:middle line:84%
excrete through
our skin, and it's

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.200 align:middle line:84%
a long way out going
through the skin

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and a lot easier to drive
everything through the colon.

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:03.370 align:middle line:84%
The gyms and the different
exercise equipment, devices

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:05.740 align:middle line:84%
that are out there all
look great and wonderful,

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:09.700 align:middle line:84%
but I really feel like gyms
should be producing energy,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.320 align:middle line:90%
not taking energy.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.700 align:middle line:84%
They should be energy
power stations.

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Let's send people to the gym to
put more energy into the grid.

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:20.398 align:middle line:84%
Let's have them
create electricity.

00:36:20.398 --> 00:36:22.690 align:middle line:84%
That's always been a little
bit of a pet peeve of mine.

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:27.070 align:middle line:90%


00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, the main
idea and theme of my book,

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:34.930 align:middle line:84%
"Eating for Beauty," was
to actually bring in food

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:36.970 align:middle line:84%
as nourishment
that would come all

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:84%
the way through the skin as what
I term food mineral cosmetics.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately, that, to me,
is what we're striving for,

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
is a deep richness of skin
tone, a deep richness of hair,

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:57.100 align:middle line:84%
a luster in our nails,
an overall feeling

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:00.680 align:middle line:84%
of shine and glow, and
even almost an aura.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.680 align:middle line:84%
This is possible
through natural foods,

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and this is possible
through certain strategies

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:09.010 align:middle line:84%
of using natural foods
and certain supplements.

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:12.910 align:middle line:84%
The "Eating for Beauty"
book is really not

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:17.470 align:middle line:84%
just appealing to vanity, but
appealing to a deeper ethic.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.650 align:middle line:84%
It's an ethic of beauty
that the Greeks had,

00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:24.800 align:middle line:84%
and it has filtered through
into our civilization.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.720 align:middle line:84%
The Greeks believed
that beauty was

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:32.380 align:middle line:84%
a divine symbol of
the gods, and even

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:35.770 align:middle line:84%
if they had conquered
an army, if the general

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:37.970 align:middle line:84%
of the opposing
army was beautiful,

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.850 align:middle line:90%
they would often spare his life.

00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Or even if they had
killed him, they

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:45.910 align:middle line:84%
would parade him around and
show all the men that symbol

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:47.860 align:middle line:90%
of beauty and perfection.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:49.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is something
that I believe,

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:51.340 align:middle line:90%
has a spiritual component.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So we hear about the vanity,
yes, but no, it's deeper.

00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:58.030 align:middle line:84%
There's a deeper spiritual
ethic about beauty.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:00.970 align:middle line:84%
We want to create a beautiful
life, we want to be beautiful,

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:03.890 align:middle line:84%
and we want to pass on beautiful
offspring into the world

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:06.970 align:middle line:84%
because there is something
mystical, spiritual,

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.190 align:middle line:90%
and magical about it.

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:11.860 align:middle line:84%
Through food, we can only
eat so much in a day,

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.570 align:middle line:84%
therefore, the idea
of eating for beauty

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:15.940 align:middle line:84%
is, let's make those
foods beauty foods,

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:21.190 align:middle line:84%
like olive oil and olives
cucumbers, radishes,

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:25.990 align:middle line:84%
hemp seeds, aloe vera,
coconut products,

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.900 align:middle line:84%
and the entire
litany of great foods

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:31.000 align:middle line:84%
that's put in the
"Eating for Beauty" book.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Let's focus on the
beauty minerals

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.970 align:middle line:84%
like silica and
iron and manganese

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:39.640 align:middle line:84%
that give glow and
charisma, sulfur

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and what it does to
our connective tissue

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and how it reverses
age-related lines

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:48.310 align:middle line:84%
and how it fills out
our protein makeup so

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.470 align:middle line:84%
that our musculature
and our overall build

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:56.520 align:middle line:84%
reflects the higher qualities,
almost the symbolical qualities

00:38:56.520 --> 00:38:58.480 align:middle line:90%
that beauty points to.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And let's use certain
supplements like MSM

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.180 align:middle line:84%
and some of these
superfood powders

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:08.500 align:middle line:84%
in order to get enough food
mineral cosmetics into our body

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.320 align:middle line:84%
so that we can drive it
all the way to the most

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.880 align:middle line:84%
remote area of our
tissues, which is our skin.

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:18.580 align:middle line:84%
See, the skin is a true
symbol of our health

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:21.093 align:middle line:84%
because it's the last
place to get nutrition.

00:39:21.093 --> 00:39:23.260 align:middle line:84%
And if you can drive all
those nutrients all the way

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.930 align:middle line:84%
through to the
skin, then you know

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.900 align:middle line:84%
it's gotten everywhere else
too, and that's something

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:29.890 align:middle line:90%
that we all recognize.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.840 align:middle line:84%
If somebody has
got beautiful skin,

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.560 align:middle line:84%
it tells us and invites us
to a deeper understanding

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.910 align:middle line:84%
about what's going
on inside their body.

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:39.730 align:middle line:84%
We know that they're
generally having

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:44.110 align:middle line:84%
healthier liver, kidneys,
heart, lungs, et cetera.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:49.420 align:middle line:90%


00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.250 align:middle line:84%
There's a doctrine
in herbalism called

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.590 align:middle line:84%
the "doctrine of signatures,"
and that doctrine

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:57.490 align:middle line:84%
says that the weight, shape,
structure, color of a food

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:01.270 align:middle line:84%
tells you a lot about its
health-giving qualities.

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.030 align:middle line:84%
Seedless fruit, in
the understanding

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.310 align:middle line:84%
of the "doctrine
of signatures," is

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:10.360 align:middle line:84%
something that is incapable
of producing seeds

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.560 align:middle line:90%
for its own reproduction.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:16.660 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, it's going to
cause us to become infertile.

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So the idea of seedless
watermelons, seedless grapes,

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:23.110 align:middle line:84%
seedless banana,
seedless oranges is not

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:26.530 align:middle line:84%
something that's conducive to a
sustainable and healthy future,

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.410 align:middle line:84%
and it is not
conducive to nourishing

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:33.550 align:middle line:84%
the reproductive aspects
of our biology, which

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.420 align:middle line:84%
are related to our
overall levels of health.

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:41.080 align:middle line:84%
If we have a richness
of reproductive power,

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:44.950 align:middle line:84%
then that generally
cascades over and indicates

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:48.580 align:middle line:84%
and eventually develops into a
higher level of overall health.

00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:53.217 align:middle line:90%


00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:55.050 align:middle line:84%
There's been a tremendous
amount of research

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:59.710 align:middle line:84%
done on worms, reptiles, all
different kinds of mammals,

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:02.970 align:middle line:84%
including mice in regards
to calorie restriction

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:03.930 align:middle line:90%
and longevity.

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And thus far we know
for sure there's only

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:11.250 align:middle line:84%
one tried and true
way of living longer

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:15.400 align:middle line:84%
according to that research,
and that is to eat less.

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.390 align:middle line:84%
However, that's
easier said than done.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.850 align:middle line:90%
How do you actually eat less?

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:22.540 align:middle line:84%
How do you make
any sense of this?

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:26.370 align:middle line:84%
And this was always the thing
to me that was unapproachable.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:29.610 align:middle line:84%
I would look at that research,
and it made sense to me,

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:31.590 align:middle line:84%
however, I didn't
know how to cut down

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.840 align:middle line:90%
on my own caloric intake.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.370 align:middle line:84%
What I ended up
finding out about

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:38.700 align:middle line:84%
was you should actually
take in nutrients

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:42.550 align:middle line:84%
that are more dense in the
same amount of calories.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So in our culture, we
have a lot of calories,

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:46.490 align:middle line:90%
but it's all empty.

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:47.290 align:middle line:90%
It's hollow.

00:41:47.290 --> 00:41:48.510 align:middle line:90%
There's no minerals present.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:49.350 align:middle line:90%
There's no vitamins.

00:41:49.350 --> 00:41:51.060 align:middle line:90%
There's no polysaccharides.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.240 align:middle line:90%
There's no protein.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:53.640 align:middle line:90%
There are empty calories.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.490 align:middle line:84%
So we want to observe
some of the research that

00:41:56.490 --> 00:42:00.720 align:middle line:84%
was done by Russian researcher,
Sauren Arakelyan, who

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.420 align:middle line:84%
apparently has the world
record in extending

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.580 align:middle line:90%
the lifespan of chickens.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And what he found
was, OK, yeah, so you

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.050 align:middle line:84%
want to restrict
the intake of food,

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:12.960 align:middle line:84%
but the food that you
feed those chickens needs

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:19.980 align:middle line:84%
to be, in particular, mineral
rich, and it needs to be raw.

00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:23.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I discovered
Sauren Arakelyan's research,

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:26.490 align:middle line:84%
then I started realizing
how I had to approach it,

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.400 align:middle line:84%
and inevitably, it
really drove me deeper

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.160 align:middle line:84%
into the superfoods and
the super herbs, which

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:35.490 align:middle line:84%
are low in calories and
extraordinarily rich

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:36.780 align:middle line:90%
in nutrients.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that seems
to be the golden symbol

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:44.220 align:middle line:90%
of how to pull this off.

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.960 align:middle line:84%
We want stuff that's
packed to the hilt,

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:47.640 align:middle line:90%
but isn't very caloric.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Herbalism is loaded
with all different kinds

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:53.850 align:middle line:90%
of substances like that.

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:55.658 align:middle line:84%
And step by step
by step, as I've

00:42:55.658 --> 00:42:57.450 align:middle line:84%
gotten a little bit
more control of my diet

00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.520 align:middle line:84%
and about my food
intake, I've been

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.940 align:middle line:84%
able to take in more superfoods
and more super herbs and less

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:04.180 align:middle line:90%
food.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.480 align:middle line:90%
This is what it led me to.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.830 align:middle line:84%
Eventually it cascaded into
food is just one thing,

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:14.250 align:middle line:84%
my diet is one aspect
of what I'm eating,

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:17.250 align:middle line:84%
but really, it's just
a source of bulk fiber

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:19.500 align:middle line:84%
and macronutrients, and
it's not something that's

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:20.820 align:middle line:90%
turning the big switches.

00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.770 align:middle line:84%
What I really focus
on more now is more

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:24.685 align:middle line:84%
the superfoods and
the super herbs,

00:43:24.685 --> 00:43:27.060 align:middle line:84%
where I don't get as many
calories as I get from my food,

00:43:27.060 --> 00:43:28.680 align:middle line:90%
but I get way more nutrients.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So I'm trying to do more
of this and less of that

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:40.730 align:middle line:84%
to get the calories down,
but not suffer as a result.

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.690 align:middle line:84%
There's only so much
we can eat in a day,

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and the best
strategy we've got is

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:46.107 align:middle line:90%
to just add in the good stuff.

00:43:46.107 --> 00:43:48.190 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, it's going to
crowd out the bad stuff,

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:49.610 align:middle line:90%
and that works for everybody.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.080 align:middle line:90%
It makes everything so simple.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.770 align:middle line:84%
It completely deactivates
all the mental neuroses

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:57.290 align:middle line:84%
we have about diets
and what we have to eat

00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:58.650 align:middle line:90%
and all that kind of stuff.

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:00.620 align:middle line:90%
Let's just add in the cucumbers.

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:02.760 align:middle line:90%
Let's add in the apples.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Let's add in the superfoods,
the goji berries,

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.260 align:middle line:90%
the raw chocolate, the macha.

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's add in the super herbs,
the Reishi mushroom, the chaga

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:09.740 align:middle line:90%
mushroom.

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:10.715 align:middle line:90%
Let's add in seaweed.

00:44:10.715 --> 00:44:12.590 align:middle line:84%
Let's try that out, see
what that looks like.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's add in vegetables,
root vegetables like radishes

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:18.410 align:middle line:84%
and garlic or leafy vegetables
like kale and lettuce.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:21.950 align:middle line:90%
Let's add in raw nuts and seeds.

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.000 align:middle line:90%
Let's add in sprouts.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.522 align:middle line:90%
That's a big list of stuff.

00:44:25.522 --> 00:44:27.230 align:middle line:84%
You start adding that
in, all of a sudden

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:30.260 align:middle line:84%
all those other choices
start moving away.

00:44:30.260 --> 00:44:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Inevitably, you're going
to feel so much better

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:37.640 align:middle line:84%
eating the good stuff that
the choice for the bad stuff

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.860 align:middle line:90%
is no longer valid.

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.860 align:middle line:84%
It falls away simply
by being replaced

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:44.810 align:middle line:90%
by a higher octave substance.

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:46.020 align:middle line:90%
Somebody likes chocolate?

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:46.820 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.040 align:middle line:84%
We'll feed them the best
raw chocolate they've ever

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.490 align:middle line:84%
had in their life, and
automatically, the old stuff

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:55.870 align:middle line:90%
is no longer on the table.

00:44:55.870 --> 00:45:00.250 align:middle line:84%
There's another piece of it, and
that is, as we develop momentum

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:03.010 align:middle line:84%
and we go further, we
need to pay attention

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:05.470 align:middle line:84%
to what's been
learned in how dogs

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:08.380 align:middle line:84%
are trained, in how
dolphins are trained,

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.330 align:middle line:90%
in how birds are trained.

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:12.740 align:middle line:90%
It's a reward system.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:15.220 align:middle line:84%
So we need to reward
ourselves, and what

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.180 align:middle line:84%
we found is the
greatest reward in you

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:21.767 align:middle line:84%
know your life when you've done
a long cleanse, when you've

00:45:21.767 --> 00:45:23.350 align:middle line:84%
done everything right
for three months

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:26.290 align:middle line:84%
is give yourself a
nice, raw chocolate.

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:27.940 align:middle line:90%
That's the best treat ever.

00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:31.210 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you
reward your behavior.

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:35.740 align:middle line:84%
Performance that is
rewarded will be repeated.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Performance that is
rewarded will be repeated.

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.480 align:middle line:84%
That's how you gain
leverage on yourself.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:47.470 align:middle line:90%


00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Actually, if somebody is in the
Midwest of the United States

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.197 align:middle line:84%
or in Canada and they've
never done anything

00:45:53.197 --> 00:45:55.030 align:middle line:84%
but meat and potatoes
and they're wondering,

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:59.440 align:middle line:84%
OK, what do I do here, one of
the best steps they can make

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.380 align:middle line:84%
is to start gardening and
growing their own food.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And then you start appreciating
the value of the food.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:07.970 align:middle line:84%
It also will cause you
to eat that food raw

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:10.000 align:middle line:84%
because if you put all
that energy into creating

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.203 align:middle line:84%
that raw tomato, you're not
going to fry that tomato.

00:46:13.203 --> 00:46:14.870 align:middle line:84%
You're going to want
to eat it as it is.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:17.500 align:middle line:84%
If you put all that energy
into growing the cucumber all

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.240 align:middle line:84%
that energy into
growing that watermelon

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.000 align:middle line:84%
you're going to want
to have it as it is.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Secondarily, if we're
going to go shop in stores,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.260 align:middle line:84%
let's be a little
bit more picky.

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:32.850 align:middle line:84%
Let's actually bring in a
little bit more discernment

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:34.420 align:middle line:90%
into our food choices.

00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:37.860 align:middle line:84%
This is the fuel that's
going to become our body.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.540 align:middle line:84%
You are what you eat ain't
going away anytime soon.

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.970 align:middle line:84%
It will be here for
all of eternity.

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So instead of running
from it or hiding from it,

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.560 align:middle line:90%
let's get totally with it.

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's just line up with it.

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:51.270 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that we all know that
phrase, you are what you eat?

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:53.850 align:middle line:84%
How could we all
know that phrase?

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, my feeling is,
is because inevitably

00:46:57.030 --> 00:46:59.250 align:middle line:84%
in our evolution
in time, we would

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.800 align:middle line:84%
come to an appreciation
of it and then

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:06.840 align:middle line:84%
realize the magic that's
within it and turn that on,

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.830 align:middle line:84%
turn that volume all the
way up and align with it

00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:16.230 align:middle line:84%
and really become gastronauts
and explore just how

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:18.690 align:middle line:84%
incredible the food
can be and what

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:21.930 align:middle line:84%
it can do for our consciousness,
what it can do for our memory,

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:23.850 align:middle line:84%
what it can do
for our cognition,

00:47:23.850 --> 00:47:25.530 align:middle line:84%
what it can do for
a strength, what

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:27.150 align:middle line:84%
it can do for our
endurance, what

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:31.320 align:middle line:84%
it can do for our versatility,
what it can do to repel stress,

00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.020 align:middle line:84%
what it can do to increase
our business acumen,

00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:35.400 align:middle line:90%
and so much more.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:40.170 align:middle line:90%


00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Because of the
search for pure food

00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:45.120 align:middle line:84%
that I embarked on
almost 20 years ago

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and the exploration of
what's possible in terms

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:52.830 align:middle line:84%
of dietary wellness, digestive
wellness, inevitably, it

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.890 align:middle line:84%
led me to a study of
water, and I became

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:57.330 align:middle line:90%
very averse to tap water.

00:47:57.330 --> 00:48:00.260 align:middle line:84%
Even at an early age, I
was averse to tap water.

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.610 align:middle line:84%
And we used to do filtered
water at my house,

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:05.890 align:middle line:84%
and eventually, that wasn't
even good enough for me,

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and I started looking into what
was available to us in nature

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.910 align:middle line:84%
and how our original human
ancestors procured water

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:14.070 align:middle line:84%
and how they
thought about water.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:17.040 align:middle line:84%
That finally led me
during a long fast

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.800 align:middle line:84%
to the research of
Viktor Schauberger.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And Viktor Schauberger
wrote in his books

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:25.780 align:middle line:84%
that when you go to the source
of the great high mountain

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.710 align:middle line:84%
springs, not only will you
find the greatest water

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:32.130 align:middle line:84%
in the world, but you
will also find access

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:34.860 align:middle line:84%
to inspiration that
is going to lead

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.310 align:middle line:90%
to the next level of technology.

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:40.738 align:middle line:84%
I thought, what do you
mean, inspiration from water

00:48:40.738 --> 00:48:42.530 align:middle line:84%
that leads to the next
level of technology?

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:43.590 align:middle line:90%
It made no sense.

00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:45.100 align:middle line:90%
But I did it anyway.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:48.290 align:middle line:84%
And for the last 13 years,
I've been a wild spring water

00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:50.040 align:middle line:84%
hunter all over the
world, everywhere when

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm at in the world, we go and
hunt down the wild springs,

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and we drink the spring
water from the source,

00:48:54.930 --> 00:48:58.500 align:middle line:84%
and you get the direct,
wild energy from nature

00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.920 align:middle line:84%
from that place,
all the information

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.560 align:middle line:84%
that is in that water that's
been embedded into the rocks,

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.410 align:middle line:84%
into the gravel, into that
aquifer where that water comes

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:09.480 align:middle line:90%
from is suddenly yours.

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.310 align:middle line:84%
It's available to
you, and you become

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:13.530 align:middle line:84%
part of the grander
intelligence, which

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:16.140 align:middle line:84%
is the intelligence of
the overall ecosystem.

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's what inspires
the new technology.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:24.000 align:middle line:84%
It's inspired me to get into
magnets, get into vortexes,

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.620 align:middle line:84%
get into super high-grade
water products that I use,

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:31.200 align:middle line:84%
for example, in my
tinctures that I create,

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.080 align:middle line:84%
and it brought in
a whole abundance

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:38.910 align:middle line:84%
of good times, prosperity
thinking, and feelings

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:40.830 align:middle line:90%
of well-being.

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:45.450 align:middle line:84%
The first time that I ever
drank spring water was

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:50.610 align:middle line:84%
underneath a glacier in Norway,
Galdhopiggen is the name of it.

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:54.305 align:middle line:84%
And I drank it, and my entire
body was electrically charged.

00:49:54.305 --> 00:49:55.680 align:middle line:84%
It was such a
profound experience

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.810 align:middle line:90%
that I almost fell over.

00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:00.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what I wish
for everybody.

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:03.620 align:middle line:84%
That's what your water
experience should be like.

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:09.643 align:middle line:90%
