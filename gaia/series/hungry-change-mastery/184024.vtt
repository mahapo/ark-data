00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:23.077 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.077 --> 00:00:25.720 align:middle line:84%
>> My journey started
when I was a kid.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.000 align:middle line:90%
My dad was a dentist.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:84%
And his brother and sister
were both medical doctors.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.520 align:middle line:84%
He was interested in
the work of Adelle Davis

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.920 align:middle line:84%
and also the work
of Weston Price.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.280 align:middle line:84%
And on his bedside table
was Weston Price's book

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.420 align:middle line:84%
showing how the dentition
of indigenous cultures

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.640 align:middle line:84%
changed within one generation
of introducing refined foods.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
So I grew up on cereal
that we called birdseed.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And my parents spiked the
orange juice with vitamin C.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And there's another interesting
thing that my dad did.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And when he had his patients on
antibiotics for oral surgery,

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.505 align:middle line:84%
he would have my
mother make yogurt.

00:01:01.505 --> 00:01:03.930 align:middle line:90%
This was years before Yoplait.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.170 align:middle line:84%
Before any commercial yogurt
was available, she'd make it.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:84%
He'd take it down the
street and give it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.060 align:middle line:84%
to his patients who were
on antibiotics to replenish

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:90%
their gut flora.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.120 align:middle line:90%
We had a compost heap.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.040 align:middle line:90%
We raised organic beef cattle.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And so I grew up with
this kind of sensibility.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.090 align:middle line:84%
However, I had a
sister who died.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:90%
She wouldn't eat.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.370 align:middle line:90%
And she died at six months.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.420 align:middle line:84%
My mother had been on high doses
of an antibiotic for pneumonia

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:90%
during her pregnancy.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And it was before we
understood that antibiotics

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.330 align:middle line:90%
have side effects.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:90%
And so she died.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.060 align:middle line:84%
They never really
knew the cause.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And when my brother Bill was
born, he also wouldn't eat.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, my
parents signed him out

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.830 align:middle line:84%
of the hospital
against medical advice.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.810 align:middle line:90%
I was about eight years old.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.850 align:middle line:84%
They tube fed him
at home every hour

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.300 align:middle line:84%
on the hour with an NG
tube-- nasogastric tube.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And at a year, he
weighed 10 pounds.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:84%
My parents signed him
out of the hospital

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.860 align:middle line:90%
against medical advice.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.470 align:middle line:84%
When I was interviewing
for med school,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%
my dad was taken to the
hospital to the intensive care

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.750 align:middle line:90%
unit with chest pain.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.483 align:middle line:84%
And he also, after three
days, called my mother.

00:02:12.483 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, Edna, get
me out of here.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.233 align:middle line:90%
They don't know what's going on.

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.280 align:middle line:90%
And he signed out AMA--

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.240 align:middle line:84%
against medical advice
and recovered at home.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.870 align:middle line:90%
He did not have a heart attack.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.850 align:middle line:90%
He had pericarditis.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.290 align:middle line:90%
It was misdiagnosed.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.123 align:middle line:84%
And he recovered
sitting up in a chair.

00:02:27.123 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:84%
I was interviewing
for med school.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:84%
My brother Bill who
weighed 10 pounds at a year

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.130 align:middle line:84%
is now 50 years old,
perfectly healthy.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.390 align:middle line:84%
And if my parents had not signed
him out, he would be dead.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So you see, I grew up with
the influence of organic food

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.530 align:middle line:84%
and living close to the Earth,
but having an aunt and uncle

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.770 align:middle line:84%
who were medical doctors and
knowing the value of that,

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.080 align:middle line:84%
but a father who understood
the natural world.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And all of it came together
for me in my career.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So no one has all
of the answers,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.860 align:middle line:84%
but we really have to get back
to a more natural approach.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.860 align:middle line:90%
And I grew up with that.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.850 align:middle line:84%
I have a first chakra
that's so hugely grounded.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.610 align:middle line:84%
Our first chakra is our
sense of safety and security

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.055 align:middle line:84%
in the world, our
sense of belonging.

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:20.600 align:middle line:84%
And my first chakra,
belonging, was always

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:90%
a bit against the mainstream.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.130 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I
didn't have to worry

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.380 align:middle line:84%
that I would be loved by my
family for doing the work

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.180 align:middle line:90%
that I do.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.530 align:middle line:84%
Most people who have been
outside the mainstream

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
have to be very
worried that they

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:84%
will lose their social
support network, which

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.820 align:middle line:90%
helps wire in immunity.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Community equals immunity.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.890 align:middle line:84%
And so we need the
collective to go along

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.200 align:middle line:84%
with us, at least
to some extent,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.590 align:middle line:84%
otherwise we're out there like
the only member of a tribe.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And you starve to death
when you're off by yourself.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
It takes a lot of courage
to go up against any system

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:90%
or suggest a different way.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason
I've been able to do it

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
is the conviction of my
parents, and the fact

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:84%
that this sense of purpose, and
that the rightness of what I'm

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.570 align:middle line:90%
doing was wired in very young.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:84%
The obesity epidemic-- you
could actually trace back,

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.420 align:middle line:84%
I think, to the day that
SnackWell's cookies came out.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.890 align:middle line:84%
And they began to replace
dietary fat with sugar.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the obesity
epidemic really started.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And we began to vilify
saturated animal fat

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.690 align:middle line:84%
and start to think that huge
low-fat muffins were the way

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.560 align:middle line:90%
to go.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
everyone has become

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:90%
fatter and fatter and fatter.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:84%
If you go through
the airport, what

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.710 align:middle line:90%
are the foods that you see?

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.210 align:middle line:84%
You see Cinnabon, and giant
pretzels, and all the foods

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
that you crave when
you're under stress.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.640 align:middle line:84%
When you're under stress,
you have the stress hormones

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:90%
cortisol and epinephrine.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever seen
anyone on steroid medication

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.160 align:middle line:84%
such as prednisone, you see that
the first thing that happens

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.010 align:middle line:84%
is they gain 20 to 30 pounds,
no matter what they're eating.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.590 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when your
cortisol stress

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.540 align:middle line:84%
hormone levels are
high enough, they've

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:84%
documented the fact
that looking at a donut

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.340 align:middle line:84%
actually changes
your metabolism.

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And so here we are now
as an entire culture,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:84%
swimming in a sea
of stress hormones

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.100 align:middle line:84%
and also sugar, which is
the response to stress.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.640 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, our
central nervous systems

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.980 align:middle line:84%
really haven't changed
for thousands of years

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:90%
from millennia.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.960 align:middle line:84%
And we are made
so that if you see

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.690 align:middle line:84%
something that is dangerous,
you run away from it.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So you get this bump from
your adrenals of cortisol

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
that should last about
15 minutes of running.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:84%
And then you eat to make
up for the energy expended.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, every time
you watch the news,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.210 align:middle line:84%
there's something
to run away from.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.990 align:middle line:84%
Because we also have a
global information system

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.420 align:middle line:84%
that is designed to take all
the bad news from the planet

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.660 align:middle line:84%
and bring it into your
living room constantly.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.060 align:middle line:84%
Or now with the internet,
constantly on your computer.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you do not have a way
to put this in perspective,

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.590 align:middle line:84%
you're in a constant
state of fight or flight

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and then a constant
state of sugar craving

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.020 align:middle line:90%
to make you feel better.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:27.420 align:middle line:84%
Because what sugar
does is it increases

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.795 align:middle line:90%
beta endorphin in the brain.

00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And that's a feel-good
natural opiate,

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:90%
morphine-like substance.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.810 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're depressed
or you're under stress,

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:90%
you want to eat.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.780 align:middle line:90%
What do we call them?

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.860 align:middle line:84%
"Comfort foods--" macaroni
and cheese, all the foods that

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.775 align:middle line:84%
have a virtual delivery system
of sugar right into body fat.

00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:52.500 align:middle line:84%
So it is not fat
that makes you fat.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.630 align:middle line:90%
It's sugar that makes you fat.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.490 align:middle line:84%
And it is very easy and
cheap to produce foods

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.330 align:middle line:90%
that become sugar quickly.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Most grains become
sugar quickly,

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.320 align:middle line:84%
particularly refined
grains, refined pasta,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.710 align:middle line:90%
this sort of thing.

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:84%
And in the United
States, we have now

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.820 align:middle line:84%
produced very high gluten wheat,
which is a whole other problem.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Because the body wasn't designed
to eat this much high gluten,

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.910 align:middle line:90%
big fluffy bagels.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:27.390 align:middle line:84%
You'll notice when you see
old movies that the portion

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.620 align:middle line:90%
size is very small.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Or when you go to Europe
to a very high-end place,

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.420 align:middle line:90%
you'll have a seven-course meal.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.120 align:middle line:84%
And in those seven
courses, you probably

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:84%
do not eat as much volume as
you get in the United States

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:41.565 align:middle line:90%
with your dinner plate.

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:44.640 align:middle line:84%
They're beautifully
done small portions,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:84%
digesting in
between the courses,

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.070 align:middle line:90%
a meal as a celebration.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Whereas in many countries
with fast food now,

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.550 align:middle line:84%
a meal is something
you eat in your car

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.830 align:middle line:84%
while your stress
hormones are up here.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.800 align:middle line:84%
So there's never this
sense of satisfaction--

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.086 align:middle line:90%
I've been fed.

00:08:05.086 --> 00:08:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
we're raising our children

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:14.040 align:middle line:84%
on baby formula, which has
sugar added to it and not breast

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.967 align:middle line:84%
milk, which is the
normal food for babies.

00:08:16.967 --> 00:08:19.050 align:middle line:84%
So there's all these things
that contribute to it.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:24.380 align:middle line:90%


00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.670 align:middle line:90%
There is an old saying.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.655 align:middle line:84%
Candy is dandy, but
liquor is quicker.

00:08:27.655 --> 00:08:31.550 align:middle line:84%
And what we're really talking
about is getting that hit,

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:36.710 align:middle line:84%
getting that sugar high,
getting that beta endorphin rush

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.205 align:middle line:84%
that people are looking
for to soothe themselves

00:08:40.205 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:90%
when they are under stress.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.830 align:middle line:84%
There is an interesting
study called

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.040 align:middle line:84%
the ACE study, the Adverse
Childhood Experiences study,

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
done by Vincent Felitti at
Kaiser Permanente in San Diego.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:54.140 align:middle line:84%
And they were working
with obese people.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And what he's come
to the conclusion of

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
is that obesity is
not the problem.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.042 align:middle line:90%
It's a solution.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:90%
So let's take a look at that.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a solution
to chronic stress.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a solution in many
people to sexual abuse,

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.290 align:middle line:84%
dysfunctional family
situation, and so on.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:14.675 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's an underlying truth.

00:09:14.675 --> 00:09:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But now, with the lifestyle
of the average American,

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.980 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like we're
all chronically stressed.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.580 align:middle line:84%
So we are going
for the foods that

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.630 align:middle line:84%
give us a temporary
respite from feeling bad.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So if you watch a sitcom like
the "Golden Girls," you'll

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:90%
see that Blanche--

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.320 align:middle line:84%
and they all sit
down at night when

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:84%
they're talking about
men problems or problems

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.230 align:middle line:90%
with their kids.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.990 align:middle line:84%
And they sit down
around a cheesecake,

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.390 align:middle line:84%
or they sit down
around ice cream.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see this played out
in television all the time.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But once you understand
that sugar is a drug

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:90%
just like alcohol is a drug.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.300 align:middle line:84%
And so what happens with
any addiction is this.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.940 align:middle line:84%
You become habituated
to the effect.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:05.930 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you need
more and more and more over

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:08.160 align:middle line:84%
time to give you
the same effect.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.090 align:middle line:84%
It's no different
than it is with sugar.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you walk the aisles
in the average grocery store

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.380 align:middle line:84%
and you look at the amount of
sugar in a child's breakfast

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.300 align:middle line:84%
cereal, you might as well be
rolling up the kid's sleeve

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
and putting in heroin,
because it's the same.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:27.655 align:middle line:90%
It's that addictive.

00:10:27.655 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Now, we think about,
whoo, cocaine, heroin,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:32.450 align:middle line:90%
all these big drugs.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.140 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is
that premature death

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:84%
is coming from sugar and
alcohol and smoking, of course.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.520 align:middle line:84%
So if you begin to think about
these massive doses of sugar

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:84%
as no different from
drugs and alcohol,

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
then you get a handle
on the situation.

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, here's what
happens, though.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.980 align:middle line:84%
When you withdraw from
sugar, you instantly

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.990 align:middle line:90%
feel a little bit depressed.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But over time,
when you've learned

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.620 align:middle line:84%
to balance that with protein and
fat and keep the carbohydrates,

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.220 align:middle line:84%
the sugar at a lower
glycemic index, meaning

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.200 align:middle line:84%
that the sugar is released
into the bloodstream

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.540 align:middle line:84%
much more slowly,
then what happens

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:15.797 align:middle line:84%
is that awful, insatiable
sugar craving finally goes away

00:11:15.797 --> 00:11:17.255 align:middle line:84%
and you get off
the roller coaster.

00:11:17.255 --> 00:11:23.650 align:middle line:90%


00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:30.910 align:middle line:84%
Back in the '80s, I was a
pretty vegan macrobiotic, which

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.880 align:middle line:90%
makes you feel quite holy.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.940 align:middle line:90%
And it makes you feel devoted.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:84%
However, the tendency in
many, many vegetarians

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:90%
is to eat too much grain.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.500 align:middle line:84%
And then what happens
because grain is associated

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.500 align:middle line:84%
with high blood sugar,
you say to yourself,

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.470 align:middle line:84%
well, a donut is
vegan, which is true.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.742 align:middle line:90%
It can be made vegan.

00:11:54.742 --> 00:11:56.200 align:middle line:84%
And then you got
these big cookies.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And what you find often
is vegetarians are often

00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:00.790 align:middle line:90%
very addicted to sugar.

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:04.510 align:middle line:84%
And in the macrobiotic community
in Boston at that time,

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:07.390 align:middle line:84%
there was almost this joke
within the community, which

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.570 align:middle line:84%
is that people would do
drive-through Dunkin'

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:84%
Donuts under cover of
darkness, so that no one would

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.555 align:middle line:90%
see this addictive behavior.

00:12:15.555 --> 00:12:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, what I noticed
is the minute I began

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:23.260 align:middle line:84%
to add more protein and
healthy fat to my diet

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:29.020 align:middle line:84%
and cut way back on the grains,
this insatiable sugar craving

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:90%
went away.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.200 align:middle line:90%
And it started with breakfast.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So you have to nail in your
blood sugar at breakfast.

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.265 align:middle line:84%
Because what you don't
eat in the morning

00:12:38.265 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:84%
or what you do
eat in the morning

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:84%
sets up your blood sugar
for the next 12 hours.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.710 align:middle line:84%
And so when you
don't have breakfast,

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and you have a cup of coffee
and then a bagel or donut,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.530 align:middle line:84%
and then you don't eat lunch,
because you're too rushed,

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:54.370 align:middle line:84%
what happens is your blood sugar
at 4 o'clock in the afternoon

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:55.540 align:middle line:90%
begins to plummet.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And then you begin your evening
meal at the refrigerator.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.930 align:middle line:84%
And the evening meal
doesn't end until midnight

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:05.770 align:middle line:84%
when you crash into bed and
begin the cycle all over again.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.830 align:middle line:84%
When you start your
day with some protein,

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:11.770 align:middle line:84%
you can have a little bit of
low-glycemic carbohydrate.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:14.470 align:middle line:84%
With protein, you will
find that you're not

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:18.380 align:middle line:84%
getting that incredible crash
at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So you really begin
to feel as though you

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:25.160 align:middle line:90%
have control over your destiny.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a very different
biochemistry in your brain.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So I'd like people to
know it's not your fault.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.830 align:middle line:90%
This is how we are as mammals.

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.177 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've lived on
the Earth for millennium

00:13:36.177 --> 00:13:37.510 align:middle line:90%
where there was a food shortage.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.720 align:middle line:84%
You're programmed to
put on fat whenever

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:90%
there is food available.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.340 align:middle line:84%
But now, there's a
lot of food available,

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.350 align:middle line:90%
but it's the wrong kind.

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And so we've been
programmed for millennia

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:84%
to store up for the winter,
but the winter doesn't come.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:59.090 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
There's an interesting
addiction that I've

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.040 align:middle line:84%
seen through the years,
and it's to diet colas.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Nothing else does it in your
brain quite like a diet cola.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.350 align:middle line:90%
And Diet 7UP doesn't do it.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Diet Sprite doesn't do it.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:90%
It's Diet Coke.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's because there's
a deadly combination there

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.400 align:middle line:90%
of aspartame and caffeine.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And those two together
create a very unique blend

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.900 align:middle line:84%
of excitotoxin that
kills off brain cells.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:35.120 align:middle line:84%
But before they die,
they have this excitement

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.950 align:middle line:90%
that's like a buzz.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.540 align:middle line:84%
So what you find
with the Diet Coke

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
addicts is that
they'll drink sometimes

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.450 align:middle line:90%
a liter, 2 liters a day.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And particularly
women do it as a way

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:90%
to keep their weight down.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.090 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.280 align:middle line:84%
They just have the next
buzz of diet colas.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.440 align:middle line:84%
But the problem
is, over time, this

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:59.130 align:middle line:84%
can lead to symptoms that
mimic multiple sclerosis.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:14:59.930 align:middle line:90%
There's headaches.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:01.580 align:middle line:90%
There's neurologic problems.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.080 align:middle line:90%
There's all kinds of problems.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.810 align:middle line:84%
There are now diet
drinks with stevia.

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:09.020 align:middle line:90%
Zevia is a brand name.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.140 align:middle line:90%
And that's very nice.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.720 align:middle line:84%
There's zero water,
and that works.

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really kind of happy the
way industry has moved forward

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:19.370 align:middle line:84%
to give us alternatives
that are healthy.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:22.580 align:middle line:84%
With Diet Coke,
you can get off it.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:90%
It's three days.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to get
off it, it's 72 hours.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:30.020 align:middle line:84%
Drink chamomile tea,
drink lots of water.

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:32.570 align:middle line:84%
And you'll find that if
you drink lots of water

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.280 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
day, the addiction

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.470 align:middle line:90%
is gone after three days.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.650 align:middle line:84%
But then stay away from
it, because there's

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.550 align:middle line:90%
a certain group of individuals.

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not everybody that will
get addicted to Diet Coke.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:90%
I'm not.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.820 align:middle line:84%
I can have one
every three months.

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:47.990 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.898 align:middle line:84%
But if you're addicted--
so take the first one.

00:15:50.898 --> 00:15:52.940 align:middle line:84%
And then you want the next
one, and the next one,

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.740 align:middle line:90%
and the next one.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.030 align:middle line:90%
Very specific brain type.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.981 align:middle line:84%
And never give
these to children.

00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:58.781 align:middle line:90%
Never.

00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:05.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.980 align:middle line:84%
In general, when you start to
look at artificial sweeteners,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.500 align:middle line:84%
we find that people
do better when

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:90%
they're on natural sweeteners.

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:16.760 align:middle line:84%
But again, sugar
is sugar is sugar.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:90%
So there's honey.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:18.580 align:middle line:90%
And there's maple syrup.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And there's barley
malt and agave.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:26.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of them still
are fairly high glycemic.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:29.420 align:middle line:84%
Agave-- depends on
where it's from.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.320 align:middle line:84%
But most of them are still
sugar and still addictive.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.790 align:middle line:84%
So for that sweet taste, what
I found is the absolute best.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.310 align:middle line:84%
Because it's not
addictive, is stevia.

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And the herb stevia has been
used for hundreds of years.

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:45.790 align:middle line:90%
It is now available in sodas.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:48.490 align:middle line:84%
They're putting it
in drinks and so on.

00:16:48.490 --> 00:16:53.020 align:middle line:84%
When you are off the sugar
roller coaster, you're human.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.010 align:middle line:84%
You're still going to want
a sweet taste now and again.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.470 align:middle line:84%
And fresh fruit, of
course, is perfect,

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.140 align:middle line:84%
because it's low glycemic
in almost every case.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.290 align:middle line:84%
But for that
occasional diet drink,

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:84%
get one sweetened
with stevia or one

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.770 align:middle line:84%
of my favorites, which is
just a nice cup of coffee

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.910 align:middle line:84%
with a little stevia and a
little heavy cream sweetened

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.900 align:middle line:90%
with stevia.

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:84%
It makes almost a
dessert-like ending to a meal,

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.990 align:middle line:90%
so that I don't feel deprived.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:84%
Over time, what you'll find
is that huge sweet tooth where

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.410 align:middle line:84%
you have to have whatever it
is, you don't care anymore.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm sitting here talking to you.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.690 align:middle line:84%
And I actually can't even
believe that I'm saying that.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Because for years, even
starting as a little kid,

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.250 align:middle line:90%
I very much liked sugar.

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Even in our "organically
grown" childhood,

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.040 align:middle line:90%
we liked pies and cakes.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And I remember experimenting
with trying to make everything

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.830 align:middle line:84%
with whole wheat flour, wheat
germ brownies, all that stuff.

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:55.645 align:middle line:90%
It was still sugar.

00:17:55.645 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:90%


00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.920 align:middle line:84%
The number one best way
to digest stress hormones

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.330 align:middle line:90%
is sleep.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And deep sleep will
metabolize excess cortisol

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.990 align:middle line:84%
and epinephrine better
than anything else.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, I want people
to try something.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:84%
If you've been
under stress and you

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
sleep for only three
to four hours a night,

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.680 align:middle line:84%
you will gain two pounds
just from that alone.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Because the stress
increases fluid retention.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:30.027 align:middle line:90%
So I call those liquid pounds.

00:18:30.027 --> 00:18:31.860 align:middle line:84%
You want to take care
of those liquid pounds

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.570 align:middle line:84%
before they turn into real
pounds, which they inevitably

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:35.370 align:middle line:90%
will.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people are
sleep deprived now.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.250 align:middle line:84%
And we have been in the midst
of a sleep macho culture

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.850 align:middle line:84%
where people actually brag
about how little sleep they

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.750 align:middle line:84%
got in the culture of
medicine and surgery,

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.500 align:middle line:84%
where you're doing
surgery in the morning.

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.570 align:middle line:84%
You're up all night,
bringing people back

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:52.690 align:middle line:90%
from the brink of death.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:57.155 align:middle line:84%
It's very sleep macho, and
it's completely unhealthy.

00:18:57.155 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'd first like to give people
permission to sleep and sleep

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.960 align:middle line:84%
as long as you need
to whenever you can.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.950 align:middle line:90%
So that's sleep.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.170 align:middle line:84%
The second thing that
really metabolizes

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.140 align:middle line:84%
stress hormones-- and this is
how the body was designed--

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:12.900 align:middle line:90%
is exercise.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.122 align:middle line:84%
When you lift weights or
you simply take a long walk,

00:19:16.122 --> 00:19:17.330 align:middle line:90%
you're doing a couple things.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.900 align:middle line:84%
One is you're increasing those
feel-good hormones that you've

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:90%
normally gone to sugar for.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.950 align:middle line:90%
So exercise.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:28.560 align:middle line:84%
Taking a walk three,
four times a week

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.270 align:middle line:84%
is as good as anti-depressants
for mild to moderate

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:34.140 align:middle line:90%
depression.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:90%
I mean, this is insane.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.407 align:middle line:90%
You just exercise alone.

00:19:36.407 --> 00:19:38.490 align:middle line:84%
And you know when you get
out there and you do it.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And you're in the
fresh air and so on.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:40.710 align:middle line:90%
You feel much better.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:90%
And that's biochemical.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is
another one that

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.310 align:middle line:90%
works extraordinarily well.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:84%
20 minutes of meditation
in the morning

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.200 align:middle line:84%
or whenever you can
do it just sitting.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.220 align:middle line:84%
And you can use the Herb
Benson relaxation response

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.930 align:middle line:90%
where you close your eyes.

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And then the mantra is rose,
or the mantra is peace,

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:84%
or the mantra is
whatever your mantra is.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:84%
And every time the mind
wanders, which it will,

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.912 align:middle line:84%
because it's a monkey mind,
you come back to that.

00:20:08.912 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:90%
And you just sit there.

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.328 align:middle line:84%
And that will lower
blood pressure.

00:20:11.328 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And it will increase beta
endorphins and so on.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Anything that is
sustainably pleasurable

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.230 align:middle line:90%
will decrease stress hormones.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.335 align:middle line:84%
Laughter decreases
them enormously.

00:20:22.335 --> 00:20:24.810 align:middle line:84%
So I would recommend
that you have

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.850 align:middle line:90%
some funny movies lying around.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.110 align:middle line:90%
"Tommy Boy" is a good one.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:31.680 align:middle line:84%
"Wedding Crashers," some of
the old Charlie Chaplin movies.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.580 align:middle line:90%
Anything like that.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:38.190 align:middle line:84%
And that's been clinically shown
to improve immunity and also

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:39.330 align:middle line:90%
decrease pain.

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:43.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the old Norman
Cousins' stuff from the past.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.110 align:middle line:84%
"Anatomy of an Illness as
Perceived by the Patient."

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.700 align:middle line:90%
And sex is also very good.

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:51.180 align:middle line:84%
The problem with sex is
in certain individuals,

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.310 align:middle line:90%
it can become addictive.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:58.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not talking about
sex to fulfill a need,

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:01.830 align:middle line:84%
but touching, massage
is very, very good.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:84%
I don't think there's anything
better than a good foot

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.200 align:middle line:84%
reflexology treatment
to decrease stress.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I swear I can put anyone into a
trance with the way I do that.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.180 align:middle line:84%
So those are things that
you can do naturally.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:20.500 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I actually think that the
concept of loving yourself

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:25.960 align:middle line:90%
is key to all of it.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Without that, nothing else
is going to be sustainable.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have a
message in your head--

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm worthless, piece
of crap, and my life

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:38.050 align:middle line:84%
doesn't count for anything,
and I'm always a failure,

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.140 align:middle line:84%
and I screw up all the time,
and I'll never be good enough,

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.330 align:middle line:84%
and I'll never make it,
and no one loves me.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.000 align:middle line:84%
If that's what's going
on subconsciously--

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, that's
usually nailed in,

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:53.020 align:middle line:84%
in childhood from some decision
you made based on something

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.720 align:middle line:84%
that your parents said
or a sibling said.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.240 align:middle line:84%
I had a woman on my
radio show the other day

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:02.260 align:middle line:84%
whose sister told her that
her husband probably had

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.330 align:middle line:90%
an affair because of her neck.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.610 align:middle line:84%
Because of the way her neck
looked, because the skin

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:08.260 align:middle line:90%
was looking a little old.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a smart woman.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And yet, she keeps going
back to, is it my neck?

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, I assure
you it is not your neck.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.890 align:middle line:84%
However, we're all so
vulnerable to these feelings

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:23.275 align:middle line:90%
that we have from childhood.

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing
you do is you know

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.330 align:middle line:90%
that they're probably there.

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And Louise Hay of Hay House
has a wonderful practice.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And if anyone would just do
this, really do it for 30 days.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And for years, I wrote
it out on a prescription.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.360 align:middle line:90%
OK, so here it is.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.390 align:middle line:84%
I accept myself
unconditionally right now.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.310 align:middle line:90%
I write it on the prescription.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.120 align:middle line:84%
Their job was to post it
on their bathroom mirror

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:52.150 align:middle line:84%
and twice a day look deep
into their eyes and say,

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:55.630 align:middle line:84%
I accept myself
unconditionally right now.

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:57.370 align:middle line:90%
Now, then you wait.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.462 align:middle line:84%
You wait for the
messages to arise.

00:23:00.462 --> 00:23:01.420 align:middle line:90%
You're a piece of shit.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.540 align:middle line:84%
There's no way you
can love yourself.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.110 align:middle line:90%
Look at your thighs.

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:06.670 align:middle line:90%
You see all that cellulite?

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:08.020 align:middle line:90%
What about that body of yours?

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.820 align:middle line:90%
You're 30 pounds overweight.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:10.640 align:middle line:90%
You're unmarried.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.280 align:middle line:84%
You're a middle-aged
woman with cats.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.928 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing
acceptable about you.

00:23:13.928 --> 00:23:15.220 align:middle line:90%
That's what's going to come up.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.110 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.910 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.090 align:middle line:90%
If you do this for 30 days--

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
the PhD level, by the way,
is just gazing into your eyes

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.910 align:middle line:90%
and saying, I love you.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.770 align:middle line:90%
I really love you.

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:33.768 align:middle line:84%
By about day 28,
something shifts inside.

00:23:33.768 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And you begin to believe
it, because you're

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.830 align:middle line:90%
planting a new affirmation.

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:43.360 align:middle line:84%
Rudyard Kipling said, I am
by nature a dealer in words.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And words are the most powerful
drug known to humanity.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.650 align:middle line:84%
So you are giving yourself
different messages.

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:56.020 align:middle line:84%
And when you start to do
that, you begin to have--

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.950 align:middle line:84%
you develop like a
muscle this witness self

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:90%
that listens to you talk.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And the stronger that
witness self gets,

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.950 align:middle line:90%
the healthier you get.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
not your thoughts,

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.425 align:middle line:84%
and you're not that
programming from childhood.

00:24:11.425 --> 00:24:14.050 align:middle line:90%
You bring that to consciousness.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And then the other
practical thing

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:19.990 align:middle line:84%
you do is you begin to
surround yourself with friends

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.180 align:middle line:90%
who actually support you.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:26.230 align:middle line:84%
I can guarantee you the
biggest naysayers in your life

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.920 align:middle line:90%
are probably family members.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.220 align:middle line:84%
We like to think, well,
my family loves me.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, they do.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.230 align:middle line:84%
But they also want to
keep you in the box,

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.630 align:middle line:90%
particularly if you're a mother.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:39.580 align:middle line:84%
Nobody wants mom to
get out of the box,

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:41.805 align:middle line:84%
because then, who's
going to cook and clean?

00:24:41.805 --> 00:24:43.180 align:middle line:84%
So one of the
things that happens

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:46.240 align:middle line:84%
if you're a mother is your
children will make fun of you

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.475 align:middle line:84%
whenever you start
to do anything

00:24:48.475 --> 00:24:51.100 align:middle line:84%
that is a little bit outside of
what they would like you to do.

00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:57.970 align:middle line:84%
I remember the first time I wore
a velour leopard giant shirt.

00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:59.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a giant shirt.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.560 align:middle line:90%
It's not sexy in any way.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:01.960 align:middle line:90%
It's just leopard.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.660 align:middle line:90%
And my daughter was 10.

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.780 align:middle line:90%
Are you going to wear that, mom?

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.010 align:middle line:90%
And so you have to--

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.450 align:middle line:84%
and I've developed this
refined part of myself

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.050 align:middle line:84%
that when my kids ask me,
are you going to do that?

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:19.270 align:middle line:84%
Then I know I'm on
the right track.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I'm going to do that.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And then I'm going to take
the dialogue of our family

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.470 align:middle line:84%
to a higher level, instead of
keeping everyone in the box.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:90%
We have a saying in Maine.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.750 align:middle line:90%
Crabs in the bucket.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:35.520 align:middle line:84%
When one crab gets over the
edge and it's looking around,

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.820 align:middle line:90%
things could be different here.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:37.990 align:middle line:90%
That looks good over there.

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll learn to dance.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.680 align:middle line:84%
The other crabs
pull it back down.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:84%
So you have to note in your life
who's pulling you back down.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:48.400 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you'll
find a new tribe

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.320 align:middle line:90%
of people who will support you.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is a very good time
to do that on planet Earth.

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.440 align:middle line:84%
Because the light
is getting lighter.

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.690 align:middle line:84%
We are in this
documentary, aren't we now?

00:25:58.690 --> 00:26:06.130 align:middle line:90%


00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.250 align:middle line:84%
I have a good friend who
weighed 100 pounds more

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.690 align:middle line:90%
than she does now.

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Back when she was in
her teenage years,

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:15.160 align:middle line:90%
her mother was schizophrenic.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.530 align:middle line:90%
And she said food was my friend.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.440 align:middle line:84%
Her dad was a career
officer in the war,

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.670 align:middle line:90%
was always away from home.

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.460 align:middle line:84%
So she raised her three
younger siblings as her mother

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.200 align:middle line:90%
slowly went crazy.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.640 align:middle line:90%
And she said food was my friend.

00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.420 align:middle line:84%
And I knew I would lose
the weight when I finally

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.220 align:middle line:90%
got away from home.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:38.450 align:middle line:84%
She introduced me to some
Living in Process therapies.

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.060 align:middle line:90%
One was with Anne Wilson Schaef.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And I watched as people had
these old emotions come up.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And one woman got down
on a mat and started

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:52.770 align:middle line:84%
to sob about something stuck
in her body in childhood.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:54.940 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, body
workers will often

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.820 align:middle line:84%
find this when they're doing
a massage in a certain way.

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:90%
An old memory will come up.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like they're
stored in the muscles.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you allow that
emotion to come out

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:06.430 align:middle line:84%
totally-- like this woman cried
and cried and cried and cried.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:90%
And she got up.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.890 align:middle line:84%
And she weighed
five pounds less.

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:12.440 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it over
and over and over.

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know Einstein
said e equals mc squared.

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:18.700 align:middle line:84%
Energy and matter
are interconvertible.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:23.320 align:middle line:84%
So when you release a big
load of blocked energy,

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.250 align:middle line:84%
then the weight also
can dematerialize.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:28.780 align:middle line:90%
And it goes back doesn't it?

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:33.760 align:middle line:84%
To self-love where you decide
you're going to love yourself

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.630 align:middle line:84%
just the way you are
and at the same time,

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.570 align:middle line:84%
eat breakfast, and
at the same time,

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:44.320 align:middle line:84%
do more walking, and at
the same time, meditate,

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.765 align:middle line:90%
but from a place of self-love.

00:27:47.765 --> 00:27:53.170 align:middle line:84%
On Valentine's Day this past
year, I sat in the bathtub

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and decided I was going to
do my own Valentine's Day

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.450 align:middle line:90%
ritual of self-love.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.220 align:middle line:90%
So I put some rose oil in there.

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.470 align:middle line:84%
And I happened to have some
roses lying around-- pink.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Put the rose petals
in the bathtub,

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:09.670 align:middle line:84%
put on some nice Deva
Premal chanting music,

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:15.340 align:middle line:84%
and just sat in the bathtub and
reveled in a self-love ritual.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Easy to do.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.570 align:middle line:90%
Just use common household items.

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And I had this sense
of creating a cocoon

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:28.285 align:middle line:90%
of loving kindness for myself.

00:28:28.285 --> 00:28:30.610 align:middle line:90%
And it has stayed with me.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:35.740 align:middle line:84%
So if you can take
one little time

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.270 align:middle line:84%
frame in which you felt
completely loved and completely

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:44.590 align:middle line:84%
accepted and you can run
that by as a touchstone--

00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:48.460 align:middle line:84%
your central nervous system--
please know that the body makes

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.660 align:middle line:90%
no--

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.948 align:middle line:84%
there is no difference
between an imagined experience

00:28:51.948 --> 00:28:52.990 align:middle line:90%
and an actual experience.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:55.540 align:middle line:90%
The body can't tell.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.540 align:middle line:84%
So when you run this by in
a visualization or simply

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.250 align:middle line:84%
remembering how that was, you
can create a biochemical state

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:04.390 align:middle line:90%
in your body-mind.

00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:08.650 align:middle line:90%


00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I remember years ago listening
to Elisabeth Kubler-Ross who

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.230 align:middle line:90%
was Swiss and one of triplets.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.530 align:middle line:84%
And she had a particularly
rough childhood.

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:21.460 align:middle line:84%
And she said based on
her own experience--

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.500 align:middle line:84%
and of course, she was
a psychiatrist, so based

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.870 align:middle line:84%
on the experience of
millions of people

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.600 align:middle line:84%
and the death and dying
people that she worked with.

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.300 align:middle line:84%
She said we're raised to
be little prostitutes.

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.400 align:middle line:90%
I'll love you if--

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.450 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, just loving
yourself, accepting yourself

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:39.250 align:middle line:90%
is not enough.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Because we think-- we
learn stupid things.

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:48.010 align:middle line:84%
Don't break your arm patting
yourself on the back.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, who are you
to love yourself?

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:55.453 align:middle line:84%
But every kid born
likes themselves.

00:29:55.453 --> 00:29:56.620 align:middle line:90%
You ever see a two-year-old?

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:58.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you want to
see the human state,

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.180 align:middle line:84%
look at a two-year-old
running around.

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:90%
They really like themselves.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:05.170 align:middle line:84%
They move very well
in their bodies.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And when they begin to walk,
to do something new like walk,

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.480 align:middle line:90%
they fall down a lot.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.610 align:middle line:84%
But we don't say to them
get up, you little toad.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Like, you want to
be able to walk.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.570 align:middle line:90%
Can't you do that better?

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:19.370 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:20.480 align:middle line:90%
They fall.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.280 align:middle line:90%
They get up.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:21.940 align:middle line:90%
They laugh.

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:22.420 align:middle line:90%
They fall.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:22.960 align:middle line:90%
They cry.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:23.470 align:middle line:90%
They get up.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:24.190 align:middle line:90%
They laugh.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.732 align:middle line:84%
Because no one's
telling them they're

00:30:25.732 --> 00:30:28.120 align:middle line:84%
a stupid fool because
they can't walk yet.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.880 align:middle line:84%
But when you're human,
and you go to school,

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.250 align:middle line:84%
and you do all
that, you're taught

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:37.097 align:middle line:84%
that you're worthless unless
you're achieving this, this,

00:30:37.097 --> 00:30:38.071 align:middle line:90%
this, this, this.

00:30:38.071 --> 00:30:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And then at the
end of the day, you

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.760 align:middle line:90%
realize there is no achievement.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.340 align:middle line:84%
There is no achievement
that's going

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.770 align:middle line:90%
to do what self-love does.

00:30:47.770 --> 00:30:50.830 align:middle line:84%
People say to me
sometimes, well,

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:56.050 align:middle line:84%
what must it be like to be
famous or to be a celebrity?

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:57.520 align:middle line:90%
Or whatever it is.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.865 align:middle line:84%
And I say to them
celebrity is meaningless.

00:31:00.865 --> 00:31:03.220 align:middle line:90%
There's nothing there.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a myth.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:08.450 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end of
the day when you go home,

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:11.350 align:middle line:84%
no one's there but
you, and maybe some

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.520 align:middle line:90%
loved ones, and maybe your cat.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:19.660 align:middle line:84%
But if you don't like your life
and like you, there's no Oscar.

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.630 align:middle line:84%
There is no "New York
Times" Best Seller.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:26.710 align:middle line:84%
There's no anything that will do
it for you more than self-love.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:30.790 align:middle line:84%
And physiologically as a
doctor, let me tell you

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.410 align:middle line:90%
what self-love does.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.810 align:middle line:84%
It improves your
hearing, your eyesight.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.160 align:middle line:90%
It lowers your blood pressure.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.420 align:middle line:84%
It increases pulmonary
function, cardiac output.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.830 align:middle line:84%
It helps wire in
the musculature.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So if we had a rampant
epidemic of self-love,

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:54.680 align:middle line:84%
then our health care costs
would go down dramatically.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:59.110 align:middle line:84%
So this isn't just some
little foo-foo New Age notion.

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:01.960 align:middle line:90%
Oh, love yourself, honey.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.500 align:middle line:90%
This is hardcore science.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:10.150 align:middle line:84%
And the way you do
the self-love is you

00:32:10.150 --> 00:32:13.150 align:middle line:84%
find yourself
beating yourself up.

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is my favorite
thing from Gay Hendricks.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.530 align:middle line:90%
How do you love yourself?

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:22.180 align:middle line:84%
You love yourself for
not loving yourself.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Because when you start to learn
about the mind-body connection,

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.920 align:middle line:90%
you do things like, oh, my God.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:29.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, my God.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.630 align:middle line:90%
I did something wrong.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.070 align:middle line:90%
I have a fibroid tumor.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.015 align:middle line:90%
I did something wrong.

00:32:34.015 --> 00:32:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I've just been diagnosed
with breast cancer.

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:38.620 align:middle line:84%
I've been reading Louise
Hay my whole life.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.670 align:middle line:90%
I've eaten well.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.080 align:middle line:90%
I got breast cancer.

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.450 align:middle line:84%
Better get out the flail
and beat myself up.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:47.230 align:middle line:84%
No, the first thing you
do is you have compassion,

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:49.120 align:middle line:90%
because we're not in control.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.770 align:middle line:84%
The culture is
bigger than we are.

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:53.633 align:middle line:84%
And stuff happens to
us that is outside

00:32:53.633 --> 00:32:56.050 align:middle line:84%
of the control of the left
hemisphere, the part of us that

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.760 align:middle line:90%
thinks it's driving the bus.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.850 align:middle line:84%
The heart and the soul
are driving the bus.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:04.110 align:middle line:84%
And they often have a
bigger agenda for you

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:06.040 align:middle line:90%
than you know about.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.610 align:middle line:84%
That's why you'll meet
people who will say to you,

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:12.110 align:middle line:84%
cancer is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.910 align:middle line:90%
Changed my life.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I just had a friend
call me today.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.350 align:middle line:84%
She said she broke
her arm skiing.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:21.140 align:middle line:84%
Three months ago, she tore
a rotator cuff skiing.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.690 align:middle line:90%
I know her history.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:25.060 align:middle line:90%
I said to her, congratulations.

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:27.520 align:middle line:84%
You finally gave yourself the
brake you've been needing.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:33.830 align:middle line:90%


00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.320 align:middle line:84%
It's so interesting
that people think, well,

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.710 align:middle line:84%
I've made it this
far on crappy food.

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't have that
much time left.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But what people don't realize
is that our DNA knows good food,

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:49.880 align:middle line:84%
because it hasn't changed
since we were in the Stone Age.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:54.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can make a huge
change in your life,

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and in your appearance, and
in your health in two weeks.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.500 align:middle line:90%
It happens really quickly.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And I wish people could
understand the degree

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:05.600 align:middle line:90%
to which their life can change.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.889 align:middle line:84%
I sat with Michio Kushi in
Boston for a number of months

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:12.260 align:middle line:84%
when he did macrobiotic
consultations

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:16.610 align:middle line:84%
with people who had cancer and
all kinds of heart disease.

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.190 align:middle line:84%
And they'd already been through
the whole medical system.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.632 align:middle line:84%
They had been-- they had
failed the medical system.

00:34:21.632 --> 00:34:23.590 align:middle line:84%
The doctor said there's
nothing more we can do.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.429 align:middle line:84%
So then they'd
show up on the door

00:34:25.429 --> 00:34:28.088 align:middle line:90%
of a guy who prescribed food.

00:34:28.088 --> 00:34:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd see
their medical chart.

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.850 align:middle line:84%
But most importantly,
a month later

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:35.120 align:middle line:84%
they'd come back, looking
like different people.

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.159 align:middle line:84%
Their facial
structures had changed.

00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:40.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything had changed just
from adopting a healthy diet.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, the only ones
who stuck with it

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:47.190 align:middle line:84%
were the ones who had nailed
in the self-love part.

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, within
a very short time,

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:53.070 align:middle line:90%
you can affect a huge change.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with just
eating breakfast.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:02.150 align:middle line:84%
Kathleen Desmaisons, who
wrote "Potatoes not Prozac,"

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:06.230 align:middle line:84%
had a thing that she did with
recidivism-- drunk drivers

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:07.340 align:middle line:90%
in New Mexico.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.090 align:middle line:84%
And the state sent
her these people

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:13.250 align:middle line:84%
that just kept driving drunk,
because of the connection

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:84%
between sugar, alcohol, and
feeling better in your brain.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:18.200 align:middle line:84%
She'd just have
them eat breakfast.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.320 align:middle line:84%
Even if breakfast
was a bag of chips,

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:25.040 align:middle line:84%
it was better than nothing
to nail in their blood sugar.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So let's just say
you eat breakfast.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Or that's what you
do for one week.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:35.580 align:middle line:84%
Four days during that week,
eat something for breakfast.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Maybe a piece of
whole grain toast.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.960 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a piece of cheese.

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Maybe a boiled egg.

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.710 align:middle line:90%
Oatmeal is good.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I'd make-- the real stuff
takes no time, really.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:45.290 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:46.340 align:middle line:90%
You do that.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.710 align:middle line:90%
Or-- give you another choice.

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:50.820 align:middle line:90%
You take a walk--

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:54.080 align:middle line:90%
15 minutes three times a week.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:59.300 align:middle line:84%
You start somewhere, anywhere,
because here's what happens.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.430 align:middle line:90%
We like to think that--

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.170 align:middle line:84%
we know that bad
habits and addictions

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:05.420 align:middle line:90%
get worse and worse and worse.

00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.790 align:middle line:84%
What we have failed
to realize is

00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:12.120 align:middle line:84%
how one positive change
attracts another positive change

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:12.920 align:middle line:90%
and another.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.003 align:middle line:84%
There was an interesting
study in "The New England

00:36:15.003 --> 00:36:18.260 align:middle line:84%
Journal of Medicine" that
followed the impact of one

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:20.450 align:middle line:90%
person quitting smoking.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:23.780 align:middle line:84%
And they found that
the impact of that

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.480 align:middle line:84%
went to four degrees
of separation

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:30.670 align:middle line:84%
from them because of the way
people relate to each other.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So one person in a
workplace stopped smoking.

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Next thing you know, we
begin an epidemic of health,

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:40.370 align:middle line:84%
because other people stop
and other people stop.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:44.605 align:middle line:84%
Or one person has an egg
instead of a donut at breakfast.

00:36:44.605 --> 00:36:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Everyone else
looks because we're

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.430 align:middle line:84%
herd creatures-- looks and
goes, oh, he's having the egg.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:50.870 align:middle line:90%
Maybe I'll have the egg.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And before long,
everyone's having the egg.

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Because there is
a level at which

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:59.570 align:middle line:90%
we are all one with humanity.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:03.470 align:middle line:84%
And it gets-- the more people
do this, the easier it becomes.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:05.600 align:middle line:84%
I spent some time
at Sanoviv, which

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:08.900 align:middle line:84%
is a holistic hospital
in Rosarito, Mexico.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And everyone wears these green
cotton, really ugly sweats.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:17.390 align:middle line:84%
And everyone eats
the green juice,

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of the
stuff, and raw vegetables.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.040 align:middle line:90%
It's easy.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:22.910 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:25.010 align:middle line:90%
We're all doing it all together.

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:27.860 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has the shots of
wheat grass in the morning.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.545 align:middle line:84%
Everyone has their
alkalinizing--

00:37:30.545 --> 00:37:32.420 align:middle line:84%
that's another thing
you can do, by the way--

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:34.520 align:middle line:84%
an alkalinizing drink
in the morning--

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.590 align:middle line:84%
lemon juice in hot
water, cayenne pepper.

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Have that first thing
in the morning--

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:39.260 align:middle line:90%
that alone.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:40.790 align:middle line:90%
Just do that for a month.

00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.500 align:middle line:84%
And that will
alkalinize your blood,

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.600 align:middle line:84%
and make you feel
better, and so on.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:48.380 align:middle line:84%
But when everyone's doing it,
it gets easier and easier.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So I would recommend
for almost everybody,

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:54.020 align:middle line:84%
get a buddy to do
this with you, someone

00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.330 align:middle line:84%
who will hold your
toes to the fire

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:58.070 align:middle line:90%
when you want to revert back.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes approximately
30 days to nail in a new habit.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:84%
With the way nerves grow and
the central nervous system

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:11.090 align:middle line:84%
is set up, is it takes a
while to make a new habit.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:13.640 align:middle line:84%
And you need support
during that time.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:15.410 align:middle line:90%
It's like learning a language.

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:16.850 align:middle line:90%
You say it, you say it, say it.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And then one day, you're
dreaming in the language,

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.100 align:middle line:90%
but it takes will.

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:23.340 align:middle line:90%
It takes commitment.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.520 align:middle line:90%
It takes discipline.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to belittle this.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:30.890 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who ever quit smoking,
anyone who ever got off

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:34.520 align:middle line:84%
of sugar, there
comes a hard place

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.970 align:middle line:84%
where you need support,
one of the reasons

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:40.750 align:middle line:84%
why I'm a huge fan of
the 12-step program.

00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:middle line:84%
Addiction is God's
answer to community.

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And the 12-step program
works all over the world

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.200 align:middle line:90%
and it's free.

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.850 align:middle line:90%
And what's the first step?

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:53.570 align:middle line:84%
We admitted we were powerless
over whatever it is--

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:57.380 align:middle line:84%
alcohol, drugs, your
mother-in-law, whatever.

00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.470 align:middle line:84%
Number 2-- came to believe a
power greater than ourselves

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:01.790 align:middle line:90%
could restore us to sanity.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.370 align:middle line:84%
3-- turned our lives
over to that power.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:08.660 align:middle line:84%
I believe that power comes
through us as our soul.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.490 align:middle line:84%
Or as they say in
"Eat, Pray, Love,"

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:13.100 align:middle line:90%
God comes through us as us.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.090 align:middle line:90%
What a revelation.

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:19.886 align:middle line:90%


00:39:19.886 --> 00:39:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Back in my macrobiotic
days, Michio Kushi

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.440 align:middle line:84%
used to say to be
present in the here

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:32.440 align:middle line:84%
and now, one must eat what
is grown in the here and now.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
like a Brandywine tomato

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:42.070 align:middle line:84%
grown in your own backyard and
picked at the peak of ripeness.

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:43.870 align:middle line:90%
This is gourmet food.

00:39:43.870 --> 00:39:45.200 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:49.240 align:middle line:84%
The stuff that is grown right
then and eaten right then.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:52.420 align:middle line:84%
First of all, it is very,
very high in nutrients.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:58.630 align:middle line:84%
The nutrient amount starts to
decline the moment it's picked.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:00.490 align:middle line:90%
But the life energy--

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:03.400 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, Gary
Schwartz down in Tucson

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.010 align:middle line:84%
has actually shown
the life energy

00:40:06.010 --> 00:40:08.800 align:middle line:84%
that fruits and
vegetables emit as light.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.480 align:middle line:90%
You can see it.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.760 align:middle line:90%
You can document it in the lab.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.040 align:middle line:90%
The light is much greater.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.360 align:middle line:84%
The chi, the life force,
the energy of that tomato

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.350 align:middle line:84%
is perfection when
it's just been picked.

00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:25.810 align:middle line:90%
So food tastes better that way.

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.170 align:middle line:90%
It's higher in nutrient value.

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.760 align:middle line:84%
There is no fossil fuels that
are consumed or very little.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:33.880 align:middle line:84%
OK, if you drive the truck
from the local organic farm

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:37.180 align:middle line:84%
five miles to the
farmer's market,

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.540 align:middle line:84%
that's very different
from cultivating

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.840 align:middle line:84%
acres and acres of
organic food in China,

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and then shipping it
all over the world,

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:49.240 align:middle line:84%
and making it in China
because the labor is cheap.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Also, there is the
food security issue.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:57.220 align:middle line:84%
What if here in Maine the
main highway into the state,

00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:01.150 align:middle line:84%
route 95, suddenly
became impassable?

00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:02.680 align:middle line:90%
What would happen to our food?

00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:07.390 align:middle line:84%
I was just at the airport to
go to Florida, and we sat down.

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I was very excited because we
got to the airport restaurant

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.990 align:middle line:90%
in time for breakfast.

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:15.460 align:middle line:84%
Normally, it's closed for
breakfast when we get there.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.120 align:middle line:84%
Guy comes over to the table
and says, I have to tell you,

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:21.200 align:middle line:90%
we have no eggs.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.000 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.920 align:middle line:90%
You have no eggs?

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.970 align:middle line:90%
The truck didn't come.

00:41:27.970 --> 00:41:32.020 align:middle line:84%
So that means that this
restaurant had no eggs.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:36.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, if something happened to
the transportation system--

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.850 align:middle line:84%
a terrorist attack or
anything, suddenly, you

00:41:39.850 --> 00:41:40.840 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't have food.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.040 align:middle line:90%
People would starve.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:46.060 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, if you've
got people keeping chickens

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:50.500 align:middle line:84%
in their backyard, or you're
supporting local organic farms,

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.620 align:middle line:84%
and arable land around
your population centers

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:55.860 align:middle line:84%
is being used to
produce food, or food

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:59.590 align:middle line:84%
is produced on the roofs of
buildings in New York City,

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.100 align:middle line:84%
you have food security,
but it tastes better.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And it has higher
nutrient levels.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:09.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a completely
win-win situation.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And also what you
would do is you

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:15.220 align:middle line:84%
would create jobs and
a food infrastructure

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:19.870 align:middle line:84%
for every area of the country
having its own indigenous food

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.430 align:middle line:90%
supply.

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:24.730 align:middle line:84%
That would be so much
better on every level

00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:28.270 align:middle line:84%
for the planet itself and
human beings in particular.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's really
where we have to go.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Because it's ideal
for everyone involved.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:38.770 align:middle line:84%
There's no downside except for
these huge agri-business food

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:43.570 align:middle line:84%
suppliers that want to sell
cheap, high-glycemic food

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:44.780 align:middle line:90%
all over the planet.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's probably
a place for that,

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:48.310 align:middle line:90%
so that people don't starve.

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And I'm talking about an ideal,
a vision to which we're all

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:53.710 align:middle line:90%
going--

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:54.877 align:middle line:90%
what we're all going toward.

00:42:54.877 --> 00:42:57.980 align:middle line:84%
But in Maine where we have
a very short growing season,

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.460 align:middle line:84%
if we can do as well as
we've been doing here,

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.020 align:middle line:84%
there's no excuse
for anyone else.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:08.477 align:middle line:90%


00:43:08.477 --> 00:43:09.560 align:middle line:90%
It's an interesting thing.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.770 align:middle line:90%
We think about vanity.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.050 align:middle line:90%
You want to look good.

00:43:14.050 --> 00:43:19.030 align:middle line:84%
But the truth is that we
are programmed as a species

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.620 align:middle line:84%
to be attracted to the
people who look good.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:22.420 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.280 align:middle line:84%
Because they're the
healthiest ones.

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.640 align:middle line:84%
As Jorge Cruise points
out, the hourglass figure

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:29.855 align:middle line:84%
with the small waist
and so on-- this

00:43:29.855 --> 00:43:31.480 align:middle line:84%
is what men are
naturally attracted to.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.790 align:middle line:84%
That's a healthier person
to have babies with.

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.000 align:middle line:90%
So let's take vanity.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.920 align:middle line:90%
It's a very good entry way.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Because your skin looks better
when you're eating a diet

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.705 align:middle line:84%
that is low glycemic where
the blood sugar is stable.

00:43:45.705 --> 00:43:47.830 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, that's
one of the first things

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:49.120 align:middle line:90%
that happens.

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.040 align:middle line:84%
Your skin, your hair, your
nails begin to look better.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.370 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
that I personally

00:43:54.370 --> 00:43:58.480 align:middle line:84%
stopped eating so many grains
and high-glycemic foods

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:01.340 align:middle line:84%
is over the years, I
noticed a couple things.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:04.750 align:middle line:84%
First of all, there was weight
gain every year, a little more.

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And every year, harder
and harder to keep off.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:10.420 align:middle line:84%
Second, me and my
patients all started

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.960 align:middle line:84%
to have fingernails that
broke, hair that broke,

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.650 align:middle line:84%
and skin that was getting all
red, and broken blood vessels,

00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:19.330 align:middle line:90%
and all of that stuff.

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:22.540 align:middle line:84%
When you eat well,
that goes away.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.850 align:middle line:84%
My daughter was
on a sea semester.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:26.020 align:middle line:90%
So she's out at sea for--

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:27.603 align:middle line:84%
I don't know-- two
months on the ship.

00:44:27.603 --> 00:44:31.560 align:middle line:84%
And she ate no sugar on
purpose, and was exercising,

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.920 align:middle line:90%
and in the fresh air.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:35.080 align:middle line:84%
So never had to worry
about her weight.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Hair and nails looked better
than ever in her entire life.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And it was all because she was
in a controlled environment

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:44.500 align:middle line:90%
called a sailing vessel.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.630 align:middle line:84%
And there was nowhere
to go except for health.

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And she avoided all the
cookies that the cook made.

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:55.540 align:middle line:84%
So let me just say from the
point of view of looking good.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.745 align:middle line:84%
Nothing looks better
than health and fitness.

00:44:58.745 --> 00:44:59.545 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:44:59.545 --> 00:45:06.150 align:middle line:90%


00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:08.250 align:middle line:84%
We hear a lot these
days of-- there's

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:12.050 align:middle line:84%
a thing in my profession
called anti-aging medicine.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And I have a good friend
who is a doctor, who's 90.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:16.530 align:middle line:90%
And she gets up on a podium.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.758 align:middle line:84%
And she goes,
anti-aging medicine.

00:45:18.758 --> 00:45:19.800 align:middle line:90%
What are you going to do?

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.910 align:middle line:90%
I'm 90.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.680 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we
begin to age the minute

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:24.360 align:middle line:90%
we come out of the womb.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But the question is,
how are we going to age?

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.750 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the baby boom
generation, the largest

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:33.870 align:middle line:84%
and richest demographic
on the planet right now,

00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:36.600 align:middle line:84%
you see that it splits
into two groups--

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:40.110 align:middle line:84%
those who are getting fatter and
more and more chronically ill

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:42.940 align:middle line:84%
and those who are doing
better than they've ever done.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:47.280 align:middle line:84%
And you can begin to see the
effects of lifestyle writ

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.440 align:middle line:90%
large at about the age of 50.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.310 align:middle line:84%
That's when you come to a
crossroads-- grow or die.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:54.900 align:middle line:90%
And the choice is yours.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:46:00.500 align:middle line:84%
Nobody is going to stay well and
be happy and healthy if they're

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.250 align:middle line:84%
not fit, if they're
not physically active.

00:46:02.250 --> 00:46:05.930 align:middle line:84%
If you want to be around and
walking at the age of 80,

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.200 align:middle line:90%
you've got to get moving.

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Because the muscles, and
joints, and all of that,

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and the fascia, which is a tight
sweater-like connective tissue

00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:20.460 align:middle line:84%
encasement of the whole
body is actually a crystal.

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.945 align:middle line:90%
It's a crystalline matrix.

00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:25.680 align:middle line:84%
And it's a electromagnetic
field where

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.170 align:middle line:84%
something that
happens in your foot

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:30.270 align:middle line:84%
goes right up to the
top of your head.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And what happens with life,
life tends to wear you down.

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And people get like this, this
tighter, tighter, tighter,

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:39.420 align:middle line:90%
shorter, shorter, shorter.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And all of that is
completely optional

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:49.200 align:middle line:84%
once you learn that you must
use this body throughout life.

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you study those-- what
are called Blue Zones where

00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.332 align:middle line:84%
people live a long time,
they're all active.

00:46:55.332 --> 00:46:56.790 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
they do is they

00:46:56.790 --> 00:47:00.030 align:middle line:84%
don't assume that,
OK, now that I'm 50,

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:02.145 align:middle line:84%
I won't be able to
do thus and such.

00:47:02.145 --> 00:47:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Or they don't talk
themselves into it.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm astounded by the
differences in people.

00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:12.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that we take a
group of people who are 60.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.030 align:middle line:90%
Some are 60 going on 35.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:17.250 align:middle line:90%
And some are 60 going on 90.

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.410 align:middle line:84%
But understand that
your chronological age

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and your biologic age can
be completely different.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:26.640 align:middle line:84%
Starting at about the age of
30, you see this sort out.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.700 align:middle line:84%
A tremendous amount has to
do with the way you think.

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.920 align:middle line:84%
So studies have been
done, particularly one

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:36.810 align:middle line:84%
by Becca Levy who was at Yale at
the time, who found that people

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:40.860 align:middle line:84%
who believed that getting older
was associated with getting

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:44.330 align:middle line:84%
more astute with positive
aspects of aging,

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:48.630 align:middle line:84%
more astute, useful,
wise, and so on.

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.580 align:middle line:84%
People who believed
this, who had

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:54.810 align:middle line:84%
positive beliefs about
aging added seven years

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:56.340 align:middle line:90%
to their lives.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:00.330 align:middle line:84%
They controlled for weight,
blood pressure, meds, smoking,

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:03.137 align:middle line:90%
alcohol, obesity, exercise.

00:48:03.137 --> 00:48:04.470 align:middle line:90%
They controlled for all of that.

00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:07.830 align:middle line:84%
The belief itself added
seven years to their life.

00:48:07.830 --> 00:48:10.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, imagine if you
have the belief,

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.360 align:middle line:84%
but then you also stay
physically active.

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:16.420 align:middle line:84%
So my mother went to
Everest Base Camp last May--

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.220 align:middle line:90%
age 84.

00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.710 align:middle line:84%
We think she's the
oldest person--

00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:22.020 align:middle line:84%
woman to ever make it
to Everest Base Camp.

00:48:22.020 --> 00:48:25.050 align:middle line:84%
I personally never want
to do a trek like that.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Because it looked
so grueling that--

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:31.750 align:middle line:84%
but she had a dream of trekking
in Nepal her whole life.

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So for her, it was
the fulfillment

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:34.740 align:middle line:90%
of a lifelong dream.

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:38.220 align:middle line:84%
In her 60s, she did the
entire Appalachian Trail.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.710 align:middle line:84%
In her 70s, she climbed
all of the hundred highest

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:42.140 align:middle line:90%
peaks in New England.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:45.000 align:middle line:90%
This is her idea of pleasure.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.070 align:middle line:90%
And she was following a dream.

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:49.680 align:middle line:90%
We all have these dreams.

00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.620 align:middle line:84%
But the dream has to
involve moving your body.

00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And we even have studies
in the very, very old--

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.370 align:middle line:84%
done by a guy named
Bill Evans, where

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:03.570 align:middle line:84%
they went into nursing
homes and took 92-year-olds

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.880 align:middle line:84%
and had them develop their
quads and all of that.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And he found that
they learned how

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:11.670 align:middle line:84%
to get up, go to the
bathroom by themselves.

00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:14.790 align:middle line:84%
They really did add strength
and relatively quickly.

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:16.710 align:middle line:84%
Do you know who they
had the problem with?

00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:18.310 align:middle line:90%
The staff.

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the staff
believed, we're

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:22.700 align:middle line:84%
here to help these
decrepit, old people.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:26.130 align:middle line:84%
And they enabled them to
stay decrepit and old.

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:27.250 align:middle line:90%
So let me just say this.

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:30.600 align:middle line:84%
If you have aging parents
and you're watching this,

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.020 align:middle line:84%
don't allow them to get into
that old, decrepit mindset,

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:36.360 align:middle line:90%
because you enable them.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:39.390 align:middle line:84%
It's like people who say
to their mother, mom,

00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:41.250 align:middle line:90%
you can't do that alone.

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:43.500 align:middle line:84%
You shouldn't drive
into the city alone.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.360 align:middle line:90%
You're 65.

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:50.010 align:middle line:84%
My mother just got into her
camper, which is 35 feet long,

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:51.990 align:middle line:90%
to go out to Arizona.

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:52.890 align:middle line:90%
She's 85.

00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:55.890 align:middle line:84%
She's going with her
best friend who's 87.

00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:57.330 align:middle line:90%
They're really good together.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:59.915 align:middle line:84%
One does the navigating, and
the other does the driving.

00:49:59.915 --> 00:50:03.580 align:middle line:84%
My mother can back that thing
up as well as she ever did.

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Because she kept
using those faculties.

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.100 align:middle line:90%
And we know this.

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:12.300 align:middle line:84%
The hippocampus of the brain,
which is the memory center,

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:16.680 align:middle line:84%
keeps adding cells
your entire life.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:19.470 align:middle line:84%
We have had very faulty
research on aging.

00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And we're finding that
there's this thing called

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:25.530 align:middle line:84%
neuroplasticity,
which is that you

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.060 align:middle line:90%
continue to add brain cells.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.890 align:middle line:90%
You continue to mold your brain.

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:31.140 align:middle line:84%
You continue to
add new connections

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:34.007 align:middle line:90%
for your entire life.

00:50:34.007 --> 00:50:36.090 align:middle line:84%
So you want to learn to
play a musical instrument?

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:36.510 align:middle line:90%
Fine.

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:36.900 align:middle line:90%
Start.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.983 align:middle line:90%
I don't care if you're 80.

00:50:37.983 --> 00:50:39.460 align:middle line:90%
You want to learn how to dance?

00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:40.260 align:middle line:90%
Start.

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:41.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't care if you're 80.

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.050 align:middle line:90%
Just begin it.

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:46.560 align:middle line:84%
Because the body is
capable of far more than

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:47.820 align:middle line:90%
you ever believed.

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.160 align:middle line:84%
I remember listening to
Deepak Chopra years ago.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And he said, we would never get
old, decrepit, and all of that,

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:57.045 align:middle line:84%
except that we watch
other people doing it.

00:50:57.045 --> 00:50:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And because we're
herd creatures,

00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.990 align:middle line:84%
we think that's what
we should be doing.

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:03.180 align:middle line:84%
In families, check
out the people

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.100 align:middle line:84%
who are the black
sheep of the family.

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:08.340 align:middle line:84%
They never get the same diseases
as the rest of the family.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.420 align:middle line:90%
And you ask if--

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:11.940 align:middle line:84%
so I had a patient who
said, well, my sister

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.110 align:middle line:90%
had a hysterectomy.

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:14.280 align:middle line:90%
We all have hysterectomies.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.830 align:middle line:84%
By the age of 50, that's "what
we do," except for Susan.

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:18.900 align:middle line:90%
She's the black sheep.

00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.190 align:middle line:90%
She's not like us.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:21.000 align:middle line:90%
That's funny.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.390 align:middle line:84%
Susan has the same
DNA, same family.

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Just decided she was
going to be the crab

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.175 align:middle line:90%
that got out of the bucket.

00:51:29.175 --> 00:51:31.440 align:middle line:90%
That's what you need to do.

00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.200 align:middle line:84%
Be the crab that gets
out of the bucket

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:35.660 align:middle line:90%
and does something different.

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll find
that you have the ability

00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:40.260 align:middle line:90%
to reinvent yourself.

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:41.760 align:middle line:84%
By the way, every
cell in the body

00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:44.490 align:middle line:90%
is replaced every seven years.

00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:46.860 align:middle line:84%
And the only reason why we
keep getting the same thing

00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.180 align:middle line:84%
is we're thinking
the same thoughts

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.388 align:middle line:90%
and doing the same behaviors.

00:51:49.388 --> 00:51:51.420 align:middle line:84%
But you're never
older than seven.

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.160 align:middle line:90%
And it's never too late.

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can always
reinvent yourself.

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.640 align:middle line:90%
And one more thing.

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.050 align:middle line:84%
There are documented cases
of spontaneous remission

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:04.410 align:middle line:90%
from every known disease.

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So there's no such
thing as false hope.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.750 align:middle line:90%
There is only false "no hope."

00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:11.520 align:middle line:90%
There's always hope.

00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.645 align:middle line:90%
And that's biology.

00:52:12.645 --> 00:52:18.846 align:middle line:90%


00:52:18.846 --> 00:52:20.210 align:middle line:90%
Thyroid disease.

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:23.900 align:middle line:84%
So many women have some
kind of thyroid problem.

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:26.600 align:middle line:84%
And I want to address
this holistically.

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:30.110 align:middle line:84%
First of all, over the
last 30 years or so,

00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:34.460 align:middle line:84%
they have replaced iodides in
bread-making with bromides.

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.370 align:middle line:84%
Bromides are a halogen.
Chlorine in the water

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:40.190 align:middle line:84%
is a halogen. Fluoride in
the water is a halogen.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.050 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
halogens-- if you

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:44.870 align:middle line:84%
look at the periodic table
of elements in chemistry,

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:49.100 align:middle line:84%
you will see that iodine,
which is absolutely necessary

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:53.150 align:middle line:84%
for full thyroid function, and
by the way, for breast health

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:58.790 align:middle line:84%
and for ovarian health,
that these halogens actually

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:01.615 align:middle line:84%
displace the iodine
from the cells.

00:53:01.615 --> 00:53:07.010 align:middle line:84%
So we have in many places
in the world a deficiency

00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:12.560 align:middle line:84%
or at least a sub-optimal
level of iodine in the diet

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.530 align:middle line:90%
and in the body.

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, I'd like
to make the distinction

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:17.900 align:middle line:84%
between gross deficiency
disease, which

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.910 align:middle line:90%
in iodine would be a goiter.

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:25.190 align:middle line:84%
This is big thyroid
tumor and constant breast

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:29.660 align:middle line:84%
pain, which would be because of
sub-optimal levels of iodine.

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:34.730 align:middle line:84%
By the way, breast tissue
actively sequesters iodine.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And one of the ways
for anyone listening

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:40.940 align:middle line:84%
who has that "misnomer
fibrocystic breast disease,"

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:42.590 align:middle line:90%
start taking kelp tablets.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:43.550 align:middle line:90%
You'll get rid of it.

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:45.980 align:middle line:84%
So iodine is very,
very important

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.580 align:middle line:84%
for the health of the thyroid
and the health of breasts.

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:51.710 align:middle line:84%
And it's the first thing
I would give to a woman

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:54.530 align:middle line:84%
who's been diagnosed
with thyroid problems

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:57.748 align:middle line:84%
or who thinks that she might
have a thyroid problem.

00:53:57.748 --> 00:53:58.790 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's what happens.

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:03.650 align:middle line:84%
When women begin to first
take increased iodine,

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:07.200 align:middle line:84%
all those toxic halogens
come up out of their cells.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.020 align:middle line:90%
They get a skin rash, usually.

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.070 align:middle line:90%
And what do they say?

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:11.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm "allergic to iodine."

00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:12.620 align:middle line:90%
That's not it.

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:15.120 align:middle line:90%
They're detoxing their body.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.560 align:middle line:90%
And so that often happens.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is when you do
thyroid function test, the TSH,

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:21.620 align:middle line:90%
thyroid-stimulating hormone--

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.900 align:middle line:90%
needs to be less than 3.

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:29.120 align:middle line:84%
And in many of the labs, the
indices for thyroid for TSH

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.330 align:middle line:90%
are too high.

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So the woman will actually have
sub-clinical hypothyroidism.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:40.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you really know that
it needs to be less than 3,

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.960 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
start treating it.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.180 align:middle line:84%
But the way to treat
it is not necessarily

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:46.250 align:middle line:90%
with synthetic thyroid.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:48.150 align:middle line:90%
Start treating it holistically.

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:49.470 align:middle line:90%
And then one more thing.

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:51.410 align:middle line:90%
There is the iodide thing.

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:53.390 align:middle line:90%
But then there's-- what is this?

00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:54.950 align:middle line:90%
It's the fifth chakra.

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:56.300 align:middle line:90%
It's your voice.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.230 align:middle line:90%
It's having your say.

00:54:58.230 --> 00:55:02.510 align:middle line:84%
For 5,000 years,
the feminine voice

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:05.030 align:middle line:90%
has been actively squelched.

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:07.290 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful quote
from physicist John Wheeler

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:08.090 align:middle line:90%
that I love.

00:55:08.090 --> 00:55:09.005 align:middle line:90%
And it's this.

00:55:09.005 --> 00:55:12.440 align:middle line:84%
"Masculinity expresses
the idea that there

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:15.020 align:middle line:90%
are things worth dying for.

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:18.230 align:middle line:84%
Femininity expresses
the idea that there

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:21.340 align:middle line:90%
are things worth living for."

00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening
now on planet

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.615 align:middle line:84%
Earth is the feminine energy
in men and women is rising.

00:55:26.615 --> 00:55:27.740 align:middle line:90%
How many wars can we fight?

00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:31.310 align:middle line:84%
How many people who don't
agree with us can we kill?

00:55:31.310 --> 00:55:34.220 align:middle line:84%
We realized through the
internet, which is probably

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:37.070 align:middle line:84%
what changed Egyptian
politics, was

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:42.050 align:middle line:84%
Facebook, that we are in
fact one small planet.

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And we can't be killing off
everything that we don't want.

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So the feminine
values are rising up.

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:51.260 align:middle line:90%
And what do women do?

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Women are the ones
typically who do

00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:56.450 align:middle line:84%
the birthday parties,
the celebrations,

00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:59.900 align:middle line:84%
making things pretty,
putting the little note

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:03.920 align:middle line:84%
in the lunchbox, things
worth living for.

00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Dancing, pleasure, love,
color, wanting to look good

00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:09.950 align:middle line:90%
on your skin and your hair.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Nothing wrong with
the feminine values.

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:16.310 align:middle line:84%
But when you have
said as a woman--

00:56:16.310 --> 00:56:20.750 align:middle line:84%
for most have written human
history what you thought--

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:23.000 align:middle line:90%
it didn't go over too well.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And so many women have squelched
their own voice for fear

00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:31.190 align:middle line:84%
that they would be
killed, or for fear

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:33.620 align:middle line:84%
that they would be shunned,
or that they would be alone.

00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:37.550 align:middle line:84%
That if I have my say and I
really say what I'm thinking,

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:39.690 align:middle line:90%
I'll be alone.

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:41.690 align:middle line:84%
And because we need each
other and because we're

00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:45.900 align:middle line:84%
a tribe culture and
a tribe species,

00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:47.630 align:middle line:90%
we don't want to risk that.

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:50.180 align:middle line:84%
So we have squelched
what we want to say.

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:52.340 align:middle line:90%
What are canker sores?

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:54.110 align:middle line:90%
Aphthous ulcers.

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:56.240 align:middle line:84%
They're things that you
don't feel you can say.

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.860 align:middle line:90%
It's an autoimmune disease.

00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:01.400 align:middle line:84%
It's where your mouth tissue
and the mucosal membrane

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.400 align:middle line:84%
actually eats your
own mucosal membrane.

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Fifth chakra-- having
your say, and knowing when

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:09.560 align:middle line:90%
to say it, how loud to say it.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:12.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's timing issues as well.

00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:14.488 align:middle line:84%
How many people
always run around?

00:57:14.488 --> 00:57:15.530 align:middle line:90%
I don't have enough time.

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:17.225 align:middle line:90%
I'm running out of time.

00:57:17.225 --> 00:57:20.090 align:middle line:84%
It affects the thyroid,
that sense of timing.

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So you need to change
your relationship to time,

00:57:22.850 --> 00:57:28.290 align:middle line:84%
take kelp tablets, have your
say when it is appropriate

00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:29.150 align:middle line:90%
and in a loving way.

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:32.500 align:middle line:90%
