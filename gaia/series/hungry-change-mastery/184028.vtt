00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:23.820 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> I was born in Uruguay.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.860 align:middle line:84%
And when I was born there,
there were no supermarkets.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.440 align:middle line:84%
My father and I used
to walk every Tuesday

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.330 align:middle line:90%
to the local farmer's market.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.780 align:middle line:84%
And he knew who to
buy the tomatoes from

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.660 align:middle line:84%
but bought the cucumbers
in a different place

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.070 align:middle line:84%
because he knew
the guy took much

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.298 align:middle line:90%
better care of the cucumbers.

00:00:42.298 --> 00:00:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And he used to talk to
everybody, know everybody.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way we
used to obtain our food.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.620 align:middle line:84%
So by default, I was in a
really, really healthy state.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.580 align:middle line:84%
I was-- I never suffered of
any diseases, any symptoms.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.285 align:middle line:90%
I was doing really well.

00:00:58.285 --> 00:00:59.160 align:middle line:90%
And I was exercising.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.040 align:middle line:90%
I was a black belt in Taekwondo.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.780 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I moved to New
York, hectic work schedule,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
eating from hospital cafeterias,
nurses potlucks, which

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.250 align:middle line:84%
are probably the worst
thing that I've ever seen,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.700 align:middle line:84%
and vending machines
or supermarkets, right.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Putting my food
in microwave ovens

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.080 align:middle line:84%
so that I could spend
little time preparing

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.270 align:middle line:90%
the food and more time working.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And I started getting sick.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.510 align:middle line:84%
I started getting pain in
my abdomen every time I ate,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.690 align:middle line:84%
which later was diagnosed
as irritable bowel syndrome.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.120 align:middle line:84%
I started suffering from
terrible allergies that,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.780 align:middle line:84%
at times, needed prednisone
and all kinds of inhalers

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.700 align:middle line:90%
and puffers and creams.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And the worst part
of it, which is

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.790 align:middle line:84%
when I started
looking for help is

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.690 align:middle line:84%
when I started waking
with this sense of dread,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.730 align:middle line:84%
this sense of doom, which
was later on diagnosed

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.440 align:middle line:90%
as depression, right.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, the incredible thing is
that the three specialists

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:84%
that I went to, a
gastroenterologist,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.520 align:middle line:84%
an allergist, and a
psychiatrist, none of them

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.160 align:middle line:90%
asked me what I was eating.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And they just gave
me medications.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.290 align:middle line:84%
They were chemicals
designed to thwart, to stop,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
the symptoms that I was showing,
which, now, I understand

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.640 align:middle line:84%
as the way that my body
expresses its attempt

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.100 align:middle line:90%
to adapt and survive, right?

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So basically, my body
was trying to survive.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And these medications were just
shutting my body off, making

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.280 align:middle line:90%
the situation even worse.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.810 align:middle line:90%
That didn't work for me.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.830 align:middle line:90%
So I took off.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.940 align:middle line:84%
And I traveled to India
and studied different types

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.590 align:middle line:84%
of healing modalities and
was exposed to many things

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.000 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.680 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't until I arrived
in California in the year 2000

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and I found this
cleansing and detox

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.550 align:middle line:84%
center that I got rid of
all my symptoms completely.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, the most incredible
thing was that,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.020 align:middle line:84%
after my 14 day cleansing
and detox program

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:22.920 align:middle line:84%
that I did for the
first time, the reason

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.320 align:middle line:84%
that people stopped me the
most around in the hospital

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:84%
and everywhere I went is because
I looked 10 years younger.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.780 align:middle line:90%
I felt 10 years younger.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.580 align:middle line:90%
I looked better.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.580 align:middle line:90%
My eyes were white.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.960 align:middle line:90%
My skin was glowing.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.990 align:middle line:84%
And that was what
attracted people

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.320 align:middle line:84%
to wanting to do whatever it is
that I did so that they could

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.330 align:middle line:90%
get the same results.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.130 align:middle line:84%
Well, I went into
medicine to begin

00:03:51.130 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:84%
with because I had this born
desire and impulse to help.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.140 align:middle line:84%
But after I went through
disease and suffering myself,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.970 align:middle line:90%
that was multiplied by 10.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:14.650 align:middle line:84%
So my day is made when I see
somebody that was suffering

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and whose life was diminished
because of a disease

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.910 align:middle line:84%
and I am able to help them
create the conditions so

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.600 align:middle line:84%
that their body recovers
their natural ability to heal

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.960 align:middle line:90%
themselves.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.635 align:middle line:84%
And when you see
that, it's like,

00:04:31.635 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when people like
plants and you go on a trip

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.390 align:middle line:84%
and they come back and
the plant is withering,

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.760 align:middle line:90%
and you just drop some water.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you come the next
morning and it's green again,

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
it gives you a
sense of pleasure.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.960 align:middle line:90%
This is what I thrive on.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
Detoxification is important
because we are in what

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:90%
I call an evolutionary glitch.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.210 align:middle line:90%
As we evolved.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.010 align:middle line:84%
We became more toxic
because we are eating things

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.900 align:middle line:90%
with a lot of chemicals.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.250 align:middle line:84%
And there's chemicals in our
atmosphere, in our homes,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.050 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.070 align:middle line:90%
So toxicity is going up.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
But the function of the
detoxification systems

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.780 align:middle line:84%
is going down because,
as we eat more,

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.970 align:middle line:84%
there is less
detoxification happening.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.820 align:middle line:84%
So this is an
evolutionary glitch

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:84%
because it should be
the other way around.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
As toxicity increases,
our detox systems

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:90%
should be allowed and supported.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.800 align:middle line:84%
And this is completely
the contrary.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.865 align:middle line:84%
And this evolutionary glitch
may kill all humanity.

00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:43.050 align:middle line:90%


00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:84%
All the chemicals
that we are using

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.450 align:middle line:84%
for preserving foods,
for coloring foods,

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
for making them smell good,
for making them taste good--

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%
but not only that, chemicals
are used for so many things,

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.550 align:middle line:90%
for cleaning, for washing.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.900 align:middle line:84%
These chemicals of
modern life that

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.090 align:middle line:84%
are supposed to
make our life easier

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:90%
are actually ruining our health.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.280 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.670 align:middle line:84%
The problem of
toxicity is not only

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.030 align:middle line:84%
because of the chemicals
of modern life.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Even if you eat completely
organic and pure and healthy

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.310 align:middle line:84%
food, but you eat it in
the wrong quantities,

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.700 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong frequencies, and
in the wrong combinations,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.040 align:middle line:90%
that is also toxic.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.550 align:middle line:84%
So the problem of
toxicity is way

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.393 align:middle line:84%
more than just the
chemicals around.

00:06:39.393 --> 00:06:40.560 align:middle line:90%
It's a problem of lifestyle.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:90%
It's a problem of habits.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a problem of man having
separated himself and herself

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:84%
from the way that nature
designed things to do.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
According to nature's design, we
should be naked under the sun,

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.028 align:middle line:84%
running around,
looking for food,

00:06:57.028 --> 00:06:58.570 align:middle line:84%
and mating every
now and then, right?

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.950 align:middle line:90%
That's what animals do.

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And animals in the
wild barely get sick.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.750 align:middle line:84%
Or if they get
sick, they recover.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:08.030 align:middle line:84%
They stop doing
what they're doing.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.490 align:middle line:90%
They fast for a bit.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:10.510 align:middle line:90%
They drink only water.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:11.310 align:middle line:90%
They rest.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:84%
And they recover, right,
because their body

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:84%
has a natural ability
to heal itself,

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.320 align:middle line:90%
just like human beings do.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.560 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that human
beings' natural ability

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.300 align:middle line:84%
to heal themselves is
hindered by the way we eat

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.200 align:middle line:90%
and the way we live.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.250 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.620 align:middle line:84%
I think we're barking up
the wrong tree, you know.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.710 align:middle line:84%
People are looking for a
result that is superficial.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.640 align:middle line:84%
They're looking
just to look good.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.210 align:middle line:84%
And they don't really
consider that that could

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.510 align:middle line:90%
be done from the inside out.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:84%
So people go into diets
and in all these fads

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.880 align:middle line:84%
in order to lose weight
and lose weight fast.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's just not
the way to approach it.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:90%
The results prove it.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:06.340 align:middle line:90%


00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.790 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that we are
not eating food anymore.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.150 align:middle line:90%
We are eating foodlike products.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.780 align:middle line:90%
And they are adorned.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.860 align:middle line:84%
They are made-- look
better and smell better

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and be presented so that
people are attracted to them.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, they
are also made so that they

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.520 align:middle line:90%
can have a long shelf life.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.520 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, the supermarket
would be losing money

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.710 align:middle line:90%
and the manufacturers as well.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:36.690 align:middle line:84%
So the objective is not really
to give you a healthy product.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:41.370 align:middle line:84%
It's to give you a product
that will make you buy it,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:90%
that will last long.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.267 align:middle line:84%
And it will make a lot
of profit for the company

00:08:45.267 --> 00:08:46.100 align:middle line:90%
that's producing it.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.642 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.642 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:84%
The products come in some kind
of container, a bag, a jar,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.440 align:middle line:90%
a tube, a can, a bottle.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is definitely not
the way nature designed things

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:90%
and provided food for us.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.910 align:middle line:84%
So things are
skewed a little bit.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.230 align:middle line:90%
Now, America loves enemies.

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And America chooses an enemy
and deploys all its forces

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.230 align:middle line:90%
against it.

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.800 align:middle line:84%
So at some point, when we were
noticing that we were getting

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:24.060 align:middle line:84%
fat as a population,
we attacked-- we made--

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:90%
the enemy was fat.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.870 align:middle line:84%
And everything became
fat free, fat free this,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:29.670 align:middle line:90%
and fat free that.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And the calories that
fat were occupying

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.750 align:middle line:84%
were replaced by
mostly carbohydrates.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:84%
That resulted in the fattest
country in the world.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.160 align:middle line:84%
So now we kind of came
in to that conclusion.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And we shifted enemies,
making carbohydrates enemies.

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And all these high protein,
low carbohydrate diets

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.970 align:middle line:90%
came into fashion.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:84%
And what these do is
a whole different--

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
they give a whole
different consequence

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.140 align:middle line:84%
of problems, a whole
different family of problems,

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:90%
as a consequence.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:84%
For example, proteins
are made of amino acid.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Amino acid-- ammonia and
another acid terminal.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:23.100 align:middle line:84%
So when you digest amino acids,
you become acidic in a way.

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:84%
And high protein, low
carbohydrate diets basically

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
are acidifying diets, which
end up irritating arteries

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.970 align:middle line:84%
and increase coronary
artery disease and all

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:34.845 align:middle line:90%
the chronic diseases.

00:10:34.845 --> 00:10:39.890 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:43.280 align:middle line:84%
High protein, low
carbohydrate diets basically,

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:47.690 align:middle line:84%
without people knowing, are
putting them into the state

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.020 align:middle line:84%
that decompensated
diabetics get into when

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.300 align:middle line:84%
they lack insulin, which
is the ketonic, or keto

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.030 align:middle line:90%
acidotic state.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:84%
It throws people
into ketoacidosis.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is a diseased state.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.940 align:middle line:84%
But by some people,
it was observed

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.450 align:middle line:84%
that these, the keto
acidotic diabetics,

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:84%
are the leanest
people in the world.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.110 align:middle line:84%
So in order to
recreate that result,

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.310 align:middle line:84%
they didn't mind putting people
in that state of sickness,

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.110 align:middle line:90%
of disease.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:30.340 align:middle line:84%
The chemicals of modern life
are usually named, generally,

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.750 align:middle line:90%
as xenobionics.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:35.050 align:middle line:84%
These are just molecules
that we put in our food,

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.980 align:middle line:84%
in our atmosphere, in
order to make life easier.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.670 align:middle line:84%
These chemicals, as
they go into your blood,

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:84%
first, they kill the good
bacteria in your gut.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.550 align:middle line:84%
And they damage the
gut wall, irritate

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:52.760 align:middle line:84%
the immune system, 80% of
which is around your gut.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.040 align:middle line:84%
They also deplete
the nervous system,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.470 align:middle line:90%
the brain around your gut.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
We have a brain around the gut
that is bigger in size and way

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.480 align:middle line:84%
bigger in activity than
the brain in your skull.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And at any given time,
for a healthy person,

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
the brain in your gut should
be producing about 90%

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:90%
of your serotonin.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.890 align:middle line:84%
And this production is
damaged, is hindered

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.870 align:middle line:90%
by all these chemicals.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.770 align:middle line:84%
But that is not where the
damage of these chemicals stop.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.530 align:middle line:84%
These chemicals then go
circulate in your blood.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Many of them are irritant.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:28.960 align:middle line:90%
They're oxygenate.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.870 align:middle line:84%
That's why antioxidants are
so good during cleansing

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and detoxification
and life in general.

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.580 align:middle line:90%
And they irritate the tissues.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And the body has two defending
itself, which are generic ways.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:45.220 align:middle line:84%
One of them is the
body produces mucus

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:50.710 align:middle line:84%
to coat these chemicals so that
they buffer the irritation.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:57.560 align:middle line:84%
Or it retains or even generates
more fat because, as we said,

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.742 align:middle line:84%
most of these chemicals are
lipophilic, or fat loving.

00:13:01.742 --> 00:13:02.950 align:middle line:90%
They don't dissolve in water.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.090 align:middle line:90%
They dissolve in fat.

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:05.740 align:middle line:90%
So they attach to fat.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you just sweat
it off and force the body

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:13.390 align:middle line:84%
into burning fat
without creating

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:16.360 align:middle line:84%
the conditions for the
body to be able to cleanse

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.510 align:middle line:84%
and detoxify and neutralize
and make these chemicals

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.440 align:middle line:84%
water soluble so that it can
be sweat it off and peed off--

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.350 align:middle line:84%
so you're burning
fat but not really

00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.760 align:middle line:90%
getting rid of the toxins--

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
these toxins are left
to cause the damage

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.630 align:middle line:84%
that they were not
causing because they

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.340 align:middle line:90%
were surrounded by fat.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And so you're forcing something
that the body's trying to do.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.670 align:middle line:84%
You're forcing against
the body's will.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.710 align:middle line:84%
The body's retaining
fat and even

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:47.560 align:middle line:84%
generating fat in
order to defend itself

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.270 align:middle line:84%
against the irritating
consequence of these chemicals.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.340 align:middle line:84%
But you are saying, no,
that's not what we need to do.

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:57.790 align:middle line:84%
I want to burn it out
because I want to look good.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And the toxins are free,
then, to cause havoc.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:05.540 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:84%
These chemicals grow
into your blood.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:10.880 align:middle line:84%
After killing the good
bacteria, after damaging

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.420 align:middle line:84%
your intestinal wall, after
irritating your immune system

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:84%
and depleting your nervous
system, they start circulating.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:23.150 align:middle line:84%
The body detects this
irritation and either generates

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.370 align:middle line:90%
mucus or fat.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Mucus surrounds or
coats these chemicals

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and then sticks to
tissues and cells.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.330 align:middle line:90%
Why is this happening?

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Because these chemicals,
which the body-- most of them,

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.110 align:middle line:84%
the body has the ability
to cleanse and detoxify,

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.650 align:middle line:84%
cannot be done because the
body is so busy digesting.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are eating 2,
3, 4, 5, 6 times a day,

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:53.810 align:middle line:84%
if you follow some
of the new fad diets.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So as the body spends
its energy digesting,

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.690 align:middle line:84%
as the energetic budget is
being spent in digestion

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:08.540 align:middle line:84%
all the time, then the body,
which has to distribute,

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.180 align:middle line:84%
has to budget this
energy, has to take away

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.870 align:middle line:90%
from different functions.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.850 align:middle line:84%
So everything is being
spent in digestion.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Energy is being stolen from
the cleansing and detox

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:25.370 align:middle line:84%
system in our systems as well,
thinking itself is diminished

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.900 align:middle line:90%
when one is digesting.

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.840 align:middle line:84%
That's why, after a big meal,
the only thing you can do

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.190 align:middle line:90%
is go to sleep.

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.220 align:middle line:84%
The body, through
thousands of years,

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:84%
gave the digestive system
a really important role

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:46.100 align:middle line:84%
because life mostly depended
on obtaining nutrients.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And they were not so
available all the time.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.245 align:middle line:90%
You had to look for it.

00:15:50.245 --> 00:15:51.620 align:middle line:84%
And once you've
found it, you had

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.440 align:middle line:84%
to eat it because you couldn't
put in a Ziploc bag or a fridge

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.800 align:middle line:90%
or in a can.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.110 align:middle line:84%
So it had to be eaten
like that immediately.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.420 align:middle line:84%
And then there were
moments of feasting

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.930 align:middle line:90%
and then times of famine.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.880 align:middle line:90%
And the body adapted like this.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:84%
And then the digestive system
was given such importance

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.180 align:middle line:84%
that it was given its
own nervous system

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.400 align:middle line:90%
and its own immune system.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.850 align:middle line:84%
So digestion was so
important in the body never

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.920 align:middle line:84%
knew when the next meal
was going to come from.

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.800 align:middle line:84%
So when it came, it shut
off everything else so

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:84%
that it could dedicate
itself to digestion.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.820 align:middle line:90%
You get tired.

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.470 align:middle line:90%
You can't move around.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:36.890 align:middle line:84%
Probably you heard,
don't eat and go to swim.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:41.200 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're digesting
and you start expending energy

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:48.020 align:middle line:84%
in swimming, in muscle activity,
the digestive system, the gut,

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:84%
has the authority to shut off
your muscles and cramp them.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.080 align:middle line:90%
And you can drown.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way, when
digestion is happening,

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.845 align:middle line:84%
your thinking is
slowed down and dulled.

00:17:00.845 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:90%


00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:84%
Your detoxification systems
are slowed down and minimized.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:12.530 align:middle line:84%
You are put to sleep, actually,
after a big, big meal.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So that is that the
reason why, nowadays,

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:23.050 align:middle line:84%
since we have food available
24/7 and we are digesting 24/7,

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:25.790 align:middle line:84%
the detoxification
system does not

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:90%
get its allocated budget daily.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.160 align:middle line:90%
So it runs behind.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:35.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, these toxins that now are
circulating and cannot be dealt

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:42.800 align:middle line:84%
with have to be buffered, have
to be hidden, in the hope that,

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.590 align:middle line:84%
at some point, you
would stop digesting.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:50.120 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens, they are
rereleased into the circulation

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.580 align:middle line:84%
so that they can pass
through the liver,

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:55.880 align:middle line:84%
be neutralized,
made water soluble,

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.430 align:middle line:84%
and then eliminated
in the urine.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:04.160 align:middle line:84%
So that is why most cleansing
and detoxification programs

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.590 align:middle line:84%
have one thing in
common, which is you

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.720 align:middle line:90%
will be digesting so much less.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:14.450 align:middle line:84%
It is either juicing or
eating less or just water.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:17.750 align:middle line:84%
Those are the intense ways
of cleansing and detoxifying.

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.720 align:middle line:84%
So the moment the
digestive system

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.600 align:middle line:84%
is not working that
intensely anymore,

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.990 align:middle line:84%
the body says, wow, this is
our opportunity to cleanse

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.160 align:middle line:90%
and detoxify.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So it will release,
rerelease, all these toxins

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.140 align:middle line:90%
into the circulation.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.900 align:middle line:84%
And these toxins, many
of them, are oxidants.

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, in
the initial phases

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.020 align:middle line:84%
and throughout any good
cleansing and detox program,

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:84%
one should be loaded with
antioxidants because now you

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:49.610 align:middle line:84%
will have an even more toxic
state than before you started--

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:84%
before you started,
everything was being--

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:52.880 align:middle line:90%
it's like the garbage.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.680 align:middle line:90%
It was floating.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.400 align:middle line:84%
It was being put
under the carpet.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.440 align:middle line:84%
When you started cleansing
and detox program,

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.680 align:middle line:84%
it's like lifting the carpet
and letting it all go loose.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.560 align:middle line:84%
So you have to take
a lot of antioxidants

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:84%
so that this
recirculating toxins,

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:12.630 align:middle line:84%
in their way to the liver,
don't cause more damage.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:14.970 align:middle line:84%
The liver detoxifies
these toxins

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:18.420 align:middle line:84%
in two steps, phase
one and phase two.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:84%
In phase one, there's
a chemical reaction

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.430 align:middle line:84%
that happens that
turns the chemical that

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:84%
was toxic into an even
more toxic chemical

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.620 align:middle line:90%
or an intermediate metabolite.

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.490 align:middle line:84%
In a normally functioning
liver, immediately,

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.610 align:middle line:84%
phase two
detoxification kicks in

00:19:35.610 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:84%
and renders that molecule
non-toxic and water soluble so

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.840 align:middle line:84%
that then it can be excreted
through the urine or the sweat

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.880 align:middle line:84%
or the feces because
there's a lot of water

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.590 align:middle line:90%
going through the feces, too.

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:52.005 align:middle line:84%
Now, that is why cleansing
and detoxification

00:19:52.005 --> 00:19:57.450 align:middle line:84%
has to be done in a way that
is understood because you have

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:84%
to support these reactions
in the liver, which are all

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.220 align:middle line:90%
dependent on certain nutrients.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.940 align:middle line:84%
The liver needs all these
nutrients as raw materials

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.470 align:middle line:90%
to do their work.

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
They mix a chemical
with another chemical.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And these chemicals
aren't nutrients.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Even the toxins came from
mostly from what we eat.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So if these chemicals, if these
nutrients, are not available

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.600 align:middle line:84%
the liver won't be
able to do its work.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the chemicals that
are responsible for phase one

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.600 align:middle line:84%
detoxification are
more readily available,

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:39.570 align:middle line:84%
are easier to obtain,
than the chemicals

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:42.510 align:middle line:90%
that are needed for phase two.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:45.480 align:middle line:84%
And somebody that's not
supporting their cleansing

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.860 align:middle line:84%
and detoxification
processes correctly

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.660 align:middle line:84%
may have enough nutrients
to go through phase one

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and create intermediate
metabolites that

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:04.080 align:middle line:84%
are really toxic and not enough
to process them through phase

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:84%
two, leaving these people in
an even toxier state than when

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.420 align:middle line:90%
they started.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.670 align:middle line:84%
This is what happens with
the master cleanse and water

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.240 align:middle line:90%
fasting and some juice fasts.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So the understanding of
the detoxification process

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.970 align:middle line:84%
that is in the liver
is really important

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.520 align:middle line:84%
when one is designing a
cleansing and detoxification

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.320 align:middle line:90%
program.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.350 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:84%
What these programs are
lacking is an understanding

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.240 align:middle line:84%
of the cleansing and
detoxification processes.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:84%
And this is tied up to what
we were talking before.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:84%
When you force the fat to
melt without supporting

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.180 align:middle line:84%
the body in eliminating the
toxin that the fat was there

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
to protect the body from, that
is when you get into trouble.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:02.750 align:middle line:84%
The concept that genes are a
life sentence is incorrect.

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:07.100 align:middle line:84%
We know now that, other than
the genes of your eye color

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:84%
and your heights and
your hair, most genes

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.420 align:middle line:90%
can be turned on and off.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And the way the genes are
turned on and off mostly

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.520 align:middle line:84%
is by nutrients, so through
the foods that we eat.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.760 align:middle line:84%
Now, what most people don't
really understand or don't

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:84%
really pay attention to is
that the body does not have

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:37.400 align:middle line:90%
an inner design for disease.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.850 align:middle line:84%
The only thing that the
body knows what to do

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:44.090 align:middle line:84%
and is designed to do
is to survive and adapt.

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So I think that there
are no diseases.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:51.870 align:middle line:84%
There are a few diseases
like, for example,

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:57.010 align:middle line:84%
genetic mistakes like Down
Syndrome and things like that.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.550 align:middle line:84%
There are other diseases
that are infectious.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.980 align:middle line:84%
But most of the
diseases of modern life,

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.770 align:middle line:84%
the chronic diseases which
we call like coronary artery

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:09.720 align:middle line:84%
disease and diabetes, they are
actually the body perfectly

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:12.090 align:middle line:90%
trying to survive.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And what's happening is
that the disease is what

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.730 align:middle line:90%
the body is trying to survive.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.610 align:middle line:90%
For example, I'm a cardiologist.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And I see a lot of coronary
artery disease, which

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.120 align:middle line:84%
is one of the leading causes
of death in the United States

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.960 align:middle line:90%
and around the world today.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, coronary artery disease
is not really a disease.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.190 align:middle line:90%
This is what's happening.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:36.930 align:middle line:84%
The arteries are
getting irritated,

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.650 align:middle line:84%
either by high blood pressure,
smoking, or many other things.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:45.360 align:middle line:84%
And the body perfectly tries
to survive that irritation

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.220 align:middle line:84%
by patching the artery
with cholesterol.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the
irritation continues,

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:53.010 align:middle line:84%
there's more patching, more
patching, more patting.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the
survival mechanism

00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:02.140 align:middle line:84%
ends up killing you just because
the irritation never stopped.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:07.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, once the irritation stops,
the cholesterol is reabsorbed

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.800 align:middle line:90%
and the arteries unclogged.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And this was proven by Dean
Ornish in California and San

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:19.170 align:middle line:84%
Francisco, who did cardiac
catheterizations on people

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.750 align:middle line:84%
and saw their arteries
completely blocked up and put

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:25.430 align:middle line:84%
them on a vegetarian diet,
meditation, and group therapy.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Repeated a cardiac
catheterization

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:32.370 align:middle line:84%
six months later, and the plaque
was completely disappearing.

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:34.980 align:middle line:84%
So we know the body is
adapting all the time.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, there are
no diseases of this type.

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:43.230 align:middle line:84%
The disease is a lifestyle
that is causing the body

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.760 align:middle line:90%
to try to survive.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:52.950 align:middle line:84%
So genes-- genes are
there to trigger or stop

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:55.950 align:middle line:90%
survival mechanisms as well.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:59.280 align:middle line:84%
So the moment that the
body, through whatever

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:03.030 align:middle line:84%
you're exposed to, through the
nutrients that are coming--

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:05.490 align:middle line:84%
or not coming because the
lack of certain nutrients

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.930 align:middle line:84%
also turns on and off diseases
and turns on and off genes--

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:14.110 align:middle line:84%
so the moment the body
detects these things,

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.980 align:middle line:84%
it turns on or off its
survival mechanisms.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:90%
And this is how genes work.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:25.090 align:middle line:84%
And this is how nutrients affect
us in such a profound way.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.940 align:middle line:90%


00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Government organization,
government offices

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:39.030 align:middle line:84%
like the FDA, don't really
understand the implications

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:40.290 align:middle line:90%
of these chemicals.

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:42.360 align:middle line:84%
What they do is
they test in rats.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:48.570 align:middle line:84%
And they talk about
a 50% death dose.

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.030 align:middle line:90%
They give doses to mice.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:55.350 align:middle line:84%
And they see how many
mice die of that dose

00:25:55.350 --> 00:26:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and the lethal dose of certain
medications or chemicals.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.360 align:middle line:84%
But they don't really consider
of what these chemicals are

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:08.890 align:middle line:84%
doing in your organism and much
less the synergy between them.

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:15.020 align:middle line:84%
Today, it's impossible for us to
even study in a controlled way

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.200 align:middle line:84%
the all the influences that
are affecting human health, not

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:84%
only with chemicals but also
with radioactivity and stress

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:34.090 align:middle line:84%
at work and the toxic intentions
that people have like greed

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:90%
and the results like anger.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:90%


00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.880 align:middle line:84%
There are no
diseases that I know

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:50.270 align:middle line:84%
of that do not respond to
changes in dietary habits.

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:55.085 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience, if
you get a charismatic person

00:26:55.085 --> 00:26:59.150 align:middle line:84%
and you put a lab coat on them
and you start sending them

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:04.130 align:middle line:84%
patients, and the only
thing that this person does

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:84%
is, after listening and chatting
a little bit, distracting them

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.430 align:middle line:84%
so they didn't realize
they're not a doctor--

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:13.340 align:middle line:84%
the only thing they do as a
consequence of their visit

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.370 align:middle line:84%
is put these people on the
elimination diet, basically

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:19.910 align:middle line:84%
no sugar, no wheat, no
dairy products, no coffee,

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.840 align:middle line:84%
no alcohol, no red meat, and no
processed food with chemicals.

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:28.370 align:middle line:84%
Just by doing that,
judging by the results

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.130 align:middle line:84%
that this doctor would
obtain, he or she

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:34.250 align:middle line:84%
would be named the best doctor
in America in very short time

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:84%
because it is my experience
that just doing that improved

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.080 align:middle line:84%
60% of the general
symptoms that people

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:90%
come with from modern diseases.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.460 align:middle line:90%


00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:54.680 align:middle line:84%
It's everything from dandruff
to autoimmune diseases, diseases

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.310 align:middle line:84%
in which your immune system
gets confused and starts

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:00.450 align:middle line:90%
attacking your own tissues.

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Now, these diseases are
not really well understood.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:06.570 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, in
my understanding,

00:28:06.570 --> 00:28:11.030 align:middle line:84%
in my experience, what I see,
these diseases start in the gut

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.630 align:middle line:90%
as most diseases do.

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And the immune system around
the gut, when it's exposed to

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.320 align:middle line:90%
undigested food--

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.140 align:middle line:84%
and the reason we
exposed our immune system

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.052 align:middle line:84%
to undigested food is
because, between the food

00:28:28.052 --> 00:28:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and the immune
system, there should

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:35.150 align:middle line:84%
be a healthy layer of intestinal
flora, of good bacteria,

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:38.240 align:middle line:90%
and an intact intestinal wall.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.780 align:middle line:84%
When the intestinal wall is
broken, leading to a condition

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:46.520 align:middle line:84%
called leaky gut syndrome,
and when the intestinal flora

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.480 align:middle line:84%
is decimated or,
even worse, changed

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.860 align:middle line:84%
into bacteria that are
not supposed to be there

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.410 align:middle line:84%
because of the
conditions we create,

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:01.070 align:middle line:84%
the immune system then
is not only attack

00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:04.940 align:middle line:84%
by the chemicals in our food,
by the bad bacteria, parasites,

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:09.140 align:middle line:84%
or whatever microorganisms
are there, but also

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.060 align:middle line:90%
by undigested food.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.740 align:middle line:84%
The immune system
should never be

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.950 align:middle line:84%
exposed to food that
is not broken down

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:21.080 align:middle line:84%
into its minimal components,
proteins into amino acids,

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:26.490 align:middle line:84%
fat into glycerol and
esters, and carbohydrates

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:30.170 align:middle line:84%
into complex carbohydrate--
simple carbohydrates.

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:36.500 align:middle line:84%
Those are the ones that are
immunologically neutral.

00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:38.318 align:middle line:84%
The building blocks
of foods, when

00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:40.610 align:middle line:84%
they're exposed to the immune
system, the immune system

00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:41.930 align:middle line:90%
just lets them pass.

00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:48.320 align:middle line:84%
But as the food starts being
exposed to the immune system

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's not fully digested,
now the immune system

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:56.450 align:middle line:84%
starts making out the
surfaces of wherever

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:90%
these foods come from.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And it recognizes
them as foreign.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.930 align:middle line:90%
So it builds attacks.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:06.140 align:middle line:84%
This is what happened to me last
night when I ate some bread.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:84%
My immune system
recognized this as a threat

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and started building an attack
and started getting crazy,

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:84%
started making me sneeze
because it got confused.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.310 align:middle line:84%
It thought that something
was coming through the air.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:25.150 align:middle line:90%


00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.570 align:middle line:84%
Cosmetics is only one aspect
of-- an important aspect

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.230 align:middle line:84%
of the things that
we have to watch

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:84%
when we are paying
attention to the toxins

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.620 align:middle line:90%
that we're exposed to.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:37.420 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.760 align:middle line:84%
Because, in a way, our skin is
very similar to our intestines.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:45.520 align:middle line:84%
Intestines is skin
turned in, right?

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And it just takes a little
bit of a different function.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:90%
The skin keeps things out.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.260 align:middle line:84%
The intestine puts
things in, mostly.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.940 align:middle line:84%
But they are both
functions in both.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.830 align:middle line:90%
The skin also absorbs.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.530 align:middle line:84%
And the gut also
keeps things out.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:08.020 align:middle line:84%
So anything that you put on your
skin you should be able to eat.

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, don't
put it on your skin

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.040 align:middle line:84%
because it's going to
end up in your blood.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:16.720 align:middle line:84%
So yes, definitely, cosmetics
are an important aspect

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.090 align:middle line:84%
that one should pay
attention to when

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:24.940 align:middle line:84%
one is willing or wanting to
keep safe from chemicals today.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:26.380 align:middle line:90%
But not the only one.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.280 align:middle line:84%
I talk with my patients about
their cleaning products,

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:39.920 align:middle line:84%
their detergents to do their
laundry, their cars, the hair

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.720 align:middle line:90%
products.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.540 align:middle line:90%
I mean, the list is endless.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:48.430 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes go into my patients'
homes and start taking a look

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:52.680 align:middle line:84%
at where the sources
of toxicity come from,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:55.180 align:middle line:90%
from non-filtered water to--

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.120 align:middle line:90%


00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.400 align:middle line:84%
There was a case-- this
was not a patient of mine.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.850 align:middle line:84%
But this is a doctor
that I know well, told me

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:06.820 align:middle line:84%
a story of this woman
who had the worst

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:11.020 align:middle line:84%
nightmares and, during the
night and during the day,

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:14.200 align:middle line:84%
the worst headaches
and migraines headaches

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:20.020 align:middle line:84%
until this doctor that was aware
of the toxicity of radiation

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and magnetism went to
her house and figured out

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:28.300 align:middle line:84%
that the moment that this woman
started having these symptoms

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.720 align:middle line:84%
was the moment that they
installed a new generator

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:35.320 align:middle line:90%
for electricity in their home.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And her bedroom
was right on top.

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.030 align:middle line:90%
Well, how did he figure it out?

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:42.880 align:middle line:84%
Because, when she went on
vacation or some nights,

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:45.820 align:middle line:84%
where she slept in
the guest house,

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.920 align:middle line:90%
she didn't have the symptoms.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So there are many,
multiple sources

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.712 align:middle line:90%
of toxicity in one's home.

00:32:54.712 --> 00:32:55.920 align:middle line:90%
And food is only one of them.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:00.550 align:middle line:90%


00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:90%
The list goes on and on.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.360 align:middle line:84%
There's an amazing book
that you guys should read.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:09.040 align:middle line:84%
It's called "The Hundred-Year
Lie" by Randall Fitzgerald.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.910 align:middle line:84%
The author, in one of
the initial chapters,

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:17.680 align:middle line:84%
describes a standard
American citizen,

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.810 align:middle line:84%
waking up and walking in his
bedroom towards the bathroom

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:29.500 align:middle line:84%
and washing their teeth and
names about 25 chemicals that

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:35.060 align:middle line:84%
are in most average American
houses that are either

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:41.020 align:middle line:84%
a carcinogen or damage
reproductive systems.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:44.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the list is scary
when you think about it.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:48.310 align:middle line:84%
But it starts as
the person wakes up,

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:52.750 align:middle line:84%
from his mattress
that was heavily--

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:57.430 align:middle line:84%
a mattress that was heavily
sprayed with fire retardant,

00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:59.200 align:middle line:90%
that off gases.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.700 align:middle line:90%
And you breathe these chemicals.

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.570 align:middle line:84%
Then walking on the floor, and
there was wax on the floor.

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, in the end,
arriving to toothpaste

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:15.490 align:middle line:84%
with fluoride and other
preservatives and tasting

00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:16.290 align:middle line:90%
agents.

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:21.420 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:25.770 align:middle line:84%
The clean program is both a
cleansing and detox program

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.469 align:middle line:90%
and a gut repair program.

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:31.679 align:middle line:84%
The cleansing and
detox aspect of it

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:38.380 align:middle line:84%
is made possible by reduction
of the work of digestion.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.540 align:middle line:90%
How do we achieve that?

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:43.500 align:middle line:84%
By having a liquid breakfast
and a liquid dinner and only

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.060 align:middle line:90%
a solid lunch.

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:49.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, all the foods, from
breakfast, dinner, and lunch,

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.940 align:middle line:84%
must be from the
elimination diet, which

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.449 align:middle line:84%
means there's a list of
foods that are allowed

00:34:56.449 --> 00:34:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and a list of foods
that are not allowed.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And this, in this way,
make things simple.

00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:05.730 align:middle line:84%
The reason why the foods that
are not allowed are not allowed

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:07.540 align:middle line:90%
is because they are irritant.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.850 align:middle line:84%
They are difficult for
the body to digest.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:11.820 align:middle line:90%
They are loaded with chemicals.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.680 align:middle line:84%
They cause food allergies,
food sensitivities.

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:22.230 align:middle line:84%
And they make people
toxic and sick.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:28.290 align:middle line:84%
So this aspect of triggering
what I call a detox mode

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.260 align:middle line:84%
is achieved by
reducing the workload

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.300 align:middle line:90%
of the digestive system.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:36.750 align:middle line:84%
Other aspects of
the clean program

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:41.580 align:middle line:84%
are antioxidant protection
for the times where

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:46.110 align:middle line:84%
these toxins are rereleased
into the blood and nutritional

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:50.730 align:middle line:84%
support for the liver phase one
and phase one detoxification

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:55.440 align:middle line:84%
as well as enhancing aspects for
the channels of elimination--

00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.260 align:middle line:90%
sweat, urine, and feces.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.356 align:middle line:90%


00:36:01.356 --> 00:36:04.740 align:middle line:84%
That is all about cleansing
and detoxification.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.720 align:middle line:84%
But there's also an
aspect of gut repair,

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.640 align:middle line:84%
which most cleansing and detox
programs don't even address.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:13.860 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.590 align:middle line:84%
It's killing the bad
bacteria with herbs

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.890 align:middle line:90%
and with herbal antimicrobials.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:23.790 align:middle line:84%
It's replanting the good
bacteria with probiotics.

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:27.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's giving the body--
and creating the conditions,

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.920 align:middle line:84%
giving the body all
the nutrients that

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.420 align:middle line:84%
are necessary for gut repair
like glutamine and others

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:38.310 align:middle line:84%
as well as nutrients that
calm the immune system

00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:40.380 align:middle line:84%
and that replenish
the nervous system.

00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:44.860 align:middle line:90%


00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:48.070 align:middle line:84%
For the first part,
for the part when

00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:51.040 align:middle line:84%
as you reduce the workload
of the digestive system,

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:54.970 align:middle line:84%
the body goes into detox mode
and rereleases all these toxins

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:58.360 align:middle line:84%
that were trapped and
coated with mucus,

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.760 align:middle line:84%
antioxidants are
really important.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.870 align:middle line:84%
Then all the nutrients that
support liver detoxification,

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:13.060 align:middle line:84%
which are certain proteins
and magnesium, sulfur,

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:17.200 align:middle line:84%
the reaction of phase one and
phase two chemical reactions

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.540 align:middle line:84%
are called glycosidation,
sulfation, methylation.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So each one of these chemicals,
these chemical reactions,

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.140 align:middle line:90%
require certain nutrients.

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And all those nutrients
are provided in order

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:32.590 align:middle line:84%
to support detoxification
nutritionally.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.990 align:middle line:84%
Then there's herbal
antimicrobials

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:39.460 align:middle line:84%
like oregano oil,
berberine, wormwood,

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:42.670 align:middle line:84%
and things like
that that will make

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.910 align:middle line:84%
it difficult for bad
bacteria to survive.

00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:48.430 align:middle line:84%
Then there's probiotics
to replant good bacteria.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:54.340 align:middle line:84%
And then there's specialized
nutrients like-- for example,

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:58.570 align:middle line:84%
the wall of the intestine,
just like your skin,

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:02.890 align:middle line:84%
when cells are damaged
or cells are shed,

00:38:02.890 --> 00:38:05.830 align:middle line:84%
other cells have
to grow and occupy

00:38:05.830 --> 00:38:07.990 align:middle line:90%
that space so there's no holes.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:10.500 align:middle line:84%
Imagine your skin
with a bunch of holes.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.270 align:middle line:90%
It'll get infected.

00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:14.150 align:middle line:90%
It will irritate itself.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.330 align:middle line:84%
The same thing
happens in your gut.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So in order for these cells to
really fabricate and reproduce

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:23.410 align:middle line:84%
themselves, they need
a lot of glutamine.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:31.120 align:middle line:84%
And glutamine, which is
an essential amino acid,

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.690 align:middle line:84%
is usually not provided that
well with our modern diet

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.520 align:middle line:90%
and combination of foods.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.370 align:middle line:84%
So glutamine, L-glutamine
is one of the nutrients

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:42.700 align:middle line:90%
that really does its trick.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And there's other ones
like tumeric for appeasing

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.210 align:middle line:90%
the inflammatory responses.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:53.650 align:middle line:90%


00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:57.490 align:middle line:84%
When one starts to
detoxify and cleanse,

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:00.580 align:middle line:84%
the first thing that
people experience

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:03.640 align:middle line:90%
is the breaking of habits.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.210 align:middle line:84%
And the breaking habits is one
of the hardest things to do.

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:10.270 align:middle line:84%
So people get
withdrawal symptoms.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And just like a heroin addict
that goes through withdrawal

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:18.730 align:middle line:84%
gets physical pain from it
because, in part, the heroin

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:29.800 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the drug is
appeasing the pain in a way--

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:34.330 align:middle line:84%
So withdrawal symptoms
are one of the big things

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.700 align:middle line:84%
that people go
through that cause

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:38.935 align:middle line:84%
not only physical pain
but many other symptoms.

00:39:38.935 --> 00:39:42.160 align:middle line:90%


00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
the symptoms that

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.660 align:middle line:84%
appear from that phase
of hyper-toxicity

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.780 align:middle line:84%
or increased toxicity
from when you started,

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.400 align:middle line:84%
which comes from the
body rereleasing all

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.120 align:middle line:84%
these toxins back
into the circulation

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:03.010 align:middle line:84%
like when we compared
it to lifting the carpet

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:08.200 align:middle line:90%
and letting all the dust free.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.670 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two reasons why
people suffer a lot of symptoms

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:14.623 align:middle line:90%
during cleansing detoxification.

00:40:14.623 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:90%


00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.310 align:middle line:84%
People that are
addicted to substances

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:25.070 align:middle line:84%
are not really addicted to
those substances themselves

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:30.100 align:middle line:84%
but to the state that
those substances give them.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:34.690 align:middle line:84%
In terms of foods,
these addictions

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:39.160 align:middle line:84%
really correlate a lot
with hormonal states.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:43.120 align:middle line:84%
So people that drink coffee
and smoke cigarettes,

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.340 align:middle line:90%
they want hyperadrenergic state.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.940 align:middle line:90%
They want a more alert state.

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:54.630 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the only thing that you
do is take away the stimulant,

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:59.590 align:middle line:84%
then there's going to
be a big disbalance.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:03.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you do other
things together

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:06.280 align:middle line:84%
that tend to balance
your hormonal states,

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:10.930 align:middle line:84%
then the addiction itself
is or the withdrawal

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:13.590 align:middle line:84%
of whatever it is that
one is addicted to

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:16.120 align:middle line:90%
is much easier to withstand.

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, with
the clean program,

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:22.600 align:middle line:84%
we see so many people
just commenting

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.800 align:middle line:84%
on how much easier than they
thought it was to get rid

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:30.420 align:middle line:84%
of coffee and
cigarettes and alcohol

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and many of the chemicals and
foods or foodlike products

00:41:34.450 --> 00:41:38.935 align:middle line:84%
that you use in order to induce
these altered hormonal states.

00:41:38.935 --> 00:41:43.820 align:middle line:90%


00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, what's happening
is that, during cleansing

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:50.680 align:middle line:84%
and detoxification, if you
support things nutritionally

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:55.340 align:middle line:84%
in the right way, then
you are balancing your,

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.740 align:middle line:90%
for example, sugar levels.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Sugar levels are
one of the reasons

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.640 align:middle line:90%
why people seek for stimulants.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.010 align:middle line:84%
When your sugar
levels go down, you

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:11.060 align:middle line:84%
have a slump in perceived
sense of energy.

00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And you take the stimulant
in order to overcome that.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.210 align:middle line:84%
But when you do
the clean program,

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.310 align:middle line:84%
we provide you
with nutrients that

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.840 align:middle line:84%
are plant derivatives that will
stabilize your sugar levels.

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:29.450 align:middle line:84%
So the craving itself will not
be generated, you understand?

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:32.390 align:middle line:84%
So you take off the
stimulant, but the sugar level

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:34.190 align:middle line:90%
is stabilized.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:39.680 align:middle line:84%
So the craving doesn't come
as hard as when you just

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.470 align:middle line:84%
take the chemical that
you were addicted to.

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:47.330 align:middle line:90%


00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:50.490 align:middle line:84%
So when you start a
cleansing and detox program,

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:53.085 align:middle line:84%
one should talk to somebody
that knows and understands,

00:42:53.085 --> 00:42:55.980 align:middle line:84%
you know, which medications
should be discontinued?

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.130 align:middle line:84%
Which medications
cannot be discontinued?

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.860 align:middle line:84%
And which medications
will either

00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.020 align:middle line:84%
affect cleansing
and detoxification,

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:07.950 align:middle line:84%
or cleansing and detoxification
will affect their blood levels,

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:09.550 align:middle line:90%
becoming dangerous?

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:11.940 align:middle line:84%
For example, if
you're an epileptic

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:15.600 align:middle line:84%
and you need an
anti-epileptic, there

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.330 align:middle line:84%
needs to be a certain level
of this medication in blood.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.720 align:middle line:84%
But when you're cleansing
and detoxifying,

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.690 align:middle line:84%
all the absorption
conditions change.

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.030 align:middle line:84%
So the anti-epileptic
could be either absorbed

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:30.930 align:middle line:84%
too much and become toxic
itself or too little,

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:33.990 align:middle line:90%
leading to an epileptic crisis.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:36.540 align:middle line:84%
The same thing is
with antiarrhythmics,

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:40.450 align:middle line:84%
same thing with anti-blood
clotting medications.

00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:41.700 align:middle line:90%
And there's a few more.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.790 align:middle line:90%


00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:51.662 align:middle line:84%
In a funny way, the
first advice that I

00:43:51.662 --> 00:43:53.120 align:middle line:84%
would have to a
person like that is

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.910 align:middle line:84%
don't do it for that,
because then it's

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:59.900 align:middle line:84%
a little bit like the
superficial way of doing things

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.710 align:middle line:84%
that, in many cases, it leads
to problems in themselves.

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Cleansing and detoxification,
as a side effect,

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.690 align:middle line:84%
will make you lose weight,
will make your eyes white,

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:11.720 align:middle line:90%
will make your skin glow.

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:14.270 align:middle line:84%
There's no need to
think about that.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:18.500 align:middle line:84%
Those are side effects of
cleansing and detoxification.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:25.190 align:middle line:84%
So cleansing and
detoxification leads to beauty

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.750 align:middle line:90%
as a side effect.

00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily one has
to go into cleansing

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.210 align:middle line:90%
and detoxification to look good.

00:44:32.210 --> 00:44:34.700 align:middle line:84%
But that would be the
result. And if one

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.650 align:middle line:84%
goes into cleansing and
detoxification to look good,

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:39.530 align:middle line:84%
then they will be
surprised not only

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.800 align:middle line:84%
by how good they look but
by how good they feel.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.970 align:middle line:90%


00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:53.940 align:middle line:84%
If you are flying in a plane
and the plane starts falling,

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:58.590 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't you want to know how
to operate your parachute?

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:02.250 align:middle line:84%
We are living in a state
in the world that's

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:05.220 align:middle line:90%
comparable to a falling plane.

00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And your detoxification
system is your parachute.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:11.370 align:middle line:84%
Either you learn how to use it,
or you'll crash in the ground.

00:45:11.370 --> 00:45:14.720 align:middle line:90%
