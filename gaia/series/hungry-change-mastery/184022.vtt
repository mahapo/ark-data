00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:23.880 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It started for
me, jeez, years ago.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.900 align:middle line:90%
I was about 15 years old.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.410 align:middle line:90%
And I started getting exposed.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.380 align:middle line:84%
I had a friend in my life who
was really influential who

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.180 align:middle line:90%
handed me a book.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.660 align:middle line:90%
It was called "The Grape Cure."

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And the book was about people
who harvested grapes in Europe

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.180 align:middle line:84%
for pressing wine and
how during that time

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.850 align:middle line:84%
they would fast on just the
grapes for a couple of weeks.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And it was about how
they had prevented

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.170 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the chronic
degenerative diseases

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.650 align:middle line:84%
that we see today in our
culture, particularly cancers.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And so I was
exposed to this idea

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.160 align:middle line:84%
that food could be
like a medicine for us.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.010 align:middle line:84%
And we could use food to cleanse
our bodies, to rejuvenate

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:84%
our bodies, and that if we did
that periodically it's possible

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.413 align:middle line:84%
we could have longer,
healthier lives.

00:01:00.413 --> 00:01:02.430 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
my first exposure.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And that kind of began a quest
that's now lasted 17 years.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
And the conclusions
I'm arriving at today

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.835 align:middle line:84%
really do stem from
that initial experience.

00:01:11.835 --> 00:01:16.290 align:middle line:90%


00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.480 align:middle line:84%
I grew up in the United
States in the 1980s, primarily

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.450 align:middle line:84%
my childhood, born
in the late '70s.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.910 align:middle line:84%
So I was really part of that
whole industrial food complex.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.602 align:middle line:84%
And I was exposed mostly to
white flour, to corn, to soy.

00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:32.810 align:middle line:90%
I grew up on processed foods.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.250 align:middle line:84%
And most of the
foods I ate really

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.520 align:middle line:84%
came in shapes and
colors that were

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.130 align:middle line:84%
more about marketing than it
was about the original food.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.333 align:middle line:84%
So I wasn't really exposed
to a lot of whole foods.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:43.250 align:middle line:90%
We had certain things.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:84%
We had that standard
baked potato.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.610 align:middle line:90%
We had the steaks occasionally.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:84%
But mostly I grew up
with boxed cereals.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.700 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with pasteurized
industrial dairy products.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with meats
that came on Styrofoam

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.310 align:middle line:84%
and wrapped in plastic and
very little understanding

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.513 align:middle line:90%
of where my foods came from.

00:01:59.513 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
And I got to say, actually,
from my childhood,

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.970 align:middle line:90%
I was hyperinflamed.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.680 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of respiratory
issues that came up for me.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.113 align:middle line:90%
I thought I had asthma.

00:02:08.113 --> 00:02:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't
understand that I was

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.410 align:middle line:84%
in a chronic state of
inflammation from the foods

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.463 align:middle line:90%
that I was eating.

00:02:13.463 --> 00:02:15.380 align:middle line:84%
Of course, my mother,
doing the best she could

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.005 align:middle line:84%
and thinking she's doing a good
thing when she's bringing home,

00:02:18.005 --> 00:02:21.253 align:middle line:84%
say, the pseudo-wheat
bread or the butter

00:02:21.253 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:84%
split wheat bread--
that's really,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.932 align:middle line:84%
like we talked about before,
the dyed, brown-looking bread.

00:02:26.932 --> 00:02:28.640 align:middle line:84%
I was exposed to all
those kind of foods.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.057 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of
problems from that.

00:02:30.057 --> 00:02:32.900 align:middle line:84%
I remember as a kid, we'd
go to the supermarket,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:84%
this big, glitzy, glamorous
mall of processed foods.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:84%
And I would open
the refrigerator.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And I'd stick my
head inside of it

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.010 align:middle line:84%
in the cooler where they
keep the frozen foods.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.060 align:middle line:90%
The air was so crisp.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.890 align:middle line:90%
I could breathe there.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And I remember
that I had trouble

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.320 align:middle line:90%
breathing my whole life.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.220 align:middle line:84%
That went away once
I changed my diet.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.805 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I grew up in a giant
international food experiment.

00:02:54.805 --> 00:02:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And I was right at ground
zero in the United States

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.310 align:middle line:90%


00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've done
a lot of research

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.100 align:middle line:84%
over the last few years
about the indigenous people

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.900 align:middle line:90%
of the planet.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.015 align:middle line:84%
When I say that, I
know a lot of us--

00:03:09.015 --> 00:03:10.140 align:middle line:90%
we think indigenous people.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.340 align:middle line:84%
We think about primitive
peoples from the past.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.180 align:middle line:84%
We forget that in Australia,
it's 200 years ago.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.850 align:middle line:84%
In parts of the United
States 200 years ago,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.763 align:middle line:84%
there were people
living here indigenously

00:03:19.763 --> 00:03:21.930 align:middle line:84%
the way they had lived for
thousands of generations.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And they did not have the
chronic degenerative diseases

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.900 align:middle line:90%
we have today.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.230 align:middle line:84%
So these are very new
things we're dealing with.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.050 align:middle line:84%
And they had found
ways to live in harmony

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.917 align:middle line:84%
with their ecosystems and with
their bodies in such a way

00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:36.250 align:middle line:84%
that they didn't break down
the way we're breaking down.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at
how they live, we

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.690 align:middle line:84%
find a very interesting thing
with regard to food and birth.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:84%
And what we find is that
most native peoples,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.070 align:middle line:84%
indigenous people have some
kind of feeding protocol

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:84%
that the mother undertakes
sometimes for a couple of years

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.600 align:middle line:90%
before she gives birth.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And also, usually the father
has very specific food regimen

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.950 align:middle line:90%
that he's on as well.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is to ensure that they
bring forth a healthy baby.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Because if you imagine
primitive peoples

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.763 align:middle line:84%
before there was the medical
interventions of today,

00:04:03.763 --> 00:04:06.180 align:middle line:84%
it's very important that they
bring forth a healthy child.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.138 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to be
living with that child,

00:04:08.138 --> 00:04:11.185 align:middle line:84%
raising that child in their
tribe in a very personal way.

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:84%
So it's important
that they carry forth

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.550 align:middle line:90%
really healthy genetics.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.709 align:middle line:84%
I think that the
effect of the food--

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.480 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's pretty obvious.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.990 align:middle line:84%
If you demineralize the human
being, if you remove and strip

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.120 align:middle line:84%
the fats from a human
being-- or maybe, say,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.040 align:middle line:84%
the mother's never even
had certain fats, like DHA,

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.290 align:middle line:90%
which her brain is made up of.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:90%
She's never had enough of that.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And she's chronically
deprived of that nutrient.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.110 align:middle line:84%
When she brings forth
a baby, that baby

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.180 align:middle line:84%
is going to require
that nutrient as well.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
Say DHA, the brain fat
I'm talking about--

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.762 align:middle line:84%
that needs to be passed
to the child, who's

00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:45.720 align:middle line:84%
going to form his brain
or her brain out of it,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.330 align:middle line:84%
as well as myelinate their
entire nervous system with it.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.918 align:middle line:84%
Well, if there's
not enough of that,

00:04:49.918 --> 00:04:51.960 align:middle line:84%
it's going to draw on the
mother's reserve, which

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.293 align:middle line:84%
is in her brain, which is
going to mean the baby's going

00:04:54.293 --> 00:04:55.688 align:middle line:90%
to be somewhat malformed.

00:04:55.688 --> 00:04:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And the mother's also now going
to be stripped of it as well.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.630 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is that
after the birth process,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.530 align:middle line:84%
the mother is now in a deep
state of nutrient deficiency.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.712 align:middle line:84%
And the child is
also undernourished.

00:05:06.712 --> 00:05:08.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's a failure to
thrive in both of them.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.840 align:middle line:90%
And we have names for this.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.720 align:middle line:84%
We call it "postpartum," for
instance, the type of brain

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.790 align:middle line:90%
depression that comes on.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Often it's because of
a lack of nutrition.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.882 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.882 --> 00:05:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that we
have a culture today that

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.948 align:middle line:84%
considers it normal to bring
forth children in a very

00:05:25.948 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:84%
what we like to
think of as a sterile

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.380 align:middle line:90%
environment in hospitals.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.510 align:middle line:84%
My birth took place
in a hospital,

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.930 align:middle line:84%
which means my first
impression of the world I live

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.740 align:middle line:84%
in was fluorescent lights, was
men and women wearing masks,

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:84%
were knives and scalpels and
scissors, were antibiotics.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And what wasn't there
for me was fresh air.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.090 align:middle line:84%
And there wasn't any
clean running water.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.510 align:middle line:90%
And there wasn't any sunlight.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.640 align:middle line:90%
And there wasn't any soil.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.920 align:middle line:84%
And the only microorganisms
that were really

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:84%
inhabiting that place were
very dangerous organisms,

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:84%
like staphylococcus,
that were looking

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.522 align:middle line:84%
to infect my mother and my
body because we were in this--

00:06:04.522 --> 00:06:05.980 align:middle line:84%
what we love to
think of as sterile

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.500 align:middle line:84%
is actually one of the more
toxic environments that exist.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:84%
So our first experience
in this world

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:84%
is often in a very sterile,
very artificial environment.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And from that
moment forth, we're

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:84%
sort of encouraged to live
in artificial environments.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I think this has a profound
effect on our health.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.200 align:middle line:84%
But it also has
a profound effect

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.930 align:middle line:84%
on where we start looking
when we sense something

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.560 align:middle line:90%
going wrong in our body.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:90%
So if you were brought forth--

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.750 align:middle line:84%
if you were bonded
to doctors and nurses

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.420 align:middle line:84%
before you were bonded
to your mother, remember,

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.130 align:middle line:84%
there's a critical
moment at birth

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.180 align:middle line:84%
where a bonding experience
is meant to happen.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And there's enough of
the hormone oxytocin

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.280 align:middle line:84%
flowing through the
child and the mother.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:45.410 align:middle line:84%
There's this moment that's
meant for their bond to happen.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.620 align:middle line:84%
But if you're taken
from her, particularly

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.920 align:middle line:90%
in the kind of birth where--

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.290 align:middle line:90%
say, a cesarean section--

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.100 align:middle line:84%
where they erect maybe a sheet
between the woman's lower body

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and upper body so the baby and
the mother cannot even make eye

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.920 align:middle line:84%
contact, your first bonding
experience is, of course,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.990 align:middle line:84%
doctors and nurses
in a hospital.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:03.880 align:middle line:84%
Then periodically,
every few weeks, you're

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.310 align:middle line:84%
brought back to the
hospital for your checkups,

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.290 align:middle line:84%
where you're separated
from your mother.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.530 align:middle line:84%
And you grow to trust the
doctors and the nurses in a way

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.450 align:middle line:84%
that you don't even
trust your own family.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.880 align:middle line:84%
And so their advice becomes
more and more paramount to you

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.680 align:middle line:90%
over the years.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And when you start
to encounter problems

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.210 align:middle line:84%
in your body, who are
you going to go to?

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:22.630 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course you're
going to go to the doctors.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
go to the nurses.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.683 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to
take their advice.

00:07:25.683 --> 00:07:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And little did we know,
they received no nutritional

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.840 align:middle line:90%
training.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.120 align:middle line:84%
Little did we know that they
aren't trained in health.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:90%
But they're trained in disease.

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And they're trained
in naming diseases,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.930 align:middle line:84%
in choosing pharmaceuticals to
treat disease symptoms with,

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.950 align:middle line:84%
but never really treating
underlying causes.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:40.750 align:middle line:90%
We don't know that.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And we continue
to go back to them

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.110 align:middle line:84%
time and time again
the way we were

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:45.570 align:middle line:90%
trained to right from birth.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.880 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.490 align:middle line:84%
Are human beings a
domesticated species?

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we look at
other domesticated species--

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:01.230 align:middle line:84%
for instance, the dog, the
cat, the pig, the chicken--

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.320 align:middle line:84%
these are all animals that
have a progenitor species.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.270 align:middle line:84%
In other words, there
is a form of that animal

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:07.920 align:middle line:84%
that lives in the
wild environment that

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.190 align:middle line:84%
can feed itself, that can
build its own home, that

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:90%
can survive in nature.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.390 align:middle line:84%
And then there's the
domesticated version, which

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:90%
we draw out of its genome.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.170 align:middle line:90%
And we sort of breed ourselves.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.510 align:middle line:84%
"Domesticated" means
"of the household."

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So we have animals like our
dog, say maybe a little lap dog.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:84%
A very cute lap dog
is not an animal

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.250 align:middle line:84%
that can survive out in its
natural environment anymore.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, purebred dogs--
one in four of them

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.232 align:middle line:84%
have degenerative diseases,
genetic diseases because

00:08:36.232 --> 00:08:37.440 align:middle line:90%
of the way they've been bred.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.482 align:middle line:84%
Well, human beings are in
a very unique situation

00:08:39.482 --> 00:08:42.086 align:middle line:84%
because we are probably
the oldest domestic animal.

00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:84%
The dog is thought to
have been domesticated

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:90%
about 15,000 years ago.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.040 align:middle line:84%
And right around
that time is where

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.110 align:middle line:84%
we started to domesticate
ourselves as well.

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And what I mean is we
go from this organism

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.110 align:middle line:84%
that lives in environments, just
like the hunter-gatherer people

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.800 align:middle line:84%
all over the world did and
still do in some places.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And we become city builders
and agriculturalists.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.660 align:middle line:90%
And we start breeding ourselves.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the same way
that the pig is bred out

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:84%
of the wild boar,
well, the modern human

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.390 align:middle line:84%
is bred out of the
indigenous person.

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And so if you think
of the wild boar,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:84%
this is a much more robust
organism, much more muscular,

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:20.100 align:middle line:84%
much more ferocious
of an animal,

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.130 align:middle line:84%
whereas the pig is
much more portly, much

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.190 align:middle line:84%
more-- it has a greater
tendency to put on body fat,

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:84%
has a tendency toward
diseases that are not

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.560 align:middle line:90%
found in its wild progenitor.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:90%
We're the same way.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.600 align:middle line:90%
We are a domesticated species.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
We've been living indoors
for quite some time.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.650 align:middle line:84%
In the last few decades, we've
seen such a serious increase

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:44.460 align:middle line:84%
of industrialization that
our future generation

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.630 align:middle line:84%
or the children
of today are not--

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:50.880 align:middle line:84%
they epigenetically do
not resemble the people

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.380 align:middle line:90%
of a few generations ago.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
They're much more prone
to degenerative disease.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.610 align:middle line:84%
They're much more
prone to cancer.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:58.410 align:middle line:84%
They're much more
prone to heart disease.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:00.610 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing now cancer
and heart disease

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:01.800 align:middle line:90%
are the top killers.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.680 align:middle line:84%
I think this generation coming
up, it's 50% will have cancer.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.480 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.938 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's partly
how we're living.

00:10:07.938 --> 00:10:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And it's partly how
we're breeding ourselves.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.660 align:middle line:84%
We are the fundamental
domesticated species.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.054 align:middle line:90%
We're of the household.

00:10:14.054 --> 00:10:18.500 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the interesting
things about indigenous people

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.568 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't see a lot
of the chronic degenerative

00:10:23.568 --> 00:10:25.610 align:middle line:84%
diseases that we're seeing
in modern people, what

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:27.090 align:middle line:90%
we call "modern people."

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:29.257 align:middle line:84%
I think it's an unfair term
because in a lot of ways

00:10:29.257 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:84%
we're very backward
in how we live.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.710 align:middle line:84%
But we don't see the
cancer prevalence.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.630 align:middle line:90%
We don't see the heart disease.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:38.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the arthritic
conditions, not to the degree

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:90%
that we see today.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.870 align:middle line:84%
These are considered
diseases of civilized people.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.940 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot to do
with what we eat.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.503 align:middle line:84%
It has a lot to do
with how we breed.

00:10:45.503 --> 00:10:47.420 align:middle line:84%
But one of the really
interesting things about

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:50.492 align:middle line:84%
hunter-gatherer people or people
who do a very moderate amount

00:10:50.492 --> 00:10:51.950 align:middle line:84%
of agriculture--
we could call them

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:90%
"hunter-gatherer-gardeners."

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:middle line:84%
What we see in those
people is that they

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.060 align:middle line:84%
have an extremely high
amount of nutrition,

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.810 align:middle line:84%
an extremely low amount
of calories in their food

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:06.140 align:middle line:84%
compared to people in
modern civilization, which

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.390 align:middle line:84%
have a very high
amount of calories

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and a very low amount of
nutrition available to them.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.220 align:middle line:84%
So what happens for
an average person

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.950 align:middle line:84%
today in our civilization
is they're not

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.668 align:middle line:84%
getting enough, say,
vitamin A. They're

00:11:17.668 --> 00:11:20.210 align:middle line:84%
not getting enough vitamin D.
They're not even getting enough

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.870 align:middle line:84%
vitamin C. They're chronically
starved of nutrients.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So they keep eating
and eating and eating.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.940 align:middle line:84%
But the foods that
they keep eating

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.800 align:middle line:84%
don't have enough
of these nutrients

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.350 align:middle line:84%
for them ever to get the
stock that they need.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:35.708 align:middle line:84%
But what those foods do
have is a lot of calories.

00:11:35.708 --> 00:11:37.250 align:middle line:84%
So what happens is
they start to pack

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.950 align:middle line:84%
these calories onto their
body in the form of body fat.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.950 align:middle line:84%
And the body starts to
accumulate or bioaccumulate

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.240 align:middle line:84%
too much not just fat, but also
all the associated pollutants

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.560 align:middle line:90%
that are in that food supply.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.410 align:middle line:84%
The opposite and inverse is true
when we look at native peoples

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.660 align:middle line:84%
because what we see is that
the foods they're choosing

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.370 align:middle line:90%
are typically lower in calories.

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:58.670 align:middle line:84%
But they have 10 times
the fat-soluble vitamins.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.310 align:middle line:84%
Those are vitamins
A, D, E, K. And they

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:84%
have four times the
water soluble vitamins.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:84%
That's the B vitamins
and the C vitamins.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.360 align:middle line:84%
They have so much more
nutrition than what

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.880 align:middle line:84%
we have today, which is our
RDA, our Recommended Daily

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Allowance, how much
nutrient we're allowed.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
We're allowed far less than
our predecessors were getting.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.745 align:middle line:84%
But we also get
far more calories.

00:12:19.745 --> 00:12:21.620 align:middle line:84%
And this is leading to
all kinds of problems.

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:23.210 align:middle line:84%
And what we're
seeing today is when

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:25.290 align:middle line:84%
you get too many
carbohydrates in your diet,

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.710 align:middle line:84%
especially those refined
empty carbohydrates,

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:29.900 align:middle line:90%
we see things like diabetes.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.070 align:middle line:84%
We see blood sugar
and balance issues.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.870 align:middle line:90%
And we see a lot of weight gain.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And so this is a really
prevalent problem today

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:90%
because people are overfed.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:84%
But they're also
starving to death.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, Weston A. Price is are
really fascinating dentist

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:48.930 align:middle line:90%
in the early 1900s.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:52.860 align:middle line:84%
And he was just one of
those pioneering thinkers

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:84%
who dared to ask the question,
why are we getting cavities?

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, our teeth are
modified bones.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And so if we have a cavity,
we have a bone disease,

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:02.920 align:middle line:90%
a sort of bone disease.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.200 align:middle line:84%
We like to overlook all of
the dental issues going on

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.000 align:middle line:90%
in our culture.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to see that these
are degenerative diseases.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.395 align:middle line:84%
And our culture seems more
interested in filling teeth

00:13:11.395 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:84%
than it does in figuring out
why we have dental problems.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, Weston Price decided
to go around the world

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:84%
and do an anthropological
study of the teeth of people

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.880 align:middle line:84%
in many different tribes
and different civilizations

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.680 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.570 align:middle line:84%
What he found was that
not only cavities,

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.030 align:middle line:84%
but also the
crowding of the teeth

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:84%
and the loss of space
in the dental arch

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
doesn't really happen until
a culture switches over

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.540 align:middle line:84%
to our modern industrialized
types of foods.

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.000 align:middle line:84%
We were just talking about
these refined carbohydrates.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.070 align:middle line:84%
And that seems to be one
of the primary culprits.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:84%
I think a really helpful way
to think about white flour--

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.680 align:middle line:84%
white flour is essentially
the refined-out carbohydrate

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.580 align:middle line:90%
from a plant like wheat.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:84%
It's very similar to
what white sugar is.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.050 align:middle line:84%
White sugar is the purified
sucrose extracted out of, say,

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:56.970 align:middle line:90%
beets or sugar cane.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:58.860 align:middle line:90%
It's a pharmaceutical sugar.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.760 align:middle line:84%
Well, white flower's a
pharmaceutical carbohydrate

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:07.680 align:middle line:84%
in the same way that cocaine is
extracted out of a coca plant.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So you have the native
cocaine in the matrix

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.940 align:middle line:90%
of the plant itself.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Or you have the
pharmaceutical version.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.730 align:middle line:84%
To me, white sugar,
cocaine, white flour--

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:84%
they all fall in
the same category

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:84%
of a whitened, extracted,
purified substance that's

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:90%
drawn out of the plant kingdom.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.860 align:middle line:84%
All of them create
imbalances in the body

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.320 align:middle line:90%
and lead to a host of problems.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.470 align:middle line:84%
We know the problems
caused by something

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.052 align:middle line:90%
like cocaine, purified cocaine.

00:14:33.052 --> 00:14:34.260 align:middle line:90%
We know that causes problems.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.350 align:middle line:84%
We're comfortable with
referring to that as a drug.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.630 align:middle line:84%
We're becoming culturally
more comfortable

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:41.880 align:middle line:84%
with recognizing
white sugar as a drug.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:84%
I think people are
starting to understand

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
how addictive a substance it
is and how pharmaceutically

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.410 align:middle line:90%
extracted it is.

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.020 align:middle line:84%
We're beginning now-- it's
starting to filter in.

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.140 align:middle line:84%
People are getting it that
this white bread culture

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.540 align:middle line:90%
that we've grown up on--

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:84%
but what it is is
pharmaceutical food.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not real food.

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:03.210 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that when you
eat just the carbohydrate

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.090 align:middle line:84%
without the associated
vitamins, without the associated

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
minerals, without the
associated fats, which

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:12.720 align:middle line:84%
are critical for the
absorption, without the fibers,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.940 align:middle line:84%
you are essentially
poisoning yourself

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.962 align:middle line:84%
with too many calories
and not enough nutrition.

00:15:16.962 --> 00:15:18.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to
lead to problems.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.503 align:middle line:84%
And we can see those
problems all around us today.

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:25.200 align:middle line:90%


00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.212 align:middle line:84%
Right now you would have to make
it a full-time job of a team

00:15:28.212 --> 00:15:30.420 align:middle line:84%
just to keep up on the new
ones being created and put

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.220 align:middle line:90%
into the environment every day.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's a challenging
question to answer.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.060 align:middle line:84%
But for me, I think
the ones that I'm

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.910 align:middle line:84%
most hypersensitive to and
most aware of in my environment

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:42.810 align:middle line:84%
right now are probably the
plastics, the petrochemicals.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.250 align:middle line:84%
For a long time
you could imagine

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that most of the substances
people interacted with

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.730 align:middle line:84%
were fairly obviously
derived from nature.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.120 align:middle line:84%
So even a few hundred years
ago in a highly advanced

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.090 align:middle line:84%
civilization like the
European civilization,

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:57.840 align:middle line:84%
you would still be
able to look at a thing

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:59.172 align:middle line:90%
and tell what it came from.

00:15:59.172 --> 00:16:00.880 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you'd
be able to say, OK,

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle line:90%
these floors are marble.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And this pouch is
made of leather.

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And I can trace back
how that was made.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:84%
Today we interact with
so many plastics, so many

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.940 align:middle line:84%
petrochemicals that it's
very difficult to even know

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.540 align:middle line:90%
where a thing has come from.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, unfortunately, a lot
of these petrochemicals

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.000 align:middle line:84%
are biologically active when
they get into our bodies.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're biologically
active often in a mimicry

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:28.200 align:middle line:84%
of other endocrine system
hormones, particularly

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:90%
the estrogens.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing a lot
of reproductive issues

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:90%
arise out of this.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.080 align:middle line:84%
I want you to
remember that when you

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
come into contact with
a piece of plastic,

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:90%
that plastic is oil soluble.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:41.140 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
when you touch it,

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.740 align:middle line:84%
it's able to pass through
very often through your skin

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.540 align:middle line:84%
because your skin
has oils on it.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.270 align:middle line:84%
This is particularly true
of the soft plastics,

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.980 align:middle line:84%
like the cellophanes
and the packaging

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.690 align:middle line:90%
that we encounter all the time.

00:16:51.690 --> 00:16:54.160 align:middle line:84%
These soft plastics
have softeners in them.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:57.317 align:middle line:84%
And those softeners get
into our tissue very easily.

00:16:57.317 --> 00:16:58.650 align:middle line:90%
We absorb them through the skin.

00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.820 align:middle line:90%
They get into our blood.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The body thinks
these are estrogens.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.862 align:middle line:84%
And they're causing
a lot of problems

00:17:02.862 --> 00:17:04.770 align:middle line:84%
in men, particularly
low sperm counts,

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and women, a host of
reproductive issues.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.359 align:middle line:84%
I think that we're
pushing ourselves

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
towards a sterilization
kind of an event.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.220 align:middle line:84%
We're seeing epidemic
reproductive and fertility

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:90%
problems arising on a plastics.

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:18.390 align:middle line:84%
We all need to
become aware of that.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.030 align:middle line:84%
We need to become aware
of the pollutants that

00:17:21.030 --> 00:17:22.770 align:middle line:90%
are in the water supply today.

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:26.550 align:middle line:84%
Those are things like
chlorine, fluoride,

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.953 align:middle line:84%
and more and more
pharmaceutical drugs

00:17:28.953 --> 00:17:30.120 align:middle line:90%
that we're interacting with.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:90%
These things are toxins.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.360 align:middle line:90%
We call them "drugs."

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.890 align:middle line:90%
We call them "medicines."

00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:37.170 align:middle line:84%
We also know that
they're poisonous.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why there's
a host of warnings

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.100 align:middle line:90%
that come associated with them.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.170 align:middle line:84%
People have forgotten
but once knew

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that medicines, poison,
toxin were all synonyms.

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:48.595 align:middle line:90%
You could use them synonymously.

00:17:48.595 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So we're encountering a lot
of poisons in our environment

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.290 align:middle line:90%
today via pharmaceuticals.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:54.720 align:middle line:84%
So I'm very aware
of those things.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.637 align:middle line:84%
I think we need to be
aware of the metals that

00:17:56.637 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:90%
accumulate in our bones.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.450 align:middle line:84%
We need to be very thoughtful
about what heavy metals

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.150 align:middle line:84%
we come into contact
with, particularly

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.060 align:middle line:84%
mercury, which is still being
put into people's mouths.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.470 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting
that if you were

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:11.340 align:middle line:84%
to put even one filling worth
of mercury into a 5-acre lake,

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:84%
the EPA could shut
that lake down.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But you can put that into
a human being's mouth.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And we can believe the
mythos that it's not

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
going to bioaccumulate
into the bones.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:22.140 align:middle line:90%
We know it does.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.850 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
it's neurotoxic.

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.143 align:middle line:84%
We know that fluoride
is neurotoxic.

00:18:26.143 --> 00:18:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Really what I see is
we're in this world

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:84%
today where probably
your best bet

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
is to see how much you
can replace in your life

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.710 align:middle line:90%
with natural substances.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Can you get rid of the
nylon comforter on your bed

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.930 align:middle line:84%
and replace it with
cotton and down?

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Can you get rid of
the Gore-Tex jacket

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.160 align:middle line:90%
and replace it with wool?

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Can you get rid of
the plastic couch

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:90%
and replace it with leather?

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:90%
Can you bring in hemp?

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.160 align:middle line:90%
Can you bring in natural fibers?

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.110 align:middle line:84%
And can you begin to
get rid of these things?

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.540 align:middle line:84%
Because one day it
will be looked back on.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:57.540 align:middle line:84%
And we'll see that it's
a crime against humanity

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.920 align:middle line:84%
to take a BPA-laden
plastic bottle,

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:84%
fill it with pharmaceutically
active tap water,

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.670 align:middle line:84%
put in genetically modified
soy, microwave that, and give it

00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:10.280 align:middle line:90%
to a baby.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.440 align:middle line:84%
We'll see that that's a
crime against a newborn,

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.150 align:middle line:84%
that you are causing the
bioaccumulation in that child's

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:90%
tissues.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And these things
biologically are active.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.810 align:middle line:84%
And they're going to affect the
child for the rest of its life.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.450 align:middle line:84%
We need to be very thoughtful
about what we come into contact

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.570 align:middle line:84%
with that you can identify
as a natural substance

00:19:27.570 --> 00:19:28.560 align:middle line:90%
from your ecosystem.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:33.667 align:middle line:90%


00:19:33.667 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the biggest ways that the
food industry is manipulating

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:90%
our relationship to food is--

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:40.390 align:middle line:84%
and when we say,
the food industry,

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:42.140 align:middle line:84%
it's important we
understand that includes

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:45.595 align:middle line:84%
the FDA because they
really work hand in hand.

00:19:45.595 --> 00:19:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Some of the larger
corporations, particularly

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.840 align:middle line:84%
corporations like Monsanto, are
manipulating our food supply

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.670 align:middle line:84%
in a way that very few
people are aware of.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And that's the way that
they're genetically modifying

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:90%
organisms.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, what that means is they're
splicing genomic material

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.330 align:middle line:84%
from one species
into another species.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:02.830 align:middle line:84%
When we say
"species," by the way,

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:06.760 align:middle line:84%
"species" means these
are like individuals

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.320 align:middle line:90%
that can breed together.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So even though we're
very much like chimps,

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:84%
a human being is a distinct
species from a chimp.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.290 align:middle line:90%
We can't breed with a chimp.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:16.130 align:middle line:90%
We're a different species.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.200 align:middle line:84%
So there are these
ancient, ancient boundaries

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:21.880 align:middle line:84%
around a species that
keep it from being

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.220 align:middle line:84%
able to transport genetic
material from itself

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.270 align:middle line:90%
into another organism.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:27.130 align:middle line:90%
We're protected from that.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's been figured
out-- and I got to say,

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:84%
it's not as an exact
a science as they

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:33.370 align:middle line:90%
would like us to believe.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:37.360 align:middle line:84%
But they're able to use a gene
gun to bombard genetic material

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.100 align:middle line:84%
into a species from
another species

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.653 align:middle line:90%
to get traits to come through.

00:20:40.653 --> 00:20:42.320 align:middle line:84%
The way that was
discovered, by the way,

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.930 align:middle line:84%
was the Roundup
Ready toxin that's

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.620 align:middle line:84%
being sprayed all over
our food supply today

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:84%
is so toxic that it
inhibits enzymes in plants.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And it basically causes
plants not to be able to grow.

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, they eventually found
a bacteria behind the plant

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.030 align:middle line:84%
where that stuff was being
produced that was surviving

00:20:58.030 --> 00:20:59.130 align:middle line:90%
in the runoff.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.593 align:middle line:84%
And they were able
to take the gene

00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:03.010 align:middle line:84%
from that that caused it to
be able to survive the Roundup

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.718 align:middle line:84%
Ready and started
putting that in plants.

00:21:04.718 --> 00:21:08.248 align:middle line:84%
That opened up a host of genetic
manipulation opportunities.

00:21:08.248 --> 00:21:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And we're at a place
now where people

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.620 align:middle line:84%
don't realize how
much of their food

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.700 align:middle line:90%
has been modified genetically.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.330 align:middle line:84%
We don't know the
results of feeding people

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:19.090 align:middle line:84%
that because studies
are being suppressed.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:20.400 align:middle line:90%
We're not seeing any studies.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:24.520 align:middle line:84%
And don't you think that
before introducing genetically

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.570 align:middle line:84%
modified food to
a human population

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.643 align:middle line:84%
we would do some studies
to test if this is safe?

00:21:29.643 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:84%
But we're not doing
those studies.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And those studies-- the
few that have been done,

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:84%
they're often stopped because
we see that they're dangerous.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Or the results are very,
very muddled or hidden.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.060 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
there's no studies being done.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.040 align:middle line:84%
The genetic modification
of our food supply

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.460 align:middle line:84%
is probably the strangest
thing we're probably--

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.140 align:middle line:90%
it's like science fiction.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:51.820 align:middle line:84%
If people understood
that, they probably

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:53.195 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't want to
eat these foods.

00:21:53.195 --> 00:21:55.090 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately,
every time somebody

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:58.810 align:middle line:84%
gets a bottle of canola
oil, vegetable oil,

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.930 align:middle line:84%
they're most likely ingesting
genetically modified food.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Every time you go to the mall
and you buy a cotton outfit,

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:08.680 align:middle line:84%
you're buying genetically
modified cotton.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:84%
Every time you eat any
food containing soy--

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.890 align:middle line:84%
and by the way, that's
most any processed food--

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:17.970 align:middle line:84%
you're consuming
genetically modified soy.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.367 align:middle line:84%
So much of our food supply,
the corn, particularly corn--

00:22:21.367 --> 00:22:23.950 align:middle line:84%
every time you eat a processed
food, you're getting some corn.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.670 align:middle line:90%
You're getting some soy.

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:25.600 align:middle line:90%
You're getting some cotton.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.320 align:middle line:90%
And we're wearing it.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:84%
We're wearing genetically
modified species.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.120 align:middle line:84%
We're eating genetically
modified species.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.670 align:middle line:90%
It's a total experiment.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:32.860 align:middle line:90%
We don't know the results.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.680 align:middle line:84%
We have seen some studies
that show gene transfer

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.870 align:middle line:84%
from the organisms that
have been genetically

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.720 align:middle line:84%
modified into the bacteria
that reside in us.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:84%
So we know there has
been some horizontal gene

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:46.900 align:middle line:84%
transfer into our probiotic
organisms that inhabit us.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.280 align:middle line:84%
We know that this genetically
modified material gets into us.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.470 align:middle line:90%
The results of it we don't know.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:57.460 align:middle line:84%
And they've manipulated
the media enough

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.680 align:middle line:84%
that the story we get is
everything's status quo.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:00.743 align:middle line:90%
Everything's OK.

00:23:00.743 --> 00:23:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately,
we really don't know.

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:06.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think I, for one, will
choose to eat a diet free

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.250 align:middle line:90%
of those things.

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.138 align:middle line:84%
Even if I were to find
out they were safe,

00:23:12.138 --> 00:23:14.180 align:middle line:84%
I don't really want my
relationship to the Earth,

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.090 align:middle line:84%
to the planet, to the
plants and animals that

00:23:16.090 --> 00:23:18.910 align:middle line:84%
live here to be one where
my species is modifying

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:19.733 align:middle line:90%
their genetics.

00:23:19.733 --> 00:23:20.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's OK.

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.525 align:middle line:90%
I think it's immoral.

00:23:21.525 --> 00:23:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So personally, I choose
to eat a diet that's

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.570 align:middle line:90%
really free of those GMOs.

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:27.910 align:middle line:84%
But unfortunately, most of
the people I know and love

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.100 align:middle line:84%
are bioaccumulating these
toxic genetic materials

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:31.900 align:middle line:90%
in their body.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And time will tell what the
results of that will be.

00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:38.810 align:middle line:90%


00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:39.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, so we all have
these extreme cravings.

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.740 align:middle line:84%
They cause us to want to eat
all kinds of crazy things,

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.465 align:middle line:84%
particularly when we've
been raised around them.

00:23:47.465 --> 00:23:49.090 align:middle line:84%
One is because the
emotional connection

00:23:49.090 --> 00:23:51.790 align:middle line:84%
we have through marketing and
brand association and brand

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:52.993 align:middle line:90%
recognition.

00:23:52.993 --> 00:23:54.410 align:middle line:84%
You see these
stories all the time

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.980 align:middle line:84%
of kids' first words
being a brand name now.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.540 align:middle line:90%
We are so branded as a culture.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.040 align:middle line:84%
By the way, that term for me is
so funny because "brand" to me

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.520 align:middle line:84%
means the way that you
mark cattle with fire

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.505 align:middle line:84%
and approve that
you own that cattle.

00:24:08.505 --> 00:24:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's pretty
funny to me when I

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.330 align:middle line:84%
see somebody brand loyal
with their Nike imprint

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.920 align:middle line:84%
across their chest
like branded cattle.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.700 align:middle line:84%
And we become associated
to brands of foods,

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:19.917 align:middle line:90%
which is funny because--

00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:21.250 align:middle line:90%
say we went to the cereal aisle.

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.505 align:middle line:84%
I remember as a kid
begging my mother.

00:24:23.505 --> 00:24:24.630 align:middle line:90%
I want this kind of cereal.

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.780 align:middle line:90%
I want that kind of cereal.

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:27.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the ingredients,

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.360 align:middle line:90%
they're all the same cereal.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the
shapes and the colors.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.480 align:middle line:84%
And when we're children and we
get associated to these cartoon

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:38.980 align:middle line:84%
character foods, we become
emotionally connected to them.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.870 align:middle line:84%
As we get older, we
become very addicted

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:43.240 align:middle line:84%
to things, particularly some
of the neurotransmitters,

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.720 align:middle line:84%
like MSG, which is
in a lot of our food,

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.640 align:middle line:84%
a lot of the stimulants
that are in our food.

00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.260 align:middle line:84%
Why is it easier
for somebody to go

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.603 align:middle line:90%
get a soda instead of a juice?

00:24:53.603 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, they kind of
know that they're not

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.220 align:middle line:84%
going to get the kick
out of the juice.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.140 align:middle line:84%
They're addicted to
the caffeine in it.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.530 align:middle line:84%
We all come from cultures
that use stimulant plants.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:04.090 align:middle line:90%
That's in our history.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.065 align:middle line:84%
Anywhere there is a
caffeine-like molecule

00:25:06.065 --> 00:25:08.440 align:middle line:84%
in nature, the native people
there took advantage of that

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:09.250 align:middle line:90%
and used that.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.750 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't do it in this
refined way that we do it now.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.050 align:middle line:84%
And the thing is people
are addicted to it.

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And they require it
for their metabolism.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.130 align:middle line:84%
They know they're going
to get a headache.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:19.210 align:middle line:84%
They know they're
going to crash.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.585 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to get
through the workday if they just

00:25:21.585 --> 00:25:22.418 align:middle line:90%
go make that switch.

00:25:22.418 --> 00:25:24.418 align:middle line:84%
And so it's one of those
things that a lot of us

00:25:24.418 --> 00:25:25.570 align:middle line:90%
have to do gradually.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.743 align:middle line:84%
We have to wean ourselves off
of the neurotransmitters that

00:25:28.743 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:90%
are added to the food.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.140 align:middle line:84%
We have to wean ourselves
off of the stimulants that

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:32.950 align:middle line:90%
are in the food.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.168 align:middle line:84%
And we have to develop new
associations to healthy foods.

00:25:36.168 --> 00:25:38.210 align:middle line:84%
The average person walking
through the food court

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.110 align:middle line:84%
is not interested in the salad
at McDonald's because the salad

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.800 align:middle line:84%
at McDonald's is
not really salad.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.650 align:middle line:84%
It's been grown-- It's
monocropped in deficient soils.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.310 align:middle line:90%
It's got no nutrition in it.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:52.210 align:middle line:84%
Another thing is that
all through our history,

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.010 align:middle line:90%
we've really had to find--

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:54.880 align:middle line:90%
as a species.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.890 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking 200,000 years.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.680 align:middle line:84%
As a species, the big
challenge is to find calories.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:02.680 align:middle line:84%
And so our bodies are
biologically adapted to this.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.750 align:middle line:90%
We seek calorie sources.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.180 align:middle line:84%
When I say that, particularly
what I'm talking about

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.730 align:middle line:90%
are fats and sugars.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.980 align:middle line:84%
If we taste something
fatty or something sweet,

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.200 align:middle line:84%
we get an immediate
signal saying, yes, I

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.490 align:middle line:90%
want more of this.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Because for our
hunter-gatherer ancestors--

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:20.980 align:middle line:84%
and that goes right up to
a few hundred years ago--

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.590 align:middle line:84%
anywhere they could
find fat or sugar meant

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:25.120 align:middle line:90%
survival for those people.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.270 align:middle line:84%
It meant carrying
forth their genetics.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.150 align:middle line:84%
Today we have so
many calorie sources.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.100 align:middle line:84%
But we still have
the same signal.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.380 align:middle line:84%
So somebody bites
into a burger or they

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.180 align:middle line:90%
take a sip off a milkshake.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.920 align:middle line:84%
And they get those
fats and those sugars.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And their body says,
yes, more, because it's

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.560 align:middle line:84%
used to behaving in an
environment where there's feast

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.520 align:middle line:90%
and there's famine.

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:48.550 align:middle line:84%
The problem is we got feast
like nobody's business.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.923 align:middle line:90%
We just don't have any famine.

00:26:49.923 --> 00:26:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And so people keep eating,
keep eating, keep eating.

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:55.990 align:middle line:84%
And the idea of going to a
low-calorie food, like a salad,

00:26:55.990 --> 00:26:59.770 align:middle line:84%
like a juice, for the average
person doesn't make sense yet.

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.193 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know you've
experienced it.

00:27:01.193 --> 00:27:02.610 align:middle line:84%
When you start
drinking the juice,

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:03.970 align:middle line:84%
you start eating the
salad, especially

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.410 align:middle line:84%
if they're high
quality, you start

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:07.010 align:middle line:90%
to get feelings in your body.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.960 align:middle line:90%
They feel so good.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:84%
You develop new associations
of pleasure to those foods.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But there's that
weaning process.

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.485 align:middle line:84%
So the average
person isn't going

00:27:14.485 --> 00:27:16.360 align:middle line:84%
to make that jump without
a little education,

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:19.360 align:middle line:84%
a little coaxing, and probably
without some good role modeling

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.978 align:middle line:84%
from somebody who's doing
it, who they look up to,

00:27:21.978 --> 00:27:24.520 align:middle line:84%
who they respect and they see
getting the results they really

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.150 align:middle line:90%
want.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.110 align:middle line:84%
All human beings are driven
by pain and pleasure.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.152 align:middle line:90%
And we all want pleasure.

00:27:28.152 --> 00:27:29.740 align:middle line:90%
And we all want results.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.040 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, most people have
been programmed in such a way

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.998 align:middle line:84%
that they associate
pleasure with things

00:27:34.998 --> 00:27:36.040 align:middle line:90%
that actually cause pain.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:41.175 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.175 --> 00:27:42.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, the best
way to lose weight

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and to keep the weight
off is to move towards--

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:49.390 align:middle line:84%
sequentially and at
a sustainable pace--

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:53.380 align:middle line:84%
towards a diet that
at least approximates

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.983 align:middle line:84%
the diet that we are
biologically adapted to.

00:27:55.983 --> 00:27:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So if we look
around the world, we

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.760 align:middle line:84%
see human beings have been able
to inhabit the whole globe.

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And they've been able to do it
on a host of different foods.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.920 align:middle line:84%
From the extreme arctic,
where people eat almost

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.510 align:middle line:84%
exclusively animal fat and
muscle and organ meats,

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.580 align:middle line:84%
to the jungle, where
people had access

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:14.890 align:middle line:84%
to far more fruits and
far more plant material,

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:18.130 align:middle line:84%
we see people thriving and
people staying lean and healthy

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.810 align:middle line:84%
and avoiding
degenerative disease

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:23.360 align:middle line:84%
and not putting on extra weight
almost no matter what they eat.

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.010 align:middle line:84%
Now we are eating a diet that
no longer resembles that.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of like
if we lived in a zoo.

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.782 align:middle line:84%
If you put a human
being in a zoo the way

00:28:31.782 --> 00:28:34.240 align:middle line:84%
you put a chimpanzee in a zoo,
well, the question would be,

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.310 align:middle line:84%
what do we feed that
human in the zoo?

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, we don't feed chimpanzees
in zoos Captain Crunch cereal,

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:40.688 align:middle line:90%
Twinkies, and donuts.

00:28:40.688 --> 00:28:42.730 align:middle line:84%
We feed them a diet that
looks like the diet they

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.920 align:middle line:90%
eat in their ecosystem.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.930 align:middle line:84%
We sort of live in a
zoo-like environment now.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.973 align:middle line:84%
We live in this
artificial environment.

00:28:48.973 --> 00:28:50.890 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, we're
not feeding ourselves

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.390 align:middle line:84%
the foods we're
biologically adapted

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.070 align:middle line:84%
to, the foods of the
hunter-gatherers,

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:58.180 align:middle line:84%
the simple foods, the plant
foods, the fruits, the nuts,

00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:01.328 align:middle line:84%
the seeds, the vegetables, the
animal foods of high quality.

00:29:01.328 --> 00:29:03.370 align:middle line:84%
We're not feeding ourselves
these things anymore.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.013 align:middle line:84%
So we're eating
all refined foods.

00:29:05.013 --> 00:29:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Of course we're
putting on weight.

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.110 align:middle line:84%
If somebody really wants to
lose weight and take it off,

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:10.270 align:middle line:90%
here's what I recommend.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.750 align:middle line:84%
Start looking at the foods in
your house and asking yourself,

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:17.950 align:middle line:84%
could I replace this food with
a well-grown, local option

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:19.125 align:middle line:90%
that's not as processed?

00:29:19.125 --> 00:29:21.250 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if you're
used to making pancakes out

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:25.120 align:middle line:84%
of white flour, can you go to
a farm locally that produces

00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.470 align:middle line:90%
flour and stone grinds it?

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Can you find that?

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.640 align:middle line:84%
If you look in your fridge,
and you've got milk in there,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.390 align:middle line:84%
and you know it's
processed milk,

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:34.690 align:middle line:84%
and it's got the
growth hormone in it,

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and you know it's
pesticide laden,

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.153 align:middle line:84%
and you know there's pus in
it, can you find a farm locally

00:29:39.153 --> 00:29:40.570 align:middle line:84%
that can produce
that food for you

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:42.070 align:middle line:90%
the way people used to get it?

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:84%
If you've got the
bananas in your house

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.000 align:middle line:84%
from the supermarket,
can you replace them

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.958 align:middle line:90%
with an organic option?

00:29:46.958 --> 00:29:49.630 align:middle line:84%
Can you move in a
direction that brings you

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.630 align:middle line:84%
towards the reapproximation
of your natural diet?

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Can you do that?

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.350 align:middle line:84%
The convenience is getting
all your stuff in one place.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:59.740 align:middle line:84%
And for me, my life looks
like I've got a few outlets.

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.450 align:middle line:90%
I got a few farms that I go to.

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And I see different people
to get my food needs.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:07.660 align:middle line:84%
But those foods keep me lean,
keep me trim, keep me healthy,

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.290 align:middle line:84%
keep me vibrant,
keep me glowing,

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:11.650 align:middle line:84%
keep me wanting more
because the feeling

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:15.130 align:middle line:84%
I get from these highly
nutritive foods that look just

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.570 align:middle line:90%
like the foods I grew up with--

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I grew up
with all of the foods

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.140 align:middle line:90%
that I'm eating today.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.335 align:middle line:84%
I just eat the real
version of them today.

00:30:22.335 --> 00:30:24.460 align:middle line:84%
The foods I eat today are
not genetically modified.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.040 align:middle line:84%
The food that I eat today
have not been processed.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.720 align:middle line:84%
The foods that I
eat today have not

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.120 align:middle line:84%
had all their goodness
removed and have

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.100 align:middle line:90%
been grown in real soil.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:35.800 align:middle line:84%
If you can get those foods
and a little bit of movement

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:39.073 align:middle line:84%
into your life, it's not
hard to keep weight off.

00:30:39.073 --> 00:30:40.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of us-- we
have some healing to do.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.110 align:middle line:84%
We have recovery to do because
the world we grew up in

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:46.810 align:middle line:84%
has been such a barrage
against our nervous system,

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:48.310 align:middle line:90%
our endocrine system.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.570 align:middle line:84%
Our health has
been under attack.

00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:53.320 align:middle line:84%
So sometimes there's going
to be a period of healing.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Probably the best thing a
person can do in the beginning

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.190 align:middle line:84%
is clean themselves out and get
on a detoxification program.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.870 align:middle line:84%
That looks like eating
a lot of salads,

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.912 align:middle line:84%
drinking a lot of juices,
eating a lot of fruits.

00:31:03.912 --> 00:31:04.810 align:middle line:90%
And that's fun.

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:05.960 align:middle line:90%
That's fun for a while.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.900 align:middle line:84%
And when the weight
starts coming off,

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.040 align:middle line:90%
people become so excited.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.830 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to stop
and then eventually start

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:15.370 align:middle line:84%
to add more and more foods back
in from healthy sources that

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.440 align:middle line:84%
look like the foods
they used to eat

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.730 align:middle line:84%
but are actually more
satisfying and more nutritive.

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:26.060 align:middle line:84%
And they'll find that they can
live a life of not just being

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.870 align:middle line:84%
fit and trim, but actually
feeling how they've always

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.298 align:middle line:84%
wanted to feel in a
body that works properly

00:31:31.298 --> 00:31:32.590 align:middle line:90%
and that stays healthy forever.

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:37.430 align:middle line:90%


00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.510 align:middle line:84%
The reason people put the
weight back on after diet

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:43.000 align:middle line:84%
is because most
of these diets are

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.745 align:middle line:90%
not sustainable ways of eating.

00:31:44.745 --> 00:31:46.120 align:middle line:84%
You simply can't
do them forever.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.030 align:middle line:84%
And if you can, you're
one of those rare, driven,

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:51.250 align:middle line:84%
type-A individuals
that will force--

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:54.320 align:middle line:84%
you will mold reality
to whatever you desire.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:55.690 align:middle line:90%
And those are rare people.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want
to be that person.

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So for me, growing up,
I was an overweight kid.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was always
trying to figure out

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.120 align:middle line:90%
how to lose the weight.

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:04.920 align:middle line:90%
And I was seeing--

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I would try these
different approaches.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.730 align:middle line:84%
And none of them were
really structured

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.325 align:middle line:90%
in a way you could eat forever.

00:32:11.325 --> 00:32:13.450 align:middle line:84%
So I think what happens is
that we set ourselves up

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:17.530 align:middle line:84%
for failure because,
yes, you can manipulate

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.810 align:middle line:90%
the ratios of calories.

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.610 align:middle line:84%
You can manipulate
the ratio of fat

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:24.280 align:middle line:84%
to protein to
carbohydrate infinitely.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.960 align:middle line:84%
We keep seeing all
these variations.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.960 align:middle line:84%
So I remember the high
carbohydrate, low fat.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And then it switched
to, well, let's go

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.410 align:middle line:90%
high protein, low carbohydrate.

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:34.868 align:middle line:84%
And then it switched to high
fat, moderate carbohydrate.

00:32:34.868 --> 00:32:36.160 align:middle line:90%
It just keeps switching around.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And all of these
things have an effect

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.250 align:middle line:84%
because what you're doing
is restricting calories

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:40.180 align:middle line:90%
from people.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Or you're manipulating the
way their metabolism works.

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.500 align:middle line:84%
Eventually they're
going to fall back

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.980 align:middle line:84%
into a rhythm of living
for life because it's not

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.178 align:middle line:84%
comfortable to make your
whole life about food.

00:32:50.178 --> 00:32:52.720 align:middle line:84%
So eventually it's going to come
back if you haven't actually

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.803 align:middle line:90%
changed what you're doing.

00:32:53.803 --> 00:32:55.512 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
people don't understand

00:32:55.512 --> 00:32:57.490 align:middle line:84%
is all these diets are
just rearrangements

00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.555 align:middle line:90%
of the same foods.

00:32:59.555 --> 00:33:01.180 align:middle line:84%
People are talking
about the same foods

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.290 align:middle line:90%
from the supermarket.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.720 align:middle line:84%
So if you eat from this
aisle and not this aisle--

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:08.200 align:middle line:84%
and it's constantly rearranging
a host of suite of foods

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.810 align:middle line:84%
that we know are not
beneficial to people.

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:12.550 align:middle line:84%
Very rarely do you
see-- what we're

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.040 align:middle line:84%
talking about today
is not a diet,

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.580 align:middle line:84%
not in the sense
of a weight loss.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.510 align:middle line:84%
They used to call
these "reducing diets."

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.218 align:middle line:84%
If you look in any of
the old literature,

00:33:22.218 --> 00:33:25.810 align:middle line:84%
say, from the 1950s, you'll see
this term a "reducing diet."

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:28.030 align:middle line:84%
The definition of
a diet is the foods

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:32.080 align:middle line:84%
that an organism habitually
eats to sustain itself.

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So what we're talking
about is a real diet

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of
what a species eats.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.182 align:middle line:84%
When we get onto
our real diet, we

00:33:39.182 --> 00:33:41.140 align:middle line:84%
don't have to think about
these things anymore.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.090 align:middle line:84%
But if we're going to eat
from that suite of foods that

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:44.310 align:middle line:84%
exists in the
supermarket, we're going

00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:45.340 align:middle line:90%
to constantly have problems.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:46.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to constantly
have to monitor ourselves

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:48.610 align:middle line:84%
because these
foods make you fat.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:49.840 align:middle line:90%
These foods make you sick.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.300 align:middle line:84%
These foods break down your
pancreas and give you diabetes.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.110 align:middle line:90%
These foods cause cancer.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to have to
constantly play with them

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:84%
to try to moderate that in a
very scientific way, in a very

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.440 align:middle line:84%
uncomfortable way, in a way
that's counterintuitive to us.

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.835 align:middle line:84%
When we step outside of
that supermarket setting,

00:34:04.835 --> 00:34:06.460 align:middle line:84%
we start going to
the farmers' markets.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:07.627 align:middle line:90%
We start going to the farms.

00:34:07.627 --> 00:34:10.648 align:middle line:84%
We maybe even step outside and
forage some of our own foods.

00:34:10.648 --> 00:34:12.190 align:middle line:84%
When we start to
get foods like that,

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.610 align:middle line:84%
we don't have to think
about this anymore.

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:14.735 align:middle line:90%
We let our bodies guide us.

00:34:14.735 --> 00:34:16.152 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
worry we're going

00:34:16.152 --> 00:34:18.489 align:middle line:84%
to put the weight back on
because your body does not

00:34:18.489 --> 00:34:20.199 align:middle line:90%
want to be overweight.

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:22.510 align:middle line:84%
This is one of the biggest
tricks the marketeers have

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:23.800 align:middle line:90%
used against us.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:28.000 align:middle line:84%
They convince us that our body
is trying to get fat on us.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.830 align:middle line:84%
And we have to somehow
whip it into shape,

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.380 align:middle line:84%
stop it, fight it all the
time because if we let it go,

00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.550 align:middle line:90%
it's going to get fat.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:90%
That's not reality.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.070 align:middle line:84%
Your body is designed
to be healthy.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.800 align:middle line:90%
Health is the natural state.

00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:40.630 align:middle line:84%
And if we let our
body do what it

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:42.190 align:middle line:84%
wants to do in an
environment where

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:43.690 align:middle line:84%
all the foods are
healthy choices--

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:45.699 align:middle line:84%
all of them-- we don't have to
be concerned with these things

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:46.499 align:middle line:90%
anymore.

00:34:46.499 --> 00:34:48.352 align:middle line:84%
And we can live without
fear of weight gain.

00:34:48.352 --> 00:34:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And we can live without fear
of degenerative disease.

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:55.659 align:middle line:90%


00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:57.250 align:middle line:90%
We require exercise.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:34:59.590 align:middle line:90%
Of course, exercise feels good.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.170 align:middle line:90%
Extreme exercise is not healthy.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:04.990 align:middle line:84%
We know that marathon
running is not healthy.

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:06.730 align:middle line:84%
It damages the
joints of the body.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not a healthy thing to do.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.740 align:middle line:84%
I know people that run
100-mile races, good friends.

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.270 align:middle line:90%
They know that's not healthy.

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:15.440 align:middle line:90%
They're driven to that goal.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.830 align:middle line:90%
But it's not good for the body.

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:18.868 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's cliche now.

00:35:18.868 --> 00:35:20.410 align:middle line:84%
But we grew up with
no pain, no gain.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:22.450 align:middle line:84%
We grew up with this
idea that, again, you

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:26.230 align:middle line:84%
have to punish your body
into submission in order

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.200 align:middle line:84%
to get it under control
because we so fear

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.090 align:middle line:90%
the wildness of this world.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:34.820 align:middle line:84%
We think of our body-- we sense
that our bodies are animalia.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.620 align:middle line:90%
They're animal.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:36.730 align:middle line:90%
We're animals.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're afraid of the
wildness of that thing.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.680 align:middle line:84%
And then if we let it go
unchecked and out of control,

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.830 align:middle line:84%
it's going to lead us
into total barbarousness.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:47.950 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be fat oafs
sitting around all day,

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.090 align:middle line:90%
eating gluttonously.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:52.157 align:middle line:84%
Nothing could be
further from the truth,

00:35:52.157 --> 00:35:53.740 align:middle line:84%
just like all the
other organisms that

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.780 align:middle line:84%
inhabit the planet
who all maintain

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:58.360 align:middle line:84%
their health effortlessly
just by going out

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.570 align:middle line:84%
on their daily business of
being a squirrel or being a fox

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.010 align:middle line:90%
or being a bird.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And we think that the
only way we can be healthy

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.870 align:middle line:90%
is to abuse ourselves.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we do abusive
diet programs.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.320 align:middle line:84%
And we do abusive
exercise programs.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And if we're real good, we
combine abusive exercise

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:15.580 align:middle line:90%
and abusive diets together.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.440 align:middle line:90%
It's madness.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:18.985 align:middle line:90%
Walking every day is exercise.

00:36:18.985 --> 00:36:20.560 align:middle line:90%
It's plenty of exercise.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:23.390 align:middle line:84%
Moving your body around a
little bit-- plenty of exercise.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:26.110 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to do something
extreme unless you're

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.570 align:middle line:84%
trying to get in shape
on extremely refined

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.690 align:middle line:84%
carbohydrates and
extremely refined fats

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and toxic, rancid fats
and denatured proteins.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're eating these
foods all the time

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.600 align:middle line:84%
that by their very
nature are going

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.190 align:middle line:84%
to lead some portion of
the population to obesity.

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:44.440 align:middle line:84%
Some people have metabolisms
that can handle it better

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:44.800 align:middle line:90%
than others.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.974 align:middle line:84%
But many people will be
led to obesity that way.

00:36:46.974 --> 00:36:48.766 align:middle line:84%
And then the only way
they're going to able

00:36:48.766 --> 00:36:50.641 align:middle line:84%
to stay on those foods
and lose the weight is

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:54.970 align:middle line:84%
to either get a gastric bypass
or do some extreme workout

00:36:54.970 --> 00:36:57.190 align:middle line:84%
program that will
not be sustainable

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.130 align:middle line:84%
and unfortunately won't supply
the nutrients that they need

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.200 align:middle line:90%
to recover from the workouts.

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.540 align:middle line:84%
So the marathon
runner on spaghetti--

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.850 align:middle line:84%
eventually the cartilage in
his knees is going to go.

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:08.520 align:middle line:84%
And if he's not
getting those proteins,

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.870 align:middle line:84%
those cartilaginous
proteins in his diet,

00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:12.820 align:middle line:84%
his knees are going
to break down.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:14.350 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to be able
to keep doing the exercise.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Then the weights going
to come on because he's

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.562 align:middle line:90%
eating the carbohydrates.

00:37:16.562 --> 00:37:17.660 align:middle line:90%
It's just a cycle.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:19.120 align:middle line:90%
So again, it's the same story.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.920 align:middle line:84%
The same story is come
back to the Earth.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.820 align:middle line:90%
Come back to nature.

00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Come back to ecosystems
and real food

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:28.540 align:middle line:84%
and real exercise, which is
going about your day today.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.040 align:middle line:84%
That's always been
enough exercise.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.420 align:middle line:90%
So I sometimes see--

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:35.050 align:middle line:84%
I've got a great image at
home of some Aboriginals

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:36.250 align:middle line:90%
from Australia.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:39.630 align:middle line:84%
And they have bodies unlike
any man I've ever met.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.200 align:middle line:84%
The abdominal development,
the pec development--

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.000 align:middle line:90%
it's incredible.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.110 align:middle line:84%
They look like fitness models
or lightweight bodybuilders.

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.163 align:middle line:84%
Their exercise is
going about their day.

00:37:49.163 --> 00:37:51.580 align:middle line:84%
They don't get up in the morning
and do a push-up routine.

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.205 align:middle line:84%
They don't get up
and do an ab routine.

00:37:53.205 --> 00:37:54.250 align:middle line:90%
They don't need to.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:55.450 align:middle line:90%
You go about your day.

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are designed
for the day-to-day living.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.360 align:middle line:84%
The problems arise when
we take ourselves out

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.210 align:middle line:84%
of our natural
environment and we

00:38:04.210 --> 00:38:06.100 align:middle line:84%
subject ourselves to
unnatural habitat,

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.142 align:middle line:90%
which is what we've done.

00:38:07.142 --> 00:38:11.490 align:middle line:90%


00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Foods that detoxify the body--

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.840 align:middle line:84%
some are really obvious,
and some are not.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Some of the more obvious
ones are green vegetables,

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.100 align:middle line:90%
chlorophyll-rich foods.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.320 align:middle line:84%
In hospitals,
chlorophyll is used

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.420 align:middle line:84%
or was used as an internal
deodorant for people

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.005 align:middle line:90%
who had a lot of body odor.

00:38:27.005 --> 00:38:29.130 align:middle line:84%
Chlorophyll is a great way
to clean our bodies out.

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:33.000 align:middle line:84%
So those are, of course, all
of our well-grown, heirloom,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.540 align:middle line:90%
organic vegetables.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:37.033 align:middle line:84%
These are fantastic for
cleaning our bodies out.

00:38:37.033 --> 00:38:38.700 align:middle line:84%
There's some less
obvious stuff as well,

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.310 align:middle line:84%
though, like gelatinous
plant foods--

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:46.170 align:middle line:84%
for instance, things like
chia seeds or aloe vera

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:48.060 align:middle line:84%
or the seaweeds,
these foods that

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:50.430 align:middle line:84%
have a gel that they
secrete when they get wet.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.190 align:middle line:84%
What those do-- those gels move
through our intestinal tract.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.530 align:middle line:84%
If we eat something
like aloe vera,

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.200 align:middle line:84%
this slimy, slippery
food, if we can blend that

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.130 align:middle line:84%
into a drink some way
or something like that

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and get it into our bodies,
these gelatinous fibers

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.290 align:middle line:84%
moved through our
intestinal tract,

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:08.310 align:middle line:84%
absorbing things, binding
them, and passing them through.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.140 align:middle line:84%
Particularly what
they do is they

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.080 align:middle line:84%
absorb the bile salts that
are released by the liver,

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:14.770 align:middle line:84%
bind those up,
and pass those out

00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:17.160 align:middle line:84%
and with it all the
fat-soluble toxins the liver's

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:18.410 align:middle line:90%
trying to get rid of.

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:20.123 align:middle line:84%
If we don't have these
gelatinous fibers,

00:39:20.123 --> 00:39:21.540 align:middle line:84%
we tend to reabsorb
a lot of that.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:24.660 align:middle line:84%
So the liver tries to get rid of
something, puts it in the bile,

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.790 align:middle line:84%
dumps it into the small
intestine hoping that it

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.200 align:middle line:90%
eventually gets out of us.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.740 align:middle line:90%
But it gets reabsorbed.

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.150 align:middle line:84%
So one of the reasons that that
gelatinous fibers-- like chia

00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:34.620 align:middle line:90%
seed is another great example.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:35.820 align:middle line:90%
You put that in your body.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And that can really do a
lot to clean out the liver.

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:41.190 align:middle line:84%
You combine that with
the juices or salads

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.830 align:middle line:84%
of fresh, young,
green vegetables,

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:45.480 align:middle line:84%
you've got a really
great program

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.860 align:middle line:90%
for cleaning the body out.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.420 align:middle line:84%
Fruits can be very
good, though I'd

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.390 align:middle line:84%
recommend going with
fruits with seeds instead

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:56.160 align:middle line:84%
of sterile foods, foods that
have been hybridized until they

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.630 align:middle line:90%
lose their ability to reproduce.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:59.820 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important that
we look at things like berries

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:00.960 align:middle line:90%
that still contain their seeds.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.710 align:middle line:84%
When we bring those
foods into our bodies,

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.740 align:middle line:90%
we get cleansed very easily.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.320 align:middle line:84%
I think removing animal
foods from our diet

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.022 align:middle line:84%
and increasing plant food is a
great way to cleanse ourselves.

00:40:10.022 --> 00:40:11.730 align:middle line:84%
And then the inverse
is true when we want

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:12.960 align:middle line:90%
to build our bodies back up.

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.860 align:middle line:84%
And so we get control
over these two horses.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.060 align:middle line:90%
There's a great analogy.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.850 align:middle line:84%
If you've got two horses, and
one's lame and the other one's

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:24.330 align:middle line:84%
going full speed, you're really
just going to go in a circle.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:27.130 align:middle line:84%
You need two healthy horses
to go in a straight line,

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:28.470 align:middle line:90%
similarly with our foods.

00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:31.390 align:middle line:84%
If we steer it that way,
we build our bodies up

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:32.190 align:middle line:90%
with animal foods.

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.640 align:middle line:84%
We detoxify our body
with plant foods.

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And when we're in a good
state of homeostasis,

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.170 align:middle line:84%
we can steer both of
those horses accurately.

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:41.790 align:middle line:90%
We can move in a straight line.

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:44.350 align:middle line:84%
But cleansing our bodies
is not complicated.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:45.930 align:middle line:84%
It's not difficult.
It's just going

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:47.900 align:middle line:84%
to require high-quality,
green plant food.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:49.610 align:middle line:84%
It's going to require
gelatinous fibers.

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:51.630 align:middle line:84%
It's going to
require good water.

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.130 align:middle line:84%
It's going to mean
needing good air.

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:54.660 align:middle line:84%
It's going to mean
getting sunlight.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.118 align:middle line:84%
And our body wants
to cleanse itself.

00:40:57.118 --> 00:40:58.410 align:middle line:90%
It's looking to cleanse itself.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:40:59.702 align:middle line:90%
It knows how to cleanse itself.

00:40:59.702 --> 00:41:01.680 align:middle line:84%
You don't even have to
really do very much.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:05.163 align:middle line:84%
Just input gentle
foods, be out in nature,

00:41:05.163 --> 00:41:07.080 align:middle line:84%
and your body will cleanse
itself very easily.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:11.880 align:middle line:90%


00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.680 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.560 align:middle line:84%
People can eat themselves
sexier, for sure.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.223 align:middle line:84%
And really, I think
if you look at--

00:41:17.223 --> 00:41:18.140 align:middle line:90%
there's great studies.

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.570 align:middle line:90%
I love these studies that show--

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.030 align:middle line:84%
they'll do a computer
model of what a man thinks

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:25.340 align:middle line:84%
a woman's attracted to and
what a woman is actually

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:26.270 align:middle line:90%
attracted to.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:29.510 align:middle line:84%
And typically men think a guy
25 pounds heavier, particularly

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:32.620 align:middle line:84%
in the chest and biceps, is
what a woman's looking for.

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.520 align:middle line:84%
And really, what do
people find sexy?

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.530 align:middle line:90%
They find confidence sexy.

00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:37.910 align:middle line:90%
They find health sexy.

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:39.710 align:middle line:84%
And both of those
things can really

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:42.110 align:middle line:90%
come about from what we eat.

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:45.770 align:middle line:84%
We are naturally designed to
screen each other for health

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:47.720 align:middle line:90%
for reproductive purposes.

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.750 align:middle line:90%
We look at each other.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.277 align:middle line:90%
And we see glowing skin.

00:41:50.277 --> 00:41:51.110 align:middle line:90%
We see shining eyes.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's sexy to us.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.870 align:middle line:84%
A confident person
is sexy to us.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you can accomplish that
through food pretty easily.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're constantly
barraged with the idea

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.620 align:middle line:84%
that technology is
the way to sexy,

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.690 align:middle line:84%
whether that's
medical intervention

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.330 align:middle line:84%
or whether that's
pharmaceutically based

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:11.432 align:middle line:84%
or whether that's some
kind of longevity cream

00:42:11.432 --> 00:42:12.890 align:middle line:84%
we're going to put
on our face that

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.320 align:middle line:84%
comes from some pharmaceutical
company somewhere.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.720 align:middle line:84%
But really, these
things come from nature.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Caring for our skin
is pretty simple.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.795 align:middle line:90%
It needs oil.

00:42:20.795 --> 00:42:22.770 align:middle line:90%
It needs good, food-grade oils.

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:23.570 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Because your skin has something
on it called an "acid mantle."

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And that's really where the
bacteria that inhabit our skin

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:31.070 align:middle line:90%
live and keep us healthy.

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:33.770 align:middle line:84%
When we wash with alkaline
soaps, for instance,

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:37.040 align:middle line:84%
when we do the TV commercial
scrub down and lather up

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.840 align:middle line:84%
and we put the suds
all over us, we

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.580 align:middle line:90%
strip those oils off our body.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.310 align:middle line:84%
We strip that acid
mantle off our body.

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And we become really
susceptible to skin infections.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.030 align:middle line:90%
This leads to things like acne.

00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:50.120 align:middle line:84%
This leads to things
like fungal infections.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Really what our skin's requiring
is oils, the same kind of oils

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:56.950 align:middle line:84%
you'd eat, like coconut
oil, like olive oil.

00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:59.450 align:middle line:84%
These are the things you see
in really high-end skin creams.

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:01.363 align:middle line:84%
You actually see
food-based oils.

00:43:01.363 --> 00:43:02.780 align:middle line:84%
We put those on
our skin, our skin

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.700 align:middle line:84%
can be colonated again
by the bacteria that

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.838 align:middle line:90%
live in our acid mantle.

00:43:05.838 --> 00:43:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And we actually become
very immune to things that

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.523 align:middle line:90%
would normally attack our skin.

00:43:09.523 --> 00:43:10.940 align:middle line:84%
We see this all
through the world.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.220 align:middle line:84%
We see it in ancient
Rome and Greece,

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:14.540 align:middle line:90%
where they used the olive oil.

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.832 align:middle line:84%
We see this in Polynesia,
where they cover their bodies

00:43:16.832 --> 00:43:17.840 align:middle line:90%
with coconut oil.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.420 align:middle line:84%
The skin can be fed just
like the digestive tract.

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:22.220 align:middle line:90%
It can be fed.

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:23.030 align:middle line:90%
It lives on oils.

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.480 align:middle line:84%
And so it's not hard to
take care of ourselves.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.600 align:middle line:90%
It's not hard to be sexy.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.390 align:middle line:84%
You just got to learn
how to be healthy.

00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And the real trick to
learning how to be healthy

00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:35.330 align:middle line:84%
is to stop listening to all
of the white noise coming

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.400 align:middle line:84%
from the media about
our health and looking

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.730 align:middle line:90%
at how our ancestors lived.

00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:39.560 align:middle line:90%
And it wasn't that long ago.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.768 align:middle line:90%
And it's not that hard to do.

00:43:40.768 --> 00:43:45.320 align:middle line:90%


00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, cultured foods
have been around as long

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:49.330 align:middle line:84%
as people have been
around harvesting food.

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:51.288 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is we
didn't have refrigeration.

00:43:51.288 --> 00:43:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And things-- they go bad
after a few days, or "go bad."

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.540 align:middle line:84%
Really it means they
begin to ferment

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and break down because other
organisms start breaking them

00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.440 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, human beings over time
learned how to control that

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:04.498 align:middle line:84%
and learned how to actually
create very beneficial colonies

00:44:04.498 --> 00:44:05.540 align:middle line:90%
of organisms in the food.

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I'm talking
about cultured food,

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:08.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about yogurt.

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:09.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about kimchi.

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:11.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about sauerkraut.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.120 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about wines and
beers made in the old way.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.610 align:middle line:84%
These are foods that have been
colonated by other organisms

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.160 align:middle line:84%
and transformed by
those organisms.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.070 align:middle line:84%
Those foods were condiments
all through our history

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:23.360 align:middle line:90%
as a civilization.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.430 align:middle line:84%
We used those foods
to help us digest

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and to replenish
the bacteria that

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.450 align:middle line:90%
colonizes our intestinal tract.

00:44:29.450 --> 00:44:30.380 align:middle line:90%
People know this.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:34.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are a lot more
other organisms in your body

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.250 align:middle line:90%
than there are cells.

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:37.850 align:middle line:84%
And so we know we're
about 4 to 10 times

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:40.790 align:middle line:84%
more bacteria
primarily in our gut

00:44:40.790 --> 00:44:42.770 align:middle line:84%
than we are human cells
in our whole body.

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:45.110 align:middle line:84%
I like to tell people,
you are an organism.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:47.630 align:middle line:90%
You are cells famed by bacteria.

00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It's bacteria that
take care of you.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:50.720 align:middle line:84%
They colonate you
and protect you

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.660 align:middle line:84%
from disbiotic organisms, the
ones that cause a disease.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.610 align:middle line:84%
And they live all in
your digestive tract.

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, with the
amount of chlorine people

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:00.470 align:middle line:84%
are exposed to in their
drinking water, in their shower,

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:02.510 align:middle line:84%
with the amount of
antibiotics people take,

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:05.180 align:middle line:84%
these things kill off the
microbes that live in them

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:08.252 align:middle line:84%
and strip them of their
primary immune system.

00:45:08.252 --> 00:45:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Those are the bacteria that
are there to protect you.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.360 align:middle line:90%
How do you get that back?

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.235 align:middle line:84%
Well, you get it back
through fermented food,

00:45:13.235 --> 00:45:15.290 align:middle line:90%
properly fermented food.

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:16.610 align:middle line:90%
The process is simple.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:18.440 align:middle line:90%
You take some cabbage.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:19.393 align:middle line:90%
You shred it up.

00:45:19.393 --> 00:45:21.560 align:middle line:84%
You put it in water with
salt. And you press it down

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:22.130 align:middle line:90%
under the water.

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:23.838 align:middle line:84%
And two weeks later,
you have sauerkraut.

00:45:23.838 --> 00:45:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's been done
all over the world.

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.980 align:middle line:84%
And we call those
"cultured foods. "

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:30.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, we also say that
if you go traveling,

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.020 align:middle line:90%
you become more cultured.

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:33.830 align:middle line:90%
Why do we say that?

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:34.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
interesting things

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.357 align:middle line:84%
is when you go to
another culture,

00:45:36.357 --> 00:45:39.560 align:middle line:84%
you actually get the bacteria
of those people into your body.

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Every person has a unique
bacterial profile in their gut.

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And the more places you've gone,
the more cultures you have,

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.190 align:middle line:84%
the greater that
fingerprint becomes.

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:50.480 align:middle line:84%
You're more cultured not
just with art and literature.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.180 align:middle line:84%
You're literally more cultured
in your digestive tract,

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:56.720 align:middle line:84%
more immune to things
than you were before.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.610 align:middle line:84%
The way we can
build that immunity

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:00.560 align:middle line:90%
is by eating cultured foods.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:02.810 align:middle line:84%
And what we see is, what's
really a culture all about?

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:04.935 align:middle line:84%
Because culture does mean
to us art and literature.

00:46:04.935 --> 00:46:11.270 align:middle line:84%
But culture also means where a
bacteria or yeast is growing.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And I think really there is this
association between a culture

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.190 align:middle line:90%
and what foods it cultures.

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And those were really
one time more synonymous

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:20.160 align:middle line:90%
and more connected.

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:25.250 align:middle line:84%
So we see if we go to Japan,
we see miso is their culture.

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:27.050 align:middle line:84%
If we go to Northern
Europe, we see

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.060 align:middle line:90%
sauerkraut is their culture.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:34.580 align:middle line:84%
If we go to, say, Russia, we
see kombucha as their culture.

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:37.100 align:middle line:84%
And they all have these
different cultured foods

00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.530 align:middle line:84%
that speak for who their
culture is and speaks

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.960 align:middle line:84%
for what cultures
live inside them.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And accessing these
foods today means

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.070 align:middle line:84%
we can get some of these
cultures back in our body.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:50.200 align:middle line:90%


00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.667 align:middle line:84%
Well, OK, I really
do believe everything

00:46:52.667 --> 00:46:54.820 align:middle line:90%
we need is all around us.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.820 align:middle line:84%
I think that in our modern
world, for some of us

00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:58.445 align:middle line:84%
it's a lot closer
than a 5-mile radius.

00:46:58.445 --> 00:47:01.140 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, everything we need to
survive is in a 5-mile radius

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.030 align:middle line:84%
just about anywhere
in the world.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:04.950 align:middle line:84%
We know that's
true because we see

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:07.410 align:middle line:84%
that the whole world's been
populated and inhabited

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:09.180 align:middle line:90%
by people.

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.790 align:middle line:84%
It's pretty amazing to me to
know that in this environment

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:13.740 align:middle line:84%
where I am right now,
I, could step outside

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.180 align:middle line:90%
into the woods of Maine.

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.830 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, everything
I need is here.

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:19.140 align:middle line:84%
Do I have the skill
set for everything?

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:20.560 align:middle line:90%
Do I need to learn it?

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Maybe.

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.030 align:middle line:84%
If I live in a city,
that's my landscape.

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:26.070 align:middle line:84%
That's my ecosystem,
essentially.

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:28.380 align:middle line:84%
And everything I need-- is
it within a 5-mile radius?

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:29.220 align:middle line:90%
It better be.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.637 align:middle line:84%
That's what cities
are set up for.

00:47:30.637 --> 00:47:34.230 align:middle line:84%
They're set up for
people on foot.

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:36.990 align:middle line:84%
As a wild food
forager here, I know

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.698 align:middle line:84%
that the things that I
need are within reach.

00:47:39.698 --> 00:47:40.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't like going to the city.

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:43.320 align:middle line:84%
But when I do, I know that
what I need is within reach.

00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:45.480 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I have this
deep level of trust

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.870 align:middle line:84%
that at all times everything
I need is basically at hand.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:51.210 align:middle line:84%
When we go to the city,
I like to think of myself

00:47:51.210 --> 00:47:53.820 align:middle line:84%
as supermarket
foraging sometimes,

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:55.350 align:middle line:90%
taking what's in my landscape.

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And that's what's
in my landscape.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:58.740 align:middle line:84%
But yeah, I really do
believe that for people

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:01.560 align:middle line:84%
who are interested in going
outside and to real nature,

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.700 align:middle line:84%
they're going to find
all the foods that they

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:03.630 align:middle line:90%
need right there.

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:04.830 align:middle line:90%
They're growing there.

00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:06.990 align:middle line:84%
They're just waiting for
people to interact with.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:09.323 align:middle line:84%
And there's a native belief
that comes out of California

00:48:09.323 --> 00:48:10.730 align:middle line:90%
that I really like.

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:13.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the idea that
nature becomes very sick

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:16.380 align:middle line:84%
when human beings are not
foraging and hunting in it.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about that
trophy buck hunting mentality.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.632 align:middle line:84%
I'm not talking about
robbing ecosystems

00:48:23.632 --> 00:48:24.840 align:middle line:90%
of the plants that are there.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.180 align:middle line:84%
But sustainable foraging,
sustainable hunting

00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.985 align:middle line:84%
is what keeps
ecosystems healthy.

00:48:28.985 --> 00:48:30.360 align:middle line:84%
The natives of
California believe

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.340 align:middle line:84%
that when human beings
are not present,

00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:35.790 align:middle line:84%
the land returns to wildness
and a kind of wildness that

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:38.040 align:middle line:84%
degenerates it and
that we are literally

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:40.440 align:middle line:84%
the gardeners of the
ecosystem, that our job is

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:43.230 align:middle line:84%
to go throughout the
world hunting and foraging

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:46.045 align:middle line:84%
in a sustainable way to
keep the lands healthy.

00:48:46.045 --> 00:48:48.420 align:middle line:84%
If you think about it, if you
were going to suddenly move

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:50.250 align:middle line:84%
outside, one of the
first things you'd

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:51.750 align:middle line:84%
have to do before
you got to food

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:53.460 align:middle line:84%
is you'd need to
gather firewood.

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:55.470 align:middle line:84%
That means you're going to
grab up all the dead and dying

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:55.920 align:middle line:90%
sticks.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.628 align:middle line:84%
You're going to grab
up all the dry wood.

00:48:57.628 --> 00:48:59.680 align:middle line:84%
You're going to create
airflow in that ecosystem.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.680 align:middle line:84%
Then you're going to begin
challenging the plant

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.730 align:middle line:84%
colonies and the animal
colonies by selectively

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:04.530 align:middle line:90%
taking from them.

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:06.160 align:middle line:84%
And you're going to cause
those colonies to become

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:07.500 align:middle line:90%
stronger and healthier.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And because we have
this unique brain,

00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:12.390 align:middle line:84%
we have the ability to oversee
that in a very intelligent way

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:middle line:84%
so that interacting
with the ecosystem

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:17.190 align:middle line:84%
is what brings health
to that ecosystem.

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, today we have this
idea of land conservation.

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:24.270 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is to keep
people out of nature.

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:26.880 align:middle line:84%
We've been tricked into an
idea that human beings are

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.520 align:middle line:84%
inherently bad for
the environment.

00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:30.362 align:middle line:90%
That's not true.

00:49:30.362 --> 00:49:32.820 align:middle line:84%
Our industrialized civilization
is bad for the environment.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.250 align:middle line:84%
But we're actually quite
good for the environment.

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:37.680 align:middle line:84%
By keeping us out of wild
lands-- in other words,

00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.810 align:middle line:84%
conservation programs
and preservation programs

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:41.670 align:middle line:84%
that exist today keep
people from being

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:43.187 align:middle line:84%
able to interact
with the landscape.

00:49:43.187 --> 00:49:45.270 align:middle line:84%
And the landscape, according
to the native belief,

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:46.860 align:middle line:90%
begins to degrade.

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.350 align:middle line:84%
So creating more and more
national parks and more

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:51.480 align:middle line:84%
and more environments where
people are not allowed

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.690 align:middle line:84%
might seem to somebody
enculturated into the belief

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:57.840 align:middle line:84%
that we're bad for the ecosystem
might seem like a good idea.

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:01.020 align:middle line:84%
But by prohibiting foraging
and prohibiting hunting,

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.953 align:middle line:84%
we actually hurt the
ecosystem, in my opinion

00:50:02.953 --> 00:50:05.370 align:middle line:84%
and in the belief of many
native peoples around the world.

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:08.700 align:middle line:84%
We are here to interact
with it in the same way

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.420 align:middle line:84%
that a beaver is here to
build dams up for watersheds.

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:13.540 align:middle line:90%
That's their job.

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.990 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't do
that, the ecosystem fails.

00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:19.230 align:middle line:84%
If we're not out there living
as hunter-gatherer-gardeners,

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:21.077 align:middle line:90%
our ecosystem begins to degrade.

00:50:21.077 --> 00:50:23.160 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, the
industrialized civilization

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.990 align:middle line:84%
wants to keep us out
of nature and keep

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:27.180 align:middle line:90%
us contained inside its bubble.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.710 align:middle line:90%
This is not just hurting us.

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:30.000 align:middle line:90%
It's hurting everything.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.760 align:middle line:84%
How can you respect a nature
you don't interact with?

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.060 align:middle line:84%
How could you respect an Earth
you don't go to for your needs?

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.380 align:middle line:90%
It's not really possible.

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.980 align:middle line:84%
We learn to respect life
by interacting with it

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.820 align:middle line:84%
and by getting
our needs from it.

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you do that,
it's very difficult

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.790 align:middle line:84%
to exploit it because
exploiting it means

00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:49.960 align:middle line:90%
your line ends eventually.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:53.490 align:middle line:84%
And so we think progress
could be infinite

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:56.125 align:middle line:84%
because we don't see where
what we have is coming from.

00:50:56.125 --> 00:50:57.750 align:middle line:84%
And we don't see the
damage it's doing.

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:00.480 align:middle line:84%
If we lived in our natural
way, we would see that.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:01.560 align:middle line:90%
And we would stop.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And we would live in a way that
brings us back into balance

00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:05.930 align:middle line:90%
with our beautiful planet.

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:11.190 align:middle line:90%


00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.075 align:middle line:84%
No conversation
about food is going

00:51:13.075 --> 00:51:15.450 align:middle line:84%
to be complete if we don't
talk about water because water

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:17.520 align:middle line:90%
is part of our diet.

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:19.250 align:middle line:90%
It shares the same--

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:20.250 align:middle line:90%
it goes in the same way.

00:51:20.250 --> 00:51:22.070 align:middle line:84%
It goes through our
digestive tract.

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:23.820 align:middle line:84%
The interesting thing
about water-- to me,

00:51:23.820 --> 00:51:25.590 align:middle line:84%
one of the many
interesting things--

00:51:25.590 --> 00:51:28.752 align:middle line:84%
is the water you drink
goes down your esophagus

00:51:28.752 --> 00:51:30.960 align:middle line:84%
through your stomach into
your small intestine, where

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.830 align:middle line:84%
it's immediately
absorbed into your blood.

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:34.470 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the water you drink

00:51:34.470 --> 00:51:36.448 align:middle line:90%
is your blood an hour from now.

00:51:36.448 --> 00:51:37.740 align:middle line:90%
You drink a glass of water now.

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.355 align:middle line:90%
You pee an hour later.

00:51:39.355 --> 00:51:41.730 align:middle line:84%
There's not a tube that goes
from the mouth down to where

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:42.780 align:middle line:90%
you pee from.

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.820 align:middle line:84%
It goes through
your bloodstream.

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's filtered
out by your kidneys.

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you thought
about your body, which

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.260 align:middle line:84%
we know is 65% to 75% water,
if we picture our bodies to be

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.780 align:middle line:84%
like a fish tank and
we thought about all

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.480 align:middle line:84%
that water in the fish tank,
and we pictured ourselves to be

00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.270 align:middle line:84%
more like the fish
swimming in the fish tank,

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:02.460 align:middle line:84%
how could the fish be
polluted if not first

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.213 align:middle line:90%
the water was actually polluted?

00:52:04.213 --> 00:52:06.630 align:middle line:84%
And how are we going to get
the pollutants out of the fish

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:08.380 align:middle line:84%
if we don't first get
them out of the water?

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:09.880 align:middle line:84%
So if we walked
into a setting where

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.247 align:middle line:84%
we knew the fish were
unhealthy and toxic,

00:52:12.247 --> 00:52:13.830 align:middle line:84%
what would the first
thing we'd do be?

00:52:13.830 --> 00:52:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Take the fish out and
clean them and then

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:16.080 align:middle line:90%
put them back in dirty water?

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.205 align:middle line:90%
It wouldn't make any sense.

00:52:17.205 --> 00:52:18.810 align:middle line:84%
We'd have to replace
the water first.

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:21.630 align:middle line:84%
It's so important to your
cleansing and detoxification

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.340 align:middle line:84%
and your health that
you're constantly

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:27.430 align:middle line:84%
replacing your body water with
clean, fresh, healthy water.

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise the cells are
sitting in this toxic soup

00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:31.062 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:52:31.062 --> 00:52:33.270 align:middle line:84%
If you thought about a fish
tank and a healthier fish

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:37.620 align:middle line:84%
tank, what's more important,
the quality of the food

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:39.900 align:middle line:84%
you give the fish or
the quality of the water

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.020 align:middle line:90%
that the fish are in?

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.970 align:middle line:90%
It's really obvious to people.

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:44.490 align:middle line:90%
It's the quality of the water.

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:47.010 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't put dirty
water in a fish tank.

00:52:47.010 --> 00:52:49.470 align:middle line:84%
And you could then go out
and buy the best-quality fish

00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:50.320 align:middle line:90%
flakes that exist.

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:52.800 align:middle line:84%
You could buy the
highest-quality fish food

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.600 align:middle line:84%
and feed it to
them all day long.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:56.910 align:middle line:84%
It's not going to matter
if the water is not clean.

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:59.490 align:middle line:84%
Your blood-- not
just your blood,

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:00.750 align:middle line:90%
your cerebrospinal fluid.

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:03.510 align:middle line:84%
That's the fluid your
brain floats inside of--

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:07.170 align:middle line:84%
your intracellular fluid,
your lymph, your extracellular

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:09.090 align:middle line:84%
fluid, all of these
fluids in your body--

00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:10.790 align:middle line:84%
they're made of the
water you drink.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:13.307 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not drinking
extremely clean water,

00:53:13.307 --> 00:53:15.390 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to be
taking and bioaccumulating

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:16.890 align:middle line:84%
the toxins that
are in the water.

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:19.830 align:middle line:84%
Those could be the plastics
that are found in bottled water.

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:25.080 align:middle line:84%
Those could be the flourides and
the chlorine that's added to--

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:27.000 align:middle line:84%
as well as other things
people don't realize

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.760 align:middle line:84%
is in their industrial
water, in their tap water.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:36.895 align:middle line:84%
For instance, phosphorus acid
and lye are added to adjust pH.

00:53:36.895 --> 00:53:39.270 align:middle line:84%
So people aren't realizing
they're ingesting these things

00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:39.970 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:53:39.970 --> 00:53:41.012 align:middle line:90%
And they're accumulating.

00:53:41.012 --> 00:53:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And they're getting
into the fish.

00:53:42.550 --> 00:53:43.950 align:middle line:90%
They're getting into your cells.

00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:46.050 align:middle line:84%
So by switching to
a clean water source

00:53:46.050 --> 00:53:47.910 align:middle line:84%
or having a high-quality
filtered water,

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:50.580 align:middle line:84%
some kind of clean water,
what you know you're doing

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:54.390 align:middle line:84%
is replacing the toxic body
water with clean water.

00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:56.370 align:middle line:84%
Once that water is
clean, the cells

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:58.948 align:middle line:84%
can start to give up their
toxins to that water.

00:53:58.948 --> 00:54:00.240 align:middle line:90%
You clean that water out again.

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.073 align:middle line:90%
You keep doing that.

00:54:01.073 --> 00:54:03.625 align:middle line:84%
Eventually the whole
system runs itself clean.

00:54:03.625 --> 00:54:06.000 align:middle line:84%
Like I said, the body is always
wants to detoxify itself.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.240 align:middle line:84%
It just needs to be given the
right elements, if you will.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:11.730 align:middle line:84%
Water used to be
considered a great element.

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Today we don't really
think of it that way.

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:15.960 align:middle line:84%
But to some of us, water
is a very sacred thing

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:17.710 align:middle line:84%
because it's literally
what we're made of.

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:22.122 align:middle line:90%


00:54:22.122 --> 00:54:24.330 align:middle line:84%
The question about what's
the best water for a person

00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:27.000 align:middle line:84%
to drink is a challenging
one today because most of us

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.683 align:middle line:84%
don't have access to really
what the cleanest water left is.

00:54:30.683 --> 00:54:32.100 align:middle line:84%
The whole surface
of the Earth has

00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:34.560 align:middle line:84%
been contaminated by the
pollutants we've released

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.090 align:middle line:90%
all throughout our ecosystem.

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And the only clean
water really left

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:40.495 align:middle line:84%
is the water that's
underground in aquifers.

00:54:40.495 --> 00:54:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Now, that water in the aquifers
is brought to the surface

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:43.670 align:middle line:90%
by springs.

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:45.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's brought to
the surface by wells.

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:48.630 align:middle line:84%
That means somebody who has an
artesian well or somebody that

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:50.790 align:middle line:84%
has access to a
spring has access

00:54:50.790 --> 00:54:52.890 align:middle line:84%
to probably the
cleanest substance that

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:56.760 align:middle line:84%
exists on Earth, the last clean
substance that exists on Earth.

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.730 align:middle line:84%
What's so unique is that
they can make 65% to 75%

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:01.260 align:middle line:84%
of their body out
of that substance.

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:02.860 align:middle line:90%
That to me is miraculous.

00:55:02.860 --> 00:55:04.920 align:middle line:84%
If somebody didn't have
access to an artesian

00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.390 align:middle line:84%
well, if they didn't
have a friend with one

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:08.700 align:middle line:84%
that they could go visit, or
if they didn't have access

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:12.270 align:middle line:84%
to a spring probably
the best thing to do

00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:14.250 align:middle line:84%
would be to look at
filtering methods

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:16.530 align:middle line:90%
or to look at bottled waters.

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:18.330 align:middle line:90%
And both have challenges.

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:20.522 align:middle line:84%
When we filter water,
we're filtering tap water.

00:55:20.522 --> 00:55:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, a lot of
the filters on the market today

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:26.490 align:middle line:84%
do not do an exceptional job
of removing all the pollutants

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:27.480 align:middle line:90%
that are in there.

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:30.060 align:middle line:84%
The carbon block filters,
like the countertop or ones

00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:31.380 align:middle line:90%
attached to your faucet--

00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:34.510 align:middle line:84%
really all they do is
remove smells from water.

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:37.470 align:middle line:84%
The reverse osmosis is
a very effective filter.

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.680 align:middle line:84%
But it creates a
tremendous amount of waste,

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.180 align:middle line:90%
up to 5 gallons--

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:44.070 align:middle line:84%
sometimes even as
much as 40 gallons--

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:45.895 align:middle line:84%
for every gallon that
you get out of it.

00:55:45.895 --> 00:55:48.270 align:middle line:84%
And it creates a water that
the World Health Organization

00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:52.350 align:middle line:84%
has told us causes
diuresis, loss of minerals,

00:55:52.350 --> 00:55:55.560 align:middle line:84%
and may be implicated in several
different degenerative disease

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.500 align:middle line:90%
states.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.410 align:middle line:84%
So we know that that
filtered water is not

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:00.030 align:middle line:90%
particularly healthy.

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:01.542 align:middle line:84%
And it leaves us
with this option

00:56:01.542 --> 00:56:03.000 align:middle line:84%
of bottled water,
which a lot of us

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.690 align:middle line:90%
don't feel has the ecological--

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:08.970 align:middle line:84%
it's not ecologically
balanced for us.

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:12.100 align:middle line:84%
That left me with a real
passion for spring water.

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:14.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why I created
findaspring.com, which is

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.050 align:middle line:90%
a website you can go to online.

00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:18.670 align:middle line:84%
It's a database of springs
all over the world.

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.460 align:middle line:84%
And what you can do
is just get your car,

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.050 align:middle line:84%
drive over to the spring
with some bottles,

00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:23.940 align:middle line:84%
fill them up, bring them home,
and that's your drinking water.

00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.200 align:middle line:84%
That's the water you
make your body out

00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:27.650 align:middle line:84%
of-- out of the cleanest water
that exists in the world.

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:29.317 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
really brilliant idea

00:56:29.317 --> 00:56:30.520 align:middle line:90%
for those who can do it.

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:31.830 align:middle line:84%
And for those who
can't do it, I really

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:34.050 align:middle line:84%
recommend you find the
highest-quality bottled water

00:56:34.050 --> 00:56:35.900 align:middle line:90%
or the best filter that you can.

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And you get real
conscious about if you're

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:38.610 align:middle line:90%
drinking filtered water.

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:40.360 align:middle line:84%
If you want to add a
little bit of mineral

00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.690 align:middle line:84%
to that, you could use a
little pinch of sea salt.

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:45.210 align:middle line:84%
Add it to the water to give
some of those minerals back so

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:46.770 align:middle line:84%
you can overcome
some of the problems

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:49.090 align:middle line:90%
of the filtered waters.

00:56:49.090 --> 00:56:51.090 align:middle line:84%
We're at this place in
history where people just

00:56:51.090 --> 00:56:52.810 align:middle line:90%
don't think water matters.

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:54.810 align:middle line:84%
They've kind of desecrated
the most sacred thing

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:55.890 align:middle line:90%
on the planet.

00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:57.150 align:middle line:90%
It's what we're made of.

00:56:57.150 --> 00:56:58.050 align:middle line:90%
It matters.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:56:58.710 align:middle line:90%
Why do you drink?

00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:59.470 align:middle line:90%
It's your body.

00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:00.000 align:middle line:90%
It's your blood.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:01.010 align:middle line:90%
It matters.

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:02.552 align:middle line:84%
And so you want to
get real conscious

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:04.513 align:middle line:84%
about choosing the
best water you can

00:57:04.513 --> 00:57:06.930 align:middle line:84%
and then realizing that not
all the water available to you

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:07.750 align:middle line:90%
is created equal.

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:09.270 align:middle line:90%
It's not just an inert chemical.

00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:11.460 align:middle line:84%
It's something more
special than that.

00:57:11.460 --> 00:57:19.200 align:middle line:90%


00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.480 align:middle line:84%
I was raised in a
culture that did not

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:24.690 align:middle line:84%
consider food an important
part of your budget.

00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:27.630 align:middle line:84%
The idea was, how much
can we save on food?

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:29.130 align:middle line:84%
The idea was, how
much money can we

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:31.600 align:middle line:90%
have surplus to buy stuff with?

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:34.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you could cut
the food costs down,

00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:36.330 align:middle line:84%
well, then you could
buy more stuff.

00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:39.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not considered
elitist to have a computer.

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:41.670 align:middle line:84%
It's not considered
elitist to have cable.

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:44.130 align:middle line:84%
It's not considered
elitist to have 14 cell

00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:45.660 align:middle line:90%
phones in a household anymore.

00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:47.340 align:middle line:90%
This is normal for people.

00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.492 align:middle line:84%
What is considered elitist
is to buy good food.

00:57:49.492 --> 00:57:51.200 align:middle line:84%
This is really strange
to me because this

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.410 align:middle line:90%
is what we're made of.

00:57:52.410 --> 00:57:55.470 align:middle line:84%
This is what our children
are going to be made of.

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:56.970 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, you could
spend a lot of money

00:57:56.970 --> 00:57:58.530 align:middle line:84%
going to some of the
high-end chain health

00:57:58.530 --> 00:58:00.447 align:middle line:84%
food stores if you bought
all your food there.

00:58:00.447 --> 00:58:02.400 align:middle line:84%
And it could be prohibitive
for some people.

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.310 align:middle line:84%
But when you buy your food
from farmers' markets,

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.770 align:middle line:84%
when you buy your
food from farmers,

00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:09.660 align:middle line:84%
when you do things
like that, you actually

00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:12.150 align:middle line:84%
save a lot more money on
food than you'd realize.

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:14.430 align:middle line:84%
For instance, if you go
to the farmers' market,

00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:15.775 align:middle line:90%
you're buying in bulk direct.

00:58:15.775 --> 00:58:18.150 align:middle line:84%
That means you're cutting out
the middleman of the store.

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:19.950 align:middle line:84%
The reason food is so
expensive at the health food

00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:21.450 align:middle line:84%
store is because
that food has to be

00:58:21.450 --> 00:58:23.470 align:middle line:84%
bought by that health food
store and transported there.

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:25.512 align:middle line:84%
And they need to turn a
profit when they sell it.

00:58:25.512 --> 00:58:27.708 align:middle line:84%
You can cut that out by
going to farmers' markets.

00:58:27.708 --> 00:58:30.000 align:middle line:84%
You can cut that out by going
direct to the farm, where

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.460 align:middle line:84%
farmers will sell you food
at prices you can't imagine.

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, it requires a different
way of thinking because you

00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:37.418 align:middle line:90%
start thinking more long term.

00:58:37.418 --> 00:58:39.210 align:middle line:84%
When I was growing up,
I thought about food

00:58:39.210 --> 00:58:40.680 align:middle line:90%
for that day or that week.

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I certainly didn't think
about food for the year.

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.440 align:middle line:84%
The way that I save money buying
my food today is I stock up.

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.540 align:middle line:84%
That means when things
are available in the fall,

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:49.440 align:middle line:90%
I buy a lot.

00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.880 align:middle line:90%
I store them in my basement.

00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.050 align:middle line:90%
I put food away.

00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:53.310 align:middle line:90%
I ferment food.

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:55.590 align:middle line:90%
And I plan out my food year now.

00:58:55.590 --> 00:58:57.765 align:middle line:90%
I probably spend a fraction of--

00:58:57.765 --> 00:59:00.510 align:middle line:84%
I probably spend about half
what I was spending on food when

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:02.550 align:middle line:84%
I bought from health
food stores because I

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:04.848 align:middle line:90%
didn't understand how to plan.

00:59:04.848 --> 00:59:07.140 align:middle line:84%
Remember that your grandmother,
your grandfather-- they

00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:09.180 align:middle line:84%
thought about food in
a more long-term way.

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And they never had a household
that didn't have food.

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:13.500 align:middle line:90%
The average person today--

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:14.670 align:middle line:90%
they run out of food.

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:15.630 align:middle line:84%
We got to get to
the supermarket.

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:16.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't have any
food in the house.

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:18.522 align:middle line:84%
That wouldn't have
happened to people

00:59:18.522 --> 00:59:21.108 align:middle line:84%
before because people planned
things out more long term.

00:59:21.108 --> 00:59:23.400 align:middle line:84%
So in my basement right now,
I have lots of vegetables.

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.570 align:middle line:90%
It's the middle of winter.

00:59:24.570 --> 00:59:26.760 align:middle line:84%
And these vegetables
were grown in the autumn.

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.317 align:middle line:84%
But they keep down
there in the cool.

00:59:28.317 --> 00:59:29.650 align:middle line:90%
And I've learned how to do that.

00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:32.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to buy them
in bulk inexpensively.

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:33.582 align:middle line:90%
I buy my food in bulk now.

00:59:33.582 --> 00:59:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And I save a lot
of money that way.

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:39.180 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the idea of us
spending these extremely high

00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:41.880 align:middle line:84%
premiums in the whole
foods-type environment--

00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.030 align:middle line:84%
I don't see that being something
we'll do much into the future.

00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I think of those
places as a place

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.750 align:middle line:84%
to get something that I
need that I don't have

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:51.330 align:middle line:84%
and I can't get from my
farmers' market or from a farm.

00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:53.550 align:middle line:84%
But I certainly don't get
all my food from there.

00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:55.133 align:middle line:84%
I think it is
prohibitively expensive.

00:59:55.133 --> 00:59:56.967 align:middle line:84%
And you would have to
be a bit of an elitist

00:59:56.967 --> 00:59:58.380 align:middle line:90%
to be able to afford to do that.

00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:01.650 align:middle line:84%
But I think we can all afford
to buy the foods that we need

01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:03.390 align:middle line:90%
that will support our health.

01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And we may need
to reanalyze what

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.940 align:middle line:90%
our spending priorities are.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.910 align:middle line:84%
Why is cable television a
priority over quality food

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:13.080 align:middle line:90%
for our children?

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:14.820 align:middle line:90%
How did it get like that?

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.988 align:middle line:84%
It's just a given you're
going to have cable.

01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But it's not a given
that somebody is going

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:20.550 align:middle line:90%
to have high-quality food.

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:22.142 align:middle line:90%
I think we can reprioritize.

01:00:22.142 --> 01:00:23.850 align:middle line:84%
We can think about
how we spend our money

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:25.420 align:middle line:84%
and what's really
important to us.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:28.260 align:middle line:84%
And if our health and
the future of our progeny

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.447 align:middle line:84%
is important to us, we're
going to want to invest

01:00:30.447 --> 01:00:31.530 align:middle line:90%
in some high-quality food.

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:34.580 align:middle line:90%
