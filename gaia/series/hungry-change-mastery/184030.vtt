00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.010 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>> There was a point where I
had allowed myself to get to 300

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.290 align:middle line:90%
pounds.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And that world, as opposed
to the current world,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.740 align:middle line:90%
is vastly different.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.070 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, people that
have never been overweight

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.400 align:middle line:84%
have no idea of the
challenges-- daily challenges--

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.490 align:middle line:90%
of what it's like to be obese.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not talking about
10 or 20 pounds overweight.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.270 align:middle line:90%
I was 130 pounds overweight.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.160 align:middle line:90%
It's a very dispiriting thing.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.470 align:middle line:84%
You wake up in the morning,
and you're immediately--

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.290 align:middle line:84%
I was immediately
aware of my body,

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.020 align:middle line:84%
and I was immediately
aware I didn't like it.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.190 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.300 align:middle line:90%
What I could wear was limited.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I would try to
dress nicely to try

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:90%
to compensate for this thing.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.820 align:middle line:84%
But there are other
aspects of being

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.150 align:middle line:90%
fat that are so dispiriting.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.160 align:middle line:84%
For example, hygiene-- there
are certain aspects of hygiene

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.420 align:middle line:90%
that are difficult to address.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.210 align:middle line:84%
For example, to be specific,
if I were out in the street

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.350 align:middle line:84%
doing something, I would have
to make sure I timed myself

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.780 align:middle line:84%
so that when I had to
go to the bathroom,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.160 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to be home, because
I really couldn't clean myself

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.350 align:middle line:84%
up the way I needed
to be cleaned up.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't reach certain places.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.823 align:middle line:84%
That's very hard to
admit at this moment.

00:01:48.823 --> 00:01:49.990 align:middle line:90%
It's a very difficult thing.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:90%
But it's a reality.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.690 align:middle line:84%
The dispiriting
nature of that is--

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.300 align:middle line:84%
I just cannot begin to describe
how dispiriting that is.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.699 align:middle line:84%
To be intimate with
someone, right?

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.450 align:middle line:84%
The one time that it did
happen when I was that fat

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
was, I made sure that
the lights were out.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:84%
I made sure I was lying down,
because I didn't look as fat.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.700 align:middle line:84%
So rather than being
able to enjoy and engage

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:84%
in our favorite
human activity, I

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.000 align:middle line:84%
was preoccupied with all
these preventative measures.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
What I think got me to
that point, in retrospect--

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.730 align:middle line:90%
I started getting depressed.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:84%
And a blow to me was when I
was diagnosed with hepatitis C.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.660 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons it
was so devastating to me

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:90%
was, when I first went--

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:90%
and the reason I had gone--

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.140 align:middle line:84%
I was healthy and all that,
and I was pretty good shape.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.250 align:middle line:90%
I had met someone.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:19.102 align:middle line:84%
And in those days, it
was the early '90s,

00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:84%
and so we had to get an AIDS
test and all that stuff.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.930 align:middle line:84%
So I had to go get
this stuff done.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And I decided to get a
full spectrum blood test

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.510 align:middle line:84%
and get an AIDS
test, which was fine.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:84%
And everything told me I
had a clean bill of health.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.530 align:middle line:84%
And as a recovered alcoholic
and drug addict, to me,

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.860 align:middle line:84%
that was amazing that
not only did I not

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.862 align:middle line:84%
have AIDS, which I knew I
didn't, but that I had nothing.

00:03:41.862 --> 00:03:43.570 align:middle line:84%
There weren't any
other-- because there's

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.360 align:middle line:84%
a whole host of
ancillary problems

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.900 align:middle line:84%
that come about
with that lifestyle.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.940 align:middle line:90%
But two weeks later--

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.080 align:middle line:90%
and I was relishing that.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.913 align:middle line:84%
Two weeks later, they
called me they told me

00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:57.790 align:middle line:90%
they may have made a mistake.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.130 align:middle line:84%
And then they told me that
they had made a mistake.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.180 align:middle line:84%
I actually do have hepatitis C.
And I'm not blaming everything

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.350 align:middle line:90%
on that, but it didn't help.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And I started noticing,
from that point on,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:90%
I started getting depressed.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And I was sort of letting
myself go bit by bit.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.029 align:middle line:90%
And it was very incremental.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.220 align:middle line:84%
It was like suicide on
the installment plan.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I was taking my time
destroying myself.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't using
drugs or alcohol,

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.810 align:middle line:90%
but I started using food.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.520 align:middle line:84%
And the thing about addiction
is it's like a balloon.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
You take one aspect
of addiction,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.180 align:middle line:84%
like drugs and alcohol,
and you squeeze it.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.590 align:middle line:90%
It dissipates.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But that addiction finds
its way into manifesting--

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:90%
it manifests in another way.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.490 align:middle line:90%
And in my case, it was food.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So I stopped using
drugs and alcohol,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.140 align:middle line:84%
but I started using
food that same way.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:57.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.740 align:middle line:84%
When I turned to
food as an addiction,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't conscious of it.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.890 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like a
shot of vodka where,

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm feeling a little anxiety.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:90%
I think I'll have a drink.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.245 align:middle line:90%
It's much more insidious.

00:05:09.245 --> 00:05:10.880 align:middle line:90%
I notice it now.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.570 align:middle line:84%
If I'm with a group of people,
and there's chips on the table,

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm not really hungry, but
I'm uptight or just not

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
comfortable, and I'll
reach for something.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.570 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is
not what I did.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.620 align:middle line:90%
It was more like that.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.990 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.090 align:middle line:84%
In my experience,
it was far more

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.950 align:middle line:84%
insidious than the
booze in the sense

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.560 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't realize
that's what I was doing.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.750 align:middle line:90%
And it sneaks up on you.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:90%
And boy, booze does, too.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.830 align:middle line:84%
But this was different,
because everybody's eating.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.080 align:middle line:84%
And there are just so many
people that are overweight,

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
and there's so many
people that look like you

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.020 align:middle line:90%
and are doing what you're doing.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And by the time I realized
how much I had let myself go,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.939 align:middle line:90%
it was really overwhelming.

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Carbs and sugar, I think,
are a real culprit.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.607 align:middle line:90%
I don't believe that, really--

00:06:11.607 --> 00:06:13.440 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing a little
reading about this.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not a nutritionist
or an expert,

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.140 align:middle line:84%
but apparently,
we're not designed

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.930 align:middle line:84%
to digest great
grains that easily.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:22.730 align:middle line:90%
Who knows.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.540 align:middle line:84%
All I know is that, to
this day, if I go, like,

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.330 align:middle line:84%
two weeks without eating
any carbs, like white sugar,

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.350 align:middle line:84%
white flour stuff, and
things like that, I'm good.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.810 align:middle line:84%
The moment I eat
carbs, I want more.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:38.300 align:middle line:90%
And sugar is the same way.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.970 align:middle line:90%
And I never knew it.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:90%
I mean, let's face it.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.538 align:middle line:84%
When you're an
alcoholic and you're

00:06:43.538 --> 00:06:45.830 align:middle line:84%
using cocaine, sugar
and carbs and not what

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:90%
you're thinking about.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.720 align:middle line:84%
But as you clean up-- as I
clean up, these things become--

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.400 align:middle line:90%
I become more sensitive to them.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that the moment
I start using a little sugar,

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.290 align:middle line:90%
I want more.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.740 align:middle line:90%
It's automatic.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.150 align:middle line:90%
And everything has sugar in it.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.470 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.330 align:middle line:84%
Try going through a day
without eating sugar or, like,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.820 align:middle line:84%
18,000 milligrams of
salt. Try it sometime.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.020 align:middle line:90%
It's really challenging.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:84%
Even toothpaste, for
Christ sake, has sugar.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.633 align:middle line:90%
Now it has aspartame, right?

00:07:22.633 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:90%
But they used to have sugar.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Before I entered a
cleaner lifestyle,

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:84%
I will openly admit that
I was a cynic about it.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:90%
But that's only part of it.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.000 align:middle line:90%
Cynicism, on my part--

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.480 align:middle line:84%
it was sort of contempt
prior to investigation.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.900 align:middle line:84%
I really wasn't interested
in doing the work

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.970 align:middle line:90%
that I knew was behind it.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:55.850 align:middle line:84%
So my cynicism was a
way of insulating myself

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.840 align:middle line:90%
from the work.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.350 align:middle line:84%
And cynicism doesn't
always have to be abrasive.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:84%
I knew how to make it
humorous and charming.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.510 align:middle line:84%
So I was able to kill
myself with charm.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
I was able to make you
laugh while I was basically

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:90%
swallowing poison, right?

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:19.880 align:middle line:90%
And so I learned how to do that.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.100 align:middle line:90%
But I was cynical.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.700 align:middle line:84%
And also, cynicism is a way of
shielding one's self from love,

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.500 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like, it's kind of
hard to love somebody that's

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.919 align:middle line:90%
behaving like a scorpion.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like, how do you pet
one, you know what I mean?

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:43.159 align:middle line:84%
And so the cynicism
reflected a wound, really,

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:47.060 align:middle line:84%
in me that had to do
with my sense of self,

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.350 align:middle line:90%
my sense of worthiness.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.058 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.058 --> 00:08:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's also the illusion
of insulating myself

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:56.020 align:middle line:90%
from further pain.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:01.330 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.450 align:middle line:84%
I was very fortunate
to be picked

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.450 align:middle line:84%
to be subject of a
documentary, may I be frank.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:84%
It had to do with raw food
and this healthy lifestyle.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.550 align:middle line:90%
And the way I was picked was--

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:90%
it was interesting to me.

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:21.130 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully, it'll be
interesting to you.

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:26.980 align:middle line:84%
But the whole film rests on
somebody doing something nice

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.760 align:middle line:90%
for somebody else.

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I like about
the whole genesis of the film.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:38.610 align:middle line:84%
I was on my way to a video store
to rent some Italian movies.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.380 align:middle line:84%
There's a video place
in San Francisco

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.140 align:middle line:84%
called Le Video that specializes
in international titles.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And I was going there to
rent some Italian films

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.570 align:middle line:84%
with subtitles,
because I'm a snob,

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.472 align:middle line:84%
and go visit my
cousin Michelangelo.

00:09:50.472 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And we were going to
watch Italian movies

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.840 align:middle line:90%
and make fun of Americans.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.520 align:middle line:84%
And on my way there, I saw this
sign that said Cafe Gratitude.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.710 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I
was tipping the scales

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:90%
at nearly 300 pounds.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:84%
I was very depressed and
very lonely and isolated.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.170 align:middle line:84%
I used to ring my own
doorbell to hear what

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:15.340 align:middle line:90%
a visitor would sound like.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.390 align:middle line:90%
And I saw this sign.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.250 align:middle line:90%
It said Cafe Gratitude.

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And I thought somebody
in the 12 Step community

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.990 align:middle line:84%
was being clever, because
in the 12 Step world,

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.790 align:middle line:90%
gratitude is a central virtue.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.580 align:middle line:84%
So I thought somebody
was being cute.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:36.490 align:middle line:84%
So it was a dark and
dreary February evening

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:39.040 align:middle line:90%
in San Francisco.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.400 align:middle line:84%
The air was moist and
foggy, and it reflected

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.530 align:middle line:90%
my internal landscape.

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:51.140 align:middle line:84%
And I walked by this window,
and it was warmly lit.

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.440 align:middle line:84%
And it reminded
me of Hemingway's

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.130 align:middle line:90%
"A Well-lighted Place."

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.210 align:middle line:84%
And there was hardly
anyone in there.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And so I open the
door, and I'm met

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.990 align:middle line:90%
with this incredible fanfare.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.790 align:middle line:90%
Hi.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:04.330 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:04.900 align:middle line:90%
How are you?

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.700 align:middle line:90%
Glad you're here.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:90%
Come on in.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.660 align:middle line:84%
And it was, like, 18 years
worth of greetings for me,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:12.850 align:middle line:90%
because I was so damn lonely.

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And so these people started
being really friendly.

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
And I met one guy, and
I said to him, well,

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.550 align:middle line:84%
I had to come and have a cup of
coffee at the Cafe Gratitude,

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:84%
because I'm sure somebody
here is in recovery.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.090 align:middle line:84%
And he looked at
me, and he said,

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:31.600 align:middle line:84%
we're all recovering from
something, aren't we?

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.442 align:middle line:84%
I immediately knew he was not
part of the 12 Step community

00:11:34.442 --> 00:11:36.025 align:middle line:84%
and assumed that
they were all stoned.

00:11:36.025 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:90%


00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.180 align:middle line:84%
But something interesting
was happening.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.780 align:middle line:90%


00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.960 align:middle line:84%
When you're as
overweight as I was,

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:90%
you don't feel seen or heard.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:84%
I felt like everyone was just
experiencing my exterior,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.850 align:middle line:84%
and they weren't
getting here or here--

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.110 align:middle line:84%
well, here, but
certainly not here.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.620 align:middle line:84%
And these people-- after a
while, I kept going back,

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.850 align:middle line:90%
because they were odd.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:90%
They were just odd.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And they were just
so warm and friendly.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I was there,
I noticed there

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.080 align:middle line:90%
wasn't an espresso machine.

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.030 align:middle line:90%
There was no stove.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.450 align:middle line:90%
There was no flame in sight.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:18.785 align:middle line:90%
It was a raw food restaurant.

00:12:18.785 --> 00:12:20.410 align:middle line:84%
I never heard of a
raw food restaurant.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Raw food.

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.050 align:middle line:90%
How do you cook raw food?

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:28.090 align:middle line:84%
I just imagined carrots and
celery with ranch dressing--

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.050 align:middle line:90%
sort of a cheap spread.

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:33.970 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
anything about vegetar--

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:34.880 align:middle line:90%
that world.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:35.700 align:middle line:90%
I knew about it.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:36.790 align:middle line:90%
I knew about vegetarians.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:40.530 align:middle line:84%
I knew Gandhi was a
vegetarian, as was Hitler.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:41.410 align:middle line:90%
And vegan is for--

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.480 align:middle line:90%
I thought vegan was a planet.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.565 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea of that world.

00:12:45.565 --> 00:12:48.220 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But these people
were reaching me.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And I started to feel like
I was being seen and heard,

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.480 align:middle line:90%
and I kept going back.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't
because of the food.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is a crucial
component to the whole food

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
movement, is that it's
not just about the food.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.185 align:middle line:84%
It's everything
surrounding the food.

00:13:11.185 --> 00:13:15.310 align:middle line:84%
It's who you're eating it
with, how you're cooking it,

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.430 align:middle line:84%
who you're preparing
it with, where

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
are you buying it, who
are you talking to,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.142 align:middle line:90%
and what's your attitude?

00:13:23.142 --> 00:13:24.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not just the food.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.210 align:middle line:90%
It's everything.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.980 align:middle line:84%
And these people were
incorporating that.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm really grateful to them,
because I started feeling seen.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.980 align:middle line:84%
And at one point, Ryland asked
me if I've ever seen the movie

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:36.910 align:middle line:90%
"Super Size Me."

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.820 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, yeah,
that's that guy that

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:43.350 align:middle line:84%
was healthy and ate himself
sick with fast food.

00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:84%
He said, yeah, well, we
have an idea for a film

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.040 align:middle line:84%
that we want to
feed a guy raw food,

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.997 align:middle line:84%
and bring him to
holistic healers, and--

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:52.830 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if they
told me about colonics.

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.122 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I would have
went for it at that point.

00:13:55.122 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And he says, and we want
to shoot that and put him

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:84%
on the raw foo- and
want you to be the guy.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.678 align:middle line:90%
I said, get out of here.

00:14:02.678 --> 00:14:03.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm not that interesting.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.428 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, we'll
be the judge of that.

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.840 align:middle line:90%
You know --

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:84%
So on Valentine's Day,
poetically enough--

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:18.000 align:middle line:84%
on Valentine's Day of 2006,
we signed an agreement.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly wasn't
an enforceable document,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.500 align:middle line:84%
but it was a document
rooted in love

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.980 align:middle line:84%
and an integrity, that basically
said that I'm turning my life

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and my will over to the
care of these three guys

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.160 align:middle line:90%
who shave once a month.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.550 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:33.080 align:middle line:90%
And I started eating raw food.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:37.010 align:middle line:84%
For the first week,
it was strictly juice

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.050 align:middle line:90%
and 8 ounces of--

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.810 align:middle line:84%
2, 4, 6-- no, 12 ounces
of wheatgrass a day--

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:44.120 align:middle line:90%
4 ounces each thing--

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.910 align:middle line:84%
which, I thought I was
going to die every time

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:48.090 align:middle line:90%
I-- it was like motor oil.

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:48.920 align:middle line:90%
It was awful.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.270 align:middle line:90%
It was just awful.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:55.550 align:middle line:84%
But they wanted to
radicalize the first week

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:84%
and throw my body into
shock, which they did.

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.980 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And I remember that
whole process beginning.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.160 align:middle line:84%
And in the beginning,
when I started to cleanse,

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.280 align:middle line:90%
it was debilitating.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.430 align:middle line:84%
I was down for the count
for a couple of days.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.210 align:middle line:84%
But after about two weeks, I did
notice my energy coming back,

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and colors just a
little bit brighter,

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:23.210 align:middle line:84%
and just a little bit
lighter in my step.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:27.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what component
would be the dominant component

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:41.020 align:middle line:90%
in that experience.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.310 align:middle line:90%
Was it the food?

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Was it the care and affection I
was getting from these people?

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
Was it the affirmations
that I was doing?

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:90%
Or was it the colonics?

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:55.390 align:middle line:84%
Was it that I felt
that somebody cared?

00:15:55.390 --> 00:16:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Was it that I was achieving
a degree of fulfillment

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:84%
because I was meeting
my commitment?

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.603 align:middle line:90%
Because I met my commitment.

00:16:04.603 --> 00:16:05.770 align:middle line:90%
I was meeting my commitment.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.090 align:middle line:90%
All of those things.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:84%
And I am convinced that
it's all of those things.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.310 align:middle line:84%
I think that if you
eat raw food and don't

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:17.770 align:middle line:84%
take care of your
heart and soul,

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:20.740 align:middle line:84%
that your body will
be pure, and you'll

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:90%
be a miserable son of a bitch.

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Simple as that.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.300 align:middle line:90%


00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:41.230 align:middle line:84%
There used to be these ads on
TV to promote quitting smoking.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.810 align:middle line:84%
So there was this campaign,
and they would show people

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
with their holes in the
throat, and the thing where

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:48.520 align:middle line:84%
they used to have this
microphone that they would have

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:49.900 align:middle line:90%
to put against their larynx.

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.150 align:middle line:90%
And just really gruesome things.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:56.320 align:middle line:84%
And I don't really know if they
were very effective in stopping

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.080 align:middle line:84%
people from smoking, because
first of all, you look at that,

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.570 align:middle line:90%
and you think, not me.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.130 align:middle line:90%
And you put it off.

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:05.710 align:middle line:90%
The willingness has to be there.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:84%
Without the willingness,
it does nothing.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:84%
It's the old horse
to water factor.

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And what happened with
your dad, would my guess,

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.270 align:middle line:84%
is that the voice that
was telling him that--

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.650 align:middle line:90%
the voice that was killing him--

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.280 align:middle line:84%
was superseded by the
voice that was loving him.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.620 align:middle line:90%
And that voice saved me.

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.330 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:33.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's a resounding voice.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.550 align:middle line:84%
That killer voice is
a resounding voice.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:84%
It led me to depths
that, sometimes when

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
I reflect on them, I find
hard to believe that I lived

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
through, and levels of
pitiful and incomprehensible

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:55.450 align:middle line:84%
demoralization that are
still painful to recount.

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:84%
But yet, there's something
in the spirit, in the --

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.680 align:middle line:90%
or as, who's it --

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle line:84%
the Buddhists say the one
who knows resides within.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.520 align:middle line:84%
And that voice was the
last gasp of that voice,

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.980 align:middle line:84%
and it probably got
your dad out of bed.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:16.480 align:middle line:84%
And it got me into
a cleaner lifestyle.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.880 align:middle line:90%
And it takes time.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.160 align:middle line:84%
Some people have a
magnificent, white light,

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.620 align:middle line:90%
burning bush experience.

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.870 align:middle line:84%
My burning bush
experience always

00:18:25.870 --> 00:18:27.870 align:middle line:90%
leads me to divorce court.

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:90%
But [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:31.490 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:35.950 align:middle line:90%


00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:38.040 align:middle line:90%
I was the problem.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.270 align:middle line:84%
I was the common denominator
in all my problems.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:49.690 align:middle line:84%
My ex-wife-- I picked
people that are vibrating

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:53.460 align:middle line:90%
at the same VPS as I am.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:84%
And the condition that
I was in, I certainly

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:84%
wasn't going to
attract someone that

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:05.365 align:middle line:84%
was living a healthy lifestyle
rooted in integrity and love.

00:19:05.365 --> 00:19:10.030 align:middle line:84%
I connected with somebody
who was living a belief that

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.300 align:middle line:84%
was resonant with mine, a
belief about themselves that

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.670 align:middle line:90%
was resonant with mine.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.380 align:middle line:84%
And I hope nobody finds a
judgment in that statement.

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not a judgment.

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.300 align:middle line:84%
It's just a-- that statement,
we attract like kind.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:23.380 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I did.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:90%


00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Everything that we talk about
winds back to self-love.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.890 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
And the voices that I
had in my head when--

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.540 align:middle line:90%
and they're still there.

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.300 align:middle line:90%
It's not like they're gone.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.890 align:middle line:84%
I just have some
more tools that help

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.990 align:middle line:90%
me turn the volume down a bit.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.420 align:middle line:84%
But the notion of being
able to love yourself

00:19:55.420 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:84%
when there's nobody else
there is challenging sometimes

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.090 align:middle line:90%
for me.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.200 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's very challenging.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:11.530 align:middle line:84%
I often wake up with a cacophony
of dissonant voices telling me

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:18.230 align:middle line:84%
how messed up I am, what's wrong
with my life, and all of that.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it takes
a little time and effort

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:84%
to get to the place where,
OK, I can breathe now.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:90%
But those voices are indicators.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Pain of any kind
is an indicator.

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:41.086 align:middle line:84%
The universe put pain
in our experience

00:20:41.086 --> 00:20:43.330 align:middle line:90%
so that we can get direction.

00:20:43.330 --> 00:20:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So like the old Henny
Youngman joke-- doctor,

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:47.890 align:middle line:90%
it hurts when I do that.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Well, don't do that, right?

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.472 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.472 --> 00:20:53.680 align:middle line:90%
But there's this other Amer--

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.013 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's strictly
American, but this notion,

00:20:56.013 --> 00:20:57.250 align:middle line:90%
if it hurts, you know just --

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:58.690 align:middle line:90%
sort of Protestant thing--

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.400 align:middle line:84%
just pull yourself
by your bootstraps.

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.950 align:middle line:90%
It's like this whole thing.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:06.280 align:middle line:84%
And there's this whole
John Wayne mentality.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Well, John Wayne's name
was actually Marion, right?

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:12.370 align:middle line:90%
It was a girl's name.

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:13.970 align:middle line:90%
He never was in the military.

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.570 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't get in.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:20.080 align:middle line:84%
And he's this icon of
manhood that doesn't exist.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.090 align:middle line:90%
It's all an illusion.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Rock Hudson was this
illusion of a man's man.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.490 align:middle line:90%
In fact, he was.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:29.950 align:middle line:90%
And it's all these illusions.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:39.250 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that those
voices are where my wounds are.

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.260 align:middle line:90%
That's where my work is.

00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And the affirmations
in the film--

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.220 align:middle line:84%
the film focuses
on affirmations.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:52.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, for a while, there's
a focus of affirmations.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:84%
It was, by far, the
most difficult thing

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.550 align:middle line:90%
in the film to do.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
I would literally feel
my intestines unraveling

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.930 align:middle line:84%
at the notion of
staring at the mirror

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:07.570 align:middle line:84%
and having to say,
"I am beautiful.

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.070 align:middle line:90%
I am radiant in health.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:11.832 align:middle line:90%
I am worthy of love."

00:22:11.832 --> 00:22:14.620 align:middle line:90%
And it just felt so wrong.

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:84%
It felt like, if God
is listening right now,

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.550 align:middle line:84%
he's going to strike
me with lightning.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.092 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to get
struck by lightning,

00:22:20.092 --> 00:22:21.820 align:middle line:90%
because this is so wrong.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.030 align:middle line:90%
This is so wrong.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:28.330 align:middle line:84%
And it felt disingenuous
and unnatural to say,

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:31.780 align:middle line:90%
"I am worthy of love."

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:38.470 align:middle line:84%
And even today, it's like,
there's still some stuff there.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:42.220 align:middle line:84%
It's like, doing internal
work, sometimes--

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:90%
it's like extracting shrapnel.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.543 align:middle line:90%
And you get the big pieces out.

00:22:47.543 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:84%
And you make sure that you're
not going to lose your limb,

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:84%
and you stop the bleeding,
and you stitch it up.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.460 align:middle line:84%
But you don't get
all the fragments.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.340 align:middle line:84%
And the body, in
it's natural process,

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.790 align:middle line:84%
expels these little
fragments of shrapnel.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.720 align:middle line:84%
But as they climb through
the tissue, they hurt--

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.960 align:middle line:84%
not as much as the
original piece of shrapnel,

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.360 align:middle line:90%
but they're reminders of that.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:15.910 align:middle line:90%


00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:19.000 align:middle line:84%
You saved your
father, because he

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:90%
saw the love you had for him.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:24.550 align:middle line:90%
That cracked him open.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.140 align:middle line:84%
And it was at that
point that he was

00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:30.370 align:middle line:84%
able to allow your love in so
that he could love himself.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:90%


00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.280 align:middle line:84%
There's a group that I go to
that says, let us love you.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.314 align:middle line:90%
Do you love yourself?

00:23:39.314 --> 00:23:42.350 align:middle line:84%
And when I first heard
that, I was like--

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.530 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.340 align:middle line:90%
it was so sad.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.720 align:middle line:84%
I became aware of the
depth of my self-loathing.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And so my guess is that, if your
father was anything like me,

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.000 align:middle line:84%
that that self-loathing
was overwhelming.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And allowing somebody
to love actually hurt.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:07.280 align:middle line:84%
It was painful to let
somebody love you.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.830 align:middle line:90%
Death seemed at least--

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.900 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't suicidal.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:14.810 align:middle line:84%
I occasionally had
bouts, thoughts.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.950 align:middle line:84%
But it wasn't suicidal,
but I welcomed death.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:20.060 align:middle line:90%
I thought, you know what?

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Just turn the switch.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.350 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.260 align:middle line:90%
Flick the off button.

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:28.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm ready for the
big sleep, man.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's at that point that the
genesis of willingness emerges.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:39.950 align:middle line:84%
That's the genesis
of willingness.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:44.360 align:middle line:84%
And that crack-- as
Leonard Cohen says,

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.400 align:middle line:84%
it's the cracks that
lets the light in.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.350 align:middle line:90%
That crack let the light in.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:53.270 align:middle line:84%
But it was your demonstration
of love-- not, dad, do this.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Dad, do that-- but what probably
transmitted in your face--

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:02.360 align:middle line:84%
the wordless transmission
of love, which

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:03.560 align:middle line:90%
is the most powerful, right?

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:06.130 align:middle line:90%


00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.020 align:middle line:90%
And so it's those experiences.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:12.670 align:middle line:90%


00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:14.980 align:middle line:84%
Oddly enough, it takes
courage to let love in.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:21.150 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Was it difficult to say when
I knew that it wasn't true?

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:28.420 align:middle line:90%
Who am I to say I'm not lovable?

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.790 align:middle line:90%
What am I, Hitler?

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.040 align:middle line:90%
So who was the voice?

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.020 align:middle line:84%
Where is the source of that
voice that says, it's not true?

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:90%
Who is that?

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:46.600 align:middle line:84%
And so what wasn't it true
that I wasn't healthy?

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I had the capacity
to achieve health.

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.420 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
degree of health.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.790 align:middle line:90%
That's mentally healthy, no?

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:59.890 align:middle line:84%
But these voices that
say, it's not true--

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:04.200 align:middle line:90%


00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.370 align:middle line:90%
there's a great story of--

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.270 align:middle line:90%
I knew a therapist.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.060 align:middle line:90%
I knew a lot of therapists.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.920 align:middle line:84%
But I knew this therapist
that had this client that

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.250 align:middle line:90%
was overweight.

00:26:13.250 --> 00:26:16.420 align:middle line:90%


00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.610 align:middle line:90%
And he had had this epiphany.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And he was still overweight,
but he was getting better.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:23.380 align:middle line:84%
But he was still
clearly overweight.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.290 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason,
he had this epiphany,

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:29.680 align:middle line:84%
and he started to really
experience himself

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:32.950 align:middle line:90%
as a beautiful human being.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:38.800 align:middle line:84%
And the therapist was
really pleased, of course.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.560 align:middle line:84%
But this guy-- he was still,
like, 30, 40 pounds overweight.

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.530 align:middle line:84%
But he really honestly
had this conviction.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:48.670 align:middle line:84%
He saw himself as a beautiful
human being to the point

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.040 align:middle line:84%
he bought himself
a speedo, right?

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.940 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.240 align:middle line:90%
And then he went to Rio.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And he called his
therapist from Rio saying--

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.430 align:middle line:84%
because he was on the
beach seeing himself

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:02.887 align:middle line:90%
as this great looking guy.

00:27:02.887 --> 00:27:04.720 align:middle line:84%
And wherever he went--
he started traveling.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Wherever he went,
he was attracting

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.240 align:middle line:90%
these beautiful women.

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:13.120 align:middle line:84%
His dance card was
filled, because that's

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.550 align:middle line:90%
the way he was seeing himself.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:20.595 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, it doesn't
detract from the--

00:27:20.595 --> 00:27:21.460 align:middle line:90%
like photography.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Avedon said about photography
that it's accurate,

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.580 align:middle line:90%
but it's not true, right?

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.120 align:middle line:84%
It's accurate,
but it's not true.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the photograph
of the guy goes,

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.210 align:middle line:84%
oh, he's 30, 40
pounds overweight.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:38.420 align:middle line:90%
That's accurate.

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.110 align:middle line:84%
What's not true is that
he's not beautiful.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:42.440 align:middle line:90%
The truth is that he is, right?

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.240 align:middle line:90%
He sees himself.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.040 align:middle line:90%
He's determined.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.650 align:middle line:90%
He said, I'm beautiful.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:46.937 align:middle line:90%
Well, he's beautiful.

00:27:46.937 --> 00:27:49.270 align:middle line:84%
Where's the fucking rule book
that says what's beautiful

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:52.160 align:middle line:90%
and what's not, right?

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:90%
So it's all perception.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:55.900 align:middle line:90%
It's willingness and perception.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.360 align:middle line:84%
The willingness to
change, the willingness

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:04.450 align:middle line:84%
to step out of a paradigm
that's familiar, yet miserable.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:05.680 align:middle line:90%
It's familiar.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.965 align:middle line:84%
It's familiar to say,
I'm not beautiful.

00:28:07.965 --> 00:28:09.340 align:middle line:84%
But now you say
you're beautiful.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Now you've got to take
responsibility for that.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.148 align:middle line:84%
You've got to take
responsibility for now

00:28:13.148 --> 00:28:16.660 align:middle line:84%
how the world's going to
respond to you differently

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.122 align:middle line:90%
because you're beautiful now.

00:28:18.122 --> 00:28:20.205 align:middle line:84%
And then you've got to get
past this thing-- well,

00:28:20.205 --> 00:28:22.080 align:middle line:84%
who the fuck are you to
say you're beautiful?

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, who the fuck are
you to say I'm not, right?

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:28.400 align:middle line:84%
So that stuff goes on
in my head all the time.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.718 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS] It's very exhausting.

00:28:31.718 --> 00:28:33.010 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to just say, oh, yeah.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.840 align:middle line:90%
I am beautiful and so what?

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.370 align:middle line:90%
But that's kind of boring.

00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.890 align:middle line:84%
There's something sparky and
spunky about neurosis, I guess.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:41.690 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:46.210 align:middle line:90%


00:28:46.210 --> 00:28:49.150 align:middle line:84%
There's a point where there's
photographs of when I was

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:51.650 align:middle line:90%
younger-- my '30s--

00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:84%
that are flipped
through the film.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.920 align:middle line:84%
And the first time I saw that--
and I looked at that film,

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.770 align:middle line:84%
and I saw a picture
of myself in my '30s.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.480 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, holy Christ.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.700 align:middle line:90%
I was really handsome.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.610 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:08.800 align:middle line:84%
But in my '30s, I
just saw this guy

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.140 align:middle line:84%
that had to do everything
in his power to compensate

00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:13.160 align:middle line:90%
for the way I looked.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.680 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, wow.

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, well,
what if that's happening now?

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be 80 and
say, oh, when I was 59,

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:24.100 align:middle line:90%
I look pretty fucking good.

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.080 align:middle line:84%
I want to be current
with that now.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.730 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's the whole thing--

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:90%
being current, right?

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Being current with
your relationships.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:35.050 align:middle line:84%
What happened with your father
is you were totally current.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.980 align:middle line:84%
You were present and current,
and there was no escaping that.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.380 align:middle line:84%
It was rooted in
integrity and love,

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:84%
and it was present, which is
where integrity and love is.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:44.633 align:middle line:90%
It's in the present.

00:29:44.633 --> 00:29:50.800 align:middle line:90%


00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.520 align:middle line:90%
And that's where love is.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:57.300 align:middle line:90%


00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:02.670 align:middle line:84%
When you do love somebody,
part of that contract

00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.690 align:middle line:84%
is the potential to
be profoundly hurt.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And you have to agree
to that possibility.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, there's no love.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:17.250 align:middle line:84%
The thing about living it
safely without getting hurt--

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.020 align:middle line:90%
you can do that.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:22.050 align:middle line:84%
But you also
automatically prevent joy

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:26.217 align:middle line:84%
from entering your
life, automatically.

00:30:26.217 --> 00:30:27.300 align:middle line:90%
It's just the way it goes.

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:30.450 align:middle line:84%
It's the way the
universe set it up.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.940 align:middle line:84%
You can keep from getting
your heart broken,

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.500 align:middle line:84%
but it will never
ever melt, either.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:39.570 align:middle line:90%


00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:44.994 align:middle line:84%
Cafe Gratitude-- what happened
was that was just a part,

00:30:44.994 --> 00:30:48.180 align:middle line:90%
because that was 42 days.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:50.790 align:middle line:90%


00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:57.240 align:middle line:84%
But the lion's share of
recovery happened after that.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:02.100 align:middle line:84%
That was an introduction into a
way of being and a way of life

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:08.240 align:middle line:84%
that I would
incorporate later on.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:13.530 align:middle line:84%
But you don't lose 130 pounds
or 120 pounds in 42 days

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.170 align:middle line:90%
without a few amputations.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:20.710 align:middle line:90%


00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:21.510 align:middle line:90%
Easy.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:23.885 align:middle line:84%
What was the most important
thing to keep off the weight?

00:31:23.885 --> 00:31:27.360 align:middle line:84%
What do I believe was the
most crucial component?

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:34.660 align:middle line:84%
Without question,
love-- love for myself

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.890 align:middle line:90%
and love for other people.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:42.160 align:middle line:90%


00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Because addictions-- because
this is within the realm

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:48.190 align:middle line:90%
of addictions--

00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:54.310 align:middle line:84%
is, more than anything,
selfish and self-centered.

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:55.120 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And you don't see it
when you're an addict.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:58.330 align:middle line:90%
You don't see it.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:02.750 align:middle line:84%
You think, I thought, well,
I'm the one who's suffering.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.000 align:middle line:90%
How could it be self-centered?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.480 align:middle line:90%
I'm the one who's suffering.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:11.440 align:middle line:84%
I got a glimpse into the
selfishness of addiction

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.130 align:middle line:90%
when I went to rehab.

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:16.900 align:middle line:84%
And I was in a group,
and we were talking.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know
how this came up.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.890 align:middle line:84%
I was really,
really in bad shape.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:25.810 align:middle line:84%
I was really, really-- going
through severe withdrawals.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.580 align:middle line:90%
And I was in this group.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.480 align:middle line:90%
And this vision came to me.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.310 align:middle line:90%


00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:38.290 align:middle line:90%
This movie unraveled in my head.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.340 align:middle line:90%
And I had saw my kids--

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.820 align:middle line:90%
I have a son and a daughter.

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And they were, at the
time, both of them--

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.860 align:middle line:90%


00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.510 align:middle line:90%
well, my son was, like, 19.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:51.700 align:middle line:90%
My daughter was in her '20s.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.382 align:middle line:84%
And I had this vision,
because I had overdosed.

00:32:54.382 --> 00:32:55.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's how I
wound up in rehab.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.910 align:middle line:90%
I had overdosed.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:00.700 align:middle line:84%
And I had this vision that they
were walking down the street,

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:02.800 align:middle line:90%
and somebody met them.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:06.240 align:middle line:84%
And they were talking, and
they said, how about your dad?

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:09.610 align:middle line:90%


00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:10.870 align:middle line:90%
How is he?

00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:12.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, he's dead.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.250 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:16.720 align:middle line:90%
What did he die of?

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:24.140 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're not sure if it was
suicide or accidental overdose.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And when I heard
that, I realized

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:32.980 align:middle line:84%
the legacy with which I almost
left to my children to carry.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.650 align:middle line:90%


00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Well, dad died.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:40.100 align:middle line:84%
We don't know if he killed
himself or it was an accident.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:42.250 align:middle line:90%
And I thought--

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:46.030 align:middle line:84%
I wept harder than I
ever wept in my life.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.150 align:middle line:84%
I literally broke-- when they
say the expression broke down,

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:50.170 align:middle line:90%
I broke down.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:53.260 align:middle line:90%
I was broken.

00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.940 align:middle line:90%
My bones collapsed.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:34:00.630 align:middle line:84%
I was crying from
my lower intestines.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:02.090 align:middle line:90%
That's where it was coming from.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.780 align:middle line:90%
I was choking.

00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:09.310 align:middle line:84%
And I realized the selfishness
of not taking care of myself.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.400 align:middle line:84%
I realized that the
pain that I would

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:16.900 align:middle line:84%
have inflicted on people that
actually did care about me.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:20.449 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that I
had to do something.

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know what that
looked like or anything.

00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:34.000 align:middle line:84%
I just knew that I had to
create a new way of being,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.570 align:middle line:84%
and I had no idea of what that
meant or what it looked like.

00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:43.929 align:middle line:84%
But I learned, at that moment,
the value and the ultimate act

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:48.610 align:middle line:84%
of sanity and responsibility
is taking care of yourself.

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And I mean that without it
being at the expense of others,

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.770 align:middle line:84%
but generally from a
spiritual foundation

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.260 align:middle line:90%
to take care of myself.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.490 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know how to
adequately take care of myself.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:05.590 align:middle line:84%
But I realized, by not
taking care of myself,

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:07.900 align:middle line:84%
how much I was
hurting other people.

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:09.670 align:middle line:84%
It didn't occur to
me, because I was too

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.087 align:middle line:84%
caught up in the
self-centeredness

00:35:11.087 --> 00:35:14.110 align:middle line:90%
of my own suffering.

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:17.470 align:middle line:84%
And so I think about
that now all the time,

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:22.330 align:middle line:84%
that taking care of myself
so that I can be more present

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:27.040 align:middle line:84%
and more available-- and access
whatever resources I carry with

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.840 align:middle line:90%
me and gifts--

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:32.380 align:middle line:84%
to have access to those
to be able to serve you.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.370 align:middle line:90%


00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And mind you, I'm not
there all the time.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm not Moses or Buddha.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:46.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a practice to try to
maintain or to get access

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.490 align:middle line:90%
to that place where I know that.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:51.610 align:middle line:84%
I have to really be
present and work at it.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:57.060 align:middle line:90%


00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.360 align:middle line:84%
My opinion about
what's happening

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.150 align:middle line:84%
with the health across the
country and across the world--

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.220 align:middle line:84%
if you don't like the
health care system,

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.960 align:middle line:90%
take care of yourself.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.420 align:middle line:90%
Take care of yourself.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:11.793 align:middle line:90%


00:36:11.793 --> 00:36:13.710 align:middle line:84%
People panic when they
don't have health care.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.400 align:middle line:90%
I understand.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.920 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.610 align:middle line:84%
But to the extent to
which they panic--

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:22.062 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't seem right.

00:36:22.062 --> 00:36:23.520 align:middle line:84%
If you're 30 years
old, why are you

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.325 align:middle line:84%
in a panic about not
having health insurance?

00:36:26.325 --> 00:36:27.950 align:middle line:84%
You should just have
catastrophic care.

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:29.450 align:middle line:84%
If you wind up in
the hospital-- you

00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:31.840 align:middle line:84%
get hit by a car or
some shit like that.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.210 align:middle line:90%
But other than that--

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:37.625 align:middle line:90%


00:36:37.625 --> 00:36:41.205 align:middle line:84%
and I think that if we start
taking care of ourselves,

00:36:41.205 --> 00:36:44.190 align:middle line:84%
my guess is that this
society will greatly

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:50.226 align:middle line:84%
adjust some of the things that
are really askew right now.

00:36:50.226 --> 00:36:51.510 align:middle line:90%
We'll self-correct.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:57.620 align:middle line:90%


00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I have found, through
the film, that people

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:04.760 align:middle line:90%
identify with me a lot.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And that always surprised me,
and continues to surprise me,

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.780 align:middle line:84%
considering the nature of
the film, that it explicitly

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:17.900 align:middle line:84%
talks about addictions to drugs,
and alcohol, and that sort

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.570 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:25.700 align:middle line:84%
And what I believe to be true
is that the circumstances

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.320 align:middle line:90%
are immaterial.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the feeling that
people relate to.

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:35.630 align:middle line:84%
It's the feelings of
inadequacy, the feeling of fear,

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:39.298 align:middle line:90%
of despair, of unknowing--

00:37:39.298 --> 00:37:40.715 align:middle line:84%
all those things--
of being stuck.

00:37:40.715 --> 00:37:45.870 align:middle line:90%


00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:51.560 align:middle line:84%
And apparently, it
reflects the commonality

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.220 align:middle line:90%
of the human experience.

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know that I was
going to be one of those guys.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.760 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing,
I think, helps

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:02.400 align:middle line:84%
people relate to the film
is the contrast between me

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.200 align:middle line:90%
and the filmmakers.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.710 align:middle line:84%
The filmmakers are these
vegan, hippie types that

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:11.273 align:middle line:84%
grew up with real liberal
parents, and never got hit,

00:38:11.273 --> 00:38:12.190 align:middle line:90%
or anything like that.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:13.460 align:middle line:90%
And that was great.

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:18.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'm this guy who
grew up that if--

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:22.940 align:middle line:84%
two films that would
define my life as a kid

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.210 align:middle line:84%
were "On The Waterfront"
and the "Goodfellas."

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:27.650 align:middle line:84%
You put those two
films together,

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:31.490 align:middle line:90%
and that would be like my life.

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:37.380 align:middle line:84%
And so that contrast enables
people that may not be--

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.820 align:middle line:84%
or feel far removed from a
vegan lifestyle, or a raw food

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.410 align:middle line:84%
lifestyle, or even a
healthy lifestyle--

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:48.440 align:middle line:84%
here is this proletarian kind
of working, blue collar working

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.120 align:middle line:90%
class guy.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.240 align:middle line:90%
Those are my roots--

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.190 align:middle line:84%
working class
Italian neighborhood.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:59.020 align:middle line:84%
And also, those
kinds of feelings

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.970 align:middle line:90%
are equal opportunity feelings.

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:04.470 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter whether
you're an aristocrat or whether

00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:05.930 align:middle line:90%
you're--

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.630 align:middle line:84%
as seen with "The
King's Speech," right?

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:10.970 align:middle line:90%
This guy's an aristocrat with--

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:13.910 align:middle line:84%
an arrogant aristocrat
with a terrible-- an

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:18.710 align:middle line:84%
egomaniac with a terrible
inferiority complex, right?

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And so that's why I think
it works through the film,

00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:28.805 align:middle line:84%
because I'm not a
young, glamorous guy.

00:39:28.805 --> 00:39:31.490 align:middle line:90%


00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:33.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm not that bad looking,
but I'm not glamorous.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:39.520 align:middle line:90%


00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the main
reasons I'm unhappy

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.470 align:middle line:90%
is because I feel separate from.

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:50.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've discovered that
everything that everybody does

00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:54.130 align:middle line:84%
is to connect, even if it
seems perverse, like war.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:57.095 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere in there is somebody's
desire to connect, somehow.

00:39:57.095 --> 00:39:59.810 align:middle line:90%


00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And the notion of
separation is an illusion.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's why-- it's like,
you can't separate the wave

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:08.170 align:middle line:90%
from the ocean.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:14.050 align:middle line:84%
My experience, emotionally, is
really no different than yours.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.758 align:middle line:84%
The intensity of it
may be different.

00:40:16.758 --> 00:40:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, the
circumstances are different.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.770 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere in there,
there's a through line--

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:23.200 align:middle line:90%
an emotional through line.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.760 align:middle line:90%
Wherever it is.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I believe
makes the film work,

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.070 align:middle line:90%
and why people identify with me.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:41.050 align:middle line:90%


00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So in the past five years, my
life has been rather colorful.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:47.530 align:middle line:90%
There's been a lot of changes.

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:55.746 align:middle line:84%
So before I did the
film, I was stuck

00:40:55.746 --> 00:40:59.110 align:middle line:84%
in a life that was very
sad, full of medication.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.810 align:middle line:90%
I was taking antidepressants.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I was taking interferon
for my hepatitis C.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And I was just in a very
dark place in my life.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.870 align:middle line:84%
And I stumbled into this cafe,
this raw food restaurant,

00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:16.060 align:middle line:84%
where, after a couple of
encounters with the people

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.300 align:middle line:84%
that work there, was
asked to do a film that I

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.950 align:middle line:90%
had no idea what that meant.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.822 align:middle line:84%
And I had no idea
what it was about.

00:41:23.822 --> 00:41:25.280 align:middle line:84%
None of us knew
what we were doing.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.000 align:middle line:84%
We didn't even have a camera
when we decided to do the film.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.480 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, we
didn't have a narrative.

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.120 align:middle line:84%
The guys would write a
couple of storyboards,

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.100 align:middle line:84%
and they had an idea of
what they wanted to do.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.350 align:middle line:84%
And then they made the mistake
of knocking on my door,

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:39.680 align:middle line:90%
and everything would change.

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.340 align:middle line:84%
And so I got introduced
to this world

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:44.830 align:middle line:84%
of raw food, and clean
living, and colonics,

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and holistic healing,
massage, massage,

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:53.160 align:middle line:84%
and all these things that I
had scoffed at in past lives,

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.000 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And I got into this world for
42 days while being filmed.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And an enormous amount
of internal stuff

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:07.750 align:middle line:84%
got revealed, because as
I started eating raw food,

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:11.050 align:middle line:84%
and as I started getting loved,
and started doing affirmations,

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:13.390 align:middle line:84%
the mechanism that was
in place to prevent me

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:15.970 align:middle line:84%
from revealing these
things about myself

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:17.210 align:middle line:90%
couldn't sustain itself.

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And so these layers
automatically

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:25.000 align:middle line:84%
dissolved, revealing the heart
that I was trying to shield.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And after that,
after those 42 days,

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.230 align:middle line:90%
I lost touch with the guys.

00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:31.163 align:middle line:90%
And I sort of--

00:42:31.163 --> 00:42:32.830 align:middle line:84%
not that they
disappeared, but our lives

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.690 align:middle line:90%
took different directions.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:40.390 align:middle line:84%
And I slipped back into
an unhealthy lifestyle.

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:44.980 align:middle line:90%


00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And then I decided to start
taking care of myself.

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:51.490 align:middle line:84%
I had gained all
the weight back.

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:52.980 align:middle line:90%
And in that time--

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:55.570 align:middle line:84%
it was in these five years
I started working out

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.805 align:middle line:84%
and decided that I wanted
to take care of myself.

00:42:57.805 --> 00:43:02.290 align:middle line:90%


00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:03.460 align:middle line:90%
So I have a friend that--

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:07.645 align:middle line:84%
Robert Keen, who definitely
won't mind being mentioned--

00:43:07.645 --> 00:43:10.192 align:middle line:90%


00:43:10.192 --> 00:43:11.400 align:middle line:90%
that I used to hang out with.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And when I was overweight, I was
prone to self-deprecating humor

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:18.190 align:middle line:84%
and self-deprecating
remarks to beat you

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:19.990 align:middle line:84%
to the punch to
make it seem like I

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:22.420 align:middle line:90%
was OK with being 300 pounds.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:24.790 align:middle line:90%
Hey, you know.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And I made a joke that was
particularly self-deprecating.

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.300 align:middle line:90%
And he said, Frankie--

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:38.440 align:middle line:84%
he said, when you do that,
it's like you're putting down

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:39.467 align:middle line:90%
my friend.

00:43:39.467 --> 00:43:41.050 align:middle line:84%
He says, you're
putting yourself down.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:42.425 align:middle line:84%
It's like putting
down my friend.

00:43:42.425 --> 00:43:45.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't allow people
to put my friends down.

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:48.600 align:middle line:90%
He said, stop doing that.

00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:54.050 align:middle line:84%
And I guess he saw my
face, that it hit me.

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:57.820 align:middle line:84%
And he said, if
you want to change,

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.210 align:middle line:84%
if you want to lose weight,
if you do what I tell you,

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:04.360 align:middle line:84%
I guarantee you you'll
lose 25 pounds in a month.

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:06.970 align:middle line:90%
And he's an athlete.

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, I had hit
that place, that low place,

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:13.050 align:middle line:90%
that my ears opened up.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:16.555 align:middle line:90%
And my heart opened up.

00:44:16.555 --> 00:44:19.850 align:middle line:90%
And I took his offer.

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:22.120 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, I
was courageous enough

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.000 align:middle line:84%
to allow him into my heart
and to allow that exchange

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.600 align:middle line:90%
to take place.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.450 align:middle line:84%
And damn it if
that didn't happen.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:30.470 align:middle line:84%
And this guy was
with me every day.

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:34.397 align:middle line:84%
And for a year, I would
text him my weight.

00:44:34.397 --> 00:44:35.980 align:middle line:84%
He was like my
accountability partner.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:39.550 align:middle line:84%
And because he was also a
recovered alcoholic and drug

00:44:39.550 --> 00:44:42.360 align:middle line:84%
addict, I couldn't
bullshit him, right?

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.220 align:middle line:84%
There's no way, because addicts
and alcoholics can smell

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.470 align:middle line:84%
bullshit before it even comes
out of the chute, right?

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:48.820 align:middle line:90%
They know it's there.

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:52.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I couldn't say I didn't
want to go to the gym today,

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:54.460 align:middle line:84%
because I-- whatever,
because I just couldn't.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:59.200 align:middle line:90%
So I had to meet that.

00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:02.160 align:middle line:90%
I had to be accountable.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.840 align:middle line:90%
And then I lost all this weight.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:07.700 align:middle line:84%
And then corresponding
when I lost 100 pounds,

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:10.940 align:middle line:90%
we had our first screening.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:14.650 align:middle line:84%
And then the screening started
about a year and a half ago,

00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:16.240 align:middle line:90%
more or less-- two years ago--

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:18.580 align:middle line:90%
a year and a half ago.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And the first six months,
we didn't do too many.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.140 align:middle line:84%
But then they
started picking up.

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.888 align:middle line:90%


00:45:25.888 --> 00:45:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And in the past year
and a half, I've

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:33.130 align:middle line:84%
been learning how to present
a message to the public,

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.430 align:middle line:84%
and also have to learn
that this is not about me.

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:38.590 align:middle line:84%
It's about, I'm a
messenger, and I

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:43.810 align:middle line:84%
was privileged to be picked
to go out and do something

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.580 align:middle line:90%
that I love to do.

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:46.600 align:middle line:90%
But it's not about me.

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:47.960 align:middle line:90%
The message is not about me.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:49.510 align:middle line:90%
I'm just a messenger.

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And the moment I forget
that, it'll blow it for me.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.050 align:middle line:84%
I know that that's
the biggest part,

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:01.360 align:middle line:84%
is to recognize all the
time that I'm of service.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:02.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm not a big shot.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:04.060 align:middle line:90%
I'm just really lucky.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.250 align:middle line:90%
I stumbled into grace.

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:09.600 align:middle line:90%
