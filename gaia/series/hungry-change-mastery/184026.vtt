[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Back in 1990, I
moved to New York.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.253 align:middle line:84%
And at the time, I was about
the same weight as I am now.

00:00:28.253 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And I was one of
those people that

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.790 align:middle line:84%
is a naturally thin person,
you know the type that

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.268 align:middle line:90%
can eat whatever they want.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:36.060 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have really
a problem with weight.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.560 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I
moved to New York,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:90%
I started putting on weight.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't think much
about it in the beginning,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.500 align:middle line:84%
but after a couple of years
I gained 5 kilos, 10 kilos.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.810 align:middle line:84%
After a while, I gained maybe
50 pounds, something like that,

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.850 align:middle line:90%
20 kilos, 25 kilos.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.280 align:middle line:84%
I decided to try to
do something about it.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.530 align:middle line:90%
And I did what everybody does.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:84%
I went on a diet because
it just made sense.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, calories
in, calories out.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:84%
Cut your calories, and
you lose weight, right?

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.120 align:middle line:90%
So I went on a diet.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.612 align:middle line:84%
And actually I went
on a lot of diets.

00:01:08.612 --> 00:01:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And every diet I went on always
followed the same approach.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.470 align:middle line:84%
There'd be a whole list of
things you couldn't have.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.850 align:middle line:90%
No wheat, no sugar, no fat.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.950 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, I'd follow
the diet to the letter.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And I'd lose weight, because
you can lose weight on a diet.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'd lose maybe 10
pounds or 5 kilos.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden I find
myself in the position

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.840 align:middle line:84%
where I'm not losing
weight anymore.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.000 align:middle line:90%
And I'm still on the diet.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.307 align:middle line:84%
I'm still fighting
cravings left and right.

00:01:32.307 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not losing weight.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.162 align:middle line:84%
And in a sense what it's
like is like when you're

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.620 align:middle line:84%
in that situation,
it's like you've

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.912 align:middle line:90%
painted yourself into a corner.

00:01:38.912 --> 00:01:43.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I did have a life-changing
experience around 2001 and 9/11

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.280 align:middle line:84%
because it was only
by a fluke of fate

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.160 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't on one of the
flights, United Airlines

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
93, the one that crash
landed in Pennsylvania.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:84%
And that experience
affected me very strongly

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.440 align:middle line:84%
because I felt like here
I was killing myself,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and now the universe has just
given me a second chance.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.910 align:middle line:84%
And when that happened,
I really decided

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.100 align:middle line:84%
that I was going to
find a real answer.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.770 align:middle line:84%
I knew diets weren't working for
me, because I tried every diet,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.820 align:middle line:90%
and they just weren't--

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:90%
nothing was happening.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I'd lose weight and gain
weight, and lose weight and gain

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:21.810 align:middle line:90%
weight.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.940 align:middle line:84%
And so I decided I was
never going to diet again.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.440 align:middle line:84%
But I was going to
try to figure out

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.350 align:middle line:84%
why my body wanted to be
fat in the first place,

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:84%
and what I could do to
get it to want to be thin.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.447 align:middle line:84%
And I had a very solid
biochemistry background

00:02:33.447 --> 00:02:34.947 align:middle line:84%
from the University
of Pennsylvania.

00:02:34.947 --> 00:02:36.660 align:middle line:84%
That gave me enough
of a foundation

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.540 align:middle line:84%
to go on the internet
and do all the research.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.410 align:middle line:84%
And I found something
really amazing,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.830 align:middle line:84%
and that is our bodies
have a fat switch.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.930 align:middle line:84%
And when that fat
switch gets activated,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.700 align:middle line:84%
your body goes into
fat storage mode.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.030 align:middle line:90%
And it will gain weight.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.890 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.020 align:middle line:90%
I was over 400 pounds.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.860 align:middle line:90%
And I had very bad sleep apnea.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.790 align:middle line:84%
I was borderline
type 2 diabetic,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.250 align:middle line:84%
elevated triglycerides
and cholesterol.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd worked with Dr. Atkins,
the late Dr. Atkins,

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:90%
face to face in New York.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And in the end,
the best he could

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.330 align:middle line:84%
do was yell at me
for being so fat

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.103 align:middle line:84%
and because I was
killing myself.

00:03:12.103 --> 00:03:13.270 align:middle line:90%
He goes, what are you doing?

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:90%
You're killing yourself.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.040 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to myself,
you've sold 200 million copies

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.640 align:middle line:90%
of your book.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.840 align:middle line:84%
The best-- you think
I'm going to lose weight

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.882 align:middle line:90%
because you're mad at me?

00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Is that really the
best you can do?

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.390 align:middle line:90%
So I was over 400 pounds.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And after I had that
sort of epiphany

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and changed my focus from diet
to finding the real reasons why

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.790 align:middle line:84%
my body wanted to be
fat, I then went on

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.140 align:middle line:90%
to lose over 200 pounds.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.190 align:middle line:84%
I lost about 220 pounds over
a 2 and 1/2 year period.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.440 align:middle line:90%
And that was seven years ago.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.020 align:middle line:84%
And I've been the same
weight now for seven years.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.275 align:middle line:90%
And I haven't never dieted.

00:03:48.275 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:84%
There's never a time I think,
I'm not going to have this.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.210 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to have this.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.950 align:middle line:84%
I do eat a very
healthy diet, but it's

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.930 align:middle line:90%
what my body craves now.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.550 align:middle line:84%
And what I've
discovered is, when

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.920 align:middle line:84%
you're living in a body
that wants to be thin,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.570 align:middle line:90%
it's all automatic.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
You simply crave
healthier foods.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.600 align:middle line:90%
Your metabolism speeds up.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.740 align:middle line:90%
Your tastebuds change.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.060 align:middle line:90%
You're not as hungry.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Your body becomes more
efficient at burning fat.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.710 align:middle line:84%
But having lived through a
body that wanted to be fat,

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.860 align:middle line:84%
I discovered-- and I know
from firsthand experience--

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.709 align:middle line:84%
that when your body wants to
be fat, you will gain weight.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And there are
certain triggers that

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:90%
cause your body to gain weight.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.610 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't address those
triggers, you will gain weight.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.190 align:middle line:84%
There's no question
about it, 100%.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.270 align:middle line:90%
It's chemically based.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.060 align:middle line:84%
If you, for example,
give a doctor cortisol,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.310 align:middle line:90%
the doctor says just eat less.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.870 align:middle line:84%
If you give them
cortisol medication,

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
over the next three
years, I guarantee you

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:90%
he'll gain 50 to 100 pounds.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.280 align:middle line:90%
I guarantee you.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.420 align:middle line:90%
It's chemical.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.153 align:middle line:84%
Your body goes into
fat storage mode.

00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:46.570 align:middle line:84%
You're simply
hungry all the time.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:90%
You crave fattening foods.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.940 align:middle line:90%
You're exhausted.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Your metabolism slows down.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.857 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes almost
impossible for you to burn fat.

00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:57.190 align:middle line:84%
And everybody's talking about
calories in, calories out.

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.900 align:middle line:84%
Nobody even asked the
question, do I even

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:90%
have the ability to burn fat?

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And when your fat
programs are on,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
you do not have the
ability to burn fat.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.120 align:middle line:84%
My old life literally feels
like a different life.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when I think about it,
I think about a dream or a movie

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.710 align:middle line:90%
that I saw of someone else.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.990 align:middle line:84%
But my memories of it
was constant chaos,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.780 align:middle line:90%
constant stress, constant agony.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Just tying my shoelaces
was a tremendous battle.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:90%
Forget about walking up stairs.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Getting into a car or a
plane was sheer agony.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Just sitting down and
feeling all that weight

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.850 align:middle line:90%
around your waist was just pain.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.800 align:middle line:90%
And my life--

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.260 align:middle line:84%
I was in a job
that I didn't like.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.460 align:middle line:90%
My heart was somewhere else.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.450 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be somewhere else.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to be doing
something else.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.608 align:middle line:84%
I knew I had something
else to offer to the world.

00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So there was just all this
pain of having to go to work

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.260 align:middle line:90%
and not having the energy.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.770 align:middle line:84%
I had really bad sleep
apnea, the worst sleep

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.340 align:middle line:84%
apnea that the sleep study
technicians had ever seen.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:84%
My blood oxygen
levels were in the 50s

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.950 align:middle line:84%
when they're supposed
to be in the 90s.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.770 align:middle line:84%
I'd fall asleep in
meetings talking to people.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.570 align:middle line:84%
I'd fall asleep when I was
in my car at a red light.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.000 align:middle line:90%
I was a walking zombie.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.705 align:middle line:90%
And it was a total nightmare.

00:06:13.705 --> 00:06:18.032 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.032 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:84%
After I lost the
weight, I realized

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:84%
what it was like to have
that type of weight on me.

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I have those big 110
pound gas tanks at my house.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.320 align:middle line:90%
I have two of them.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.292 align:middle line:84%
And you have to replace
them every once in a while.

00:06:33.292 --> 00:06:34.250 align:middle line:90%
So I was replacing one.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.300 align:middle line:90%
I could barely lift it.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.690 align:middle line:84%
And I'm taking it over
and just budging it.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And I thought to
myself, my god, I

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:84%
was carrying around two of
these every day of my life.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.700 align:middle line:84%
Every moment of my life, I was
carrying around two of these.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you think you want to
go to work in the morning

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:84%
when you're carrying
around two gas tanks,

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.620 align:middle line:84%
or talk to your wife or your
spouse or go out to a movie?

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.610 align:middle line:90%
Anything.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.780 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to move.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:90%


00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.562 align:middle line:90%
Definitely bread.

00:07:02.562 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I could
get off bread back then.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.340 align:middle line:90%
I was totally addicted to bread.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:90%
Pizza, whatever form.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the Atkins
diet was so miserable for me,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:84%
because I was so
addicted to carbs,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.300 align:middle line:90%
to what I call now dead food.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.620 align:middle line:90%
I was so addicted to dead--

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.913 align:middle line:84%
to try to go off that,
at the end of the day,

00:07:20.913 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:90%
it was just miserable.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And what I used to do
is I used to swap diets

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.460 align:middle line:84%
because the Atkins
diet is zero carbs.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.130 align:middle line:84%
And then the Pritikin
diet is all carbs.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:37.415 align:middle line:84%
So my wife used to joke with me
that I was on the Atkins diet

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:39.290 align:middle line:84%
during the day and the
Pritikin diet at night

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.210 align:middle line:84%
because I'd come home
at the end of the day,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.150 align:middle line:84%
and I just couldn't take going
a whole day without carbs.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:46.460 align:middle line:90%
But I had to have bread.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you when I
look at bread right now,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at a
piece of cardboard.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there is no way my
body would want anything

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.960 align:middle line:90%
to do with that.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.500 align:middle line:84%
My body knows what nutrition
is and knows what's real.

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.780 align:middle line:90%
And it's not an effort.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And an effort would be to try to
get me to eat bread right now.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.834 align:middle line:84%
There's just no way I have
any interest in it whatsoever.

00:08:05.834 --> 00:08:09.920 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.230 align:middle line:84%
It's not like I'm
resisting anything.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And people say to me, oh, you
must have so much willpower.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
And if I have one message,
it's that willpower

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.520 align:middle line:90%
has nothing to do with it.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.460 align:middle line:84%
Because I lived through a
body that wanted to be fat.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And I now live in a body
that wants to be thin.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.120 align:middle line:90%
It is effortless.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.760 align:middle line:84%
I eat whatever I
want whenever I want.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And that has gone on
now for seven years.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.179 align:middle line:90%
I don't weigh myself.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:37.150 align:middle line:84%
I wear the same clothes
that I did seven years ago.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:38.630 align:middle line:90%
There's no effort whatsoever.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:40.127 align:middle line:90%
It's not about willpower.

00:08:40.127 --> 00:08:41.210 align:middle line:90%
It's not about discipline.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:84%
It's about getting your
body to want to be thin.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:48.090 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.647 align:middle line:84%
There's about 10 or
15 reasons that I've

00:08:50.647 --> 00:08:52.730 align:middle line:84%
been able to identify that
your fat programs would

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:90%
get activated.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.330 align:middle line:84%
But one of the reasons why
your fat programs get activated

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.420 align:middle line:84%
is because we're
nutritionally famined.

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:90%
We're nutritionally starved.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:90%
We're in a nutritional famine.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.698 align:middle line:84%
And what that means
is, you could be

00:09:05.698 --> 00:09:06.990 align:middle line:90%
eating to your heart's content.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
You could eat 10,000
calories a day.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.180 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not getting
the specific nutrients

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
your body needs in a way that
they can digest and assimilate,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.360 align:middle line:84%
then you're starving
on a nutritional basis.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
And as long as you're starving
on a nutritional basis,

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:21.290 align:middle line:84%
your body's going to
stay hungry to get

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:22.710 align:middle line:90%
those specific nutrients.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, man made foods
like bread and sugar

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.880 align:middle line:84%
trick your body into
thinking-- and table salt,

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.530 align:middle line:84%
as a matter of fact--
trick your body

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.780 align:middle line:84%
into thinking you're
getting specific nutrients.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And so your body
stays hungry for them.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.727 align:middle line:84%
But then the cells
don't get nourished.

00:09:36.727 --> 00:09:38.810 align:middle line:84%
And as long as the cells
aren't getting nourished,

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:40.950 align:middle line:84%
you're starving on
a cellular level.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So you have to--
one of the things

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.450 align:middle line:90%
I talk about is adding foods.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.760 align:middle line:84%
Not dieting because
dieting is another thing

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:84%
that causes your body to
activate its fat programs.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.170 align:middle line:84%
Because the whole
reason why we have

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:53.952 align:middle line:84%
fat programs is to protect
us against famines.

00:09:53.952 --> 00:09:55.910 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of years ago,
when we lived outdoors,

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:58.220 align:middle line:84%
and we didn't know where our
next meal was coming from,

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:84%
if there was a famine because
it was a cold winter or whatever

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.833 align:middle line:84%
reason, your body
is going to want

00:10:03.833 --> 00:10:05.750 align:middle line:84%
to hold extra weight to
protect you from that.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.603 align:middle line:90%
And a famine is a stress.

00:10:07.603 --> 00:10:09.020 align:middle line:84%
And if you go
through that stress,

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.900 align:middle line:84%
your body's going to say,
we need an extra 10 pounds

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:90%
to protect us against famines.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you go on
a diet, guess what?

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.680 align:middle line:90%
That's a famine.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, that same
stress of a famine

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.990 align:middle line:84%
when you have a diet, and so
it activates your fat programs.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:25.767 align:middle line:90%
Sure, you can lose 10 pounds.

00:10:25.767 --> 00:10:27.350 align:middle line:84%
But you just made
your body want to be

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:30.560 align:middle line:84%
10 pounds heavier than
when you even started

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.210 align:middle line:90%
to protect you against famines.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.600 align:middle line:84%
So it actually gets your
body to want to be fatter.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And it's not just
dieting that does that.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.920 align:middle line:84%
Other stresses-- mental
stresses and emotional

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.380 align:middle line:84%
stresses-- cause the exact
same chemistry as a famine.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.852 align:middle line:84%
So your body gets tricked into
activating those fat programs.

00:10:48.852 --> 00:10:50.810 align:middle line:84%
And when your body gets
tricked into activating

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.660 align:middle line:84%
fat programs, and at the
time of unlimited all

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:59.760 align:middle line:84%
you can eat excess empty carbs,
that's a recipe for disaster.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get
morbid obesity.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.803 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I lived through.

00:11:02.803 --> 00:11:07.080 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:90%
You can lose weight on a diet.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:84%
But it's a little bit
like borrowing from Peter

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.550 align:middle line:90%
to pay Paul.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.720 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can get 10
pounds off your body

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.553 align:middle line:90%
through shear force.

00:11:16.553 --> 00:11:18.678 align:middle line:84%
But you're going to have
to pay back with interest.

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:20.153 align:middle line:90%
You'll pay back with 15 pounds.

00:11:20.153 --> 00:11:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Because your body--
every time you

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:84%
force yourself to
lose weight, your body

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:84%
is going to want to have
extra weight to protect you

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.590 align:middle line:90%
from a perceived famine.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.500 align:middle line:84%
And I lived through this, where
I lose 10 pounds, gain 15.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.210 align:middle line:90%
Lose 10 pounds, gain 15.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:36.730 align:middle line:84%
Until I have gained
over 200 pounds.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:41.310 align:middle line:84%
And when I say I tried every
diet, besides meeting face

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.580 align:middle line:84%
to face with Atkins,
going to Pritkin,

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.280 align:middle line:84%
I had naturopaths,
homeopaths, acupuncture.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.920 align:middle line:84%
I had these seeds taped to
my ear from an acupuncturist.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And they're supposed to be--
it's like an acupressure point.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So every time you're hungry,
you're supposed to press them.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.868 align:middle line:84%
I'd walk through the
streets of New York.

00:11:54.868 --> 00:11:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Every time I'd smell pizza, I'd
sit there and press these seeds

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.040 align:middle line:90%
in my ear.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.065 align:middle line:90%
Is what I lived with.

00:12:00.065 --> 00:12:01.980 align:middle line:90%
And I really did work at it.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.350 align:middle line:84%
People think that
overweight people are just

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.100 align:middle line:90%
weak and lazy and overindulgent.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.550 align:middle line:90%
I am a very disciplined person.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But I could not-- when
my body wanted to be fat,

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:14.210 align:middle line:90%
I could not lose the weight.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.220 align:middle line:84%
And I had fitness
trainers in the morning.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.100 align:middle line:90%
I was running three companies.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.270 align:middle line:90%
I'm a hardworking person.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.620 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't lose the weight.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can not lose the weight
when your body wants to be fat.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.300 align:middle line:90%
You can not.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.060 align:middle line:84%
Just in the short term,
but not in the long term,

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:31.530 align:middle line:84%
until you address
the real issues.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:36.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:39.300 align:middle line:90%
There's about 12--

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.570 align:middle line:84%
I forget how many, but
somewhere about 12 to 15

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:44.240 align:middle line:84%
stresses that can activate
your fat programs.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And the reason they
activate your fat programs

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.240 align:middle line:84%
is because stress causes
chemistry in the body.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:84%
A famine causes
chemistry in the body.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, for some people, the
stresses in our modern day life

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.580 align:middle line:84%
cause the exact same
chemistry as a famine.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And when that happens,
your body gets

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.060 align:middle line:84%
tricked into
activating the famine

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.890 align:middle line:90%
response or these fat programs.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.600 align:middle line:84%
So the type of stresses
are like nothing

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.810 align:middle line:84%
that you would ever associate
necessarily with waking.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.830 align:middle line:84%
Sleep deprivation, dehydration,
mental and emotional stress.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:90%
You're driving to work.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:90%
You're stuck in traffic.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.240 align:middle line:84%
Your boss is going
to get mad at you.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.650 align:middle line:90%
That's causing chemistry.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.950 align:middle line:84%
Every time you have a mental
or an emotional stress,

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:84%
it's causing chemistry in
your body, real chemistry.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.232 align:middle line:84%
And when that chemistry is the
same chemistry as a famine,

00:13:28.232 --> 00:13:29.940 align:middle line:84%
your body's going to
want to gain weight.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.510 align:middle line:84%
It's trying to protect you
from the stresses in your life.

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't know what to do.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.747 align:middle line:84%
We're living in a world that's
so different from the way

00:13:38.747 --> 00:13:41.330 align:middle line:84%
it was thousands of years ago,
where all we had to worry about

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:84%
was not being eaten
by a tiger, and where

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.350 align:middle line:90%
our next meal was coming from.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.720 align:middle line:84%
And now we've got to worry
about where our mortgage-- how

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.280 align:middle line:84%
are we going to pay our
mortgage or our credit card,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.863 align:middle line:84%
or if our kid's going
to go to school,

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:53.040 align:middle line:84%
or if the world's
going to get blown up.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.040 align:middle line:84%
And all of these stresses
are causing chemistry,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.990 align:middle line:84%
and our bodies are
trying to protect us.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:58.220 align:middle line:90%
And people get so mad.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.200 align:middle line:90%
We get so mad at our bodies.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.168 align:middle line:84%
We hate our bodies
because we think

00:14:02.168 --> 00:14:04.460 align:middle line:84%
that our body's trying to
sabotage us or out to get us.

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.930 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a protection mechanism.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.255 align:middle line:90%
It's nothing more.

00:14:08.255 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:90%
It's your body's chemistry.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.330 align:middle line:84%
And when you understand
that, and you understand

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:13.163 align:middle line:84%
the protection mechanism,
and you understand

00:14:13.163 --> 00:14:15.950 align:middle line:84%
how to deactivate the protection
mechanism by addressing

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:19.135 align:middle line:84%
the real stresses in your life,
it's a very automatic process.

00:14:19.135 --> 00:14:20.510 align:middle line:84%
And your body just
simply doesn't

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:21.718 align:middle line:90%
need to hold onto the weight.

00:14:21.718 --> 00:14:23.427 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't think you
need the protection.

00:14:23.427 --> 00:14:25.400 align:middle line:84%
So dealing with mental
and emotional stress,

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
dealing with childhood traumas,
dealing with toxins, digestion.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, we've lost the
ability to digest food because

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.920 align:middle line:84%
of antibiotics and
chlorine and toxins

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and modern day man
made invented foods.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And even stress itself affects
your ability to digest.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.190 align:middle line:84%
So we've totally lost the
ability to digest the foods.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.730 align:middle line:84%
And the foods we eat don't
have any nutrients anyway,

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:84%
that between the two we
are chronically starving

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.700 align:middle line:90%
on a cellular level.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.223 align:middle line:84%
And our bodies are screaming
for help and nutrition.

00:14:56.223 --> 00:14:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And that's a stress
that's going to make

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:58.932 align:middle line:90%
your body want to be fat.

00:14:58.932 --> 00:15:03.520 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, fat is a protection
mechanism originally designed

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.790 align:middle line:84%
to protect you from
famines and cold weather.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.640 align:middle line:90%
That's fat's original purpose.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.780 align:middle line:84%
But in today's world, fat
also protects us from toxins.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.850 align:middle line:84%
Because we're literally
swimming in toxins.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:22.650 align:middle line:90%
I read an article.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:84%
There's 20 different toxins
in bread, 20 different sprays

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.510 align:middle line:84%
and chemicals and pesticides
and herbicides and fungicides.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.450 align:middle line:84%
20 different ones from the
seed to the actual bread

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:90%
that we're eating.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
And there's toxins
in the plastics.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And every year there's 3,000
new toxins that are invented.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.700 align:middle line:90%
We're swimming in toxins.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:84%
We're taking in so many
toxins that our body can't

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.000 align:middle line:90%
eliminate them fast enough.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.368 align:middle line:84%
And so if your body can't
eliminate the toxins,

00:15:48.368 --> 00:15:50.160 align:middle line:84%
they can't be swimming
in your bloodstream.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:90%
You've got to store them.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Fat is the appropriate
place to store toxins

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.580 align:middle line:84%
because it's a chemically
neutral environment.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.360 align:middle line:84%
It acts as a buffer to
protect you from the toxin.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And one study I read
said that there's

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.440 align:middle line:84%
over 800 different
toxins in our fat cells.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.800 align:middle line:84%
So as long as you're
taking in more toxins

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.300 align:middle line:84%
than you're
eliminating, your body's

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.580 align:middle line:90%
not going to let you burn fat.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.110 align:middle line:84%
Because burning
the fat will just

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:90%
put more toxins into your body.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.160 align:middle line:84%
So you have to address
the fact that you're

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.460 align:middle line:84%
being assaulted with toxins
before your body will

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.560 align:middle line:90%
allow you to let go of weight.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And I really have to
stress allow as the word.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.340 align:middle line:84%
Your body has to allow
you to lose weight.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:90%
And then it's automatic.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.110 align:middle line:84%
But you have to give
your body its due.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.430 align:middle line:90%
You can't force it.

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.330 align:middle line:90%
Not in the long term.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Maybe in the short term.

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And the reason
you can't force it

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.480 align:middle line:84%
is because the same
mechanisms that

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:43.170 align:middle line:84%
control your heartbeat and your
breathing control your hunger.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:47.790 align:middle line:84%
So you can control the types
of foods you put in your mouth

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:51.240 align:middle line:84%
for a while, but you can't
control how hungry you are.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:54.960 align:middle line:84%
And you can't control the
types of foods you crave.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.410 align:middle line:90%
That's the domain of your body.

00:16:56.410 --> 00:16:57.420 align:middle line:84%
And if your body
wants to be fat,

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.128 align:middle line:84%
it's going to make
you insatiably hungry,

00:16:59.128 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:84%
the same way that if
you're sleep deprived,

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.870 align:middle line:84%
it's going to
force you to sleep.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.141 align:middle line:84%
So imagine you walk
into your doctor,

00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
and he said your problem
is you sleep too much.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:90%
Just sleep two hours a night.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.111 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in
the world judged you

00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:12.540 align:middle line:90%
because you slept too much.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And so you could sleep
two hours a night, right?

00:17:14.130 --> 00:17:16.213 align:middle line:84%
You could do that for a
day, two days, three days,

00:17:16.213 --> 00:17:17.520 align:middle line:90%
five days maybe.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.150 align:middle line:84%
But eventually you're
going to need a huge sleep.

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:84%
That's because your body
is forcing you to sleep.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:25.169 align:middle line:84%
And your body has the
ability to do that.

00:17:25.169 --> 00:17:27.540 align:middle line:90%
It's the exact same with hunger.

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:30.780 align:middle line:84%
You can force yourself to
eat less in the short term.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.470 align:middle line:84%
But your body will force you
through the same mechanism

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:35.640 align:middle line:90%
to eat more.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And eventually you'll
have a big binge.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And then people get
so discouraged by it.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.070 align:middle line:84%
But it's simply because we don't
know how to operate our bodies.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.830 align:middle line:84%
We're violating our
body's basic survival laws

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.600 align:middle line:90%
over and over and over again.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.510 align:middle line:84%
The whole dieting
paradigm is flawed.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.340 align:middle line:90%
And every diet comes out--

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:55.800 align:middle line:84%
every week there's a new
diet based on the same idea

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.230 align:middle line:84%
that you can somehow force
yourself to lose weight.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.220 align:middle line:90%
And it's flawed.

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:84%
It's based on a fundamental
flaw that every time you

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.010 align:middle line:84%
force yourself to
lose weight, your body

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:90%
will force you to gain weight.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:11.530 align:middle line:90%


00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.672 align:middle line:84%
You've got to-- in order to
lose weight and get your body

00:18:14.672 --> 00:18:17.130 align:middle line:84%
to want to be thin, you've got
to address it on all levels.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.940 align:middle line:84%
You've got to address it
from the mind, from the body,

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:20.875 align:middle line:90%
energetically.

00:18:20.875 --> 00:18:22.500 align:middle line:84%
You've got to look
at all these things.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.667 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't take the
mind out of the equation.

00:18:24.667 --> 00:18:28.200 align:middle line:84%
Because every time we have a
mental or an emotional stress,

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.180 align:middle line:84%
it's causing
chemistry in the body.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.270 align:middle line:84%
And that chemistry can be
activating your fat programs.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So you have to deal with
the stresses in your life.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.738 align:middle line:84%
You have to deal with
childhood traumas.

00:18:37.738 --> 00:18:39.780 align:middle line:84%
You know, I've talked to
so many people that have

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.300 align:middle line:90%
been overweight all their life.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And I always ask them,
when did it start?

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.080 align:middle line:90%
When I was four years old.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:84%
What happened when you
were four years old?

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:50.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, my father was an
alcoholic and he beat me.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:84%
Or we moved to another country,
and I was really scared.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.255 align:middle line:84%
Or there was some sort
of other abuse or trauma.

00:18:57.255 --> 00:18:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Where someone else will
say it's when they were 20.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.672 align:middle line:90%
What happened when you were 20?

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:02.760 align:middle line:90%
This, that, and the other thing.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.820 align:middle line:84%
Fundamental traumas that
we've had from our past

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:09.210 align:middle line:84%
will trigger a feeling
of unsafety in the world.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:14.637 align:middle line:84%
And that feeling of unsafety is
reflected back to us every day.

00:19:14.637 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:84%
We pass someone that reminds us
of someone who used to beat us

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:90%
up, and we get scared.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.040 align:middle line:90%
We got mugged once.

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.688 align:middle line:84%
We walk down the
alley, we get scared.

00:19:21.688 --> 00:19:22.980 align:middle line:90%
We're afraid of losing our job.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.300 align:middle line:90%
Our boss yells at us.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.220 align:middle line:90%
We get scared.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.520 align:middle line:84%
So traumas trigger this
feeling that you're unsafe.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And you have got
to somehow reclaim

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.810 align:middle line:90%
this feeling of inherent safety.

00:19:33.810 --> 00:19:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you can
do that, your body

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.970 align:middle line:84%
will relax and will let
you let go of the weight.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:46.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, well, I have certain
visualization techniques

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.950 align:middle line:84%
that I use with people to
help them address childhood

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.700 align:middle line:84%
traumas through
reliving them and having

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.860 align:middle line:84%
more positive
associations with them,

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:84%
through creating a
powerful feeling of safety

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:01.200 align:middle line:84%
around your body, and going
back to that situation

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.420 align:middle line:84%
and having this protection
that we've created

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.790 align:middle line:84%
through visualization,
having this protection,

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.280 align:middle line:84%
go back with them
and protect them

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
and make them totally
reimagine the situation.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.510 align:middle line:84%
Because our bodies don't know
the difference between a real

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.990 align:middle line:90%
and imagined experience.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.790 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:84%
Like they've done studies
with Olympic athletes,

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.970 align:middle line:84%
and every great Olympic
athlete uses visualization.

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:28.440 align:middle line:84%
But they've done studies
where when an athlete does

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.250 align:middle line:84%
visualization, their
brain, their neurons,

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:34.200 align:middle line:84%
their nervous system,
all get activated

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.630 align:middle line:84%
in the same coordinated
sequence as if they're actually

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.648 align:middle line:90%
doing the sport.

00:20:37.648 --> 00:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
Your body doesn't
know the difference

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.450 align:middle line:84%
between a real or
imagined experience.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.450 align:middle line:84%
If you have a dream that
a tiger is chasing you,

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:44.970 align:middle line:84%
you're going to wake up sweating
and your heart's pounding.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So when you use visualization
to go back and relieve childhood

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:84%
traumas, your body totally
reprograms what happened

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and what's safe and what's
not safe in the world.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.020 align:middle line:84%
So I use visualization
where we go back,

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:03.360 align:middle line:84%
and we create this
powerful feeling of safety.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.850 align:middle line:90%
We reimagine the situation.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:07.620 align:middle line:90%
And we let go of the pain of it.

00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:10.500 align:middle line:84%
And then all through life, we
imagine the rest of your life,

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.450 align:middle line:84%
anywhere where there is any
pain from that, relive it.

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:15.450 align:middle line:84%
And then in your present
life, have that feeling

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:16.800 align:middle line:90%
of safety around you.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.295 align:middle line:84%
And then through doing
daily visualizations,

00:21:19.295 --> 00:21:20.670 align:middle line:84%
like listening to
my CD that I've

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.390 align:middle line:84%
created and things like that,
people on a cellular level,

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:84%
on a conscious, body
conscious, subconscious level,

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.400 align:middle line:90%
there's a feeling of safety.

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can't fake
a feeling of safety.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:34.860 align:middle line:84%
Like right now as I'm sitting
here and I'm talking to you

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:36.570 align:middle line:90%
I feel safe.

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.640 align:middle line:84%
I have never felt
more safe in my life.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.810 align:middle line:90%
I just feel totally safe.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:40.650 align:middle line:90%
I can't fake that.

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why it is.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.750 align:middle line:84%
It's through years
of visualization

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:84%
and my daily training and
all this, but I feel safe.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And so now I'm not
being triggered

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:90%
by all these stressors.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:84%
There was a time when
I never felt safe.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.910 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what I was
going to do for a living, how

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.300 align:middle line:90%
I was going to make ends meet.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.910 align:middle line:90%
My relationships weren't safe.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
Paying the rent, just whether
someone's going to attack me,

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:05.015 align:middle line:90%
the world situation.

00:22:05.015 --> 00:22:06.390 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it was,
all these things

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:10.140 align:middle line:84%
were building to create
this feeling of unsafety.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:12.270 align:middle line:84%
The partner, business
partner that I had

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:13.620 align:middle line:90%
was a very aggressive person.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:17.820 align:middle line:84%
He just scared me, reminded
me of childhood traumas

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.830 align:middle line:90%
that I had had.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Just no matter where
I was, I felt unsafe.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you
now, that's all gone.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is for so many people
that I've worked with now

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.570 align:middle line:90%
over the last couple of years.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.430 align:middle line:84%
So when you get that,
your body relaxes.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:40.760 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've always used
visualization in my life.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't only
until back then

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.460 align:middle line:84%
when I started losing weight
that I applied visualization

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.260 align:middle line:90%
to weight loss.

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.870 align:middle line:84%
And that became
incredibly successful.

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:84%
But from the age of
10, I used to get

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.860 align:middle line:90%
really bad migraine headaches.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:59.930 align:middle line:90%
And nothing would work.

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And eventually my
father, who was a dentist

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:84%
and had some experience with
hypnosis for pain relief

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.153 align:middle line:84%
in his clients,
he would take me--

00:23:10.153 --> 00:23:12.570 align:middle line:84%
he took me on this journey
where I was skiing down a hill.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:15.920 align:middle line:84%
And I imagined the headache
as this black sand.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:18.327 align:middle line:84%
And I would tip it, tip
the sand as I was skiing.

00:23:18.327 --> 00:23:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And eventually got down
to the bottom of the hill,

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.967 align:middle line:84%
and the black sand was gone,
and my headache was gone.

00:23:22.967 --> 00:23:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned how
to do that to myself.

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And then eventually,
I got so good at it

00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:29.060 align:middle line:84%
that anytime I felt
the size of a headache,

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I could just sort of imagine
that the headache was going

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.480 align:middle line:84%
into my finger, and
then flick it away,

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.170 align:middle line:90%
and then it would be gone.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And so from a very
early age, I had

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.880 align:middle line:90%
experience with visualization.

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.310 align:middle line:84%
Then for giving up smoking
as a teenager, I did it.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.920 align:middle line:90%
And then in business I did it.

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.800 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't do
it for weight loss

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.500 align:middle line:84%
until after that
experience that I had.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:53.340 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as I did it,
I found a difference.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.938 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you,
a lot of people

00:23:54.938 --> 00:23:56.480 align:middle line:84%
look at my before
and after pictures,

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.610 align:middle line:90%
and they wonder how I did that.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:00.710 align:middle line:84%
I can tell you that the
body that I have now

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the body that
I visualized having.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not sure
that's a coincidence.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.760 align:middle line:84%
And I thought about, why is
visualization so powerful

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.870 align:middle line:90%
for weight loss?

00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:84%
And visualization for
body changing in general.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Because Arnold
Schwarzenegger said

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.800 align:middle line:84%
he used to use visualization to
become a professional champion

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.080 align:middle line:84%
bodybuilder, and he was one
of the best bodybuilders.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And I've talked to
so many other people

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:24.980 align:middle line:84%
that have been so successful
with visualization.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized
is, visualization

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.870 align:middle line:84%
is like a language
that you can use

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:90%
to talk to your subconscious.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Your subconscious is
the part of your brain

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:37.610 align:middle line:84%
that's in charge
of a lot of things.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:39.235 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
it's in charge of

00:24:39.235 --> 00:24:41.180 align:middle line:84%
is your body's
unconscious processes.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.880 align:middle line:84%
How much oxygen you need
is not a conscious thought.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't think I
should breathe more.

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:47.330 align:middle line:90%
That's unconscious.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.430 align:middle line:84%
How much your heart
beats is unconscious.

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And how fat or thin you should
be is an unconscious decision,

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.670 align:middle line:90%
but it is a decision.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with this
subconscious or unconscious

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:84%
part of us is that it
doesn't speak English.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:05.840 align:middle line:84%
And so we're being run by a
brain that we can't talk to.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:84%
But what I realized
is, visualization

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.650 align:middle line:84%
is like a language
that you can use

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:11.210 align:middle line:90%
to talk to your unconscious.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Because just like you
can't talk to someone who

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:15.840 align:middle line:90%
doesn't speak your language--

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.690 align:middle line:84%
say you have to go to the
bathroom in a foreign country.

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:19.280 align:middle line:84%
You could ask 1,000 people
where the bathroom is.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:20.113 align:middle line:90%
They won't tell you.

00:25:20.113 --> 00:25:22.280 align:middle line:84%
But if you draw a
picture of a bathroom

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.080 align:middle line:84%
on a napkin in the
restaurant or something

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.760 align:middle line:84%
and show it to anyone, instantly
they know what you mean.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.610 align:middle line:84%
Visualization is the
universal-- or symbols

00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:34.938 align:middle line:84%
is the universal
language for people

00:25:34.938 --> 00:25:36.230 align:middle line:90%
that don't speak your language.

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:38.150 align:middle line:84%
And your body doesn't
speak your language.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.660 align:middle line:84%
When you make a visual image
of the way you'd like to look,

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:46.410 align:middle line:84%
and you do it when your mind is
calm and powerful and relaxed,

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.230 align:middle line:90%
your subconscious understands.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:84%
And it understands that
it doesn't need fat,

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.450 align:middle line:84%
and that it's
confusing the stresses.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:54.560 align:middle line:84%
Because it really
doesn't know what

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.330 align:middle line:84%
to do with the stresses
of modern day life.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:90%
Do I get fatter?

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.920 align:middle line:90%
Do I get thinner?

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.640 align:middle line:84%
How do I protect this
person who's so scared?

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.205 align:middle line:90%
So sometimes it uses fat.

00:26:03.205 --> 00:26:05.330 align:middle line:84%
But when you can communicate
with your subconscious

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and say no, that's
not the answer.

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:10.340 align:middle line:84%
I appreciate it, but that's
not what's happening.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.710 align:middle line:84%
OK, I'll turn the
fat programs off.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:15.440 align:middle line:84%
Just like that,
everything changes.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So visualization is such a
powerful-- and in my opinion,

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.480 align:middle line:90%
totally indispensable--

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.045 align:middle line:84%
practice for
sustainable weight loss.

00:26:23.045 --> 00:26:28.175 align:middle line:90%


00:26:28.175 --> 00:26:30.300 align:middle line:84%
You know, not everybody
has had the same experience

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:31.508 align:middle line:90%
with visualization as I have.

00:26:31.508 --> 00:26:34.080 align:middle line:84%
Like I started from
early childhood

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.305 align:middle line:84%
because of my headaches
and things like that.

00:26:36.305 --> 00:26:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So I've had a lot of
experience with visualization.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
But people say to me, I can't
visualize my ideal body,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.000 align:middle line:90%
or I can't picture this.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:42.875 align:middle line:90%
I can't picture that.

00:26:42.875 --> 00:26:47.310 align:middle line:84%
So I made a visualization CD
that you listen to at night.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:84%
But I also tell people, get
a picture of exactly the way

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:51.270 align:middle line:90%
you'd like to look.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.940 align:middle line:84%
It could be you at
another time when you

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.642 align:middle line:90%
were fit and healthy and happy.

00:26:55.642 --> 00:26:56.850 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be somebody else.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't matter.

00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:01.130 align:middle line:84%
Just look at the picture for
30 seconds with kind of like

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:03.630 align:middle line:84%
if you're looking through the
picture in an unconscious way.

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:05.338 align:middle line:84%
Don't look at the
picture with your eyes.

00:27:05.338 --> 00:27:06.190 align:middle line:90%
Look through it.

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:11.640 align:middle line:84%
Let your subconscious absorb
it for just 30 seconds.

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.220 align:middle line:84%
And then close your eyes,
and either see yourself,

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.950 align:middle line:84%
feel yourself, imagine
yourself being in that body.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself walking on
the beach with that body.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.680 align:middle line:90%
Whatever way you can do it.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's a little
bit like a muscle.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Visualization is like
a muscle that gets

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:28.890 align:middle line:90%
stronger the more you use it.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it's been
atrophied for 20 or 30 years

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.640 align:middle line:90%
because you've never used it.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.340 align:middle line:84%
And look, if you
had your left arm

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.320 align:middle line:84%
taped to your body for 30 years,
you couldn't lift a pencil.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.120 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.360 align:middle line:84%
But from daily practice,
eventually your left arm

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.130 align:middle line:84%
gets as strong as
your right arm.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:46.110 align:middle line:90%
So visualization gets stronger.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:48.953 align:middle line:84%
Your power to visualize
gets stronger and stronger.

00:27:48.953 --> 00:27:50.370 align:middle line:84%
And what's really
amazing about it

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.620 align:middle line:84%
is when your power of
visualization gets so strong,

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.040 align:middle line:84%
you can visualize anything
you want happening,

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.130 align:middle line:84%
and it'll happen
for most people.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.752 align:middle line:84%
I mean if you
really get strong--

00:28:00.752 --> 00:28:02.460 align:middle line:84%
it's really only a
function of how strong

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.440 align:middle line:84%
and how powerful your
visualization is.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I found a
publisher that I really wanted

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.802 align:middle line:90%
to be my publisher for my book.

00:28:13.802 --> 00:28:14.760 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't call them.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:16.927 align:middle line:84%
I didn't say, hey, I got a
really good book for you.

00:28:16.927 --> 00:28:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I sat in my morning
visualization.

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:21.000 align:middle line:84%
I imagined them publishing
it, and the book

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.782 align:middle line:90%
spreading all over the world.

00:28:22.782 --> 00:28:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And within a week, I got a
call from a literary agent

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.060 align:middle line:84%
in Thailand that said,
I just read your book,

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.810 align:middle line:84%
and the last book I sold
was to this publisher.

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:32.710 align:middle line:90%
And I'd like to sell it.

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to
introduce it to them.

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.090 align:middle line:90%
And I said, sure.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:90%
And they did.

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.070 align:middle line:90%
The publisher loved it.

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And then it went, and
it's now in 15 languages.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:43.710 align:middle line:84%
So that happened
through visualization.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:46.440 align:middle line:84%
That didn't happen through
me going out and getting it.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.720 align:middle line:84%
And more and more I've
realized that whatever

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.210 align:middle line:84%
it is that I'm
looking to achieve,

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.560 align:middle line:84%
it always starts
with a vision first.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And the more powerful
my mind gets--

00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.270 align:middle line:90%
and this is true of everyone--

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.100 align:middle line:84%
the more able we are
to create that vision.

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:04.360 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.200 align:middle line:84%
You know, our foods have
so many flavor enhancers

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:10.180 align:middle line:84%
to try to get us
to eat more of it.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.700 align:middle line:84%
And one of them,
for example, is MSG.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And MSG is in 80%
of all flavor foods

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:16.390 align:middle line:84%
that you get at a
restaurant, that you

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:19.490 align:middle line:90%
get at a grocery store.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:20.950 align:middle line:90%
It makes you want to eat more.

00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:23.060 align:middle line:90%
But it does something else.

00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:25.060 align:middle line:84%
It actually excites
a part of your brain

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:27.340 align:middle line:84%
that's in charge of
the fat programs.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.100 align:middle line:84%
The chemical of MSG
excites the brain.

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:34.540 align:middle line:84%
And due to that
excitation, your body

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.760 align:middle line:84%
actually activates the fat
programs and gets fatter.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.870 align:middle line:90%
And everybody knows this.

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:42.005 align:middle line:90%
Scientists know this.

00:29:42.005 --> 00:29:42.880 align:middle line:90%
Everybody knows this.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.332 align:middle line:90%
And no one's saying anything.

00:29:44.332 --> 00:29:45.790 align:middle line:84%
How do I know
everybody knows this?

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you want
to study obesity,

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.990 align:middle line:84%
and you want to
study a fat mouse,

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.370 align:middle line:90%
you've got to make a mouse fat.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:52.870 align:middle line:90%
Because mice aren't fat.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:56.648 align:middle line:84%
So the way you make a mouse
fat is you feed him MSG.

00:29:56.648 --> 00:29:57.940 align:middle line:90%
And there's even a term for it.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:29:59.920 align:middle line:90%
MSG obesity-induced mice.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.650 align:middle line:84%
If you do a search for
MSG obesity-induced mice,

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:05.020 align:middle line:84%
you'll see tons of
research reports

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.842 align:middle line:84%
where they talk about,
well, the protocol was

00:30:07.842 --> 00:30:10.300 align:middle line:84%
we made the mouse fat feeding
them this much MSG, blah blah

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:10.870 align:middle line:90%
blah blah blah.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And then we studied this, this,
and this, and the other thing.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.170 align:middle line:90%
They're not studying that.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:15.587 align:middle line:84%
They're just--
that's the protocol

00:30:15.587 --> 00:30:18.130 align:middle line:84%
for making a mouse fat,
is feeding them MSG.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:22.690 align:middle line:84%
And this is in 80%
of modern day foods.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:25.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's basically turning
us into fat programs.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:31.050 align:middle line:90%


00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:34.920 align:middle line:84%
Diet sweeteners-- just
like MSG, diet sweeteners,

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.860 align:middle line:84%
certain diet sweeteners,
activate your fat programs.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.230 align:middle line:84%
It's also what's
called an excitotoxin.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:43.950 align:middle line:84%
An excitotoxin is really
a neurotransmitter

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:48.490 align:middle line:84%
that's being delivered into the
brain in too high of quantity.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.970 align:middle line:84%
So it excites the
neurons too much.

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you look
at aspartame, it's

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.100 align:middle line:90%
composed of two amino acids.

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.800 align:middle line:84%
And one of them
is phenylalanine.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, phenylalanine is
a neurotransmitter.

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.410 align:middle line:84%
When you put too much
phenylalanine in your brain

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.390 align:middle line:90%
at once, it excites the brain.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And it excites the
part of your brain

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.700 align:middle line:84%
that activates the fat
programs and makes you fatter.

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, there's zero
calories in diet soda.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.400 align:middle line:84%
But studies have shown that
if you drink diet soda,

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.848 align:middle line:84%
within a couple
of years you will

00:31:18.848 --> 00:31:21.390 align:middle line:84%
be fatter than when you first
started drinking the diet soda.

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:24.030 align:middle line:84%
This whole idea of
calories in, calories out

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:26.230 align:middle line:90%
is ridiculous and ludicrous.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.430 align:middle line:84%
It's simply about the
chemical reaction to the foods

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:30.360 align:middle line:90%
that you're eating.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.902 align:middle line:84%
And if the chemical reaction is
activating your fat programs,

00:31:32.902 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:90%
you will get fat.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:34.610 align:middle line:90%
Guaranteed.

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:40.010 align:middle line:90%


00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.750 align:middle line:84%
We're definitely being
marketed to this idea

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.910 align:middle line:90%
that you have to be beautiful.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:46.110 align:middle line:90%
You have to be glamorous.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And this is the way
you're going to do it.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Through eating diet
soda, drinking diet soda,

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.700 align:middle line:84%
or having this diet
thing or that diet,

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.650 align:middle line:84%
or having this surgery
or that surgery,

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.400 align:middle line:84%
that your problems are
going to be solved,

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:58.775 align:middle line:84%
and you're going
to be beautiful,

00:31:58.775 --> 00:32:00.810 align:middle line:90%
and your life's going to change.

00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's just opportunism
at its finest, really

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:06.630 align:middle line:90%
is what it is.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:11.540 align:middle line:90%


00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think we all
want to be loved.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:16.010 align:middle line:84%
And when you think about
love, what love is really,

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:18.350 align:middle line:90%
is love is safety.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:20.690 align:middle line:84%
Because when you're
zero years old,

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.370 align:middle line:84%
when you're a
couple of weeks old,

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:25.082 align:middle line:84%
if your mother doesn't love
you, you're going to die.

00:32:25.082 --> 00:32:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Your mother has to take care
of you, has to feed you.

00:32:27.290 --> 00:32:29.040 align:middle line:90%
You're totally helpless.

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:33.537 align:middle line:84%
So from the moment we're born,
we equate love with safety.

00:32:33.537 --> 00:32:35.120 align:middle line:84%
So when you feel
like you're not being

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:38.450 align:middle line:84%
loved because your partner
or boyfriend or girlfriend

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:41.210 align:middle line:84%
doesn't love you, or because
someone out there doesn't love

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:45.690 align:middle line:84%
you, then your safety, your
primal feeling of safety,

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:46.490 align:middle line:90%
is being triggered.

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.050 align:middle line:90%
That activates a stress.

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.570 align:middle line:84%
That's going to make you
want to hold on to weight.

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.400 align:middle line:84%
You know, 1,000 years ago, if
the community didn't love you,

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:56.600 align:middle line:90%
you were excommunicated.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.100 align:middle line:84%
The tribe didn't love,
you were excommunicated.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.000 align:middle line:90%
And so then you die.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Because you can't survive on
your own in a tribal world.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:05.870 align:middle line:90%
So

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:11.040 align:middle line:84%
It's totally hardwired into
us that love equals safety.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.350 align:middle line:90%
And so we want to be loved.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And if it means being
beautiful, healthy,

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:18.590 align:middle line:84%
or the healthy
looking at all costs

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:22.700 align:middle line:84%
successful, whatever it is, love
to us is the same as safety.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.310 align:middle line:84%
But if you can get that
feeling of safety on your own

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.580 align:middle line:84%
through doing visualization
or practices, or just really

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:32.630 align:middle line:84%
programming into you an
inherent feeling of safety,

00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:36.620 align:middle line:84%
then you're not at the whim
of everything out there.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.590 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
buy and sell anymore.

00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:41.017 align:middle line:90%
You just speak your truth.

00:33:41.017 --> 00:33:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And the people that love
you are going to love you

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:43.910 align:middle line:90%
for the right reasons.

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:45.740 align:middle line:84%
And the people that
don't, you don't care.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.282 align:middle line:84%
And you can truly,
truly be yourself.

00:33:47.282 --> 00:33:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Because you're just
not being pulled

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:50.765 align:middle line:84%
in every different
direction to get everybody

00:33:50.765 --> 00:33:52.840 align:middle line:90%
to like you and love you.

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.770 align:middle line:90%
You just feel safe.

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:59.680 align:middle line:90%


00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.350 align:middle line:84%
When it's coming from the right
place, it's coming through you.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:03.880 align:middle line:90%
It's not what you're doing.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.610 align:middle line:84%
And then when it's coming
through you, it's all ease.

00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:07.870 align:middle line:90%
It's all flow.

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.400 align:middle line:84%
It's only when we have an
idea of what we want to do.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Well, I want to be an
accountant because that's how

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.219 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to make the money.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:13.560 align:middle line:90%
That's how I'm going to be safe.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And maybe that's
right for one person,

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:16.335 align:middle line:84%
but it might not be
right from another.

00:34:16.335 --> 00:34:18.909 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not right for
you, then you're on your own.

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:21.909 align:middle line:84%
You're subject to how smart you
can be, how fast you can be,

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:24.040 align:middle line:90%
how hard you can work.

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.489 align:middle line:84%
But when you're really following
your heart and that impulse

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:29.110 align:middle line:84%
inside you that
knows why you're here

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.485 align:middle line:84%
and knows what
you're meant to be

00:34:30.485 --> 00:34:32.560 align:middle line:90%
doing, even if it's illogical--

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.530 align:middle line:84%
because you can't see the
end until it's happened.

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:38.080 align:middle line:84%
But when you follow
that, the doors open up.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.360 align:middle line:84%
And there's flow
and ease and grace.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.449 align:middle line:84%
And then there's not stress from
everything that's not working.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:46.900 align:middle line:84%
It's like, ah, I just talked
to this guy on the streets,

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.960 align:middle line:84%
and all of a sudden he's the
vice president of the company

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.489 align:middle line:90%
that I wanted to talk to.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.300 align:middle line:90%
And we're buddies now.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.090 align:middle line:84%
It's just how could I know
that was going to happen?

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:58.890 align:middle line:84%
But when you're following
that impulse inside you,

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:01.325 align:middle line:84%
that part inside your heart
that knows why you're here,

00:35:01.325 --> 00:35:02.125 align:middle line:90%
it all flows.

00:35:02.125 --> 00:35:07.330 align:middle line:90%


00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:09.220 align:middle line:84%
People think that
the fat you eat

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.730 align:middle line:84%
is the fat that
becomes your body.

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.000 align:middle line:90%
It's not exactly like that.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.470 align:middle line:90%
Fat doesn't make fat.

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:17.920 align:middle line:84%
Hormones and chemistry
in your body make fat.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And the wrong chemistry
from either the stress

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.490 align:middle line:84%
or eating the wrong
types of foods

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:26.830 align:middle line:84%
will put your body
in fat storage mode.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:30.430 align:middle line:84%
But certain fats are
totally essential.

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Aside from water, the largest
part of our body is fat.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.860 align:middle line:90%
65% of our brain is fat.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.560 align:middle line:84%
Every cell in your body is
covered with a wall of fat.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.490 align:middle line:84%
If it's not the right fat that
is an essential fat that's

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:43.750 align:middle line:90%
uncorrupted--

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:45.580 align:middle line:84%
which is very rare
in modern days--

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.650 align:middle line:84%
if it's not that,
it's the wrong fat,

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.320 align:middle line:84%
you don't get proper
hormonal communication

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.790 align:middle line:84%
between the hormones
and the cell.

00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Because the cell wall protects
the cell from the outside.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:58.640 align:middle line:84%
So the cell doesn't open up
to have the right nutrients.

00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.780 align:middle line:90%
So it's starving.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And then your body goes
into this fat storage mode

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:04.990 align:middle line:84%
and starts making fat and
starts making you hungrier.

00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:07.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's because of
hormonal miscommunication

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.140 align:middle line:84%
and eating the wrong fats
and the wrong types of foods.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:16.780 align:middle line:84%
Modern day man made foods will
totally screw your body up

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.680 align:middle line:90%
on a hormonal level.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:20.050 align:middle line:90%
And so it's not about fat.

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:22.600 align:middle line:84%
You can eat as much
fat as you're craving,

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.520 align:middle line:90%
as long as it's the right fat.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:27.790 align:middle line:84%
Essential fats that are
uncorrupted and not man made.

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Those are the right fats.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.900 align:middle line:90%
Eat as much of them as you want.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.700 align:middle line:84%
Over time what
happens is your cells

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.790 align:middle line:84%
get coated with a very
permeable layer that

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:39.310 align:middle line:84%
allows for the most
efficient communication

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:41.590 align:middle line:84%
between the hormones
in the cells.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a little bit like putting
the right oil in a car.

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.120 align:middle line:90%
It functions properly.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So the hormones
that make fat start

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.300 align:middle line:84%
to go down because that
stress isn't there anymore.

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.077 align:middle line:84%
Your blood sugar stabilizes, so
you're not hungry all the time,

00:36:55.077 --> 00:36:56.660 align:middle line:84%
and you're not
exhausted all the time.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.682 align:middle line:90%
You're not craving junk food.

00:36:58.682 --> 00:36:59.890 align:middle line:90%
You have so much more energy.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:01.470 align:middle line:84%
And everything's
flowing properly.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.520 align:middle line:90%
Your energy is flowing.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.770 align:middle line:84%
You can have the courage
then to do what it

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:07.058 align:middle line:90%
is that you're longing to do.

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:09.100 align:middle line:84%
You can make a change
because you have the energy

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:11.860 align:middle line:90%
to make a change.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.880 align:middle line:84%
So having the right fat is one
of the most essential things

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.680 align:middle line:90%
you can do.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.290 align:middle line:90%


00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:23.410 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing is add the foods

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.060 align:middle line:90%
your body's starving for.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.590 align:middle line:90%
Don't turn it into a diet.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.750 align:middle line:90%
Keep the focus always on adding.

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:29.770 align:middle line:90%
If it's, for example--

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:32.650 align:middle line:84%
the types of foods we need are
foods that were not man made.

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Because man made foods our body
doesn't know how to process,

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.830 align:middle line:90%
doesn't know how to digest.

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:39.060 align:middle line:90%
And it causes hormonal chaos.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.780 align:middle line:84%
It causes us to gain
weight and to have

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:44.350 align:middle line:84%
problems like type 2
diabetes and high blood sugar

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.230 align:middle line:84%
and heart disease and cancer
and all those kind of things.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So add foods that
are not man made.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:52.938 align:middle line:84%
If you were on an island
from 1,000 years ago,

00:37:52.938 --> 00:37:53.980 align:middle line:90%
what foods could you eat?

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.770 align:middle line:84%
You could eat meat, chicken,
fish, salads, nuts, fruits,

00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:58.590 align:middle line:90%
seeds.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:37:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Our bodies understand those.

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:01.610 align:middle line:84%
Keep the focus on
adding those foods.

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:06.370 align:middle line:84%
At every meal, ask yourself,
where's the real food?

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:08.440 align:middle line:84%
And as far as omega
3s, it's very hard

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.960 align:middle line:84%
to get omega 3s in
an uncorrupted form.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.280 align:middle line:84%
One way is to take
ground linseeds.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.268 align:middle line:84%
But you want to buy
the linseeds whole.

00:38:17.268 --> 00:38:18.310 align:middle line:90%
And they're really cheap.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.658 align:middle line:84%
They're a couple
dollars a pound,

00:38:20.658 --> 00:38:21.700 align:middle line:90%
I think is what they are.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:23.210 align:middle line:90%
A pound will last a few months.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:25.053 align:middle line:84%
So you take a couple
of tablespoons,

00:38:25.053 --> 00:38:27.220 align:middle line:84%
put it in a coffee grinder,
grind it up, sprinkle it

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.720 align:middle line:90%
on your food all day.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:30.470 align:middle line:84%
For most people,
that's good enough.

00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:31.928 align:middle line:84%
It's not good enough
for everybody.

00:38:31.928 --> 00:38:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Because if your family comes
from a northern European

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:40.030 align:middle line:84%
fishing village, then
all of your omega 3s

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.470 align:middle line:90%
came from coldwater fish.

00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And you lose the
enzymes that translates

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:49.060 align:middle line:84%
omega 3s from vegetable sources
into the specific omega 3s--

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.890 align:middle line:90%
EPA and DHA-- that you need.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:52.370 align:middle line:90%
So you've lost that ability.

00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So you need to take probably
some fish oil supplements.

00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.410 align:middle line:84%
The best ones are
probably krill oil,

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:03.280 align:middle line:84%
because krill oil has the
least amount of toxins in it.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.860 align:middle line:90%
Remember, fat holds toxins.

00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:13.450 align:middle line:84%
Like a conventionally farmed
almond is going to have way

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:15.200 align:middle line:90%
more toxins than organic.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.140 align:middle line:84%
Because that's where--
like our bodies,

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.020 align:middle line:84%
we hold our toxins
in our fat cells.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.673 align:middle line:84%
So plants and animals also
hold their toxins in their fat.

00:39:24.673 --> 00:39:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So if your fat is coming
from a conventional source,

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.548 align:middle line:84%
it's going to have a
lot of toxins in it.

00:39:28.548 --> 00:39:30.250 align:middle line:84%
So it's really
important to have fats

00:39:30.250 --> 00:39:32.350 align:middle line:90%
that don't have toxins in them.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:35.860 align:middle line:84%
And so krill oil's a really
good source of fish oil

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.440 align:middle line:84%
because most fish have just
too many toxins in them.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.120 align:middle line:84%
That if you just get
regular fish oil,

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:40.845 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be toxic.

00:39:40.845 --> 00:39:42.190 align:middle line:90%
So krill oil is a good source.

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:44.320 align:middle line:84%
But just putting ground
linseeds on all your food

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.950 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day is a
great way to get omega 3s.

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:51.610 align:middle line:90%


00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:54.475 align:middle line:84%
There's a couple of different
layers to live food.

00:39:54.475 --> 00:39:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And to me, the difference
between a live food

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.180 align:middle line:84%
and a dead food is a
lot like the difference

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.760 align:middle line:84%
between a live person
and a dead person.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:04.750 align:middle line:84%
You know, if you look at two
people next to each other,

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.760 align:middle line:84%
one's live, one's dead,
they might look the same

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.063 align:middle line:90%
if they're not moving.

00:40:09.063 --> 00:40:10.480 align:middle line:84%
But there's a world
of difference.

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.380 align:middle line:90%
What's missing?

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.090 align:middle line:90%
Life force.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:14.710 align:middle line:90%
Life force energy.

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:16.090 align:middle line:90%
We all know it exists.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:18.430 align:middle line:84%
Science hasn't given it a
name yet, just the same way

00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:20.710 align:middle line:84%
that radio waves
weren't discovered

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:25.300 align:middle line:84%
until a couple hundred
years ago or bacterias

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.290 align:middle line:90%
weren't discovered.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.760 align:middle line:90%
But they were all there.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:32.050 align:middle line:84%
We haven't, quote,
"discovered" life force energy.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.210 align:middle line:90%
But we all know it exists.

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.960 align:middle line:84%
The sun interacts
with the planet.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.820 align:middle line:84%
And through photosynthesis,
converts sunlight

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:47.170 align:middle line:84%
into protein,
carbohydrates, and fats.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:48.160 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we live.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.580 align:middle line:90%
So sun is energy.

00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:52.260 align:middle line:90%
Life force is energy also.

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.280 align:middle line:84%
And we need life
force in our food.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.160 align:middle line:84%
Years ago, almost
everything we ate

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.600 align:middle line:90%
had life force energy in it.

00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, almost nothing we
eat has life force energy.

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:06.460 align:middle line:84%
So we're starving on a chronic
basis for life force energy.

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:08.740 align:middle line:84%
And that causes the
same stress in your body

00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:10.710 align:middle line:90%
and starving for anything else.

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:13.030 align:middle line:84%
And so your body activates
its fat programs.

00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:16.750 align:middle line:84%
Also live food has living
enzymes and healthy bacteria

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.790 align:middle line:84%
that your stomach needs to
digest and assimilate foods.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not eating
those, your stomach

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.352 align:middle line:84%
loses the healthy
bacteria and enzymes

00:41:26.352 --> 00:41:27.560 align:middle line:90%
that it needs to digest food.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.140 align:middle line:84%
So even if the
food had nutrients

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.900 align:middle line:84%
that you were eating-- which
it doesn't, but even if it did,

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.240 align:middle line:84%
you can't extract
those nutrients.

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.980 align:middle line:90%
So adding more live food.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Turn everything into a salad.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:40.480 align:middle line:84%
Even if you're
having a Happy Meal,

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.192 align:middle line:84%
cut it up and turn
it into a salad.

00:41:42.192 --> 00:41:43.900 align:middle line:84%
Not that I recommend
having a Happy Meal.

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.840 align:middle line:84%
But whatever you're eating,
keep the focus on adding.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.280 align:middle line:90%
So add salad.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.870 align:middle line:90%
Add it to it.

00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:51.970 align:middle line:84%
When it's Thanksgiving,
and you're

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:54.940 align:middle line:84%
having a big turkey meal,
make a big salad out of it.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:58.880 align:middle line:84%
That food, that salad,
will give you the enzymes

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.830 align:middle line:90%
to properly digest the food.

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.210 align:middle line:84%
It'll give you the life force
that you're starving for.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:07.165 align:middle line:84%
And then help your body
turn off the fat programs.

00:42:07.165 --> 00:42:12.080 align:middle line:90%


00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:15.312 align:middle line:84%
Look, we all have tried to lose
weight through deprivation.

00:42:15.312 --> 00:42:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And we know that, look,
if you starve yourself,

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:18.050 align:middle line:90%
you're going to lose weight.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:19.820 align:middle line:84%
But you can't starve
yourself forever.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.737 align:middle line:84%
And you can't go off of
this food or that food

00:42:21.737 --> 00:42:22.820 align:middle line:90%
that you crave forever.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.900 align:middle line:84%
You can't fight
your body forever.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:26.960 align:middle line:84%
But if you keep the focus
on adding, what happens

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.760 align:middle line:90%
is you have more energy.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.470 align:middle line:90%
Your tastes change.

00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:31.813 align:middle line:90%
Your cravings change.

00:42:31.813 --> 00:42:33.230 align:middle line:84%
You don't have
blood sugar issues,

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:34.617 align:middle line:90%
so you don't have sugar issues.

00:42:34.617 --> 00:42:36.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't have sugar
cravings anymore.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.100 align:middle line:84%
And over time, you
educate your body

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:40.437 align:middle line:90%
that this is proper nutrients.

00:42:40.437 --> 00:42:42.770 align:middle line:84%
Not the dead stuff that we've
been tricked into thinking

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.300 align:middle line:90%
is real food.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.740 align:middle line:84%
So over time, you crave this
with more and more and more.

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.300 align:middle line:84%
If you want to lose
weight forever,

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.400 align:middle line:84%
don't try to lose 20
pounds in 20 days.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.330 align:middle line:84%
Try to solve the
problem forever,

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it's a mental
stress or emotional stress

00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.290 align:middle line:84%
or a physical thing, or
you're starving for nutrients.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Solve the problem forever, and
then you're cravings change.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:05.022 align:middle line:84%
And you will crave
healthier foods.

00:43:05.022 --> 00:43:05.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's happening now.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.355 align:middle line:84%
I've seen it happen with so
many thousands of people now.

00:43:08.355 --> 00:43:12.730 align:middle line:90%


00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Nothing on earth frustrates
me more than the way

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:17.500 align:middle line:90%
we deal with childhood obesity.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.813 align:middle line:84%
Because you can force a kid to
lose weight in the short term.

00:43:20.813 --> 00:43:22.480 align:middle line:84%
But then you've just
given him a problem

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:23.950 align:middle line:84%
for the rest of
his life, a problem

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.770 align:middle line:84%
of feeling that he's
inadequate, that he's not

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.635 align:middle line:84%
able to achieve what he
wants, that he's a loser,

00:43:29.635 --> 00:43:33.790 align:middle line:84%
or that you have to
force him to eat less,

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:35.680 align:middle line:84%
taking him to this
place and that place

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.170 align:middle line:90%
and weighing him in school.

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.300 align:middle line:84%
When more than
anything, we're starving

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.610 align:middle line:90%
the kid on a nutritional level.

00:43:42.610 --> 00:43:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And the stresses
that he's having

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:46.510 align:middle line:90%
to undergo through toxins--

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:49.360 align:middle line:84%
do you know today,
I read a study

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:54.970 align:middle line:84%
that an average three-year-old
has 70 different vaccinations

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.770 align:middle line:90%
by the time they're three.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:58.610 align:middle line:84%
And it wasn't like that
when we were a kid.

00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:01.550 align:middle line:84%
And I don't want to get into
the argument about vaccinations.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:02.350 align:middle line:90%
Some are good.

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:02.680 align:middle line:90%
Some are bad.

00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.490 align:middle line:90%
Whatever.

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:05.920 align:middle line:84%
But there's no question
that there's toxins.

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:10.840 align:middle line:84%
They tell a mother
or a pregnant woman

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.440 align:middle line:84%
not to eat tuna fish because
there's too much mercury in it.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.280 align:middle line:84%
Yet there's
vaccinations that they

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:18.130 align:middle line:84%
give in infants that are
the equivalent of maybe

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:22.960 align:middle line:84%
50 or 100 cans of tuna fish,
as far as the mercury content.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.880 align:middle line:84%
So we're bombarding
kids with toxins.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.860 align:middle line:84%
We're starving them on
a nutritional level.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:30.010 align:middle line:84%
We're giving them
stresses about how

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:33.620 align:middle line:84%
they have to achieve in life and
compete that are unbelievable.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.870 align:middle line:90%
And kids can't take that.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:37.340 align:middle line:90%
And they can't handle it.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.400 align:middle line:84%
And then on top of
that, we tell them

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:42.130 align:middle line:84%
that they've got to eat less
when their bodies are forcing

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:44.308 align:middle line:84%
them to gain weight as
a form of protection.

00:44:44.308 --> 00:44:45.600 align:middle line:90%
And then it gets in their head.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.683 align:middle line:84%
For the rest of their life,
they feel like there's

00:44:47.683 --> 00:44:49.630 align:middle line:90%
something wrong with them.

00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:52.480 align:middle line:84%
So you can force a kid to
lose weight in the short term.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.030 align:middle line:84%
But you've given them a problem
for the rest of his life.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:58.423 align:middle line:84%
And it's our problem
and it's our faults.

00:44:58.423 --> 00:45:00.340 align:middle line:84%
We're the ones that are
doing something wrong.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:05.190 align:middle line:90%


00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:09.870 align:middle line:84%
Antibiotics and chlorinated
water and eating modern day

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.290 align:middle line:84%
foods that are devoid of
these healthy bacterias

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:17.130 align:middle line:84%
and digestive enzymes have
totally changed the bacteria

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:18.130 align:middle line:90%
in our stomach.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:19.713 align:middle line:84%
So those healthy
bacteria aren't there

00:45:19.713 --> 00:45:21.000 align:middle line:90%
anymore that digest our foods.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:25.260 align:middle line:84%
And the unhealthy bacteria
that are in there instead

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.960 align:middle line:84%
feed off of sugar and
cause sugar cravings.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.730 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
we've become a host

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:31.740 align:middle line:84%
to unhealthy bacterias
in our stomach

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:33.540 align:middle line:84%
that are forcing
us to eat sugar.

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:37.450 align:middle line:84%
Because that's what
they need to propagate.

00:45:37.450 --> 00:45:39.187 align:middle line:90%
So you have to reverse all that.

00:45:39.187 --> 00:45:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And the way to reverse it--
in the beginning, at least--

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.220 align:middle line:84%
is you've got to add
healthy bacteria.

00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:44.470 align:middle line:90%
And they're called probiotics.

00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:46.140 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to add
digestive enzymes.

00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:48.090 align:middle line:84%
And you've got to
eat more live food

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:50.250 align:middle line:84%
to change the bacteria
in your stomach

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.440 align:middle line:84%
so that you can digest
and assimilate nutrients.

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:54.990 align:middle line:84%
Because when you can't digest
and assimilate nutrients,

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:58.290 align:middle line:84%
you continue to starve
on a cellular level.

00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And that keeps your body hungry.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:04.580 align:middle line:90%


00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Reducing sugar
cravings is really

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:09.867 align:middle line:84%
about addressing
issues on every level.

00:46:09.867 --> 00:46:12.200 align:middle line:84%
Because mental and emotional
stress will cause chemistry

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:13.300 align:middle line:90%
that cause sugar cravings.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.050 align:middle line:84%
Having unfriendly
bacteria in your stomach

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.390 align:middle line:90%
will cause sugar cravings.

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Having insulin
resistance, which you

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.260 align:middle line:84%
get when you have
the fat programs on,

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.290 align:middle line:84%
cause low blood sugar that
causes sugar cravings.

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.840 align:middle line:84%
So by adding friendly
bacteria, by dealing

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:29.900 align:middle line:84%
with the mental and emotional
stresses in your life,

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.840 align:middle line:84%
and by adding healthy foods
like omega 3 fatty acids,

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.210 align:middle line:90%
all these things get addressed.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:38.240 align:middle line:84%
So systematically, point
by point, all of the things

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.800 align:middle line:84%
that cause the
sugar and the bread

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.950 align:middle line:84%
cravings in the first
place get eliminated.

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end I
also offer a visualization

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.915 align:middle line:84%
for people that will
help finish the job.

00:46:49.915 --> 00:46:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So what you find is, more
and more what will happen

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.140 align:middle line:84%
is, you'll walk by the bakery,
and normally you think,

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:54.820 align:middle line:90%
should I have that donut?

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even look
anymore at the bakery.

00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.405 align:middle line:84%
You don't even look
through the window,

00:46:58.405 --> 00:47:01.070 align:middle line:84%
or you realize you
forgot to eat dessert.

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.257 align:middle line:84%
Little by little,
organically you just

00:47:03.257 --> 00:47:04.340 align:middle line:90%
don't crave sugar anymore.

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.920 align:middle line:84%
But if you really want
to finish the job,

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.200 align:middle line:90%
you can use visualization.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.570 align:middle line:84%
Because visualization is
also a really powerful way

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:13.250 align:middle line:90%
of eliminating cravings.

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:17.633 align:middle line:84%
If you imagine that
you're eating sugar,

00:47:17.633 --> 00:47:19.550 align:middle line:84%
and it's actually ground
glass cutting you up,

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:21.425 align:middle line:84%
and it's painful, and
all this kind of stuff,

00:47:21.425 --> 00:47:23.150 align:middle line:90%
your body will reject sugar.

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:26.330 align:middle line:84%
I once had a friend
of mine tell me

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:30.742 align:middle line:84%
that he never eats
anything that's

00:47:30.742 --> 00:47:32.450 align:middle line:84%
prepared by a friend
of his, because when

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:34.850 align:middle line:84%
he was 10 years old, his
friend made him a sandwich,

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:36.380 align:middle line:90%
and he spit in it.

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.800 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't tell him.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And ever since then--
he's 40 years old

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:41.405 align:middle line:84%
now-- he'll never eat
anything because it

00:47:41.405 --> 00:47:44.210 align:middle line:90%
was such a visceral experience.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, when you imagine
something like that happening--

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:47.835 align:middle line:84%
if you imagine
eating a sandwich,

00:47:47.835 --> 00:47:51.597 align:middle line:84%
and the bread has
worms in it, your body

00:47:51.597 --> 00:47:53.180 align:middle line:84%
reacts to it on such
a cellular level.

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.890 align:middle line:84%
You feel that you're
nauseous all of a sudden.

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:56.410 align:middle line:84%
Because your body doesn't know
the difference between a real

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:57.670 align:middle line:90%
and imagined experience.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:59.670 align:middle line:84%
Then you're not going to
want the bread anymore.

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.430 align:middle line:84%
But I don't recommend doing
that type of visualization

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.910 align:middle line:90%
in the beginning.

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:03.770 align:middle line:84%
I recommend dealing
with it organically

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:06.830 align:middle line:84%
by addressing the root
causes of the addiction.

00:48:06.830 --> 00:48:09.900 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end, you finish
the job like that in one shot.

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:14.880 align:middle line:90%


00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, I have very specific
guidelines on exercise.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:21.740 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I don't recommend
that you do it initially.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.572 align:middle line:84%
Because there's so much
stress that your body

00:48:24.572 --> 00:48:26.780 align:middle line:84%
is experiencing already that
your body's in this kind

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.650 align:middle line:90%
of stress overload.

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And the stress of exercise
will just add to that overload.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.980 align:middle line:84%
So for the first month
or two, I recommend

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.170 align:middle line:84%
dealing with the
emotional stresses,

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:40.190 align:middle line:84%
getting your digestion better,
adding more real foods.

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.770 align:middle line:84%
And then once the stress
level goes down a little bit,

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.690 align:middle line:90%
then adding exercise.

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:46.790 align:middle line:84%
But I only recommend
adding exercise

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.050 align:middle line:90%
in a very specific way.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:51.380 align:middle line:84%
Exercise when done right
will actually get your body

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.808 align:middle line:90%
to want to be thinner.

00:48:53.808 --> 00:48:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise it just becomes
a calorie burning tool.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:48:58.072 align:middle line:90%
And as a calorie burning tool--

00:48:58.072 --> 00:48:59.780 align:middle line:84%
so you burn 300
calories, and then you're

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.040 align:middle line:90%
300 calories hungrier.

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:01.998 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't do anything.

00:49:01.998 --> 00:49:04.623 align:middle line:84%
But if you do it right-- and you
don't have to do it that much.

00:49:04.623 --> 00:49:05.840 align:middle line:90%
You just have to do it right.

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:08.000 align:middle line:84%
Then it becomes a tool
for getting your body

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.020 align:middle line:90%
to want to be thin.

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And the way it works is, imagine
it's like 1,000 years ago,

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:15.970 align:middle line:84%
and you're walking in the
woods, and a bear comes out

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:17.690 align:middle line:90%
and starts chasing you.

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:19.880 align:middle line:90%
So that's a stress.

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to go
for a 40 minute cardio walk

00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.200 align:middle line:90%
if a bear is chasing you.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.330 align:middle line:90%
You're going to run.

00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:28.280 align:middle line:84%
You're going to run as fast
as you can for 30 seconds,

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.260 align:middle line:90%
or you're dead.

00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:33.215 align:middle line:84%
And that stress activates a
different program inside you

00:49:33.215 --> 00:49:34.840 align:middle line:84%
that's different than
the fat programs.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:36.860 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
stress than a famine.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:41.060 align:middle line:84%
That stress activates the get
thin or get eaten adaptation.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:45.740 align:middle line:84%
When your body activates the get
thin or get eaten adaptation,

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.620 align:middle line:84%
then it thinks nothing is more
important than being thin.

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Because if we're not thin, and
we're not fast, we're dead.

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:55.580 align:middle line:84%
And then boom, you're
not hungry anymore.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.457 align:middle line:84%
You stop eating
halfway through a meal.

00:49:57.457 --> 00:49:58.790 align:middle line:90%
You don't crave fattening foods.

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:00.957 align:middle line:84%
Your body knows how to lose
weight when it wants to.

00:50:00.957 --> 00:50:04.790 align:middle line:84%
And if it thinks be thin or
be dead, it'll lose weight.

00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:09.632 align:middle line:84%
You can use exercise
to trick your body

00:50:09.632 --> 00:50:11.840 align:middle line:84%
into activating the get thin
or get eaten adaptation.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.090 align:middle line:84%
The way to do it is, let's
say you're going for a walk

00:50:14.090 --> 00:50:15.290 align:middle line:90%
that you do every day.

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:16.130 align:middle line:90%
Just walk leisurely.

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:19.580 align:middle line:84%
Don't do this power walk
thing for 40 minutes.

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Walk leisurely.

00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:24.883 align:middle line:84%
But every once in a while,
just for maybe 10 seconds--

00:50:24.883 --> 00:50:27.050 align:middle line:84%
and of course, get your
doctor's approval, whatever.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But just for 10 seconds,
move as fast as you can.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:35.360 align:middle line:84%
And imagine that you're
being chased by a predator.

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.400 align:middle line:84%
Because remember,
your body doesn't

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.858 align:middle line:84%
know the difference between a
real and imagined experience.

00:50:39.858 --> 00:50:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And it thinks the reason you're
moving so fast is for survival.

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And so if survival
is about being thin,

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:46.850 align:middle line:90%
that's a whole other game.

00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:48.350 align:middle line:84%
That's a whole other
kettle of fish.

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:50.270 align:middle line:84%
That'll get your body
to want to be thin.

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:51.853 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to do it that much.

00:50:51.853 --> 00:50:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Once or twice a week for
30 seconds here or there.

00:50:55.230 --> 00:50:58.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you do do it too much,
it becomes a chronic stress

00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:59.690 align:middle line:84%
that elevates your
cortisol levels

00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:01.773 align:middle line:84%
and causes your body to
activate the fat programs.

00:51:01.773 --> 00:51:03.440 align:middle line:90%
And studies have shown--

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.570 align:middle line:84%
there was a study I
read about cross country

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:08.150 align:middle line:84%
skiers in Colorado where they
were training and training

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.960 align:middle line:84%
and training, and
they were getting

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:09.800 align:middle line:90%
fitter and fitter and fitter.

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And at a certain point,
they start gaining weight.

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Because the stress
was too much for them.

00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And that stress became
a chronic stress

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.760 align:middle line:84%
that then activated
their fat programs.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have
to do it too much.

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:24.207 align:middle line:84%
Always keep the focus on how
fat or thin my body wants to be.

00:51:24.207 --> 00:51:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Don't worry about
calories in, calories out.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:27.957 align:middle line:90%
Let your body do the accounting.

00:51:27.957 --> 00:51:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Keep the focus on how fat or
thin your body wants to be.

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:32.885 align:middle line:84%
And when you do
exercise this way,

00:51:32.885 --> 00:51:34.010 align:middle line:90%
your body wants to be thin.

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:39.440 align:middle line:90%


00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.920 align:middle line:84%
The way to have clear,
healthy, vibrant skin

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:47.790 align:middle line:84%
and to have proper functioning
happy brain chemistry so

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:51.500 align:middle line:84%
you don't have depression
and to look and feel great

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:53.355 align:middle line:90%
is to do it from the inside out.

00:51:53.355 --> 00:51:54.980 align:middle line:84%
If you eat the right
fats, for example,

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:57.500 align:middle line:84%
and you eat live foods,
you add live foods,

00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.630 align:middle line:84%
and you have the
right proper proteins,

00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:01.310 align:middle line:90%
then your skin clears up.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:03.530 align:middle line:90%
I used to have the worst eczema.

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:06.215 align:middle line:90%
My skin looked like a crocodile.

00:52:06.215 --> 00:52:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And it itched all the time.

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:09.800 align:middle line:90%
And it was terrible.

00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And there were marks of
toxins all over my body.

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:18.412 align:middle line:84%
And there were blue spots
and all kinds of things.

00:52:18.412 --> 00:52:19.620 align:middle line:90%
And it's just all cleared up.

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:22.590 align:middle line:84%
And my skin's softer
than it's ever been.

00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's from dealing
with the inside out.

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:30.290 align:middle line:84%
Getting the cells of your body
healthier, reducing toxins.

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:34.430 align:middle line:84%
When you put creams on your
skin, those creams have toxins.

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:36.277 align:middle line:84%
And those toxins
go into your body.

00:52:36.277 --> 00:52:38.610 align:middle line:84%
And then a lot of times people
say, stay out of the sun.

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:39.590 align:middle line:90%
Stay out of the sun.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:40.760 align:middle line:90%
The sun is our life force.

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.970 align:middle line:84%
It's our connection
to life itself.

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:45.998 align:middle line:90%
Don't stay out of the sun.

00:52:45.998 --> 00:52:47.790 align:middle line:84%
The reason we're having
so much skin cancer

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:50.060 align:middle line:84%
is because we're putting
toxins on our skin

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.950 align:middle line:90%
in the form of sunscreen.

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:54.590 align:middle line:84%
And when those toxins
interact with the sun,

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:56.190 align:middle line:90%
you get mutations.

00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:58.670 align:middle line:90%
And that causes skin cancer.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:53:01.970 align:middle line:84%
But if your skin is
healthy from the inside out

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:04.640 align:middle line:84%
because you don't have
toxins, then that energy just

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:06.080 align:middle line:90%
gets absorbed into your body.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:10.532 align:middle line:90%


00:53:10.532 --> 00:53:12.240 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin D is essential
for losing weight.

00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.830 align:middle line:84%
Vitamin D turns off
the fat programs.

00:53:13.830 --> 00:53:17.310 align:middle line:84%
And a lack of vitamin D
turns on the fat programs.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:20.328 align:middle line:84%
It's like in winter time,
if there's not enough sun,

00:53:20.328 --> 00:53:22.620 align:middle line:84%
your body knows that there's
probably not enough foods.

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.700 align:middle line:84%
It's going to activate
the fat programs.

00:53:25.700 --> 00:53:29.007 align:middle line:84%
Sunlight elevates
your vitamin D levels.

00:53:29.007 --> 00:53:30.340 align:middle line:90%
That turns off the fat programs.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:34.080 align:middle line:84%
It also increases
the hormone group

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.060 align:middle line:84%
called melanocortins
in your brain

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:37.980 align:middle line:90%
that turns off the fat programs.

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And you're absorbing
life force that you're

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:42.420 align:middle line:90%
starving for into your body.

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.220 align:middle line:84%
The sun is your
connection to life.

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.090 align:middle line:90%
Don't cut it off.

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:53:50.470 --> 00:53:53.470 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of ways
to do healthy cheap.

00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And it's important, because
people are on a low income,

00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:59.020 align:middle line:84%
and they can't afford all
these food supplements.

00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:01.970 align:middle line:84%
They can't afford organic food
and all this kind of stuff.

00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:05.080 align:middle line:84%
But for example, going
to the health food store

00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:08.470 align:middle line:84%
and buying a couple of
pounds of whole flax seeds

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:10.635 align:middle line:84%
and then grinding
them up each day,

00:54:10.635 --> 00:54:12.010 align:middle line:84%
you're talking
about if you spend

00:54:12.010 --> 00:54:15.490 align:middle line:84%
$10, that's going to feed
your family for two months.

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:18.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to give
you proteins, fibers,

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:21.070 align:middle line:84%
and all the omega 3s you
need in an uncorrupted form

00:54:21.070 --> 00:54:23.110 align:middle line:90%
for two months.

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:24.370 align:middle line:90%
And buy them organic.

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:26.200 align:middle line:84%
Spend the extra $2
for the organic.

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.848 align:middle line:90%
Because toxins are held in fat.

00:54:28.848 --> 00:54:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And that healthy fat's
going to have toxins

00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:31.660 align:middle line:90%
if it's not organic.

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.490 align:middle line:90%
So buy the organic one.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:36.910 align:middle line:84%
Go to farmers
markets in your area

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:41.710 align:middle line:84%
and buy locally grown
spray-free produce.

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:44.260 align:middle line:90%
It's typically much cheaper--

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:47.050 align:middle line:84%
if it's in season
and locally grown,

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:50.410 align:middle line:84%
it's typically much cheaper
than going to a supermarket

00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:51.370 align:middle line:90%
to buy produce.

00:54:51.370 --> 00:54:52.630 align:middle line:90%
And it's much healthier.

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:54.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe it's not
certified organic,

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.710 align:middle line:84%
because they haven't gone
through all the rigmaroles.

00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:58.180 align:middle line:84%
But it's usually a mom and pop
that are growing some stuff,

00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:58.960 align:middle line:90%
and they're not spraying it.

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And it's on there
that it's spray free.

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:02.110 align:middle line:90%
Go to your farmer market.

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:03.640 align:middle line:90%
Buy spray-free.

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Add that to all the
meals that you're having.

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:10.060 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you can, if you have
a little bit of a garden--

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:15.040 align:middle line:84%
even if you have two
meters, two square meters,

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.150 align:middle line:84%
in your house or out, you
can grow all the lettuce

00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:22.030 align:middle line:84%
that your family
will need forever.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:23.800 align:middle line:84%
You can grow 30
patches of lettuce--

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:26.560 align:middle line:84%
that's a month's worth of
lettuce at any given time--

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:27.642 align:middle line:90%
for next to nothing.

00:55:27.642 --> 00:55:29.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's the healthiest
food you can get.

00:55:29.350 --> 00:55:31.117 align:middle line:84%
So much healthier
than any other lettuce

00:55:31.117 --> 00:55:32.950 align:middle line:84%
you can buy, even if
it's organically grown,

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:35.380 align:middle line:84%
because it still
has the life force.

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:39.640 align:middle line:84%
The second you cut it off,
you serve it, you eat it,

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:42.280 align:middle line:84%
you're absorbing life
force, live enzymes,

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:44.500 align:middle line:84%
all of the different
nutrients that you need.

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:47.560 align:middle line:90%
And it costs next to nothing.

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.540 align:middle line:90%
Growing wheat grass.

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.290 align:middle line:84%
Wheat grass is by far
the healthiest thing

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:52.480 align:middle line:90%
you can put in your body.

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.360 align:middle line:84%
If it's fresh squeezed
organically grown wheat grass,

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.410 align:middle line:84%
you can grow that on a
windowsill for next to nothing.

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:00.160 align:middle line:84%
A shot of wheat grass
is going to give you

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:04.008 align:middle line:84%
all the nutrients your body
needs for a day bar none.

00:56:04.008 --> 00:56:05.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to go
right into your cells.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter if
your digestion is not

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:09.285 align:middle line:84%
working because it goes right
through your stomach, right

00:56:09.285 --> 00:56:12.050 align:middle line:84%
through your blood,
right into your cells.

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:12.850 align:middle line:90%
Grow wheat grass.

00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:13.930 align:middle line:90%
Have a shot every day.

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:15.730 align:middle line:90%
Grow some lettuce.

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:18.550 align:middle line:84%
Even inside an apartment,
have that every day

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:19.930 align:middle line:90%
and get some ground linseeds.

00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And you will be healthier
than your wildest imagination

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:24.880 align:middle line:90%
for next to nothing.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:29.130 align:middle line:90%
