00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.444 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:24.150 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>> So I thought I was smart.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.440 align:middle line:90%
I made a lot of money.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.062 align:middle line:84%
I'd spent a lot of time giving
myself pats on the back.

00:00:31.062 --> 00:00:33.020 align:middle line:84%
I spent a lot of time
with my mates in the pub,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.890 align:middle line:84%
giving each other
a pat on the back.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And I got to this point
where I was 40 years of age.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.830 align:middle line:84%
I was fat, sick,
and nearly dead.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:90%
I was 310 pounds, or 141 kilos.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.090 align:middle line:84%
I was taking high doses
of steroids every day,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.110 align:middle line:90%
day and night, for eight years.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.530 align:middle line:84%
I was a cheeseburger
away from a heart attack.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.530 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no more.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Got to do something
about this, Joe.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.590 align:middle line:84%
You're not as smart as
you thought you were.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So I went straight to juicing
and a plant-based diet.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.600 align:middle line:84%
And within basically 10 to
15 days, the fog had lifted.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.590 align:middle line:90%
And I was on the path.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.760 align:middle line:84%
I was on the path to not
being fat, not being sick,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and not being
anywhere near dead.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:84%
At my all-time high, I was about
141, 142 kilos, or 310 pounds.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.400 align:middle line:90%
That was the all-time high.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.130 align:middle line:90%
I fluctuate in my weight.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Weight was always
an issue with me.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:84%
I used to be called "fat
bum" when I was like 10.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And all my life, it was
something that was very much--

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:84%
I was conscious of the size
of my thighs, bum, stomach.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And then I got really
fit when I was at school.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to play
competitive football.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.700 align:middle line:90%
And I rode.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.960 align:middle line:90%
And I was as thin as a rake.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
But as soon as I
hit the workforce

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:84%
and I started having
those beers at lunchtime,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.070 align:middle line:90%
the waist went one way.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:90%
And that was out.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:16.580 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't so much an
issue in my early 20s.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.430 align:middle line:84%
But once you stop playing
competitive sport,

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:84%
once you stop the
exercising and keep up

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.312 align:middle line:84%
the poor habits
with the diet, it

00:02:24.312 --> 00:02:25.520 align:middle line:90%
doesn't take long to blow up.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.140 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.260 align:middle line:84%
I think that when you're
fat and grossly overweight,

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.990 align:middle line:84%
you actually work
out a few tricks.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.930 align:middle line:84%
You buy clothes that
are a lot bigger.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.030 align:middle line:90%
You don't tuck your shirt in.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.910 align:middle line:84%
You wear lots of
loose-fitting clothes.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.640 align:middle line:84%
So there are all tricks of
the trade that you can do.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.470 align:middle line:90%
And you don't wear light colors.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
You wear darker colors
because they're slimming.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.780 align:middle line:84%
So there's a few
things that you learn

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.780 align:middle line:84%
to do to try and
mask the obesity.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.840 align:middle line:84%
But look, I think
that for me, it's--

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.060 align:middle line:90%
I've had a big change.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.260 align:middle line:90%
There's a big change now.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:84%
And also, when
you're overweight--

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.600 align:middle line:90%
I'll just back up here.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.650 align:middle line:84%
The big change for me now is
that I used to look at people.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.500 align:middle line:90%
And I used to see fat people.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.210 align:middle line:90%
I don't see fat people anymore.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.300 align:middle line:84%
I just see lots of people
with excess energy on them.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Because at the end of
the day, our bodies

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:90%
are storage systems of energy.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:29.940 align:middle line:90%
We take energy in.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:90%
We expend energy out.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.380 align:middle line:84%
What I was doing was I was
taking too much energy on board

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.550 align:middle line:90%
and not using it.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.130 align:middle line:84%
And so the body just
naturally stores it up.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.650 align:middle line:84%
So I sort of have a very
different view on the world

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.590 align:middle line:84%
right now when I see people that
are carrying too much energy.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.120 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.820 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my early 30s,
I was focused very much

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:90%
on career.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.660 align:middle line:84%
I was focused very
much on wealth.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.170 align:middle line:84%
And health was at the
bottom of the list.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was super
focused on business.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm running around
the world, trying

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.480 align:middle line:90%
to build my little empire.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And what actually happened
after that period of time

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:90%
was that my body gave up.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.319 align:middle line:84%
It gave up to the pressure of
what I was putting it under.

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.444 align:middle line:84%
And when I talk about the
pressure I was putting it

00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:23.470 align:middle line:84%
under, it was like
lack of sleep,

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:84%
poor diet, too much alcohol,
smoking, no exercise.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.760 align:middle line:90%
You throw everything in.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.990 align:middle line:90%
I had it all.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And essentially what happened
was is that I ended up

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:84%
with an autoimmune disease,
a chronic condition

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.630 align:middle line:90%
called "urticaria," which is a--

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.910 align:middle line:90%
it's like a chronic rash.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:90%
It's like hives.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.190 align:middle line:90%
And it was induced by touch.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So any kind of touch, any kind
of pressure on my body, and I

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.920 align:middle line:84%
would swell up and look
like the elephant man.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:84%
And so when I went to the
doctors to get this looked at,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.490 align:middle line:90%
they gave me some pills.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.110 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, within
four or five hours, everything

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.910 align:middle line:90%
was good as gold.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, here we go.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
Great to be alive in this
modern world of medicine,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
where they can give you a
pill, and you're healed.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.705 align:middle line:84%
Well, obviously,
I wasn't healed.

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:11.080 align:middle line:84%
All they were
doing was giving me

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.170 align:middle line:84%
a high dose of prednisone,
a powerful steroid,

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.710 align:middle line:84%
to mask the actual
symptoms of my condition.

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.820 align:middle line:84%
So when you're faced
with an illness that--

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.650 align:middle line:84%
after three or four weeks, I've
got to keep taking the pills.

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.540 align:middle line:84%
After two or three
months, I've got

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.510 align:middle line:84%
to keep taking the pills,
pills night and day.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.610 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to have
these pills with me.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.560 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't not have
them by my side

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
because if I checked
luggage on a flight,

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.500 align:middle line:84%
and my luggage got lost, I
couldn't do without my pills.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So I went from someone who
was relatively very healthy

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.390 align:middle line:84%
and not having to worry
about anything like this

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.610 align:middle line:90%
to having pills night and day.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.410 align:middle line:90%
And that was a huge shock.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.700 align:middle line:84%
So after about a year of
this, I started to focus on,

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
well, there must be
some other solution.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.700 align:middle line:84%
So I was looking for solutions
in the medical area first.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:90%
I went to the best doctors.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.210 align:middle line:90%
I went all around.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:84%
And money was no object for
me to find a cure for this.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:84%
And after a couple of
years and all sorts

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.150 align:middle line:84%
of different
treatments, nothing.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.750 align:middle line:84%
Still taking the same dosage
of prednisone, about 30

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.440 align:middle line:84%
milligrams a day, 15 in
the morning, 15 at night.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:90%
And I started to--

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm a very happy guy.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm a positive guy.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:84%
And for the first time in
my life, I started to--

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.600 align:middle line:90%
the outlook looked bleak.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.850 align:middle line:90%
And I won't say I got depressed.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.620 align:middle line:84%
But I felt the early
part of it coming on.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.252 align:middle line:84%
So then I started a switch
to alternative paths.

00:06:48.252 --> 00:06:49.210 align:middle line:90%
And I tried everything.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:50.320 align:middle line:90%
I did witch doctors.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:90%
I did mud baths.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.190 align:middle line:90%
I did acupuncture.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.810 align:middle line:90%
I did the lot.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.000 align:middle line:84%
The one thing which I was
really afraid to face up to

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.930 align:middle line:84%
was changing what I
put into my mouth.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's like at
the end of the day,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.350 align:middle line:84%
this is kind of like your last
area of control in the world.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.350 align:middle line:84%
What you do with this, what you
take, and what you put in here

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:18.942 align:middle line:90%
nobody can control you on.

00:07:18.942 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of control
going on in the world,

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.170 align:middle line:84%
whether it's your
government, whether it's

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.880 align:middle line:84%
your state, whether it's
your career, your parents,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.220 align:middle line:90%
your kids, your loved ones.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.720 align:middle line:84%
But this last
little bastion here

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.640 align:middle line:90%
of what you put in your mouth--

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:90%
that's all yours.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.790 align:middle line:90%
And so I was very--

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.230 align:middle line:84%
it was a big issue
to face up to that.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And deep down, I
probably knew that what

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.365 align:middle line:84%
I was putting in my mouth had
to have something to do with it.

00:07:47.365 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
Because I was a
smart guy, right?

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.840 align:middle line:84%
Well, at least I
thought I was smart.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.070 align:middle line:84%
And so that was
the turning point.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:57.440 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's a difference
between knowing it and doing

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.720 align:middle line:84%
So it was about three or
four years in that I knew

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.800 align:middle line:90%
I had to do something about it.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.540 align:middle line:84%
But it took me another
five before I actually did.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And that shift, that
procrastination,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.630 align:middle line:90%
that putting it off--

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I think that once I hit 40,
I think that was like a--

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.743 align:middle line:90%
the quiet chats with myself.

00:08:23.743 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
Joe, you got to do
something about this, mate.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.090 align:middle line:84%
You've been putting it off,
putting it off, putting it off.

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:28.923 align:middle line:90%
And I have a saying.

00:08:28.923 --> 00:08:31.270 align:middle line:84%
We spend the first 40
years of our life trying

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.640 align:middle line:84%
to kill ourselves and the
next 40 trying to stay alive.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.380 align:middle line:84%
And I certainly was the
poster boy for that mantra.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.669 align:middle line:90%


00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.230 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'm no expert.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.970 align:middle line:84%
I'm just a bloke
who's gone along.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:49.730 align:middle line:84%
And I was heading
down one path, where I

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.620 align:middle line:90%
was fat, sick, and nearly dead.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden, I
said, wake up yourself, Joe.

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.580 align:middle line:90%
But I'm no expert.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But what I have learned is that
70% of all disease in the world

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:90%
is caused by lifestyle choices.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can look at
that as quite negative.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.440 align:middle line:84%
I look at that as
quite positive.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.570 align:middle line:90%
I reckon, how exciting is that?

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.630 align:middle line:84%
That means that 70%
of all the diseases

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.823 align:middle line:90%
we can do something about.

00:09:15.823 --> 00:09:17.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's
exciting, isn't it?

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:23.940 align:middle line:90%
I didn't try any.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.340 align:middle line:84%
I think I worked out pretty
quick after two years

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.190 align:middle line:84%
that the pills
weren't the answer.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.650 align:middle line:90%
So no, I didn't try any of that.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.100 align:middle line:90%


00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Lap band, surgery, all the
risk associated with that--

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.580 align:middle line:90%
I was desperate.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.990 align:middle line:90%
But I wasn't that desperate.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.540 align:middle line:84%
I still felt I had
a few cards to play.

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, it was
facing up to that one big card

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.210 align:middle line:84%
that I might have
to give up pizza.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.830 align:middle line:90%
I might have to give up beer.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.950 align:middle line:84%
I might have to give
up the hamburger.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:90%
Shoot me.

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.220 align:middle line:90%
So it was that.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:04.800 align:middle line:90%
It was those comfort foods--

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
the sugar, the fat, the
salt. You grow up with it.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.290 align:middle line:90%
It's part of who you are.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:13.140 align:middle line:84%
You associate so
much of happiness

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.020 align:middle line:84%
with being at McDonald's and
having that clown run around

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.250 align:middle line:90%
while you're eight years of age.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's these associations
that we grew up with.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:23.760 align:middle line:90%
And food is no longer energy.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:90%
It's entertainment.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's not
good because it's--

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:28.290 align:middle line:90%
I mean, look.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of entertainment
for food is fine.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.510 align:middle line:84%
But if it's all about
entertainment, that ain't good.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm still addicted to
chocolate ice cream.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:42.807 align:middle line:90%
That doesn't go away.

00:10:42.807 --> 00:10:44.390 align:middle line:84%
When you're addicted,
you're addicted.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.920 align:middle line:90%
You're gone.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Now I try to manage
it as best as I can.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.600 align:middle line:84%
My whole message is not
to give up foods entirely.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.540 align:middle line:84%
I come from this
middle-of-the-road point

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.340 align:middle line:90%
of view.

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I just think rather than
not eat certain foods,

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:08.120 align:middle line:84%
I think you should eat
more of certain foods.

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:12.980 align:middle line:84%
And so my whole message, which I
tell myself every day, is, Joe,

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:15.860 align:middle line:84%
today you've got to eat
more fruits and vegetables.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.380 align:middle line:84%
You've got to eat more
foods that are alive.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.340 align:middle line:84%
You've got to eat more nuts and
beans and legumes and seeds,

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:26.120 align:middle line:84%
all those things that are made
by the sun and by the earth

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.400 align:middle line:90%
and by water.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And if you can eat those
things, then eat more of them.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.017 align:middle line:84%
Then that'll allow you
for those special times

00:11:35.017 --> 00:11:36.350 align:middle line:90%
to have the chocolate ice cream.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:42.160 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.783 align:middle line:90%
No, no.

00:11:44.783 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:84%
One thing I learned driving
across the United States

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.730 align:middle line:84%
for 60 days just drinking
juice and talking to people

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.130 align:middle line:84%
about what they ate and,
more importantly, what

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:54.600 align:middle line:90%
they didn't eat--

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:84%
what I learned was that there
is a whole group of people

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:03.360 align:middle line:84%
out there that are addicted
to sugar, fat, and salt.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.280 align:middle line:84%
And they want to do
something about it.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.140 align:middle line:84%
But the big thing was
that they didn't blame

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.980 align:middle line:90%
anyone else except themselves.

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.110 align:middle line:84%
So there's this enormous
groundswell of people out there

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.090 align:middle line:84%
that know that they've got
to do something about it.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's just them going from
the knowing to the doing.

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.360 align:middle line:90%
There's enough information.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.400 align:middle line:84%
There's enough
stories out there.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.710 align:middle line:84%
There are enough
great movies out there

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.540 align:middle line:84%
that have shown people
what they need to do.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just a matter
now of doing it.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.370 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that that
comes down to leadership.

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.090 align:middle line:84%
I think each and every
person, the people

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.680 align:middle line:84%
out there that are
watching this now--

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.230 align:middle line:84%
you start eating
more plant food.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:42.270 align:middle line:84%
That people next door-- they'll
follow and so on and so on.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:44.110 align:middle line:90%
And that's how we make a change.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:46.770 align:middle line:84%
It's just about
individuals going out there

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:47.730 align:middle line:90%
and blazing the trail.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:53.110 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.838 align:middle line:90%
So I was motivated to--

00:12:57.838 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:84%
I guess the way I look at
it was is that I turned

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.690 align:middle line:90%
my back on mother nature.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to
conduct an experiment

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:90%
where I was the lab rat.

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:09.220 align:middle line:84%
What would happen if I ran
towards her full steam?

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
Would she open her
arms and embrace me?

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:90%
And would I be healed?

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And that was kind
of my experiment.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.270 align:middle line:90%
So let's full bull.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's go hard hitter.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And so it was like, OK,
what am I going to do?

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:26.120 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'm on high
dose of steroids.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:90%
I'm on medication night and day.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:33.820 align:middle line:84%
I am 100 pounds, or 45,
50 kilos, overweight.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm a cheeseburger away
from a heart attack.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.960 align:middle line:90%
And I'm only 40 years of age.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.550 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when I was a kid
hearing about my mates' dads

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.555 align:middle line:90%
having a heart attack.

00:13:43.555 --> 00:13:44.680 align:middle line:90%
And they were in their 40s.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.510 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, gee, that's old.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.150 align:middle line:84%
But here was I, all of
a sudden hitting 40.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, I'm
part of that group.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So I said to myself, all
right, what if I just

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.710 align:middle line:84%
embrace plant food only
until I'm off my medication?

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.160 align:middle line:84%
I had no idea how long it
was going to take, no idea.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:02.960 align:middle line:90%
Could be a year.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.180 align:middle line:90%
Could be two years.

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.230 align:middle line:90%
Could be longer.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:84%
But I made the commitment
that I'm going to do it.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.750 align:middle line:84%
And to supercharge my
start and my beginning,

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:84%
I said, what would happen
if I only juiced it?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.640 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I
did the juicing part

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.920 align:middle line:84%
was because that's
how I was able to get

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.040 align:middle line:84%
much more of the superfood
or the micronutrients

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:25.210 align:middle line:84%
or the phytochemicals
in a concentrated way

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.200 align:middle line:90%
into my system.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.390 align:middle line:84%
So I went out, and I did
two months, 60 days, nothing

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:32.800 align:middle line:90%
but juice.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Then it took me
another three months

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.390 align:middle line:90%
of only eating plant food.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:90%
I had one break.

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:40.550 align:middle line:84%
Christmas day I had
a prawn, or a shrimp

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:90%
as they call it over here.

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But apart from that, that's
what I did-- five months

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:90%
total of plant food.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And I took my steroid
dosage down to zero.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
That was three and
a half years ago.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.735 align:middle line:90%
And I haven't had a pill since.

00:14:55.735 --> 00:15:00.930 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:04.760 align:middle line:84%
Over the period
of the 60 days, I

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:12.800 align:middle line:84%
lost close to 80 pounds,
or 35 to 40 kilos.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.780 align:middle line:84%
And then the period afterwards,
I continued to lose the weight.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:90%
But see, losing weight--

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't like these
words of losing weight.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:28.220 align:middle line:84%
I like the idea of getting
rid of excess energy.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.542 align:middle line:84%
And the excess energy
is in the fat for mine.

00:15:32.542 --> 00:15:34.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know there's
energy in the muscle.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:36.800 align:middle line:84%
But I like to think
about it as reducing

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.480 align:middle line:84%
the amount of fat
I had in my body

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.740 align:middle line:90%
and increasing the muscle tone.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.240 align:middle line:84%
And I've still got
a long way to go.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.710 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I'm not perfect.

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:47.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm still on this journey of
trying to get to that level

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.242 align:middle line:84%
where I can sit
back and be happy.

00:15:49.242 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:84%
But I know that the day I
sit back and say that, I'll

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.800 align:middle line:90%
probably go have a pizza.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:84%
So we don't want that
to happen, do we?

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
But the idea of quickly
losing the weight--

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.880 align:middle line:84%
I kind of think that it
was more about my body

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.250 align:middle line:84%
trying to get into
balance and to be healthy.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:07.622 align:middle line:84%
And if you put plant
food only into your body,

00:16:07.622 --> 00:16:09.830 align:middle line:84%
you'll know pretty quickly
whether you're overweight.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:11.540 align:middle line:84%
Because lots of
people who do this--

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:13.790 align:middle line:84%
they don't lose any weight
because they didn't need to

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.850 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:18.260 align:middle line:84%
But if you're actually carrying
too much energy and you've got

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.650 align:middle line:84%
too much excess fat on
you or excess muscle--

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:90%
and some people do--

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:84%
then the body will quickly and
simply adjust and balance up.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:33.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:90%
The hardest part of what--

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.750 align:middle line:90%
I call it a "reboot."

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:90%
I call what I did was--

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.430 align:middle line:84%
just like with computers,
you need to sometimes hit

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:41.787 align:middle line:90%
the Control-Alt-Delete.

00:16:41.787 --> 00:16:43.370 align:middle line:84%
Well, I needed to
do that with myself.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:84%
So I call it that I
needed to reboot my life.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I needed to reboot
the whole system

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and take everything
that I was putting

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.070 align:middle line:90%
into this amazingly designed--

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.580 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're all incredibly
unique in our own way.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:05.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I was putting into
the system was basically crap.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.430 align:middle line:84%
The average American
and Australian--

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.680 align:middle line:84%
60% of what they eat
is processed food,

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:14.329 align:middle line:84%
30% animal product, 5% whole
grains and white potatoes,

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:17.420 align:middle line:84%
and just 5% fruits
and vegetables.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And I reckon I wasn't
even doing that.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.010 align:middle line:90%
So what do you expect?

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.420 align:middle line:90%
I have a saying.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.930 align:middle line:84%
You're going to eat food made
by people in white coats.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:29.600 align:middle line:84%
You're going to end up
seeing people in white coats.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.200 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
pretty obvious for me

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.450 align:middle line:90%
that that's where I had to go.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:36.827 align:middle line:84%
So the motivation was all about
getting off the medication.

00:17:36.827 --> 00:17:38.285 align:middle line:84%
It was about getting
off the pills.

00:17:38.285 --> 00:17:42.404 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.404 --> 00:17:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So you have these
highs and lows.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And then you start
to look at it.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.660 align:middle line:84%
You start getting
a little nervous.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And you start to think, gee,
this is going to be tough.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And then when you start,
there's a lot of emotion

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.022 align:middle line:90%
when I started off.

00:17:59.022 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't know
what I was doing.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Making a film?

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:02.402 align:middle line:90%
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:18:02.402 --> 00:18:03.990 align:middle line:90%
So it was a bit of distraction.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:08.490 align:middle line:84%
But about two or three days
in, I was doing it real tough.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:13.110 align:middle line:84%
I felt like someone had come
along, ripped open my guts,

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.640 align:middle line:84%
split open my stomach, and
put rocks and dirt and then

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
all sorts of crap in me
and zipped me back up.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:25.980 align:middle line:84%
I was feeling crook
as and lonely,

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.040 align:middle line:84%
couldn't sleep, wanted
to sleep, didn't know

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.900 align:middle line:90%
whether I was Arthur or Martha.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:34.380 align:middle line:84%
And it took about two
or three days for me

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:38.190 align:middle line:84%
to get through those
dark, dark times.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.010 align:middle line:84%
And then after about
day four, day five,

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:90%
the fog started to lift.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:45.330 align:middle line:90%
And I wasn't hungry anymore.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:46.580 align:middle line:90%
I truly wasn't hungry.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.225 align:middle line:90%
Now, I had cravings.

00:18:48.225 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't watch TV
because of all the commercials

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:90%
about advertising all the food.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.700 align:middle line:90%
And it's funny.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
They all come on in the
evening, the food ads.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.320 align:middle line:90%
So I couldn't do that.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.750 align:middle line:90%
But I was never hungry.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.550 align:middle line:84%
For the whole two months,
never, ever hungry

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:90%
after about three or four days.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:12.390 align:middle line:84%
And then I didn't really have
any emotional setbacks other

00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:15.270 align:middle line:90%
than it just was a bit boring.

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:19.113 align:middle line:84%
Just drinking juice for
60 days is boring as.

00:19:19.113 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:84%
But if you're making a movie and
you're traveling across America

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and you're talking to all these
wonderful people over here,

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.200 align:middle line:90%
it makes it interesting.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:90%


00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, I don't take
the pills anymore.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:36.800 align:middle line:84%
And that's a miracle,
as far as I'm concerned.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.150 align:middle line:90%
So not having to take pills--

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.330 align:middle line:84%
knowing that every time you
put those pills into the body

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:84%
that you're exposing
yourself to a whole wrath

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:47.770 align:middle line:90%
of other diseases.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:52.620 align:middle line:90%
So it's hard to--

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:84%
how you feel is, I guess,
a hard thing to qualify.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:57.960 align:middle line:90%
I feel younger.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.610 align:middle line:90%
I feel more alive.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:02.580 align:middle line:90%
I certainly feel healthier.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:05.110 align:middle line:90%
I feel more alert.

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:08.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm definitely sleeping better.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.160 align:middle line:90%
Everything works better.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to be able
to go into stores

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.620 align:middle line:84%
and buy clothes that you
can tuck your shirt in.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.190 align:middle line:84%
It's nice to be able to actually
not have to go to specialty

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.040 align:middle line:90%
stores to buy your jeans.

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:26.078 align:middle line:90%
So there's lots of benefits.

00:20:26.078 --> 00:20:27.120 align:middle line:90%
There's lots of benefits.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:35.430 align:middle line:84%
And I guess that I feel 10
years younger, maybe 20.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:41.340 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.670 align:middle line:84%
I think your attitude
to life has a lot

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.640 align:middle line:90%
to do with your health as well.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:52.590 align:middle line:90%
And unfortunately, most people--

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:56.490 align:middle line:84%
and when I say "most,"
that's over 50% of people--

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.940 align:middle line:84%
get out of that morning shower,
have a look at themselves

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.760 align:middle line:84%
in the mirror when
they're alone,

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:84%
and they're not happy
with what they see.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.970 align:middle line:90%
They're just not happy.

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:10.950 align:middle line:84%
And they start out their day by
berating themselves and telling

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.990 align:middle line:84%
them they're a loser
and that they're no good

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:15.960 align:middle line:84%
and they've got to lift their
game and all these things.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you had someone who
is with you 24/7 that was just

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.872 align:middle line:84%
whispering that in
your ear all the time,

00:21:21.872 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know about you, but
they wouldn't last five minutes

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:90%
with me.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Yet we allow ourselves
to do it to ourself.

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.470 align:middle line:90%
But we do it to ourselves.

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:35.730 align:middle line:84%
So I really think
that part of what

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.100 align:middle line:84%
I went through with
my reboot and what

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I've found with the
thousands of people

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:46.290 align:middle line:84%
that have followed me and done
this is that their optimism--

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:49.560 align:middle line:90%


00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.620 align:middle line:84%
the way they look at themselves
after they've achieved this

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.590 align:middle line:84%
is they get out of that
shower in the morning.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And OK, they're not going to
look like Brad Pitt or Angelina

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.110 align:middle line:90%
Jolie.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.340 align:middle line:90%
But you know what?

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.360 align:middle line:90%
They look at themselves.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.527 align:middle line:90%
They give themselves a wink.

00:22:01.527 --> 00:22:04.560 align:middle line:84%
And they say, you're a
winner because you've

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.850 align:middle line:90%
at least achieved something.

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:09.120 align:middle line:84%
You've gone and you've eaten
only fruits and vegetables

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.490 align:middle line:84%
or drank them for a
set period of time.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.140 align:middle line:90%
And you achieved a goal.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
to be said for that.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.580 align:middle line:84%
There's something
for setting a goal,

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:21.750 align:middle line:84%
achieving it, looking
better, losing a few pounds,

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:25.450 align:middle line:90%
sleeping well, thinking clearer.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what's not
to love about that?

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:90%
