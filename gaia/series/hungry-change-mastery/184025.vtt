00:00:04.446 --> 00:00:23.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I've been interested
in health for a long time.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And my first exposure
to that was really

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:84%
through reading Dr. Ken
Cooper's book on exercise

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.390 align:middle line:90%
called "Aerobics" in 1968.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And really I've been
exercising ever since then.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.830 align:middle line:84%
And it started me down
the path of wellness.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.380 align:middle line:84%
And then I actually want to
be an astronaut at one point,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:84%
but decided that after my
involvement with the United

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.630 align:middle line:84%
States government process
that it would probably

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.672 align:middle line:84%
be wiser to go into medicine
and stick to health.

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:50.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm very glad I did that.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.595 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't have an epiphany or
a particular health challenge.

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.220 align:middle line:84%
I've been pretty
healthy my whole life.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.260 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, Western medicine
primarily focuses

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
on the use of drugs and surgery
as a solution for the symptoms.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.120 align:middle line:84%
They rarely ever
look at the cause.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.020 align:middle line:84%
And that's due to a
complex series of processes

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.160 align:middle line:84%
that occurred over time
that really involve the drug

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.970 align:middle line:84%
companies and the food industry
giants that really dictate much

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.340 align:middle line:84%
of the policy and
the direction that's

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.080 align:middle line:84%
transferred through
the education system

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.370 align:middle line:90%
and through the media.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.590 align:middle line:84%
Whereas natural
medicine really seeks

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.290 align:middle line:84%
to focus applying
natural solutions

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.932 align:middle line:84%
that have been around
for ages and time

00:01:36.932 --> 00:01:38.890 align:middle line:84%
tested, of course, and
as a result of that very

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.660 align:middle line:90%
few if any side effects.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.790 align:middle line:84%
And they are really
directed towards addressing

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.013 align:middle line:84%
what the cause of the
health challenge is

00:01:47.013 --> 00:01:48.430 align:middle line:84%
rather than treating
the symptoms.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.347 align:middle line:84%
And symptom treatment
is important, of course.

00:01:50.347 --> 00:01:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Especially if you're
in acute trauma,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:84%
you're going to want
some pain relief,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.240 align:middle line:84%
but that is really
about the benefit of it

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.477 align:middle line:90%
is in acute care medicine.

00:02:00.477 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.520 align:middle line:84%
One usually becomes sick
or encounters disease

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.400 align:middle line:84%
when they're following
a lifestyle typically

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.150 align:middle line:84%
that's different
than one was really

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.540 align:middle line:84%
designed to follow in
conjunction with exposure

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.560 align:middle line:84%
to many modern day
toxins and chemicals.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.790 align:middle line:84%
So the combination usually
is what predisposes one

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.160 align:middle line:90%
to developing that.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:90%
And typically, that involves--

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.550 align:middle line:84%
some of those strategies
would be not eating properly,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.670 align:middle line:84%
of course-- exposure
to too many processed

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.540 align:middle line:84%
foods and the chemicals
in those foods.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:84%
Not sleeping well-- exposure
to electromagnetic radiation

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.070 align:middle line:84%
and stresses in
cell phones and EMFs

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.290 align:middle line:84%
from a refrigerator that might
be behind your bedroom wall.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.200 align:middle line:84%
So these are all
variables that tend

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.200 align:middle line:84%
to detract from the
vitality of the system.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And it's really when you
get a critical threshold

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.870 align:middle line:84%
of a certain number of them that
the body is unable to tolerate

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:84%
at some point, and
then an assault

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.370 align:middle line:84%
comes in and
challenges the person.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.410 align:middle line:84%
It's why many people
believe or feel

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.750 align:middle line:90%
that cold is caused by a virus.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And while that may
be the trigger, it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
really it is a challenge
with a person's immune system

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
that is unable to
respond to that.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.492 align:middle line:84%
Because normally we're
designed to live in harmony

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:90%
with these infectious agents.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.290 align:middle line:84%
Its only when we have a problem
in our own internal system

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.850 align:middle line:84%
that that's allowed
to take over.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.450 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Well, obesity is an
interesting challenge.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's been my
personal belief that this

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.875 align:middle line:84%
is related to certainly
a number of variables,

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:43.250 align:middle line:84%
but the primary
culprit I believe

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.060 align:middle line:84%
is related to fructose,
which is a simple sugar.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:55.070 align:middle line:84%
It's typically combined with
glucose, so a disaccharide,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.740 align:middle line:84%
and that's what cane
sugar is or table sugar.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:84%
But when you break it apart
and have simple fructose,

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.090 align:middle line:84%
as is in high
fructose corn syrup,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.990 align:middle line:84%
which is the number one source
of calories in the United

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.790 align:middle line:90%
States--

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.380 align:middle line:84%
the number one source
of calories is fructose.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.760 align:middle line:84%
So when this is the
primary source of food

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.950 align:middle line:84%
that most people are
consuming, then there's

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.660 align:middle line:84%
metabolic consequences
of that that

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.190 align:middle line:84%
really start this
cascade that leads

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.020 align:middle line:90%
to a variety of conditions.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.810 align:middle line:84%
One of the primary ones
is insulin resistance.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
And when you're
insulin resistant,

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.200 align:middle line:84%
then you have an impairment
of the metabolic enzymes

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.050 align:middle line:90%
to help you break down fat.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's impaired.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.820 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that,
it's really difficult

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:41.738 align:middle line:90%
to lose weight.

00:04:41.738 --> 00:04:44.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably the primary
one-- and in conjunction

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.170 align:middle line:90%
with exercise, of course.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.700 align:middle line:84%
And there's been interestingly
an increase in exercise,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.590 align:middle line:84%
but the focus has
been traditionally

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.720 align:middle line:84%
on aerobic or cardio, which is
not the best type of exercise

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.720 align:middle line:90%
to help one lose weight.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.150 align:middle line:90%


00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, the issue of who's
responsible for this epidemic I

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.190 align:middle line:84%
believe really depends
on the population

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.600 align:middle line:90%
that you're looking at.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.200 align:middle line:84%
The typical average
American is exposed

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:90%
to a plethora of advertising--

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
media manipulation-- in a
number of different channels.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you're continually
bombarded with that,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and it's reinforced by the
traditional media which

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.550 align:middle line:84%
is purported to be news,
it's difficult to break out

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:90%
of that process.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.130 align:middle line:84%
So if one doesn't invest
significant time, effort,

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.040 align:middle line:84%
and energy to do independent
analysis, which fortunately

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.760 align:middle line:84%
is relatively easy to do
through tools like the internet,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
then it's easy to
become confused.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is a carefully
orchestrated process.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately I think the
responsibility goes back

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.840 align:middle line:90%
to the individuals.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we all are
responsible for taking

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.940 align:middle line:90%
control of our health.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not great breaking
news that there's

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.120 align:middle line:84%
this bias and prejudice
from the traditional media.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.010 align:middle line:84%
Unless one has been living under
a rock, one is aware of this.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.625 align:middle line:84%
Especially as one encounters
health challenges that

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:84%
aren't responding with the
traditional model-- of course,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.080 align:middle line:84%
that's the vast majority of
them from my experience-- then

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.090 align:middle line:84%
it's incumbent upon one
to explore the options

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:84%
that the traditional
conventional model

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.496 align:middle line:90%
is recommending.

00:06:34.496 --> 00:06:39.160 align:middle line:90%


00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, I believe there
are 80,000 chemicals

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.420 align:middle line:84%
or so that have been introduced
in the last 100 years or so.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.540 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the industry
is creating more and more

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.650 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:84%
And really none of them are
highly beneficial for you

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.260 align:middle line:84%
in any amount, but it really
becomes an exposure issue.

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:01.780 align:middle line:84%
So the more exposure you
have to these toxins,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.212 align:middle line:90%
the worse it's going to be.

00:07:03.212 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And there are some that
are particularly potent

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.970 align:middle line:84%
and should be
avoided at all costs.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.730 align:middle line:84%
I believe one of the most
serious ones is mercury.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.090 align:middle line:84%
Really, a drop of mercury in an
Olympic-sized swimming pool is

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:14.097 align:middle line:90%
considered--

00:07:14.097 --> 00:07:16.180 align:middle line:84%
the entire swimming pool
would be considered toxic

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:90%
by OSHA standards.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:90%
So it's quite toxic.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.640 align:middle line:84%
And the typical exposures
that most Americans

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.450 align:middle line:84%
have would be in seafood or in
their silver, which is really

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.790 align:middle line:90%
50% mercury, fillings.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.110 align:middle line:84%
So that's why it's really
important not to have

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.530 align:middle line:90%
those put in to begin with.

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.883 align:middle line:84%
And if you had to
have silver fillings,

00:07:32.883 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:84%
you want to make
sure that they're

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.095 align:middle line:84%
removed but not just willy nilly
by the conventional dentist

00:07:37.095 --> 00:07:39.220 align:middle line:84%
because they don't believe
that there are problems.

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.760 align:middle line:84%
They want to be removed by
an experienced biologically

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.280 align:middle line:84%
trained dentist
that can usually be

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.720 align:middle line:84%
identified in your
local community

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.860 align:middle line:90%
by just asking people--

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:84%
health store,
friends or relatives

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.430 align:middle line:84%
who are involved
in that community,

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:84%
and they can tell you
who the dentist that's

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.720 align:middle line:84%
qualified to take it up and
not cause more problems.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.000 align:middle line:84%
The other toxins that are
pervasive would be fluoride.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.880 align:middle line:84%
And most unfortunately, most of
the water supply in the United

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.320 align:middle line:90%
States is fluoridated.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And so we have this
regular exposure.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:84%
And then most people are
using fluoridated toothpaste,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.100 align:middle line:84%
but they're not eating organic
foods so most of the pesticides

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:90%
are fluoridated.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So you've got these
ongoing exposures

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.830 align:middle line:90%
which can be quite pervasive.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.597 align:middle line:84%
And because it's
a large exposure,

00:08:24.597 --> 00:08:25.930 align:middle line:90%
it can really present a problem.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.200 align:middle line:84%
And I believe it's one of
the primary reasons why

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.018 align:middle line:84%
we have really relatively an
epidemic of hypothyroidism.

00:08:33.018 --> 00:08:37.419 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:43.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, there are a variety of the
toxins that the EPA and the FDA

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.490 align:middle line:90%
are responsible for regulating.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:50.740 align:middle line:84%
And depending on which
ones were discussing,

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:55.780 align:middle line:84%
there are different reasons why
they take the actions they do.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.960 align:middle line:84%
With the issue of
fluoride, it's become

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:03.190 align:middle line:84%
really pushed by
the dental community

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:06.977 align:middle line:84%
as believing that to be safe and
probably some other influences

00:09:06.977 --> 00:09:07.810 align:middle line:90%
in addition to that.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:13.090 align:middle line:84%
But that has really
guided the direction

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.010 align:middle line:84%
of these governmental
regulatory agencies.

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Although recently, I
believe the CDC came out

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:22.690 align:middle line:84%
with a recommendation to reduce
the lower level of fluoridation

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.340 align:middle line:84%
of the American
water supplies, which

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.370 align:middle line:84%
was a definite step in
the right direction.

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.450 align:middle line:84%
But there tends to be a
revolving door between most

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:35.740 align:middle line:84%
industries and the governmental
regulatory authorities

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.500 align:middle line:84%
so that if a person is
hired in the government,

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.260 align:middle line:84%
they may receive a job
in the very industry

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.920 align:middle line:84%
that they were responsible for
regulating prior to shifting.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.630 align:middle line:90%
Or the converse is true also.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
So this intermingling of
the government and industry

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.890 align:middle line:84%
really plays a very significant
role, because it's just

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.100 align:middle line:84%
a massive conflict of
interest and really

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.850 align:middle line:84%
doesn't serve the
public health very well.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:03.230 align:middle line:90%


00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.420 align:middle line:84%
The issue of food cravings
is relatively complex.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.340 align:middle line:84%
There is obviously
behavioral components,

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.900 align:middle line:84%
but there's also very
clever science behind this.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:14.272 align:middle line:84%
The food industry is
multi billions-- tens

00:10:14.272 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:90%
of billions of dollars.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.800 align:middle line:84%
And they have the wherewithal
and the science resources

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.050 align:middle line:84%
to really identify very
carefully what appeals

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:90%
to the average consumer.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that,
they can use these chemical

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.550 align:middle line:84%
derivatives to create these
concoctions which really

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:36.080 align:middle line:84%
taste quite good and can have
an addictive component-- not

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.910 align:middle line:90%
necessarily, but can.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.450 align:middle line:84%
And in addition to
that, tasting good,

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:84%
because of the way that
the food is mass produced,

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:84%
they can actually offer it at
a relatively low price which,

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.230 align:middle line:84%
of course, is a significant
issue for many people,

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.313 align:middle line:90%
especially in our economy.

00:10:50.313 --> 00:10:53.780 align:middle line:84%
So that combination of low cost
and appealing is a big issue.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:84%
But then one of the other ones
is, as I mentioned earlier,

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.480 align:middle line:84%
the number one source of
calories in the United States

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.560 align:middle line:90%
is fructose.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.630 align:middle line:84%
And fructose is
highly addictive.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.800 align:middle line:90%
So it's very inexpensive.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:09.710 align:middle line:84%
In the '70s, Japanese scientists
develop the technology

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:13.970 align:middle line:84%
to separate fructose from
corn, thus radically reducing

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.820 align:middle line:84%
the cost of this
high fructose corn

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.380 align:middle line:84%
syrup relative to
traditional forms of sugar.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.810 align:middle line:84%
So in many ways, fructose
isn't that much worse

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:30.480 align:middle line:84%
than regular sugar, but
because it's so less expensive,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.100 align:middle line:84%
it's more widely used, and
larger quantities of it

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.840 align:middle line:84%
wind up in the food
supply so that you're

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.690 align:middle line:90%
getting exposed to more of it.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.930 align:middle line:84%
In the 1900s, the average
person was exposed

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:43.460 align:middle line:90%
to about 15 grams of fructose.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And fructose-- another term
for that is fruit sugar.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's why
most fruits are sweet.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.600 align:middle line:84%
And fructose, in small
amounts, 15, 25 grams,

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.160 align:middle line:84%
which is less than
an ounce a day,

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:84%
is probably OK
and healthy if you

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.020 align:middle line:90%
don't have insulin resistance.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:06.080 align:middle line:84%
But the average person is
consuming 70 to 80 grams a day.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.330 align:middle line:84%
And there are many kids,
primarily teenagers,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.180 align:middle line:84%
who are taking 120, 150
grams of fructose a day,

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.700 align:middle line:84%
literally 10 times
the amount that they

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.360 align:middle line:90%
were taking a century ago.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.620 align:middle line:84%
So when you abuse
that type of sugar

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.600 align:middle line:84%
and you have that
exposure, it has

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.850 align:middle line:84%
very severe metabolic
consequences

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:84%
that can lead to these addictive
processes and change brain

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:31.310 align:middle line:84%
chemistry and really make
it very difficult to get out

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:33.830 align:middle line:84%
of this cycle where you
have these food cravings

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.450 align:middle line:84%
and really addicted
to food that's

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.700 align:middle line:90%
not going to make you healthy.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:42.120 align:middle line:90%


00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's common when
you go to a food court,

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:47.420 align:middle line:84%
and you see a whole variety of
food options-- and many of them

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.555 align:middle line:84%
can actually be healthy,
but most of course are not.

00:12:50.555 --> 00:12:52.010 align:middle line:90%
They're these processed foods.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:12:54.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's really quite surprising
to see people routinely

00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:56.510 align:middle line:90%
make these unhealthy choices.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.130 align:middle line:90%
And so the question is, why?

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:01.250 align:middle line:84%
And I believe, though there's
a number of factors that

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.400 align:middle line:84%
contribute to it, but in
many cases it's just a habit

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:10.100 align:middle line:84%
and a lack of awareness, because
a typical person doesn't really

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.060 align:middle line:84%
understand the profound
connection between the food

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.770 align:middle line:84%
they eat-- even though it's
relatively simple and it seems

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.707 align:middle line:90%
so basic--

00:13:16.707 --> 00:13:18.290 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
understand that there's

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.600 align:middle line:84%
a consequence of
choosing processed

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.820 align:middle line:84%
foods over a long period of time
that will have negative health

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:90%
consequences.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.912 align:middle line:90%
And they don't understand that.

00:13:25.912 --> 00:13:30.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's really an
issue of ignorance.

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.340 align:middle line:90%
And the other food--

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.648 align:middle line:84%
the processed food actually
taste good, so they taste good,

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.190 align:middle line:84%
it's relatively
inexpensive, and they

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.310 align:middle line:84%
have this habit and this
ignorance or lack of awareness

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.072 align:middle line:84%
of the connection between
the consequences of making

00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:44.780 align:middle line:84%
those choices over a
long period of time.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Because processed food--

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, 90% of the money
that Americans spend on food

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.638 align:middle line:90%
is for processed food--

00:13:49.638 --> 00:13:51.650 align:middle line:90%
90%.

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:56.150 align:middle line:84%
And processed food is
OK to have occasionally.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Maybe 5% or 10% of your
diet can be processed food.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.540 align:middle line:84%
But if you've got it mixed
up and it's 90% of your diet,

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.240 align:middle line:84%
there is just no
question there are

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.750 align:middle line:84%
going to be consequences to pay
for making that type of choice.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:18.610 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's interesting
that there has been a trend

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.250 align:middle line:84%
to use a healthy
alternative to sugar,

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.000 align:middle line:84%
because most people
believe and understand--

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000 align:middle line:90%
it's not rocket science.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.040 align:middle line:84%
They know sugar is not
good for-- yes, they'll

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.500 align:middle line:84%
choose to eat it
because it tastes good

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.625 align:middle line:84%
and it's not that expensive,
but really tastes good

00:14:30.625 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:90%
and they get this vicious cycle.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.100 align:middle line:84%
But they seek to make
a healthy choice,

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.580 align:middle line:84%
and the food industry
cooperates by providing them

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.630 align:middle line:84%
artificial sweeteners
with no calories.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:84%
So what is the danger
of making that choice?

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Well, I actually wrote a book
on that, "Sweet Deception,"

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.040 align:middle line:84%
and studied this for
a number of years

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.360 align:middle line:90%
and looked at the literature.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:84%
But before I wrote the book,
I wasn't aware of which

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.100 align:middle line:90%
choice was worse--

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.785 align:middle line:84%
either artificial
sweeteners or sugar--

00:14:58.785 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
and after doing
the research, I'm

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.118 align:middle line:84%
absolutely convinced that
artificial sweeteners

00:15:02.118 --> 00:15:03.340 align:middle line:90%
are far more serious.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number of them
on the market, of course.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:09.940 align:middle line:84%
And they have
different toxicities.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.810 align:middle line:84%
But probably the worst is
NutraSweet or aspartame,

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:13.610 align:middle line:90%
or Equal.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:90%
They're all the same.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:16.675 align:middle line:84%
So two are brand names and
one is the generic name.

00:15:16.675 --> 00:15:19.930 align:middle line:84%
And NutraSweet is
actually a dipeptide,

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:22.870 align:middle line:84%
which means there are two
amino acids linked together.

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's marketed
as being natural.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Well, those are natural,
but they were never

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.850 align:middle line:84%
designed to be linked
together like that

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.280 align:middle line:90%
and in taken such large amounts.

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And they actually are
connected with what's

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.410 align:middle line:90%
called an ester bond.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And when this ester
bond breaks apart,

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.610 align:middle line:84%
one of the byproducts
is formaldehyde--

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:84%
actually, methanol, which is
transported past the blood

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.460 align:middle line:84%
brain barrier and goes
into the brain and

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:90%
turns to formaldehyde.

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.860 align:middle line:90%
So it's very, very toxic.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably one of
its largest toxicities,

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.417 align:middle line:84%
and it can contribute to tumors
and seizures and migraines

00:16:01.417 --> 00:16:03.250 align:middle line:84%
and headaches and a
whole variety of others.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.270 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that
side effects reported

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:12.220 align:middle line:84%
to the FDA or any other
governmental agency that's

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.660 align:middle line:84%
responsible for collecting
this data are literally

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
orders of magnitude higher
than almost all the other food

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:20.810 align:middle line:90%
sources put together.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.360 align:middle line:90%
So it's a significant issue.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
like most reports,

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.478 align:middle line:84%
including vaccines,
what's actually reported

00:16:28.478 --> 00:16:29.770 align:middle line:90%
is just the tip of the iceberg.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.260 align:middle line:84%
It's probably well less
than 10%, probably under 1%.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.050 align:middle line:90%
So it's a significant issue.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:84%
But getting back to those
other amino acids that

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:84%
are supposedly natural,
even when they break down,

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.850 align:middle line:84%
they are there in far
larger concentrations

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.380 align:middle line:84%
than you would normally receive
by eating that in a food.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.090 align:middle line:84%
So as a result, these ratios,
which are so important,

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.020 align:middle line:90%
become disturbed.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.290 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Aspartame also has two
amino acids linked together.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And when that's
digested in the body,

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:01.210 align:middle line:84%
then they're broken down
into two separate ones.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.610 align:middle line:84%
And the problem with that
is that these are typically

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.579 align:middle line:84%
in much larger concentrations
than you typically

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.589 align:middle line:90%
would receive from eating food.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So these ratios become
really disturbed.

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:16.315 align:middle line:84%
And one of the amino
acids is aspartic acid.

00:17:16.315 --> 00:17:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And that actually has been shown
to be an excitive toxin, which

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.232 align:middle line:90%
has its own intrinsic problems.

00:17:20.232 --> 00:17:22.000 align:middle line:84%
But then the other
one is phenylalanine,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.623 align:middle line:84%
which is a precursor
to some really

00:17:23.623 --> 00:17:24.790 align:middle line:90%
important neurotransmitters.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And you develop imbalances
in serotonin in the brain.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:84%
As a result of that, it
can be a real challenge.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting
too, if you look

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:37.650 align:middle line:84%
at the studies that examined
the approval or actually

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.180 align:middle line:84%
the toxicity of
aspartame, I think

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:45.190 align:middle line:84%
this was done by Dr. Frank
Walton about 15, 20 years ago

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:middle line:90%
or so.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And it just is a
classic illustration

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.620 align:middle line:84%
of this massive
conflict of interest.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:55.240 align:middle line:84%
Of the approximately
90 says that were done

00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:00.100 align:middle line:84%
that showed that there was no
side effects from aspartame,

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.500 align:middle line:84%
over 90% of those were
funded by industry.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:05.230 align:middle line:84%
And you have almost the
same number of other studies

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.220 align:middle line:84%
that were independently funded
finding the exact reverse--

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.330 align:middle line:84%
90% of them showing
problems with it.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately when a food
additive like aspartame or any

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.550 align:middle line:84%
artificial sweetener is
manufactured-- or Splenda--

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:25.030 align:middle line:84%
the process of getting
approval is really

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
that the manufacturer or
the company that's making it

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.760 align:middle line:84%
is the one that
funds the studies.

00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:84%
And those are the
studies that are

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.230 align:middle line:84%
submitted to the regulatory
agency to provide approval.

00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:39.220 align:middle line:84%
So it's not this
independent, third party,

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:84%
objective evaluation
that's being done,

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.970 align:middle line:90%
like most people's impression.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:44.530 align:middle line:84%
I think most people
believe the FDA actually

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.488 align:middle line:84%
has their own scientists
that do this analysis,

00:18:46.488 --> 00:18:49.020 align:middle line:84%
but nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.700 align:middle line:84%
It basically
evaluates the studies

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.990 align:middle line:84%
that the industry
submits that they funded,

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.450 align:middle line:84%
which, of course, is just
fraught with massive conflict

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.396 align:middle line:90%
of interests.

00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:03.662 align:middle line:90%


00:19:03.662 --> 00:19:05.870 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] a number of
people in the past who've had

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:07.540 align:middle line:84%
challenges with this,
and some of them

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.380 align:middle line:84%
my own personal
relatives-- my own sister

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.053 align:middle line:84%
has migraines when she
takes any food that has

00:19:12.053 --> 00:19:13.220 align:middle line:90%
artificial sweeteners in it.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.750 align:middle line:84%
She normally avoids it,
but sometimes it's hidden

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.210 align:middle line:84%
and it's not really
labeled well.

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, interestingly,
if you look

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.690 align:middle line:84%
at the new approach in marketing
for these bottled waters

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:25.130 align:middle line:90%
or flavored waters.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And they taste
great-- and you wonder

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:84%
why does it-- how could
it possibly taste so good?

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:33.590 align:middle line:84%
And if you read in fine
2 to 4 point print that

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:84%
is very difficult to see
because it's basically

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
dark font on dark
background, there's

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:45.002 align:middle line:84%
artificial sweeteners in there,
like Splenda or sucralose.

00:19:45.002 --> 00:19:46.460 align:middle line:84%
So they don't
advertise it as such,

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.002 align:middle line:84%
and it's really
hidden in many cases.

00:19:48.002 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
So migraines can be a common
one-- visual disturbances,

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.900 align:middle line:90%
headaches.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:56.720 align:middle line:84%
These are all potential
complications--

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and seizures in
more serious cases--

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.730 align:middle line:90%
visual dysfunctions.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.460 align:middle line:84%
Actually, most pilots
are aware that they

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.920 align:middle line:84%
can't drink diet sodas
because it's well recognized

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.700 align:middle line:84%
within the pilot association
that you just don't drink this

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.175 align:middle line:84%
because it can really
cause severe aberrations

00:20:13.175 --> 00:20:14.960 align:middle line:84%
in your vision that
would potentially

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.430 align:middle line:84%
lead to the problems
with your flying.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:19.970 align:middle line:90%
And there's a whole list of--

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:22.170 align:middle line:84%
there's literally hundreds
of different symptoms.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.770 align:middle line:84%
So it's easy to look
them up on the internet

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.420 align:middle line:90%
and find out if it is.

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:30.200 align:middle line:84%
But really there's no reason
ever to be drinking diet soda.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:90%
There's just none.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
And just want to make a
distinction here that sometimes

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.590 align:middle line:84%
people who haven't studied
this carefully throw stevia

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.390 align:middle line:84%
into the basket with
artificial sweeteners.

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.370 align:middle line:84%
And nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:44.490 align:middle line:90%
Stevia is a plant.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:45.290 align:middle line:90%
It's an herb.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:47.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a medicinal herb
that's raised primarily

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.890 align:middle line:90%
in South America.

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:49.400 align:middle line:90%
That what's its origins from.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:84%
It's been around
for 1,500 years.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.310 align:middle line:90%
And it's very sweet.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:55.280 align:middle line:84%
You can grow this plant in
your backyard or in your home.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.850 align:middle line:90%
And you can chew the raw leaves.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:20:58.142 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see it's very sweet.

00:20:58.142 --> 00:21:00.740 align:middle line:84%
So that is typically
a better alternative.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:03.228 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't like
the aftertaste it has,

00:21:03.228 --> 00:21:05.520 align:middle line:84%
but that may be a reflection
of the way it's processed.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So some of the
newer ones, they're

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.900 align:middle line:84%
used as a liquid
stevia and actually

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.015 align:middle line:84%
of other flavors like
the French vanilla

00:21:11.015 --> 00:21:13.250 align:middle line:84%
or English toffee that
actually are quite good

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and can be a much better
alternative to sugar and then

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.902 align:middle line:90%
certainly artificial sweeteners.

00:21:20.902 --> 00:21:25.240 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:27.130 align:middle line:84%
Hormone by definition
is a chemical.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.650 align:middle line:84%
Typically, a hormone is
secreted by gland in your body.

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:84%
And it then is transported
in the bloodstream

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:84%
to have an effect distantly
or somewhere else in the body.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's the strict
definition of a hormone.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:42.970 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number of them,
but the two primary ones

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.470 align:middle line:84%
that most people
are concerned about

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:49.210 align:middle line:84%
are your adrenal hormones,
your sex hormones, estrogen,

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:84%
and then, of course,
thyroid hormones.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.190 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
primary ones that

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:90%
tend to have health challenges.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And the adrenal
hormones tend to be

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.870 align:middle line:84%
the most complex with respect to
understanding them and balance.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time, in
my experience, dysfunctions

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:84%
or disturbance into your
hormones are related to stress.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So processes and therapies
that are addressing

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:17.660 align:middle line:84%
balancing that, such as
emotional freedom technique

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:20.200 align:middle line:84%
or other energy
psychology tools,

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.660 align:middle line:84%
or meditation or
prayer or exercise--

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:27.790 align:middle line:84%
these can all be useful tools to
help moderate adrenal stresses.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:30.340 align:middle line:84%
The problem with the adrenals
and why they're so essential

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.300 align:middle line:84%
is that once those are
imbalanced or unbalanced,

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.750 align:middle line:84%
that has consequences to the
other hormones, specifically

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:39.080 align:middle line:90%
the sex hormones.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So rather than trying to be
a biochemist or pharmacist

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and try to individually treat
an incorrect or low or high

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:52.600 align:middle line:84%
hormone level, you really want
to balance the whole system

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.910 align:middle line:90%
naturally if you can.

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:57.700 align:middle line:84%
But one of the other
hormones that tends to be low

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:90%
is thyroid hormone.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:01.870 align:middle line:84%
And it's really almost an
epidemic, especially in women.

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is related to
two primary reasons.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.070 align:middle line:84%
One is that we have a
massive unnecessary exposure

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:07.870 align:middle line:90%
of fluoride.

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:11.380 align:middle line:84%
And fluoride is a
toxin to the thyroid.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Fluoride actually
displaces iodide.

00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And iodine is part
of thyroid hormone.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.738 align:middle line:84%
Typically, there's three or
four molecules of iodine there.

00:23:20.738 --> 00:23:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And when you're having
large amounts of fluoride,

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.863 align:middle line:84%
the fluoride actually goes
into the thyroid gland,

00:23:24.863 --> 00:23:26.807 align:middle line:84%
displaces the ioidine,
so you have a fluoride

00:23:26.807 --> 00:23:28.390 align:middle line:84%
molecule instead of
iodide, and that's

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:30.520 align:middle line:90%
not active and doesn't work.

00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's one of
the reasons why.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:36.640 align:middle line:84%
And then also soy is perceived
by many to be a health food

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.820 align:middle line:84%
and actually has
chemicals in there,

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.400 align:middle line:84%
like isoflavones and
hormones, which are

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.410 align:middle line:90%
basically toxic to the thyroid.

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So people who have high
amounts of soy in their diet--

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.280 align:middle line:84%
specifically soy milk tends to
be one of the worse because you

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.190 align:middle line:84%
can just get large amounts
of these proteins--

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:57.645 align:middle line:84%
that they can have a consequence
and have reduced thyroid

00:23:57.645 --> 00:23:58.770 align:middle line:90%
function as a result of it.

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.540 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhat of a challenge
to recover from that

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.150 align:middle line:84%
without having to go
on thyroid hormones.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:07.450 align:middle line:84%
And actually treating
thyroid dysfunction

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:09.850 align:middle line:84%
is a whole science in
itself and really could

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.020 align:middle line:84%
be the topic of the
whole documentary.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And one of the last ones
would be the female hormones,

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.780 align:middle line:84%
sex hormones, primarily
estrogen and progesterone.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
And then for men,
testosterone and DHEA.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.158 align:middle line:84%
Although men and
women have levels

00:24:27.158 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:84%
of all of those in
their system, of course,

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.242 align:middle line:84%
the women have higher levels
of estrogen, progesterone,

00:24:31.242 --> 00:24:32.970 align:middle line:90%
and men testosterone and DHEA.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:37.140 align:middle line:84%
So in my experience, most
women who are ideally healthy

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.750 align:middle line:84%
will tend to have lower
levels of progesterone

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.600 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes will benefit
from some progesterone

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.710 align:middle line:90%
supplementation.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:90%
And men tends to be DHA.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.860 align:middle line:90%
So those can be--

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.660 align:middle line:84%
frequently, many
people find benefit

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:55.080 align:middle line:84%
from augmenting them or
taking supplemental forms.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.890 align:middle line:84%
The problem becomes
on how you administer

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:00.100 align:middle line:90%
those supplemental hormones.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And it took me quite
a while in a process

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.380 align:middle line:84%
to go through to understand that
most people are administering

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.400 align:middle line:90%
hormones incorrectly.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.660 align:middle line:84%
This is related to the fact
that most hormones are given

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.030 align:middle line:90%
are given orally or swallowed.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:20.450 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, they don't
work that way in your body.

00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:23.330 align:middle line:84%
When you swallow a hormone,
you have to break it down

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.870 align:middle line:84%
and your liver metabolizes
it, and it makes byproducts,

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:31.360 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps 75% to 80% of it has
not gone into your bloodstream.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.860 align:middle line:84%
So as a result of that, you
have to take much higher levels.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.277 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
have side effects

00:25:35.277 --> 00:25:38.303 align:middle line:84%
from the metabolites
of the hormone.

00:25:38.303 --> 00:25:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So you really shouldn't
swallow oral hormones.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.850 align:middle line:90%
It's not a good idea.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:42.840 align:middle line:90%
So don't do that.

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.012 align:middle line:84%
Now, then some
people think, well,

00:25:45.012 --> 00:25:46.970 align:middle line:84%
then I could take a
sublingual, because there's

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.877 align:middle line:84%
capillaries under your tongue
and that may transfer directly

00:25:49.877 --> 00:25:50.710 align:middle line:90%
to your bloodstream.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:53.630 align:middle line:84%
And though some of it does, the
problem with sublingual drops

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:84%
is that, frequently,
many people swallow them.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.670 align:middle line:84%
So then you have the same issue
of swallowing and hormones.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, then you have-- then
let's rub it on your skin.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.153 align:middle line:84%
And especially a lot of
naturally oriented physicians

00:26:04.153 --> 00:26:05.070 align:middle line:90%
are recommending this.

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:10.140 align:middle line:84%
And that works initially, but
then most places on the skin,

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.508 align:middle line:84%
they have fat, and then it tends
to build up in your system.

00:26:13.508 --> 00:26:15.050 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
that works initially

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.810 align:middle line:84%
but then it tends to
stop working over time.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:20.960 align:middle line:84%
So I actually abandoned the use
of supplement hormone therapy

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.870 align:middle line:84%
until I reconnect with Dr.
Jonathan Wright, who is really

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:26.570 align:middle line:84%
one of the pioneers in hormone
therapy in the United States.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.460 align:middle line:84%
He's really the
physician who brought it

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:29.780 align:middle line:90%
into the United States.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.050 align:middle line:84%
So what Dr. Wright
noticed after his years

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.090 align:middle line:90%
of clinical observation was--

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:84%
and figured out that if you
apply the hormone topically,

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.250 align:middle line:84%
but apply it to
mucosal surfaces,

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.663 align:middle line:84%
then you don't have this issue
with the fat penetration,

00:26:45.663 --> 00:26:47.580 align:middle line:84%
and it tends to go right
into the bloodstream.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:84%
So the mucosal
surfaces would be,

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.510 align:middle line:84%
in women, the vaginal
area, the vaginal mucosa,

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.610 align:middle line:84%
or in women and men,
the rectum mucosa.

00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:58.723 align:middle line:84%
So administering
hormones there, if you're

00:26:58.723 --> 00:27:00.140 align:middle line:84%
going to use that
form of therapy,

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.515 align:middle line:84%
would be the wise
way-- if you're

00:27:01.515 --> 00:27:04.100 align:middle line:84%
using sex hormones, like
progesterone, estrogen, DHEA,

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:05.780 align:middle line:90%
or testosterone.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.612 align:middle line:84%
If you're taking thyroid
hormone, that of course

00:27:08.612 --> 00:27:10.070 align:middle line:84%
can be swallowed
because that's not

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:90%
a problem with thyroid hormone.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.040 align:middle line:84%
It's a different
type of molecule.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:17.360 align:middle line:90%


00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.330 align:middle line:84%
There is a common myth
that's been perpetuated

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:24.750 align:middle line:84%
by the media and most nearly
every single dermatologist

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.860 align:middle line:84%
in the United States and
probably the world who

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.260 align:middle line:84%
is advocating avoiding sun
because it's dangerous.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:34.362 align:middle line:84%
And they create this massive
fear that exposing the skin

00:27:34.362 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:90%
is going to cause two things.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.000 align:middle line:84%
One, increase your risk of
cancer, which is not true.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And then second, it will
increase photoaging,

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:44.090 align:middle line:84%
which can be true, but you
have to use exposure sun

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.300 align:middle line:90%
with caution.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.520 align:middle line:84%
So with respect to
cancer, it actually

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:51.110 align:middle line:90%
decreases the risk of cancer.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.550 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly, when the
epidemiologists, the scientists

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.610 align:middle line:84%
who study that process of
disease and the risk factors,

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.470 align:middle line:84%
look at this and analyze
it very carefully,

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:84%
they find that if
people had been exposed

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.780 align:middle line:84%
to optimal amounts of
sunshine, the rate of cancer

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:90%
would drop by nearly 50%.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.730 align:middle line:84%
So we're talking hundreds
of thousands of people

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.730 align:middle line:84%
every year not die from
cancer because they

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:18.200 align:middle line:90%
don't have enough vitamin D.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.322 align:middle line:84%
So what are the
risks, the downside?

00:28:20.322 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, the downside is
you may have an increased

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.550 align:middle line:84%
risk of basal cell
carcinoma, which

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:27.980 align:middle line:84%
is an easily
excised cancer, just

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.460 align:middle line:84%
for the most part cosmetic,
and it is not really dangerous.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:33.868 align:middle line:84%
But for the most part,
actually the newer studies

00:28:33.868 --> 00:28:36.410 align:middle line:84%
show that it decreases the risk
of the dangerous cancer which

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:37.743 align:middle line:90%
can kill you, which is melanoma.

00:28:37.743 --> 00:28:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So it actually lowers
it by somewhat primarily

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.240 align:middle line:84%
because it raises
your vitamin D levels.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.490 align:middle line:84%
But all of us want to
look healthy and good

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.290 align:middle line:90%
when we're older.

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be
conscious of photoaging.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.810 align:middle line:84%
And what you can do
is really there's--

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:58.070 align:middle line:84%
the ideal way to optimize
your vitamin D levels

00:28:58.070 --> 00:28:59.990 align:middle line:84%
is exposing as much
of your skin as is

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.820 align:middle line:90%
legally possible to the sun.

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And so if you're
going out to sun

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.710 align:middle line:84%
like I am right now, and
really the only things that

00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:13.070 align:middle line:84%
are exposed are my
hands and my head,

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
get much vitamin D.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.600 align:middle line:84%
So you really need to
take your shirt off

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.720 align:middle line:84%
and wear shorts and really
have a significant exposure.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.040 align:middle line:90%
So that's a big issue.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:27.920 align:middle line:84%
But typically, there's
not a big reason

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.460 align:middle line:84%
to have a lot of sun
shining down in your face,

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.620 align:middle line:84%
because it's a relatively
small surface area.

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.690 align:middle line:84%
And the skin is
relatively thin, so it's

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.300 align:middle line:84%
particularly vulnerable
to photo-oxidative damage.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So what I recommend
is to wear a hat.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.220 align:middle line:84%
I typically always wear
a hat when I'm out.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:45.050 align:middle line:90%
My face is in the shade.

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:47.498 align:middle line:84%
I don't have direct
sunlight most of the time.

00:29:47.498 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:84%
And if you're
particularly concerned,

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.020 align:middle line:84%
or you're fair complexion,
you blonde or blue eyes,

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.610 align:middle line:84%
or you tend to
sunburn real easily,

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:55.520 align:middle line:84%
then you might want to put some
safe sunscreen around there

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:56.978 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
you don't get it.

00:29:56.978 --> 00:29:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Because you have to understand
that when you use sunscreen

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:03.440 align:middle line:84%
on the rest of your body, it
eliminates your body's ability

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.390 align:middle line:84%
to make vitamin D. You won't
get burned if it's applied

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:10.190 align:middle line:84%
properly, but you won't get
any vitamin D. It blocks

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.400 align:middle line:84%
the very rays, the ultraviolet
B radiation, that causes

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.980 align:middle line:84%
your body to make vitamin D.
So if you're not going to get

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.647 align:middle line:84%
burnt or you're not
going to get tanned,

00:30:17.647 --> 00:30:22.918 align:middle line:84%
you're not going
to get vitamin D.

00:30:22.918 --> 00:30:24.710 align:middle line:84%
There's a major challenge
for most everyone

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:26.293 align:middle line:84%
to know what their
vitamin D level is.

00:30:26.293 --> 00:30:28.626 align:middle line:84%
It's somewhat like high blood
pressure in that we really

00:30:28.626 --> 00:30:30.751 align:middle line:84%
don't know we have high
blood pressure for the most

00:30:30.751 --> 00:30:31.878 align:middle line:90%
part unless you measure it.

00:30:31.878 --> 00:30:33.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, similarly, we don't
know that our vitamin D

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.820 align:middle line:90%
levels are fine.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you have
a deep healthy tan

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.120 align:middle line:84%
like I happen to do
right now, there's

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.270 align:middle line:90%
absolutely no reason to measure.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:41.645 align:middle line:84%
You can be guaranteed that
your vitamin D levels are just

00:30:41.645 --> 00:30:42.800 align:middle line:90%
about near perfect.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.330 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not,
and you and you

00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:46.612 align:middle line:84%
know you don't have relative
exposure to the sun,

00:30:46.612 --> 00:30:48.320 align:middle line:84%
then you really don't
have another option

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.028 align:middle line:84%
unless you're going
to use a safe tanning

00:30:50.028 --> 00:30:52.610 align:middle line:84%
bed, which is I think
better than swallowing it.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:55.130 align:middle line:84%
But it's not either
convenient or cost effective

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:56.400 align:middle line:90%
for many to do that.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.240 align:middle line:84%
So the only way you're going
to know if you have vitamin D

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.270 align:middle line:90%
is to measure it.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.450 align:middle line:90%
That's the only way we know how.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.807 align:middle line:84%
Now, typically the
adult dose is--

00:31:05.807 --> 00:31:07.640 align:middle line:84%
most people who take
vitamin D think they're

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.920 align:middle line:84%
taking a lot at 1,000 or
2,000, but that's still

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.390 align:middle line:90%
seriously deficient.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:15.830 align:middle line:84%
The RDA is still only 400 to
800 depending on whose numbers

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:16.700 align:middle line:90%
you're looking at.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:19.370 align:middle line:90%
But we really need--

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:23.360 align:middle line:84%
most adults need
about 5,000 to 6,000--

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.450 align:middle line:84%
I would say probably closer
to 6,000 to 8,000 units a day,

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.500 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.430 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just break down
about 4,000 units every day.

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:32.180 align:middle line:84%
And most people don't
understand that when

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.830 align:middle line:84%
you are having enough skin
exposed to healthy sunshine,

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:middle line:84%
you can make up to
20,000 units in a day.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's not like it's toxic.

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And there's this fear that's
been created that they're going

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:44.970 align:middle line:90%
to have vitamin D toxicity.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:47.030 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:48.872 align:middle line:90%
Most people, I would say--

00:31:48.872 --> 00:31:50.330 align:middle line:84%
when we look at
the numbers, and it

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:51.830 align:middle line:84%
depends on which
ranges you're using

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.600 align:middle line:84%
because the typical
reference ranges

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.390 align:middle line:84%
that are used to
evaluate Vitamin D levels

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:57.470 align:middle line:90%
are antiquated.

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:58.580 align:middle line:90%
They're outdated.

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.580 align:middle line:84%
And they really were designed
to prevent rickets, which is--

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.310 align:middle line:84%
you need the least amount of
vitamin D to prevent rickets.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you're looking to
use vitamin D therapeutically

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:10.460 align:middle line:84%
to optimize health
to prevent cancer,

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.430 align:middle line:84%
to prevent heart
disease, to optimize

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.130 align:middle line:84%
the 2,000 to 3,000
genes that it regulates,

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.050 align:middle line:84%
then you're going to
need levels in excess

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.390 align:middle line:90%
of 50 nanograms per milliliter.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.335 align:middle line:84%
And that is, if you're
watching this in Australia

00:32:23.335 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:84%
or some other
European countries,

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:29.970 align:middle line:84%
you'd multiply by 2.5 to
get the nano moles per liter

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.690 align:middle line:90%
I think it's called.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:34.850 align:middle line:84%
So at least 50 and
probably up to 80.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I like to keep mine
between 60 and 70.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.360 align:middle line:90%
I think it's a healthy range.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And when I personally am exposed
to large amounts of sunshine,

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:50.000 align:middle line:84%
my numbers typically
go close to 100.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.500 align:middle line:84%
We know that the
food that you eat

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.848 align:middle line:84%
has an enormous
influence on your health.

00:32:53.848 --> 00:32:56.390 align:middle line:84%
So it becomes really important
to be conscious of what you're

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.600 align:middle line:84%
eating and to look at the
variables or the factors that

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:02.090 align:middle line:84%
contribute to making
healthy choices.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And many of us have been
exposed to childhood influences

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.130 align:middle line:84%
and parents that
really give us comfort

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.340 align:middle line:84%
for certain types
of food behaviors.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.930 align:middle line:84%
So if you find that you're
one of those individuals who

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:18.470 align:middle line:84%
have behaviors that are not
healthy that may be related

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:22.262 align:middle line:84%
to these types of
influences, then there

00:33:22.262 --> 00:33:23.720 align:middle line:84%
are a number of
strategies that you

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.595 align:middle line:84%
can use that have been
found to be effective.

00:33:25.595 --> 00:33:27.260 align:middle line:84%
And I find that energy
psychology tools

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:84%
are some of the most effective
ones that you can use.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:33.050 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most common
ones is a technique called EFT,

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:35.520 align:middle line:84%
or Emotional Freedom
Technique for short,

00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:38.930 align:middle line:84%
which is a simple tapping on
acupuncture meridians done

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:43.398 align:middle line:84%
with skilled questions and
typically by someone else.

00:33:43.398 --> 00:33:45.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can use these
techniques on yourself,

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:47.255 align:middle line:84%
but they're not
nearly as effective

00:33:47.255 --> 00:33:49.130 align:middle line:84%
as working with someone
who's trained in this

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and really has helped many
others and is skilled.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:56.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very powerful
and profoundly effective,

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.960 align:middle line:90%
nearly magical technique.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So that is something that
certainly can be used.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.280 align:middle line:90%
And there's no side effects.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.290 align:middle line:84%
There's no harm or damage that
can come as a result of it.

00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:05.330 align:middle line:84%
So the worst that would
be is it didn't work.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:09.239 align:middle line:84%
But it has a great potential to
affect some of these behaviors.

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:12.770 align:middle line:84%
But interestingly, one of
the most powerful choices

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:14.420 align:middle line:84%
that you can make
is the commitment

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:16.699 align:middle line:84%
to have the discipline
and make the decision

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:19.460 align:middle line:84%
to avoid these unhealthy foods,
primarily sugar and processed

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.260 align:middle line:90%
foods.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.219 align:middle line:84%
But once you get them out of
your diet for two, three weeks,

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:26.690 align:middle line:84%
especially after 21 days, your
body tends to self regulate

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:29.040 align:middle line:84%
and you tend not to
want them as much.

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So if you can just do whatever
it takes for those three weeks

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:37.248 align:middle line:84%
to get over the hump, so to
speak, and start to experience

00:34:37.248 --> 00:34:39.040 align:middle line:84%
some of the benefits,
because unfortunately

00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.070 align:middle line:84%
during those three
weeks, you may

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.237 align:middle line:90%
go through some withdrawals.

00:34:41.237 --> 00:34:42.489 align:middle line:90%
It may not feel that great.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.960 align:middle line:84%
And understanding that it
could happen beforehand

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.560 align:middle line:90%
will help you get through it.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.170 align:middle line:84%
But once you do that and you
reach the three week period,

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:49.628 align:middle line:84%
usually you're
feeling a lot better

00:34:49.628 --> 00:34:51.739 align:middle line:84%
because you're replacing
those unhealthy foods

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:54.230 align:middle line:84%
with healthy foods, giving
you vitality, energy that you

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:55.730 align:middle line:84%
probably haven't
had for a long time

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and getting rid of a
lot of the symptoms

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:01.332 align:middle line:84%
that you may not have been aware
were related to the poor food

00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:02.540 align:middle line:90%
choices that you were making.

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.120 align:middle line:84%
So that really is
a powerful strategy

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.880 align:middle line:84%
that one can implement if
they're seeking to get healthy.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:12.260 align:middle line:90%


00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.060 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:17.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a series of strategies
that has really collectively

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:84%
been called energy psychology
and typically developed

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.272 align:middle line:90%
by psychologists.

00:35:22.272 --> 00:35:24.730 align:middle line:84%
And my understand is there's
about 10,000 psychologists who

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.397 align:middle line:84%
are actively employing
these techniques.

00:35:26.397 --> 00:35:28.850 align:middle line:84%
And they have regular annual
conferences and [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.700 align:middle line:84%
and are constantly
evolving them.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.000 align:middle line:84%
One of the most popular ones
is Emotional Freedom Technique,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.650 align:middle line:90%
or EFT for short.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:38.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's a process
where one does

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:42.550 align:middle line:84%
tapping on acupuncture
meridians concurrently while one

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:46.570 align:middle line:84%
is saying something
that's actually triggering

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:51.880 align:middle line:84%
the neurological pathways that
is contributing to the issue

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.170 align:middle line:90%
that one wants to treat.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So typically when one is really
involved in that emotion,

00:35:57.610 --> 00:36:01.280 align:middle line:84%
that is probably the ideal
time to do this process.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.475 align:middle line:84%
But it can be
radically effective.

00:36:03.475 --> 00:36:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's just no question,
no doubt in my mind--

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:09.160 align:middle line:84%
I've been practicing medicine
for over three decades.

00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And the most dramatic,
impressive, literally miracle

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:16.060 align:middle line:84%
responses I've ever
seen were the result

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.397 align:middle line:90%
of using this technique.

00:36:17.397 --> 00:36:21.600 align:middle line:90%


00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.040 align:middle line:84%
Two out of three people in
the industrialized world

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:24.840 align:middle line:90%
are overweight.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:26.130 align:middle line:90%
It's an epidemic.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:28.540 align:middle line:84%
And one of three people
are actually obese.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And we know there's enormous
consequences from a health

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:33.950 align:middle line:84%
perspective of carrying
this extra weight.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.700 align:middle line:84%
And then from a
psychological perspective,

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.600 align:middle line:90%
people don't feel good about.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:38.120 align:middle line:84%
At least most people don't
feel good about themselves.

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.510 align:middle line:90%
They're embarrassed or ashamed.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:41.430 align:middle line:84%
They wish they could look
better and feel better and have

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:42.700 align:middle line:90%
less health complications.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.880 align:middle line:90%
So why can't they do it?

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.840 align:middle line:84%
Why do we had this
massive epidemic?

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:50.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think for the most part
there's two primary reasons.

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:54.090 align:middle line:84%
But after reviewing
this really carefully,

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:56.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm convinced the single most
important reason is really

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.290 align:middle line:90%
the foods that you're eating.

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:01.200 align:middle line:84%
You can exercise like a maniac,
but if you're making poor food

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.810 align:middle line:84%
choices, it's very,
very difficult

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.890 align:middle line:84%
to compensate for
the food choices.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:08.700 align:middle line:84%
So diet's about
70% to 80% of it.

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Exercise is really crucial.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.810 align:middle line:84%
And to be effective, I
think it's really difficult,

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:16.290 align:middle line:84%
if not impossible in many
cases, to have effective weight

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:18.360 align:middle line:90%
loss without combining both.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.052 align:middle line:84%
So you could starve yourself and
not exercise and still not be

00:37:21.052 --> 00:37:22.260 align:middle line:90%
able to lose a lot of weight.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.460 align:middle line:84%
So you really need
the combination.

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:25.470 align:middle line:84%
But really, the focus
needs to be on the foods

00:37:25.470 --> 00:37:26.430 align:middle line:90%
that you're eating.

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.610 align:middle line:84%
And in my experience, well,
it's not rocket science.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.368 align:middle line:84%
Again, when we look at what
foods are people eating,

00:37:32.368 --> 00:37:34.410 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the numbers,
the number one source

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:37.095 align:middle line:84%
of calories in the United
States is fructose, specifically

00:37:37.095 --> 00:37:41.490 align:middle line:90%
in the form of sugar from sodas.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's the most common,
but it is pervasive,

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:46.200 align:middle line:84%
because it's so inexpensive
to make that it's

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.610 align:middle line:90%
added to just about every food.

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So that really needs to be
eliminated from the diet

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.920 align:middle line:84%
because it's one of
the primary reasons

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.800 align:middle line:84%
that people develop what's
called insulin resistance.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.300 align:middle line:84%
If you have insulin resistance,
it becomes almost metabolically

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:04.860 align:middle line:84%
impossible to lose weight
because the enzymes that

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.560 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for
burning fat are impaired.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.850 align:middle line:90%
They're blocked.

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:09.882 align:middle line:90%
So you just add fat.

00:38:09.882 --> 00:38:11.340 align:middle line:84%
You just won't burn
it effectively.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.353 align:middle line:84%
So you have to lower
insulin resistance.

00:38:13.353 --> 00:38:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately,
this is something

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.890 align:middle line:84%
that's relatively easy
and expensive to measure.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:19.950 align:middle line:84%
You can just measure
your insulin level

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and fasting-- not after
food, but after fasting

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.420 align:middle line:90%
of about 8 to 12 hours.

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:25.920 align:middle line:84%
And it should be
about two or three.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:28.050 align:middle line:84%
And if it's much higher, the
higher it is the worst it is,

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:29.590 align:middle line:84%
the more difficult it's
going to be to lose weight.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.548 align:middle line:84%
So the key is to lower
your insulin resistance.

00:38:31.548 --> 00:38:33.255 align:middle line:84%
And you do that by
not eating sugars.

00:38:33.255 --> 00:38:34.940 align:middle line:90%
And this is primarily fructose.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And the other way to do it
that's profoundly effective,

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:42.150 align:middle line:84%
better than any drug we know
of, and literally is the cure

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.690 align:middle line:84%
for another epidemic one of
four people in the United States

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:49.610 align:middle line:84%
have, which is diabetes
or pre-diabetes--

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and it's moving rapidly
to one in three.

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:56.588 align:middle line:84%
And it's paralleling
the obesity epidemic.

00:38:56.588 --> 00:38:58.380 align:middle line:84%
And it's all related
to insulin resistance.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.520 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you with
incredible confidence

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.250 align:middle line:84%
and authority that
the drugs don't work.

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.368 align:middle line:84%
And they recently
pulled one of the most--

00:39:07.368 --> 00:39:09.160 align:middle line:84%
at least from Europe,
they were wise enough

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.910 align:middle line:84%
to pull it-- one of
the most popular drugs

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:12.270 align:middle line:90%
to treat type 2 diabetes.

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:14.233 align:middle line:84%
It's an oral hypoglycemic
called Avandia.

00:39:14.233 --> 00:39:15.900 align:middle line:84%
It was pulled from
the market in Europe,

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.160 align:middle line:84%
but yet still
maintain and kept--

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and physicians in the
United States were allowed

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.290 align:middle line:84%
prescribe, but they gave
it a black box warning,

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:30.030 align:middle line:84%
despite the fact that it killed
80,000 people and never, never

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:32.730 align:middle line:90%
cured one person from diabetes.

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:36.300 align:middle line:84%
This is atrocious when
you consider the fact

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:40.380 align:middle line:84%
that we actually do have a
cure for type 2 diabetes.

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's not insulin.

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.610 align:middle line:84%
Insulin is almost as bad
as the oral hypoglycemics,

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.980 align:middle line:84%
because there is never
a need for anyone

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.260 align:middle line:84%
who has type 2 diabetes
to take insulin.

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.440 align:middle line:90%
It's a disaster.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.513 align:middle line:90%
It is treating a symptom.

00:39:51.513 --> 00:39:52.680 align:middle line:90%
It's not treating the cause.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:54.330 align:middle line:84%
The cause is insulin
resistance, and if you

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:55.800 align:middle line:84%
give someone with insulin
resistance more insulin,

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:57.450 align:middle line:84%
you make the insulin
resistance worse.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:00.060 align:middle line:84%
So what will cure the
insulin resistance?

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:02.410 align:middle line:90%
Diet and exercise would do it.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:07.710 align:middle line:84%
So you have to lower the foods
that cause insulin to rise.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
sugar but it's also

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:12.490 align:middle line:90%
foods that act like sugar.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you have diabetes
or if you're overweight,

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:16.110 align:middle line:84%
then you want to
eliminate foods that

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:20.680 align:middle line:84%
raise insulin real rapidly,
which would be grains--

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:27.480 align:middle line:84%
so that's breads, pasta, cereal
rice, potatoes, corn, waffles,

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:30.810 align:middle line:84%
pancakes, most pretty much
any food for breakfast

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:32.100 align:middle line:90%
that most people eat.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So those are the
foods that need to be

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:36.210 align:middle line:84%
away from your diet
at least until you're

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.410 align:middle line:84%
able to get the insulin
resistance under control.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And this includes
even healthy grains,

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.350 align:middle line:84%
like organic,
biodynamically grown wheat

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:45.537 align:middle line:90%
that's freshly ground.

00:40:45.537 --> 00:40:47.370 align:middle line:84%
And it could be health
food for some people,

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:48.970 align:middle line:84%
but if you have
insulin resistance,

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:51.600 align:middle line:84%
it should be avoided until you
are able to address the insulin

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.425 align:middle line:90%
resistance.

00:40:52.425 --> 00:40:56.260 align:middle line:90%


00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So let me emphasize that
point because many people feel

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.795 align:middle line:84%
they're doing the right
thing by getting off of sugar

00:41:00.795 --> 00:41:02.920 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps taking artificial
sweeteners, which you

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.330 align:middle line:90%
don't want to do, of course.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:05.560 align:middle line:90%
But it's not just sugar.

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.410 align:middle line:84%
You have to eliminate
the foods that break down

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:11.530 align:middle line:84%
the sugars-- that's
rice, that's pasta,

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:15.880 align:middle line:90%
that's corn, bread, potatoes.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.508 align:middle line:84%
Foods that rapidly
break down the sugar

00:41:17.508 --> 00:41:18.550 align:middle line:90%
raise your insulin level.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:19.630 align:middle line:90%
Cereals.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:21.390 align:middle line:90%
So all these things--

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:25.840 align:middle line:84%
waffles, pancakes-- these are
foods that you have to avoid.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Even if they're organic and you
purchase them at Whole Foods,

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.690 align:middle line:90%
it's not going to matter.

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:31.880 align:middle line:90%
You need to stay away from them.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It's the rice, potatoes, and
the corn you've got to avoid--

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and wheat-- until you control
the insulin resistance.

00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:40.300 align:middle line:84%
So the other part of
the equation, though,

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:44.380 align:middle line:84%
which actually lowers insulin
resistance quite effectively,

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.580 align:middle line:90%
is exercise.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.350 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's not just any exercise.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:49.930 align:middle line:84%
If you think you're-- now,
unless less you're morbidly

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:51.460 align:middle line:84%
obese and weigh
400 or 500 pounds,

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:54.040 align:middle line:84%
or you just have
no activity at all,

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.610 align:middle line:90%
walking is not going to work.

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:59.588 align:middle line:84%
It's a good first step, but
it rapidly loses its benefit

00:41:59.588 --> 00:42:00.880 align:middle line:90%
at lowering insulin resistance.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.510 align:middle line:84%
So you really need what's
called high intensity exercise.

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:08.410 align:middle line:84%
And many people are under the
illusion that doing cardio

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:13.400 align:middle line:84%
or aerobics is beneficial to
treat this, as I was for 30--

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and I started
exercising in 1968--

00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:20.020 align:middle line:84%
for well over 30 to 40 years, I
believed that was the solution,

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.010 align:middle line:90%
and it really isn't.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:22.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can do some
cardio, but now I've

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.210 align:middle line:84%
come to the conclusion that
you really don't need any.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:27.550 align:middle line:84%
And what you really need
are these high intensity

00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:30.700 align:middle line:84%
exercises where you're
pushing your body

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:33.790 align:middle line:84%
to its physiological maximum
over a short period in sort

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:35.440 align:middle line:90%
of like interval sprints.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:36.940 align:middle line:84%
And we've developed
a program called

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:39.520 align:middle line:84%
Peak 8, which was
developed by Phil

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.730 align:middle line:90%
Campbell on his principles.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:45.190 align:middle line:84%
And basically it's a
system where you only

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:47.210 align:middle line:90%
use exercise for 20 minutes.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:49.380 align:middle line:84%
The first three minutes,
you're warming up.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Then, for 30 seconds, you're
going full out and exercising

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:53.920 align:middle line:90%
really intensely.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.180 align:middle line:84%
And then you're
recovering for 90,

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.030 align:middle line:84%
and then you do this
in eight cycles.

00:42:58.030 --> 00:43:01.450 align:middle line:84%
And then you cool down
for 2 and 1/2 minutes.

00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:04.100 align:middle line:90%
So the total time is 20 minutes.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And the intention is to engage
in activity and the intensity

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:11.440 align:middle line:84%
of the activity that
eventually you get to the point

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.140 align:middle line:84%
where you're at your calculated
maximum heart rate, which

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.390 align:middle line:90%
is 220 minus your age.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:21.810 align:middle line:84%
So for someone like me, who's
56 years old, that would be 164.

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, I like to go
a little harder,

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.240 align:middle line:84%
and I try to get
mine's about 170

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:27.280 align:middle line:84%
or even higher when
I'm doing my workout.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.620 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
that you work up to.

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.140 align:middle line:84%
If someone hasn't engaged in
these kinds of activities,

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.850 align:middle line:84%
then they don't want
to do it right away,

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.362 align:middle line:84%
they want to work
up to it slowly.

00:43:35.362 --> 00:43:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Instead of doing
eight cycles, they

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.430 align:middle line:84%
would start with two or
three, and then work up

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:40.960 align:middle line:90%
so then they can tolerate that.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.240 align:middle line:84%
But the types of
activities that can do it--

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:47.620 align:middle line:84%
probably the two best would be
something like a recumbent bike

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.060 align:middle line:84%
where you're sitting
down and cycling,

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:56.200 align:middle line:84%
a stationary recumbent bike
as opposes a regular bike,

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.230 align:middle line:84%
and then an elliptical machine
that actually uses the arms.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.000 align:middle line:84%
So this happens
to be my favorite.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And it seems to be the
least mentally stressful

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to do it, maybe because I've
been running for over 40 years

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and I'm more inclined to
use that type of activity.

00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:12.970 align:middle line:84%
But it works really
well and can give you

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.480 align:middle line:84%
this stimulus that will
lower your insulin resistance

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.370 align:middle line:84%
but it also has a
marvelous other benefit,

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:21.010 align:middle line:84%
because one of the hormone
deficiencies that invariably

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:24.370 align:middle line:84%
is associated with
aging is growth hormone.

00:44:24.370 --> 00:44:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And virtually everyone
watching this tape, this video,

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.928 align:middle line:90%
has heard of menopause.

00:44:30.928 --> 00:44:33.053 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's another
problem that occurs with age,

00:44:33.053 --> 00:44:34.850 align:middle line:90%
and it's called somatopause.

00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:36.460 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is somatopause?

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, somatotropin is
the medical Latin term

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:42.270 align:middle line:90%
for growth hormone.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:43.523 align:middle line:90%
And at about the--

00:44:43.523 --> 00:44:45.940 align:middle line:84%
actually earlier than aging
occurs for women going through

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.970 align:middle line:84%
menopause, typically
late 30s or 40s,

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:52.930 align:middle line:84%
we have a fairly dramatic
reduction of growth hormone

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:56.330 align:middle line:84%
that is associated
with many of the anti--

00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:59.770 align:middle line:84%
or the aging process,
accelerated aging and decrease

00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:01.960 align:middle line:84%
in accelerating
telomere shortening.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:05.230 align:middle line:84%
So it's really important to
optimize your growth hormone.

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:08.320 align:middle line:84%
And yes, we have
manufactured it.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.820 align:middle line:84%
We have a common
DNA growth hormone.

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:12.880 align:middle line:84%
You could actually purchase
it for $1,000 or more a month

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.682 align:middle line:90%
and inject it.

00:45:13.682 --> 00:45:15.390 align:middle line:84%
But your body wasn't
designed to do that,

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:16.750 align:middle line:84%
and there's no feedback
loops, and you're not

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:17.625 align:middle line:90%
going to optimize it.

00:45:17.625 --> 00:45:19.240 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
probably mess up.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's a lot less expensive
and a lot healthier and safer

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.550 align:middle line:84%
to have your body make
your own growth hormone.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:29.460 align:middle line:90%


00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.920 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
very few exercises

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.930 align:middle line:90%
will stimulate growth hormone.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.240 align:middle line:84%
There are a number of
different muscle fiber types

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.960 align:middle line:84%
that we have-- the slow fibers,
the fast, and the superfast.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.590 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that you
can stimulate growth hormone

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.040 align:middle line:84%
is to stimulate these
superfast muscle fibers.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:50.550 align:middle line:84%
So exercises like
running, or cardio,

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.520 align:middle line:84%
or even strength training,
your typical aerobics, those

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.860 align:middle line:84%
will not cause growth
hormone increase.

00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:00.840 align:middle line:84%
You need super high intensity
sprinting or explosive types

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.800 align:middle line:84%
of activity where you'll know
because once you're engaged

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.550 align:middle line:84%
them, even though it's
only a few minutes,

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.130 align:middle line:84%
you'll start to sweat
profusely-- unless you have

00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:11.580 align:middle line:84%
thyroid problems, which is one
of the symptoms of low thyroid

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.070 align:middle line:84%
function is you have
inhibited ability to sweat.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:16.340 align:middle line:84%
But most people, assuming
the thyroid functions well,

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:18.273 align:middle line:84%
will start sweating
profusely when

00:46:18.273 --> 00:46:19.690 align:middle line:84%
they're doing these
high intensity

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:21.188 align:middle line:90%
activities after a few minutes.

00:46:21.188 --> 00:46:23.355 align:middle line:84%
Now, I know you can sweat
doing aerobics and cardio,

00:46:23.355 --> 00:46:25.710 align:middle line:84%
but usually it takes a
lot longer to get to that.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:27.085 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
one of the keys

00:46:27.085 --> 00:46:29.010 align:middle line:84%
that I look at
internally to find out

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:30.990 align:middle line:84%
if I'm engaging in
intense enough activity,

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:32.160 align:middle line:84%
or if I'm doing
strength training,

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.030 align:middle line:84%
because I think
strength training is

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:34.590 align:middle line:90%
another crucial activity.

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:39.293 align:middle line:84%
You can use weight training
to increase growth hormone,

00:46:39.293 --> 00:46:40.960 align:middle line:84%
but it has to be done
very specifically.

00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.563 align:middle line:84%
It just can't be
done traditionally.

00:46:42.563 --> 00:46:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Even though doing
it traditionally

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:49.420 align:middle line:84%
is a good proactive process that
I believe everyone should do,

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:52.030 align:middle line:90%
it's not massively important.

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:54.570 align:middle line:84%
I think your food choices
and high intensity exercises

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:57.450 align:middle line:84%
are more important, but
it is an important element

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:58.980 align:middle line:84%
of a comprehensive
exercise program.

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:03.940 align:middle line:90%


00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.120 align:middle line:84%
There is a show called "The
Biggest Loser" in which they

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.850 align:middle line:84%
use large amounts of
exercise and really not

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:12.170 align:middle line:84%
very careful attention to
details on the nutrition

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:14.170 align:middle line:84%
to help people lose weight,
and they lose weight

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:15.610 align:middle line:90%
relatively rapidly.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And so the question becomes,
is this a useful strategy?

00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's important to
understand that it's not just

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.550 align:middle line:84%
losing weight that
is the issue here,

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:27.560 align:middle line:84%
because you really need to
take a long-term perspective.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:31.870 align:middle line:84%
So you really want ideally to
develop behaviors and patterns

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:33.770 align:middle line:84%
that one can continue
for a lifetime.

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:36.850 align:middle line:84%
So there is no rush here to
necessarily lose the weight.

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:40.570 align:middle line:84%
And the danger of doing that,
if you lose it too aggressively,

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:43.660 align:middle line:84%
is that way especially without
some enhanced processes

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:47.290 align:middle line:84%
to help the body detoxify,
is that these toxins,

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.290 align:middle line:84%
the fat soluble toxins that
are pervasive, like pesticides

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:54.220 align:middle line:84%
and such, that are stored,
that we all have exposure to,

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:55.630 align:middle line:90%
are stored in our fat--

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:57.970 align:middle line:84%
they have to be
properly excreted

00:47:57.970 --> 00:47:59.470 align:middle line:84%
because if they're
not, then they'll

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:02.620 align:middle line:84%
relocate to other fat
stores in your body.

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.540 align:middle line:90%
And that's really why--

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.510 align:middle line:84%
but one of the most important
parts of a detoxification

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:10.228 align:middle line:84%
process is actually
lowering your body fat,

00:48:10.228 --> 00:48:12.020 align:middle line:84%
because that's where
the toxins are stored.

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So if you can reduce
them, and at the same time

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.170 align:middle line:84%
you're reducing
the fat facilitate

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:20.830 align:middle line:84%
the excretion of those
through the proper sweating

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:23.740 align:middle line:84%
or through bowel
cleanses or combinations,

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:29.110 align:middle line:84%
then you'll be able to
eliminate them from your body

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.200 align:middle line:84%
rather than having them
concentrate and become

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.400 align:middle line:90%
even more of a problem.

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:38.640 align:middle line:90%


00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.380 align:middle line:84%
With respect to
detoxification, there's

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:41.880 align:middle line:84%
a lot of confusion in
this area, because there's

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.547 align:middle line:84%
so many different strategies and
approaches that one could take.

00:48:44.547 --> 00:48:46.440 align:middle line:90%
And I certainly was confused.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.540 align:middle line:84%
But I've really
reached the conclusion

00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:52.320 align:middle line:84%
that it isn't that
much of a challenge.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.770 align:middle line:84%
And it's important to
understand that sort

00:48:55.770 --> 00:49:00.540 align:middle line:84%
of the gold standard of toxin
assays would be a fat biopsy.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:04.072 align:middle line:84%
That's because there's a hundred
times more toxins in your fat

00:49:04.072 --> 00:49:05.280 align:middle line:90%
than there are in your blood.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:06.990 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be
stored in the blood.

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:11.760 align:middle line:84%
So really, the key, the
central core to detoxification

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.220 align:middle line:90%
is lowering your body fat.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.100 align:middle line:84%
2/3 of the country
is overweight.

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.810 align:middle line:84%
So almost everyone is carrying
around too much body fat

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:20.040 align:middle line:90%
and can stand to lower it.

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, that's not
true for everyone.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.352 align:middle line:84%
But that's really
the central core.

00:49:23.352 --> 00:49:24.310 align:middle line:90%
And how do you do that?

00:49:24.310 --> 00:49:25.680 align:middle line:84%
You do that by eating
the right foods

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.180 align:middle line:84%
and engaging in an
exercise program.

00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:29.070 align:middle line:84%
But while you're
doing that process,

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:30.750 align:middle line:84%
or especially if
you are suffering

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:34.080 align:middle line:84%
from signs of
toxicity, then you may

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.980 align:middle line:84%
want to engage in
some other components.

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And some of the ones I've
learned to be particularly

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:45.210 align:middle line:84%
useful is infrared saunas,
combined with exercise,

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:49.572 align:middle line:84%
so that you can engage
in an exercise program--

00:49:49.572 --> 00:49:51.780 align:middle line:84%
ideally a Peak 8 program
where you're really sweating

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:53.072 align:middle line:90%
and getting your heart moving--

00:49:53.072 --> 00:49:55.350 align:middle line:84%
and then go into an
infrared sauna for an hour.

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:56.850 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
even tweak this

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:59.730 align:middle line:84%
a little further from
a protocol that I

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:02.130 align:middle line:84%
learned by one of the top
detoxification specialists

00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:03.060 align:middle line:90%
on the East Coast.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So there's a doctor
out of Washington DC

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:08.310 align:middle line:84%
who's actually received a grant
from the Department of Defense

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:10.140 align:middle line:84%
to treat Gulf War
and 9/11 victims

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and has had a fair
measure of success.

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:18.540 align:middle line:84%
And his protocol is
that he initially

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:21.850 align:middle line:84%
puts people on progressively
larger amounts of niacin

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:23.307 align:middle line:90%
or vitamin B3.

00:50:23.307 --> 00:50:25.890 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone can tolerate this
because one of the side effects

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:27.610 align:middle line:90%
of niacin is this flushing.

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So most people can tolerate
50, 100 milligrams.

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:31.253 align:middle line:84%
But he eventually
wants to get them up

00:50:31.253 --> 00:50:34.530 align:middle line:84%
to like 5,000 milligrams, which
will cause them to be massively

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:36.120 align:middle line:90%
red, and this vasodilation.

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And it basically increases
the circulation process

00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:43.170 align:middle line:84%
so that there's this
breakdown and lipolysis

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:46.350 align:middle line:84%
of the fat in conjunction
with moving the toxins out

00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:47.290 align:middle line:90%
of the system.

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:49.620 align:middle line:84%
And if you combine that
with an infrared sauna,

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.770 align:middle line:84%
you're actually sweating
these toxins out of the body.

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:54.060 align:middle line:90%
Should be very effective.

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:58.470 align:middle line:84%
And of course you can use
other conjunctive modalities

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:03.450 align:middle line:84%
such as enemas and
cleansing in that area,

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and combining it with a
variety of adjuvants to act,

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:12.690 align:middle line:84%
such as zeolite in other
clays that can be used.

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Niacin is not really
chelating the metals.

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:20.580 align:middle line:90%
It's not like DNPS or DMSA.

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.350 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't complex--
or chlorella--

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:24.010 align:middle line:90%
with the metals at all.

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:27.060 align:middle line:84%
What it does is it enhances
the body's circulatory response

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.980 align:middle line:84%
so it increases
perfusion, causes

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.650 align:middle line:84%
the body to actually break
down the fat a little better.

00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And because of that process
and increased circulation,

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.572 align:middle line:84%
the body is able to
eliminate the toxins

00:51:38.572 --> 00:51:40.280 align:middle line:84%
through other routes,
primarily sweating,

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.630 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're
using an infrared sauna.

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:43.090 align:middle line:90%
So it comes out in the sweat.

00:51:43.090 --> 00:51:45.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you're actually
using a sauna to do this,

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:47.250 align:middle line:84%
you have to clean the
sauna because it'll

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:48.623 align:middle line:90%
be filled with toxins.

00:51:48.623 --> 00:51:50.165 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally
filled, so you have

00:51:50.165 --> 00:51:51.660 align:middle line:90%
to be really careful about that.

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.383 align:middle line:84%
And in commercial
institutions that use this,

00:51:54.383 --> 00:51:56.550 align:middle line:84%
they actually vent this out
through a special filter

00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:59.692 align:middle line:84%
because it's very toxic, the
materials that are actually

00:51:59.692 --> 00:52:02.025 align:middle line:84%
excreted from people who are
going through this process.

00:52:02.025 --> 00:52:06.405 align:middle line:90%


00:52:06.405 --> 00:52:07.780 align:middle line:84%
With our current
economy, which I

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.832 align:middle line:84%
believe will get worse
before it gets better,

00:52:09.832 --> 00:52:11.290 align:middle line:84%
and many people
will be suffering--

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:14.740 align:middle line:84%
and we don't have to look
too-- in recent history,

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:17.590 align:middle line:84%
I mean, Egyptian crises that
we had was primarily mediated

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:19.010 align:middle line:90%
through food prices.

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is a significant issue
and will become progressively

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.990 align:middle line:90%
more important in the future.

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.783 align:middle line:84%
So the challenge is to find
healthy foods alternatives

00:52:26.783 --> 00:52:29.200 align:middle line:84%
to the processed crap that
people are eating and consuming

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.520 align:middle line:90%
that's getting them sick.

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.460 align:middle line:84%
So there's a perception
that healthy food

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:34.450 align:middle line:90%
has to be expensive.

00:52:34.450 --> 00:52:36.820 align:middle line:84%
And while it may be
a bit more expensive

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.620 align:middle line:84%
in some cases in
the short term, it's

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:40.520 align:middle line:84%
certainly cheaper
in the long run.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.490 align:middle line:84%
But the practical
question becomes, well,

00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:44.090 align:middle line:90%
how do you afford it?

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:45.520 align:middle line:90%
Well, you do the best you can.

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And typically, in
many cases, it's

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:50.230 align:middle line:84%
going to involve making
choices and actually putting

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:51.460 align:middle line:90%
a priority.

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:56.020 align:middle line:84%
In America, we spend a lot less
on food than other countries.

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:58.040 align:middle line:84%
I think it's probably
close to 10%, where

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.108 align:middle line:84%
in many other countries
it might be 20, 30%.

00:53:00.108 --> 00:53:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think that
percentage is going

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:03.233 align:middle line:84%
to increase with
food inflation, which

00:53:03.233 --> 00:53:05.360 align:middle line:90%
is coming around the corner.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:09.760 align:middle line:84%
But the issue is it's
a matter of increasing

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.770 align:middle line:84%
the percentage
you spend on food,

00:53:11.770 --> 00:53:14.200 align:middle line:84%
recognizing that it really is
an important consideration,

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.870 align:middle line:84%
and making sacrifices or
cutbacks in other areas

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:18.640 align:middle line:90%
if you have a limited pot.

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, if you're really
economically challenged,

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:23.530 align:middle line:90%
then you can become creative.

00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.310 align:middle line:84%
And there's food banks
that are available.

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And what I would strongly
recommend and actually

00:53:27.310 --> 00:53:31.300 align:middle line:84%
going to seek to catalyze
to facilitate a project

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:33.850 align:middle line:84%
where there's enormous
waste in this country--

00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:35.920 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally
billions of pounds of food

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:37.810 align:middle line:90%
are thrown away every year.

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:41.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just shocking how
much waste there is.

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:44.260 align:middle line:84%
And it's largely
related to the fact

00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:46.520 align:middle line:84%
that there's this
fear of liability.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.790 align:middle line:84%
So these grocery stores
are just throwing it away,

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:51.663 align:middle line:84%
throwing in the
dumpsters, because they

00:53:51.663 --> 00:53:53.080 align:middle line:84%
don't want to give
it to food bank

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.788 align:middle line:84%
because if someone
gets sick because it's

00:53:54.788 --> 00:53:57.590 align:middle line:84%
a little bit dated, they're
concerned about liability.

00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:00.628 align:middle line:84%
Well, this is shocking, because
President Clinton in the United

00:54:00.628 --> 00:54:02.920 align:middle line:84%
States passed legislation of
Good Samaritan legislation

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.140 align:middle line:84%
which essentially insulated
them from any that type

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.460 align:middle line:90%
of prosecution.

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.890 align:middle line:84%
So that exists, but there's
still not this infrastructure

00:54:08.890 --> 00:54:14.260 align:middle line:84%
or this process that can allow
the transfer of this really

00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:16.610 align:middle line:84%
good food that's being
wasted every day.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:19.120 align:middle line:84%
So if an individual's
in that circumstance,

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:22.510 align:middle line:84%
he can connect to the food
bank that's in their area

00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:26.560 align:middle line:84%
and seek to strategize and
develop a program where they

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:29.680 align:middle line:90%
can volunteer and transfer--

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.960 align:middle line:84%
talk to the people
at the local stores

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:34.450 align:middle line:84%
and transfer that wasted
produce every day in food--

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:37.090 align:middle line:84%
the perishables--
to the food bank

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:39.980 align:middle line:84%
so that we can use that food
instead of throwing it away.

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:44.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very creative
and a very efficient and less

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:47.020 align:middle line:84%
wasteful strategy than
we're currently doing.

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:51.220 align:middle line:84%
And really seek to always
get organic if you can.

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.522 align:middle line:84%
Even if you can't afford
it, make the compromises,

00:54:53.522 --> 00:54:55.480 align:middle line:84%
because that's going to
really ultimately lower

00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:57.710 align:middle line:90%
the price in the long run.

00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:59.522 align:middle line:84%
Right now, because
of the bastardization

00:54:59.522 --> 00:55:01.480 align:middle line:84%
of the food system and
the regulatory agencies,

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:05.805 align:middle line:84%
it is illegal to label a food
as GMO without consequences.

00:55:05.805 --> 00:55:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So really the only
way you can be

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:11.620 align:middle line:84%
assured of getting non GMO foods
we all want is to get organic.

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:16.000 align:middle line:84%
Because by the strictest
definition of the standards,

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.670 align:middle line:84%
GMO cannot be included, at
least up to a certain level,

00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:20.272 align:middle line:84%
other than
contaminant, of course.

00:55:20.272 --> 00:55:21.730 align:middle line:84%
So that's what you
want to get you.

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:23.188 align:middle line:84%
You can stay away
from GMO products

00:55:23.188 --> 00:55:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and the potential problems
and complications with that

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:27.860 align:middle line:84%
and avoid the other toxins
that are contributed.

00:55:27.860 --> 00:55:29.760 align:middle line:84%
So it may be a little more
expensive, but in long run

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.677 align:middle line:90%
it's going to be less.

00:55:30.677 --> 00:55:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And then by putting
this economic pressure

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.675 align:middle line:84%
and voting with your
dollars, eventually

00:55:35.675 --> 00:55:37.300 align:middle line:84%
it comes down because
then the industry

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:38.923 align:middle line:90%
will move in that direction.

00:55:38.923 --> 00:55:43.560 align:middle line:90%


00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.560 align:middle line:84%
So when it comes to
extending your lifespan,

00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.020 align:middle line:84%
I think there's some really
effective strategies.

00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:49.970 align:middle line:84%
Ray Kurzweil is
one of the pioneers

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:54.470 align:middle line:84%
and really a brilliant man at
promoting the use of technology

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:55.500 align:middle line:90%
to extend our lifespan.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.280 align:middle line:84%
And he has a concept called the
singularity which he believes

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:04.400 align:middle line:84%
will occur somewhere the next
30 years or so, 35 years.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
this transition

00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:10.610 align:middle line:84%
occurs where the technology is
developed so radically that we

00:56:10.610 --> 00:56:12.777 align:middle line:84%
can extend our lifespans
quite dramatically

00:56:12.777 --> 00:56:13.610 align:middle line:90%
to the point where--

00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:15.460 align:middle line:90%
100, 200, 300 years.

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.080 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the traditional
lifespan has been to 120.

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:21.770 align:middle line:84%
But I'm pretty convinced that
most people viewing this,

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:23.360 align:middle line:84%
if you maintain a
healthy lifespan,

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.550 align:middle line:84%
that you're going to reach
this bridge where you'll

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:27.920 align:middle line:84%
be able to employ these
technologies, which are largely

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.500 align:middle line:84%
related to STEM
cells and telomere

00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.680 align:middle line:84%
lengthening processes,
that will essentially

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:37.367 align:middle line:84%
allow you to go to 150 or
200 I think in our lifespan.

00:56:37.367 --> 00:56:38.700 align:middle line:90%
I don't think it's unreasonable.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:40.250 align:middle line:90%
It may sound shocking.

00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:42.008 align:middle line:84%
And humans have not
done that before.

00:56:42.008 --> 00:56:43.550 align:middle line:84%
But if you look at--
it's interesting

00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:45.008 align:middle line:84%
if you look at
history and see what

00:56:45.008 --> 00:56:46.670 align:middle line:90%
our average lifespan has been.

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:49.808 align:middle line:84%
It's improved quite dramatically
over the last 50 to 100 years.

00:56:49.808 --> 00:56:51.350 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we're talking
20, 30, 40 year

00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:53.460 align:middle line:90%
increases for many countries.

00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:54.740 align:middle line:90%
I mean, 30 or 40 years.

00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:58.250 align:middle line:84%
So adding another 40 years
where we're at now, or 50 or 60,

00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:59.930 align:middle line:84%
isn't too unreasonable,
especially when

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:03.920 align:middle line:84%
you integrate the impact of
the technological revolution,

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.280 align:middle line:84%
specifically Moore's law, where
you're developing increasing

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:10.100 align:middle line:84%
computing capacity at a rapidly
reduced fraction of what

00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.200 align:middle line:90%
the previous capacity cost.

00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.690 align:middle line:90%
So the issue becomes the bridge.

00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So the bridge is to stay healthy
long enough so that you can

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:20.400 align:middle line:90%
have access to the technology.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.365 align:middle line:90%
So what do you do?

00:57:21.365 --> 00:57:23.240 align:middle line:84%
So what is the single
most important variable

00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:27.020 align:middle line:84%
that will contribute to
slowing down the aging process?

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:29.600 align:middle line:90%
Lowering your insulin levels.

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.070 align:middle line:84%
If you have an
insulin resistance

00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:33.320 align:middle line:84%
or an elevated
fasting insulin, that

00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:35.690 align:middle line:84%
is the single most
important element

00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:38.600 align:middle line:90%
that will accelerate aging.

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.858 align:middle line:84%
So that means you've got
to stay away from sugar.

00:57:41.858 --> 00:57:43.400 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can have
it occasionally.

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.533 align:middle line:90%
We all need to celebrate.

00:57:44.533 --> 00:57:45.950 align:middle line:84%
But you really
want to avoid sugar

00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:47.600 align:middle line:84%
for the most part
or anything that's

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:49.730 align:middle line:84%
going to raise it-- so
even fruits in excess

00:57:49.730 --> 00:57:51.100 align:middle line:90%
can be a problem.

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:55.520 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't believe
me, just believe your body.

00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:56.810 align:middle line:90%
Go and do the test.

00:57:56.810 --> 00:57:59.570 align:middle line:84%
Get a fasting insulin level
and find out for yourself.

00:57:59.570 --> 00:58:01.490 align:middle line:90%
Don't guess.

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:03.673 align:middle line:84%
And let your body tell
you if it's true or not.

00:58:03.673 --> 00:58:05.090 align:middle line:84%
So you may have
to really restrict

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:08.120 align:middle line:84%
fruits and grains which are
traditionally by many people

00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:11.480 align:middle line:84%
viewing this felt to be healthy,
but in many people are not.

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:12.500 align:middle line:90%
So do that.

00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.240 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you've
got to exercise.

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.740 align:middle line:84%
There's just no way
you're not going

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.630 align:middle line:84%
to do it without a
good exercise program.

00:58:17.630 --> 00:58:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a particular fan of
these high intensity exercises.

00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:23.990 align:middle line:84%
We developed a program
called Peak 8 which

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:27.900 align:middle line:84%
is really designed to exercise
the superfast muscle fibers.

00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:30.920 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of that, they
will increase growth hormone

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.000 align:middle line:90%
to dramatic levels--

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really shockingly
levels that you

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:37.270 align:middle line:90%
would see from a child.

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And it does it at
no cost to you.

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:40.620 align:middle line:90%
There's no charge.

00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And if Susie, you were
to take this hormone,

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:44.210 align:middle line:84%
it's only available
intravenously

00:58:44.210 --> 00:58:47.250 align:middle line:84%
or intramuscularly-- that it
would cost you $1,500 a month

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:48.050 align:middle line:90%
to take.

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:50.300 align:middle line:84%
And then you'd have the side
effects and complications

00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:51.930 align:middle line:84%
of not knowing what
the right dose is.

00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:52.730 align:middle line:90%
So that's one.

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And then with respect
to antioxidants,

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.370 align:middle line:84%
which is certainly another
part of aging, because--

00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:01.230 align:middle line:90%


00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:03.353 align:middle line:84%
I'm a big fan of
using food based ones.

00:59:03.353 --> 00:59:05.520 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most powerful
ones is relatively new.

00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.353 align:middle line:84%
And many people watching
this would probably

00:59:07.353 --> 00:59:08.490 align:middle line:90%
have not heard of it.

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:10.220 align:middle line:90%
It's called astaxanthin.

00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And that is a antitoxin
derived from marine algae.

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:18.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's one of the most
potent known naturally

00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:20.090 align:middle line:90%
occurring antioxidants.

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Literally it has 500 times the
free radical quenching capacity

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:28.040 align:middle line:84%
of vitamin E. It's
shockingly effective.

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.760 align:middle line:84%
It is what gives
the color to salmon.

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.713 align:middle line:84%
Or many people don't know that
pink flamingos are born white,

00:59:35.713 --> 00:59:37.130 align:middle line:84%
and they don't get
pink until they

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:39.800 align:middle line:84%
have astaxanthin, because
it's in their food supply.

00:59:39.800 --> 00:59:41.650 align:middle line:84%
So it really gives
the pink color.

00:59:41.650 --> 00:59:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Now it's a shockingly
effective supplement.

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:44.875 align:middle line:90%
It's one that I take every day.

00:59:44.875 --> 00:59:46.750 align:middle line:84%
I really think that
everyone should be on it.

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's been shown to
protect against a number

00:59:50.690 --> 00:59:51.810 align:middle line:90%
of interesting diseases.

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:54.393 align:middle line:84%
One of the most common cause of
blindness in the United States

00:59:54.393 --> 00:59:56.240 align:middle line:84%
is age related
macular degeneration.

00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And it would virtually
eliminate that.

00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.383 align:middle line:84%
Cataracts is really
pervasive too,

01:00:00.383 --> 01:00:01.550 align:middle line:90%
which won't cause blindness.

01:00:01.550 --> 01:00:03.383 align:middle line:84%
We have a pretty effective
surgery for that.

01:00:03.383 --> 01:00:06.330 align:middle line:84%
But why have the surgery if you
don't have to have the disease?

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:07.970 align:middle line:90%
So this can prevent cataracts.

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:09.387 align:middle line:84%
And interestingly,
if you're on it

01:00:09.387 --> 01:00:12.835 align:middle line:84%
for a few weeks, many fair skin
and light complexion people

01:00:12.835 --> 01:00:15.260 align:middle line:84%
will appreciate
this, it virtually

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:18.140 align:middle line:90%
eliminates the risk of sunburn.

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.590 align:middle line:90%
So it's really potent.

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, sun is
good and healthy,

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:24.070 align:middle line:84%
but of course we
have to be careful.

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:25.653 align:middle line:84%
And it certainly can
cause photoaging.

01:00:25.653 --> 01:00:26.453 align:middle line:90%
And

01:00:26.453 --> 01:00:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Actually, interestingly,
studies were shown that when

01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:30.770 align:middle line:84%
you look at these carotenoids,
because astaxanthin

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:32.090 align:middle line:90%
is in the carotenoid family.

01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:34.970 align:middle line:84%
It's just much more powerful
than beta carotene, which

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:37.130 align:middle line:90%
is the classic carotenoid.

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:38.870 align:middle line:90%
Far more effective.

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:43.145 align:middle line:84%
So it's really-- it's a
lipid fat soluble one,

01:00:43.145 --> 01:00:44.763 align:middle line:90%
so you have to take it with fat.

01:00:44.763 --> 01:00:46.680 align:middle line:84%
Because if you just
swallow it without eating,

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.597 align:middle line:84%
then you're not going
to absorb as much of it,

01:00:48.597 --> 01:00:49.725 align:middle line:90%
but it's really beneficial.

01:00:49.725 --> 01:00:52.350 align:middle line:84%
So with respect to super foods,
I think that's one of the best.

01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:54.225 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's a
lot of traditional ones.

01:00:54.225 --> 01:00:56.130 align:middle line:84%
And it could be a
topic for a whole DVD

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:57.520 align:middle line:90%
to go into all of those.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.562 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of my
personal favorites, I think,

01:00:59.562 --> 01:01:02.275 align:middle line:84%
that should be used on a
regular basis by everyone.

01:01:02.275 --> 01:01:06.640 align:middle line:90%


01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:09.170 align:middle line:84%
As you seek to
improve your health,

01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
you're going to want to include
certain types of foods, classes

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:15.210 align:middle line:84%
of foods, that are
typically ignored

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:16.210 align:middle line:90%
in the American culture.

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Now, this is not controversial.

01:01:18.310 --> 01:01:21.760 align:middle line:84%
The most conservative
nutritionists

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.430 align:middle line:84%
will recommend that we need
six to eight servings of fruits

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and vegetables,
they like to say.

01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:26.872 align:middle line:84%
But I always like
to twist it around.

01:01:26.872 --> 01:01:28.390 align:middle line:84%
It should be
vegetables and fruits,

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:32.890 align:middle line:84%
because vegetables are really
the most beneficial food group

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:34.510 align:middle line:90%
that we can have access to.

01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:37.660 align:middle line:84%
And most people are
not getting enough.

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:38.490 align:middle line:90%
They just aren't.

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you need a lot
of good vegetables,

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.570 align:middle line:84%
because they're full of the
full range of phytonutrients

01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:46.430 align:middle line:84%
and antioxidants and everything
that you need to stay healthy.

01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But also, and most people don't
realize this, it's living.

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:51.340 align:middle line:90%
It's a live food.

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And when the
vegetable is growing

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:57.910 align:middle line:84%
in the ground as a plant,
it actually has energy.

01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:00.730 align:middle line:84%
And you can measure this if you
have sophisticated equipment.

01:02:00.730 --> 01:02:01.810 align:middle line:90%
They do this in Germany.

01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:04.410 align:middle line:84%
The technology is not as
readily available here,

01:02:04.410 --> 01:02:06.335 align:middle line:90%
but it's called biophotons.

01:02:06.335 --> 01:02:08.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually-- and
there are certain other meters

01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:09.510 align:middle line:90%
that can show it.

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And you can show that vibrant,
healthy vegetables will

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.380 align:middle line:84%
have a different appearance
under these instruments

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:17.350 align:middle line:84%
than ones at aren't,
especially nonorganic ones

01:02:17.350 --> 01:02:19.930 align:middle line:84%
with commercial
fertilizers and pesticides.

01:02:19.930 --> 01:02:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And if you get these
healthy vegetables,

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:24.640 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
transfer this energy

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.030 align:middle line:84%
directly from the
sun into you, along

01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:30.640 align:middle line:84%
with all the other important
accessory micronutrients.

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So it's essential to have
large amounts of vegetables

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.480 align:middle line:90%
every day.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.170 align:middle line:90%
It really is crucial.

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Now one of the ways
that I cheat this,

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.610 align:middle line:84%
because getting
vegetables is a challenge,

01:02:42.610 --> 01:02:44.770 align:middle line:90%
is that I do vegetable juicing.

01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:49.960 align:middle line:84%
So I'll typically buy, I don't
know, 20 pounds of vegetables

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:53.620 align:middle line:84%
a week, maybe more, and
juice a few pounds a day,

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.600 align:middle line:84%
essentially a quart of
dark green vegetable

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.760 align:middle line:90%
juice that consist of--

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
I like celery and
cucumbers as a base,

01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:03.190 align:middle line:84%
and then I add the dark,
deep green leafy vegetables

01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:04.760 align:middle line:90%
like kale or collards.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number of
different types of kale.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.427 align:middle line:84%
Those are the two big
ones, but then you

01:03:08.427 --> 01:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
can also use other
dark green vegetables.

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:13.313 align:middle line:84%
And then they're bitter,
though, so that's a challenge

01:03:13.313 --> 01:03:14.230 align:middle line:90%
that many people have.

01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:16.647 align:middle line:84%
And you're not going to drink
it if it doesn't taste good.

01:03:16.647 --> 01:03:19.150 align:middle line:84%
So one of the simple
tricks you can use

01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:22.417 align:middle line:84%
is to cut up a lime, which
even though it's a fruit

01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:23.500 align:middle line:90%
has virtually no fructose.

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.850 align:middle line:84%
It has one of the lowest
amounts of fructose

01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:26.110 align:middle line:90%
of any fruits known.

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:28.547 align:middle line:84%
So you just cut up a
lime, put in there,

01:03:28.547 --> 01:03:30.130 align:middle line:84%
and then it really
tastes pretty good.

01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:32.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's a delightful drink.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.660 align:middle line:90%
So this lime will--

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:36.940 align:middle line:84%
doesn't make it really
sweet, but it just

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.710 align:middle line:84%
does an amazing thing
to the bitterness.

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:41.230 align:middle line:84%
It virtually eliminates
for the most part.

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:43.330 align:middle line:84%
Now, many people, to
compensate for this,

01:03:43.330 --> 01:03:45.790 align:middle line:84%
will put in other
fruits like apples

01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:47.050 align:middle line:90%
or large amounts of carrots.

01:03:47.050 --> 01:03:49.300 align:middle line:84%
I would caution you against
that because you're really

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.880 align:middle line:90%
increasing the fructose content.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't believe
me, please, please, please

01:03:53.410 --> 01:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
read what I've written
about fructose.

01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.590 align:middle line:90%
It is not your friend.

01:03:56.590 --> 01:04:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the
enemies of helping you

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.380 align:middle line:90%
slow down the aging process.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.270 align:middle line:90%
You've got to limit fructose.

01:04:04.270 --> 01:04:08.095 align:middle line:84%
And especially in the form of
juice, it's really important.

01:04:08.095 --> 01:04:09.970 align:middle line:84%
Fresh juice is going to
be better, of course,

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:11.950 align:middle line:84%
but you really want to keep
your fructose level low.

01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So the lime has virtually
no fructose in it.

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:15.018 align:middle line:90%
So I'd stay away from apples.

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
You can have a few carrots,
but don't use a lot.

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:22.420 align:middle line:84%
And it will actually
provide you with an easy way

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.852 align:middle line:84%
to massively increase the amount
of green vegetable food matter

01:04:25.852 --> 01:04:27.310 align:middle line:84%
that you're getting
into your body.

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:32.400 align:middle line:90%


01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.580 align:middle line:84%
So I just like to mention
one other component

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
about fruit juice,
because of this perception

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:37.370 align:middle line:90%
that it's healthy.

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:39.242 align:middle line:84%
And fruits in relatively
small quantities

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:41.700 align:middle line:84%
are going to be OK, especially
with low insulin resistance.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:45.220 align:middle line:84%
But I want to caution anyone
about buying a commercial fruit

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:46.020 align:middle line:90%
juice.

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:48.430 align:middle line:90%
Don't do it.

01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:49.920 align:middle line:90%
And this is because--

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.800 align:middle line:84%
this actually came out
of the understanding

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
of the whole issue
with aspartame,

01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:58.260 align:middle line:84%
because it has methanol
and formaldehyde toxicity.

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:01.440 align:middle line:84%
And the advocates of
aspartame were saying, well,

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
fruits have plenty of
methanol in it too.

01:05:04.020 --> 01:05:05.170 align:middle line:90%
Yes, they do.

01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:09.120 align:middle line:84%
But in fruits the methanol
is bound up with pectin.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And if you're eating
a raw fresh fruit,

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:14.790 align:middle line:84%
it bypasses through your system
because your body doesn't have

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:16.620 align:middle line:90%
the enzymes to break it down.

01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:21.420 align:middle line:84%
But when you juice it or
separate it from the pulp,

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:23.010 align:middle line:90%
that methanol disassociates.

01:05:23.010 --> 01:05:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And the longer it's in a bottle,
the higher the concentration

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:27.540 align:middle line:90%
will be.

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.570 align:middle line:84%
So you're getting levels
of wood alcohol, which

01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:32.010 align:middle line:90%
are directly toxic.

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:35.490 align:middle line:84%
And there are some fairly
significant studies

01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:38.190 align:middle line:84%
that have a strong
support and association

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:40.950 align:middle line:84%
between that use
of that methanol

01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:43.590 align:middle line:90%
and autoimmune problems like MS.

01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:46.742 align:middle line:84%
So I'd really be careful
about fruit juices.

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:47.700 align:middle line:90%
And I would avoid them.

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.790 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
juice, juice it fresh.

01:05:49.790 --> 01:05:51.630 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a big
fan of fruit juice,

01:05:51.630 --> 01:05:53.740 align:middle line:84%
because if you're going to have
it, just have the whole fruit.

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:54.948 align:middle line:90%
It's a little better for you.

01:05:54.948 --> 01:05:59.490 align:middle line:90%


01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:02.540 align:middle line:84%
So unfortunately, the
typical American breakfast

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.430 align:middle line:90%
is really literally a disaster.

01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:07.220 align:middle line:84%
That's why I like
to be proactive.

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:09.050 align:middle line:90%
And I do travel, of course.

01:06:09.050 --> 01:06:11.420 align:middle line:84%
And when I travel, I
bring my breakfast with me

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I typically have
raw eggs, which you

01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:17.750 align:middle line:84%
can transfer-- organic, free
range raw pasture chickens.

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:20.570 align:middle line:84%
Have the eggs, and
then I have a protein

01:06:20.570 --> 01:06:24.920 align:middle line:84%
that we have-- it was taken
from raw, organic cow milk.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to the raw eggs,
I have some protein powder,

01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:31.040 align:middle line:84%
whey protein, that's
taken and extracted

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:36.140 align:middle line:84%
from organic grass
fed cows, pastured

01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:38.690 align:middle line:90%
cows, that is very healthy.

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:40.220 align:middle line:84%
So I combine that
with the raw eggs

01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and it's a really
beneficial breakfast for me.

01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And I can avoid the
typical American breakfast

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:46.880 align:middle line:90%
which is an absolute disaster.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:51.680 align:middle line:84%
I mean, usually you've got toast
or bagels, cereal, waffles,

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:57.413 align:middle line:84%
pancakes, orange juice that's
probably not only pasteurized

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:58.955 align:middle line:84%
but is in a bottle,
or reconstituted.

01:06:58.955 --> 01:07:00.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's full of methanol
and can potentially

01:07:00.830 --> 01:07:01.940 align:middle line:90%
cause lots of problems.

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:04.135 align:middle line:84%
So really, one of
the simple things

01:07:04.135 --> 01:07:06.510 align:middle line:84%
you can do to improve your
health is never have any soda.

01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:07.843 align:middle line:90%
There's just no reason for soda.

01:07:07.843 --> 01:07:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And then if you were
to focus on one meal,

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:10.850 align:middle line:90%
focus on your breakfast.

01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:13.700 align:middle line:84%
Clean up your breakfast, because
almost universally breakfast

01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:15.740 align:middle line:84%
is a problem for
everyone, because

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.820 align:middle line:84%
the standard American
breakfast is so unhealthy.

01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:21.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you're really
in a bind, and you're

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.232 align:middle line:84%
traveling or something, then
buy a dinner the night before

01:07:24.232 --> 01:07:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and have that dinner,
because it's easier

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:27.940 align:middle line:84%
to find a healthy dinner
than it is a breakfast.

01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:31.083 align:middle line:84%
It is really, really challenging
to find any healthy breakfast.

01:07:31.083 --> 01:07:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think
oatmeal is healthy,

01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:34.550 align:middle line:84%
if you have insulin resistance,
don't do the oatmeal.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:35.883 align:middle line:90%
It is not going to be a problem.

01:07:35.883 --> 01:07:37.733 align:middle line:84%
You really need some
high quality protein.

01:07:37.733 --> 01:07:39.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a green vegetable
juice in the morning

01:07:39.650 --> 01:07:42.108 align:middle line:84%
would be fine too, but you do
need a source a good protein.

01:07:42.108 --> 01:07:45.430 align:middle line:90%
