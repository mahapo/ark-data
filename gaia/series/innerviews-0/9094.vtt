00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:04.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello I'm Chantel Westerman.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.500 align:middle line:84%
One of the best parts
of the Wisdom Workshops

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.740 align:middle line:84%
are the up close and
personal conversations

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.810 align:middle line:84%
with the leading
practitioners and authors

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.460 align:middle line:90%
in the holistic field.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.710 align:middle line:84%
This gives all of
us an opportunity

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.960 align:middle line:84%
to know these people
just a little bit better.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.962 align:middle line:84%
So join me as they share
their wisdom with us.

00:00:21.962 --> 00:00:23.444 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:51.610 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:10%
I have noticed in
your most recent book,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.280 align:middle line:10%
"At Peace in the Light," you
dedicated it to baby boomers.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.530 align:middle line:84%
Being one, of course
I'm delighted.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.060 align:middle line:90%
But what made you do that?

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, because baby
boomers, we are the largest,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:10%
expanded population growth
in the history of Western

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.160 align:middle line:10%
consciousness.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.630 align:middle line:10%
We're at a place
in our lives, born

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.170 align:middle line:10%
between 1939 and
'40 and 1964, we're

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.220 align:middle line:10%
in a place where
we are the power.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.950 align:middle line:10%
We're in the middle
of our lives.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.870 align:middle line:10%
We have a perspective
that is strong.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.902 align:middle line:84%
We've come through
a lot of stuff.

00:01:21.902 --> 00:01:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're also at the
point where so many of us

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:84%
will lose our moms and
dads, brothers, and sisters,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
and aunts, and uncles
at the same time,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.330 align:middle line:84%
literally everybody
in our age group.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're all going to know each
other who's losing someone.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.050 align:middle line:84%
By taking that power, and
the power of the quality

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
and the dignity of
those people who we love

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.140 align:middle line:84%
and who have loved us, we have
the possibility and capability

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.330 align:middle line:84%
of altering
consciousness forever.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Because if we understand
death as a process,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.660 align:middle line:84%
and we understand it the way
that I think I understand it--

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.570 align:middle line:84%
because of going through
three near-death experiences,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.150 align:middle line:84%
and being a hospice
volunteer for over 23 years,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.180 align:middle line:84%
and being with more
than 170 people--

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.580 align:middle line:84%
to change that
mindset will change

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.260 align:middle line:84%
how we view war,
the world ourselves,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.310 align:middle line:90%
and our spirituality.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's start
at the beginning then.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.870 align:middle line:90%
Why is it do you suppose--

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
and if anybody would know, I
would think it would be you--

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.050 align:middle line:84%
why are we so
terrified of death?

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.790 align:middle line:84%
It's like Woody Allen says--
doesn't Woody Allen say--

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.540 align:middle line:84%
I'm not afraid of
death, I just don't want

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.720 align:middle line:90%
to be there when it happens?

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's wonderful.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.587 align:middle line:90%
I'll remember that.

00:02:25.587 --> 00:02:26.920 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what Woody Allen says.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:90%
>> We are taught Chantel--

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.880 align:middle line:90%
we are taught to be afraid--

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.170 align:middle line:84%
religions, institutions,
and governments.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.430 align:middle line:84%
There is also an innate nature
within the human experience

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.070 align:middle line:90%
of the unknown, or fear of that.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And so with those combinations,
and a lot of religious dogma

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.000 align:middle line:84%
and fervor, a lot of
institutional play

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.870 align:middle line:84%
psychologies, like in
medicine, and that death

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.105 align:middle line:84%
is an evil villain that
you always must defeat,

00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:84%
and these kinds of
psychologies, we have--

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and then a so-called cult
attachment to it from

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.040 align:middle line:90%
a religious context--

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.130 align:middle line:84%
then we have a whole world
that has supported us

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:90%
in being afraid.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.340 align:middle line:84%
But we, of the baby
boomer generation,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.990 align:middle line:90%
we don't have a choice.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.290 align:middle line:84%
It's our moms and dads, it's
not a statistic, or psychology,

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.170 align:middle line:84%
or something happening
way off somewhere else.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.660 align:middle line:84%
It's our moms and dads, and
our brothers and sisters,

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.740 align:middle line:90%
we must deal with it.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:16.740 align:middle line:90%
We must face it.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And we must find a way
to, in our own lives,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:84%
be able to look at it,
so we can help our moms

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.660 align:middle line:84%
and dads in their transition
in making the right decisions.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, of course, you know
it's astonishing for some people

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.980 align:middle line:90%
to hear you say, I died.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.680 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I died twice.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Some people probably
don't believe you.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.020 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't blame them.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:84%
I would have never believed
any of this, Chantel.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'm a jerk
from South Carolina.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.550 align:middle line:90%
I'm 48 years old, redneck.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:90%
I grew up deep of the Carolinas.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, everybody goes
to hell where I come from.

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.760 align:middle line:90%
And I don't buy into that.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.500 align:middle line:10%
When I heard all that
stuff growing up,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:10%
all that fire and
brimstone, I don't buy it.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.577 align:middle line:10%
And people who do whole
life expos and stuff

00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:10%
like this, and people who
even watch the Wisdom Channel,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.440 align:middle line:10%
I said they're retarded.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:10%
Until you get hit in the
neck by a bolt of lightning.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.030 align:middle line:90%
You're dead for 28 minutes.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.890 align:middle line:84%
You're completely paralyzed for
six days, partially paralyzed

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:13.690 align:middle line:90%
for seven months.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.310 align:middle line:84%
It takes you two years to learn
to walk and feed yourself.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:90%
You lose about fifty pounds.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.420 align:middle line:84%
You wear welder's
glasses for four years.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And you walk with
canes and crutches.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Then you all of a sudden
change your perspective

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.920 align:middle line:90%
about the game.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:90%
>> You did that?

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.990 align:middle line:90%
Hello.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I had a near-death
experience on top of that.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Not only did I feel
the searing pain

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and the horror of a
literally terminal accident--

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:84%
catastrophic accident--
that would kill anybody.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.205 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a near-death
experience,

00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:42.550 align:middle line:84%
where I lifted out of my
body, moved down a tunnel,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.920 align:middle line:84%
came into a place of
light and wonderment,

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.980 align:middle line:84%
explored my own self, the
panoramic life review.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.533 align:middle line:84%
Moved to great
cities and mansions,

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:52.450 align:middle line:84%
great, what you would
call mansions, but great

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.430 align:middle line:84%
crystal cities, and
places of learning,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.692 align:middle line:84%
and a whole world that
I never even thought

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:58.150 align:middle line:84%
existed or wouldn't
of believed it.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's over there
and it's there.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.000 align:middle line:84%
So if people don't
believe it, that's OK.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.590 align:middle line:90%
We have our rights.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.600 align:middle line:84%
But you better
believe something,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.930 align:middle line:84%
because if you leave
your mom in a hospital,

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.640 align:middle line:84%
or you leave them in a managed
care system, or your brother

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:84%
or your sister, and you watch
the torture that goes on,

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and you watch what happens to
the dignity and quality of life

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.440 align:middle line:84%
as we have received death today,
then you have done an evil.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.110 align:middle line:84%
You have done something
that takes away

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.630 align:middle line:84%
from the quality of
people who have loved you.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.220 align:middle line:90%
So I changed that.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.410 align:middle line:84%
I have been through three
near-death experiences,

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.210 align:middle line:90%
one death experience--

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.380 align:middle line:90%
struck by lightning.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.430 align:middle line:90%
But because of this--

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.510 align:middle line:84%
I got struck by
lightning again in 1978.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.510 align:middle line:84%
And in 1989, I collapsed
and had a heart failure,

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.430 align:middle line:84%
and had to have emergency
open heart surgery,

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.030 align:middle line:90%
with no chance to survive.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And in 1997, because of
complications from my heart,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.570 align:middle line:84%
from complications
from the lightning,

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.980 align:middle line:84%
I had three subdural
hematomas explode in my brain.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And I had to have
brain surgery with less

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.290 align:middle line:90%
than a 8% chance of survival.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.440 align:middle line:84%
They were going to
cut my scalp open,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:84%
take away a third of my
skull, cut my chest open

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
at the same time, so that
they could work on my heart.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Because of the blood
clots would kill me

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.070 align:middle line:90%
after open heart surgery.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:10%
>> I would say two near-death
and one death experience

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:10%
qualifies as some very,
very powerful messages.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.400 align:middle line:84%
I wonder if you know where
they came from, these messages.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are
two points to this.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.780 align:middle line:84%
The first thing,
Chantel, is the system

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.800 align:middle line:90%
by which we leave this world.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.520 align:middle line:84%
I have been through
the system three times.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.160 align:middle line:84%
Whoever created this system,
by where you lift out

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.947 align:middle line:84%
of your body, you
move down to a tunnel,

00:06:39.947 --> 00:06:42.030 align:middle line:84%
you come to a place of
brilliant, beautiful light,

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.670 align:middle line:84%
you're met by
relatives and friends.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.550 align:middle line:84%
You have a panoramic
life review.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And then you move on into
a more expansive wonderment

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:49.650 align:middle line:90%
about yourself.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.170 align:middle line:84%
Whoever created this
loved us dearly.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.130 align:middle line:84%
I think that the messages
come from my spiritual self

00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:00.930 align:middle line:84%
and my connectedness to
spirituality on the other side.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.690 align:middle line:84%
We are great powerful and
mighty spiritual beings.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.020 align:middle line:90%
That is home.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:84%
This is just some place
we come to do a job.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.540 align:middle line:84%
And we do it well
and we go back home.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
So where this message comes from
is, number one, hi, Dannion,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:90%
you idiot.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.875 align:middle line:90%
We have to keep you on track.

00:07:15.875 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:84%
And your head is
so hard, we have

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.420 align:middle line:84%
to kill you to get
your attention.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, I think that's what my
spiritual self is teaching me.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.680 align:middle line:10%
And I have to learn
it really tough.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:10%
But that side over there
is where we are from.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:10%
It is a whole systems that
I don't really comprehend

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.590 align:middle line:10%
or have language to describe.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.160 align:middle line:90%
But this is our home.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.110 align:middle line:84%
It has many diverse levels and
more dynamic and more wondrous

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:41.280 align:middle line:90%
than here.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:84%
But it is an opportunity to
develop spiritual greatness

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.900 align:middle line:90%
by coming here.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the proving
ground, the training area,

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.290 align:middle line:84%
the place to become
almost godlike yourself

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.370 align:middle line:84%
with those types of
responsibilities.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Do we all leave that way?

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Is that a reason
not to be afraid?

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.725 align:middle line:84%
Because I think people
are afraid to die,

00:08:03.725 --> 00:08:05.350 align:middle line:84%
because they're afraid
of the darkness.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.080 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of the pain.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:10.050 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of the unknown.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So you tell us that the way
we die is in light and love.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.820 align:middle line:84%
>> The most beautiful
art form ever created.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.348 align:middle line:84%
>> The transition from
this world back home.

00:08:20.348 --> 00:08:21.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't know about birth.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:84%
It seems to me if I think
of birth in the same context

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:84%
as I look at death,
you come from

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.590 align:middle line:84%
to be the most awesome,
powerful, mighty spiritual

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.530 align:middle line:90%
being, with greatness about you.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.080 align:middle line:84%
And then you marry yourself
to live on a head of a pin.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.150 align:middle line:84%
You block off your own
spiritual consciousness

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.919 align:middle line:84%
an understanding
of who you are, so

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:41.580 align:middle line:84%
that you can develop
and explore a world,

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.919 align:middle line:84%
physically and mentally,
as opposed to spiritually.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.940 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time accomplish
greatness for the heavenly host

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.300 align:middle line:90%
to achieve.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.030 align:middle line:84%
So I think I'd
whole lot rather be

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:84%
leaving this world then
coming into it, when

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.390 align:middle line:90%
I think of those two.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:90%
>> When you put it that way--

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.660 align:middle line:90%
>> No one should fear death.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.135 align:middle line:84%
It is wrong the way that we
of the Western consciousness

00:09:00.135 --> 00:09:03.792 align:middle line:84%
have separated from the fact
that it's a part of life.

00:09:03.792 --> 00:09:05.250 align:middle line:84%
The more we embrace
it, the more we

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.500 align:middle line:84%
understand it, the greater
we understand and love

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.020 align:middle line:90%
this life that we have.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.450 align:middle line:90%
And we have no fear.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.900 align:middle line:84%
I have absolutely no fear
of leaving this world

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.960 align:middle line:84%
after having these three
experiences, absolutely none.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.080 align:middle line:84%
It's a basic concept that
comes from those of us who have

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.410 align:middle line:90%
had near-death experiences.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:21.210 align:middle line:90%
>> You're right.

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:90%
You're absolutely right.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:24.780 align:middle line:84%
Because everyone I
have talked to who

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:84%
has had a near-death experience
somehow, oddly enough, make me

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:36.330 align:middle line:84%
and everyone who watches
Wisdom, comfortable and unafraid

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.800 align:middle line:90%
of the idea of death.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's a powerful message.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:40.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.690 align:middle line:84%
But I think one of the other
messages that Wisdom channel is

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.270 align:middle line:84%
offering too, is
an ancillary way

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.150 align:middle line:90%
to look at all this information.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.970 align:middle line:84%
A way to look at yourself from
a spiritual point of view.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:84%
This is the wonderment of what's
happening in this revolution.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
And that this is
on the forefront.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.900 align:middle line:84%
We who live in this world,
where death is nothing to me--

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.450 align:middle line:84%
it's just something you
help families get through

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and you help that person make
their transition properly,

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.530 align:middle line:84%
and I send another
brother and sister home.

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh no, wait.

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.590 align:middle line:90%
I have to stop you there.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.090 align:middle line:90%
Death is a big deal.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.310 align:middle line:84%
And death is a very big deal
to those people who you help.

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.910 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about,
for just a bit,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:23.520 align:middle line:84%
what your experiences have led
you to, which is hospice work.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.030 align:middle line:84%
Which by the way, is another
thing that frightens people.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You're around people
who die all day.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.168 align:middle line:90%
Dan--

00:10:30.168 --> 00:10:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you're right, Chantel.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my gosh, you're around--

00:10:33.162 --> 00:10:35.230 align:middle line:84%
what do you mean,
you help people die?

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:37.350 align:middle line:90%
How do you help someone die?

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:39.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Every way I know how.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:41.210 align:middle line:84%
When you go through
the experience--

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.470 align:middle line:84%
I not only know what
it's like to be afraid,

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.970 align:middle line:84%
I know what it's
like to face death.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.137 align:middle line:84%
I know what it's like to
die, to see the other side,

00:10:47.137 --> 00:10:48.420 align:middle line:90%
and to come back.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I have been struck by
lightning, electrocuted.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.180 align:middle line:90%
I have had open heart surgery.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.880 align:middle line:90%
I have had brain surgery.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:84%
I have had such
critical situations

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.940 align:middle line:84%
that I understand what it's
like to look up at the ceiling

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.890 align:middle line:84%
and what it's like
also to look down.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:90%
I've been both people.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.920 align:middle line:90%
What led me to hospice was me.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:90%
I was my first hospice patient.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.840 align:middle line:90%
They sent me home to die.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And from there, as I studied
that I was not going to die,

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.170 align:middle line:84%
and everything and how I
watched people react to me,

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:84%
knowing what I looked like as
I emaciated away and atrophy

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.540 align:middle line:84%
was setting in,
what I looked like,

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.910 align:middle line:84%
and the horror that
came in their life.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:84%
And also being intuitive, I
knew I could do something.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.060 align:middle line:84%
I knew there was something
in my life that could affect,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
and I could affect change, in
me and in people around me.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:90%
And I began to do hospice work.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:39.810 align:middle line:90%
Then I--

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:42.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So-- so, then
your work today,

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:84%
is not only teaching us to
be unafraid of the concept

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.230 align:middle line:84%
of death, but
literally how to die.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, an art form.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:90%
Literally, how to help a family.

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I can teach a person
how to be intuitive.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:84%
I can teach a person how to
become a transition specialist.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.195 align:middle line:84%
I believe that there are
those of us who come--

00:12:05.195 --> 00:12:06.570 align:middle line:84%
and there are a
lot of the people

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.660 align:middle line:84%
who listen to my
programs and shows,

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.250 align:middle line:84%
and who become a part
of compassion and action

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.153 align:middle line:90%
that are trained to do this.

00:12:13.153 --> 00:12:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's be clear, so people
watching this understand what

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:16.403 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about.

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:20.897 align:middle line:84%
When you say, compassion and
action, that's your program.

00:12:20.897 --> 00:12:21.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Compassion and action--

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>> That's your project.

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my life's work.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.700 align:middle line:10%
Compassion and action
is a foundation

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.550 align:middle line:10%
that trains people to
help those they love

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.980 align:middle line:10%
and who love them
make that transition.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:37.560 align:middle line:10%
Today there are 32,420
combat WWII veterans leaving

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.900 align:middle line:10%
this world every 30 days.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.850 align:middle line:90%
They need us.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.600 align:middle line:84%
We were there-- they
were there for us,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.250 align:middle line:90%
and we must be there for them--

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:90%
32,000.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.420 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a choice but
to learn and know death

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.980 align:middle line:84%
as it truly is, as opposed to
what we've been being taught.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:56.480 align:middle line:84%
And then it gives
us a chance-- when

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.300 align:middle line:84%
you're not afraid of
dying, Chantel, then you're

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.980 align:middle line:90%
not afraid of living.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And wisdom and knowledge
becomes the power.

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:06.380 align:middle line:84%
I have so much more
of my life that I

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
can explore things, that air
on these shows, these programs.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.690 align:middle line:90%
I know you don't die.

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:13.310 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
I know everything.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.685 align:middle line:84%
I know that you're a powerful
and mighty spiritual being,

00:13:15.685 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:84%
but I don't know about
the pyramids or some

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.520 align:middle line:84%
of the great mystical
things that we've all

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.488 align:middle line:84%
been taught about that
now we know are true.

00:13:22.488 --> 00:13:23.780 align:middle line:90%
And I want to learn about them.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:35.080 align:middle line:10%
>> Even if the greatest skeptic
in the world were to sit down

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:10%
in a room with you, he
couldn't help but feel your--

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.090 align:middle line:10%
dare I say, vibration--
your energy.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's very,
very powerful.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.300 align:middle line:84%
Do you think this
comes from your work?

00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Partially.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.355 align:middle line:84%
I think because
I'm a windowpane.

00:13:52.355 --> 00:13:54.480 align:middle line:10%
Not the sun that shines,
nor the warmth that enters

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:10%
a room on a hot August day.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm just a means by which
that light can pass to this

00:13:58.630 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:10%
world.

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:00.970 align:middle line:84%
When you're not
afraid of death, you

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:03.070 align:middle line:90%
open up your spiritual self.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:06.700 align:middle line:84%
You don't shut off the source
of your true life, which is what

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.040 align:middle line:90%
they say happens when you die.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the source of your life.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.940 align:middle line:84%
What flows through
me and the sheer joy

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.430 align:middle line:84%
of knowing that I can make
a difference in the life

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:84%
of a person, who is
terrified, and a family trying

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:90%
to make the right decisions.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:84%
I can train people to be
that, a transition specialist.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.050 align:middle line:84%
To be able to know when you
walk out of that room that day,

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.500 align:middle line:84%
you have helped a person pass
home, safe and protected.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And you've given a
family quality of dignity

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:39.020 align:middle line:84%
in the life of how they handled
it, a way to have closure.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.730 align:middle line:84%
It's as much what I
train people to do

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.550 align:middle line:84%
to help that family
that stays behind

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.170 align:middle line:90%
as those who go on ahead.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that
molds the family unit.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.370 align:middle line:90%
It puts a spiritual context.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:50.530 align:middle line:84%
It gives a place to
resolve so many issues

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.420 align:middle line:84%
and have closure on
a part of their life,

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.970 align:middle line:84%
so that they can open up
collectively and grow together

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:55.870 align:middle line:90%
in their new life.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.610 align:middle line:90%
And they can seek wisdom.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.160 align:middle line:84%
They can seek knowledge,
and seek a unity and a love

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.910 align:middle line:84%
for each other, that I think
will pull back together what's

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:06.460 align:middle line:84%
happening to this country
and the rest of the world.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:08.590 align:middle line:84%
>> How many years have
you been in hospice work?

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.270 align:middle line:90%
>> 23 years.

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:15.010 align:middle line:84%
November becomes my 22
years, because November

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.380 align:middle line:90%
becomes my 23rd year.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.090 align:middle line:84%
>> That's amazing that
you've done it for that long.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I love it.

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.360 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.277 align:middle line:90%
Yes, there's sad days.

00:15:23.277 --> 00:15:24.077 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:15:24.077 --> 00:15:26.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there's some stuff where
you have to go off and cry.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.620 align:middle line:84%
I love it, because I
know that if I help

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:31.750 align:middle line:90%
those who leave this world--

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.440 align:middle line:84%
and I help them
leave this world--

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Literally.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Literally.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> You're there
holding their hand.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:39.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Holding their hand
and talking to them,

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.950 align:middle line:84%
using my techniques--
aromatherapy, color therapy,

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:46.120 align:middle line:84%
music therapy,
subtle energy, touch.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.180 align:middle line:84%
Certain things like this, the
complementary alternatives that

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.450 align:middle line:84%
reduces pain, reduces medicine,
and the feeling of someone

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.250 align:middle line:84%
there who cares and who loves
you, that you've never met--

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:56.050 align:middle line:90%
it changes.

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.825 align:middle line:84%
But also remember this,
Chantel, the next person

00:15:58.825 --> 00:16:00.700 align:middle line:84%
they're going to see is
that powerful, mighty

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:90%
spiritual being.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.193 align:middle line:84%
And I always tell them
just before they go, psst,

00:16:04.193 --> 00:16:06.610 align:middle line:84%
tell him I'm doing a good job
when you get over there, you

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:09.140 align:middle line:84%
know what I mean, because
you kind of stack the deck.

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.920 align:middle line:84%
If you know you don't die--
and I know you don't die,

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.317 align:middle line:90%
and I know where they go.

00:16:13.317 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:90%
I know who they're going to see.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.630 align:middle line:84%
Don't you think I'm
pretty smart by becoming

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.180 align:middle line:90%
a hospice volunteer.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Having done it 22
years, my question is,

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:28.480 align:middle line:84%
what changes have you
seen for the better?

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:84%
Because certainly
22 years ago, people

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.280 align:middle line:84%
were saying, hospice work,
dying, spiritual beings,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.080 align:middle line:90%
yeah, OK.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a great--

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.797 align:middle line:90%
>> How has it changed?

00:16:37.797 --> 00:16:39.460 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a great
question, Chantel.

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:90%
I have seen a revolution.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.800 align:middle line:84%
>> The near-death experience
has pulled the value of death

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.230 align:middle line:90%
to mainstream.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.600 align:middle line:10%
And that we, the baby
boomers, we have no choice.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.100 align:middle line:10%
And through near-death
experiences--

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.200 align:middle line:10%
and 14 million other
people just like me,

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.860 align:middle line:10%
who's had some form of it--

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.040 align:middle line:10%
we have created a
way that a paradigm

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:58.780 align:middle line:10%
has come into existence.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:16:59.740 align:middle line:90%
It's here.

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Raymond Moody, Ken Ring,
Bruce Greyson, Michael Saybom,

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:03.910 align:middle line:90%
Betty Eddy--

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:90%
some of the-- Ian Stevenson.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:08.000 align:middle line:90%
These names-- Ken Ring--

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000 align:middle line:84%
these names have
revolutionized--

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.470 align:middle line:84%
Elizabeth Kruger
Ross-- these names

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:14.290 align:middle line:84%
have revolutionized
how we view death.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.030 align:middle line:90%
I see the changes.

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:20.180 align:middle line:84%
I see the changes in people
opening up, no critical care,

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.540 align:middle line:84%
"Rights of the Dying,"
David Kessler, which

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.140 align:middle line:84%
is an excellent book, that
tells you there's a revolution.

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.300 align:middle line:84%
We're not listening
to that doctor.

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:29.590 align:middle line:90%
We're making the decisions.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:90%
Quality and dignity of life.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Hospice itself came
to America in 1974.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And today, more than
92% of all doctors

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.490 align:middle line:84%
won't refer a
patient to hospice.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:41.950 align:middle line:84%
But that was better than
100% five years ago.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Why not?

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:46.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it means that
they've been defeated.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:84%
I'm not against the
medical community.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I work with the National
Institute of Health.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:52.900 align:middle line:84%
I look at research, the
National Cancer Society,

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.540 align:middle line:84%
because in hospice work, you
have to be knowledgeable.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.460 align:middle line:84%
You have to
understand protocols.

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:59.420 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
pain management.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.300 align:middle line:84%
You have to
understand the things

00:18:01.300 --> 00:18:03.880 align:middle line:84%
that if you know about it,
you can best help your friend

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.950 align:middle line:90%
in transition and the family.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.870 align:middle line:84%
You have to understand
these things.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.120 align:middle line:84%
But doctors have
been taught, they're

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.210 align:middle line:84%
just as afraid of
dying as anybody else.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.170 align:middle line:84%
They compartmentalized
their identity

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.570 align:middle line:84%
so they don't have to
emotionally get involved.

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:90%
Then they just become chemists.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.190 align:middle line:90%
And I've watched this.

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.160 align:middle line:84%
But I've seen a transition
in a lot of places.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
One of the oddest places
that you would ever

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.810 align:middle line:84%
imagine a revolution
is going on,

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.920 align:middle line:90%
the Veterans Administration.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.128 align:middle line:90%
The VA is on the forefront.

00:18:33.128 --> 00:18:35.170 align:middle line:84%
And you have all those
horror stories about them.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And I know most of them.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>> They're terrible stories.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm in there are a
lot, and a lot of that's true,

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.020 align:middle line:84%
but there is a
revolution going on.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:84%
The VAs will lead us into the
21st century in a revolution.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.083 align:middle line:90%
>> What's happening?

00:18:47.083 --> 00:18:47.883 align:middle line:90%
How is that?

00:18:47.883 --> 00:18:49.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Health care is
changing, using alternative

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.060 align:middle line:90%
and complementary.

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.520 align:middle line:90%
They'll attempt to do anything.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.710 align:middle line:84%
They don't have as many
bias and prejudice.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.900 align:middle line:84%
They open their doors
to train people.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:90%
They're looking at hospice.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.470 align:middle line:90%
They're not afraid.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.270 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, there are old
boundaries and old ways,

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.960 align:middle line:10%
but I am so proud
to work in the VAs.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.425 align:middle line:10%
And I'm proud.

00:19:06.425 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:10%
And to see what the
capability and potential

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.020 align:middle line:10%
is to revolutionize
consciousness,

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:10%
to revolutionize consciousness.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm so glad that I found it.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.440 align:middle line:84%
The Office of
Alternative Medicine

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.040 align:middle line:84%
has become now the Center for
Alternative Medicine, where

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.710 align:middle line:84%
the mainstream medical
profession is looking

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.080 align:middle line:84%
at complementary and
alternative things, which

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:28.910 align:middle line:90%
opens up a whole new world.

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:31.995 align:middle line:84%
With the Wisdom channel,
now it's not fringe.

00:19:31.995 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
The Wisdom channel
is not fringe.

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:34.645 align:middle line:90%
It's a specialty market.

00:19:34.645 --> 00:19:36.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to go back to
something that has for some

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.390 align:middle line:90%
reason stayed in my mind.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
It has resonated in my
mind since you said it.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.580 align:middle line:84%
A little while ago you said,
I've helped 171 people die.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.460 align:middle line:84%
And since you do it all
the time that must have--

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:53.520 align:middle line:84%
that must mean you literally
just left your 171st person.

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:54.320 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.580 align:middle line:84%
Now listen to who
my 171st person is.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.890 align:middle line:84%
The guy who was on the
other end of the phone

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:05.810 align:middle line:84%
when I was struck by lightning
in 1975, Tommy Hall, my best

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:06.840 align:middle line:90%
friend.

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.600 align:middle line:90%
It's his mom.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.580 align:middle line:84%
She will last only
a few days from now.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.620 align:middle line:90%
His mom.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:13.610 align:middle line:90%
I get to go--

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.630 align:middle line:84%
at this stage of my
life, as I look at me--

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:90%
back to the first day.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:84%
Back to a friend that I've
known since I was 10 years old.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:24.530 align:middle line:84%
Back to the other
end of the telephone.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And back to who is
literally my second mother.

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.900 align:middle line:84%
She knows everything
about me from a kid.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.510 align:middle line:90%
And I'm there with her.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:34.610 align:middle line:84%
And we talk, and we explore
my life and her life,

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.110 align:middle line:84%
and the art forms
that I've learned.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'm perfecting skills,
because she will answer

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.070 align:middle line:90%
questions and tell me things.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.970 align:middle line:90%
>> She's not afraid?

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:41.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:44.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we've been together for
so long, we talked about it.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:45.190 align:middle line:90%
We went through it.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And I literally told
her, I said, you know,

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.910 align:middle line:84%
your time here has
come and it's going.

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:52.370 align:middle line:84%
And we had a family
review, like a life review,

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.772 align:middle line:84%
where her family is as I see
them, create that comfort zone.

00:20:55.772 --> 00:20:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And then teach her
about the light,

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.647 align:middle line:84%
and teach her about
the breathing.

00:20:58.647 --> 00:21:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's a thrill
to help Estelle.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.540 align:middle line:90%
It's a thrill.

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a privilege.

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.180 align:middle line:90%
I am not sad.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.730 align:middle line:84%
One of my sisters goes home
and I get a chance to help her.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And I get a chance to help
Bill, which is her husband,

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:12.110 align:middle line:90%
and Tommy.

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:16.070 align:middle line:84%
And this is where it all
started, 23 years ago, in 1975.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:19.310 align:middle line:84%
And today, I'm fulfilling
it by being there with them.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:84%
What more does a man
ask for in the distance

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.100 align:middle line:84%
that he has traveled, and even
with the adversity, than be

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:28.070 align:middle line:84%
able to bring that together
in a loving way, comforting

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:30.270 align:middle line:84%
a family who has loved
you since a child,

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:32.420 align:middle line:84%
and who you get to give
your love back in something

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm not afraid of.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And they watch it,
and they see it.

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.190 align:middle line:10%
And it's a sheer privilege.

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:41.750 align:middle line:10%
To learn the art of transition
and to sit with someone

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:46.130 align:middle line:10%
and use it, you will grow
so fast, so spiritually.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:48.710 align:middle line:84%
You will have such might,
comfort, and freedom

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.160 align:middle line:90%
in your own identity.

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.390 align:middle line:84%
You will change you and
the world around you.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:90%
It has happened to me.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:59.120 align:middle line:84%
And I'm proud that I
get the privilege to be

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.980 align:middle line:90%
with people in transition.

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:02.430 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:90%
I love them.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I will tell you what
else is a great privilege,

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.090 align:middle line:90%
and that is speaking with you.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for visiting
with us today.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It was just wonderful
to talk with you.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:13.940 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:90%
Absolute pleasure.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.830 align:middle line:90%
