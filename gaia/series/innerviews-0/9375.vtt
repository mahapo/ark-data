00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:02.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.160 align:middle line:90%
I'm Chantal Westerman.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the best parts
of the Wisdom Workshops

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.720 align:middle line:84%
are the up close and
personal conversations

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.790 align:middle line:84%
with the leading
practitioners and authors

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.440 align:middle line:90%
in the holistic field.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.690 align:middle line:84%
This gives all of
us an opportunity

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.940 align:middle line:84%
to know these people
just a little bit better.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.442 align:middle line:84%
So join me as they share
their wisdom with us.

[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.880 align:middle line:10%
Your book deals with
enhancing our lives

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.210 align:middle line:10%
with universal energy.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.100 align:middle line:10%
For the benefit of
people who might not

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:10%
know what it is, what is that
energy you're talking about?

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, in the spiritual
sense, some people call it god

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.240 align:middle line:90%
or spirit.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.310 align:middle line:10%
But there's some
intelligence that

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.108 align:middle line:10%
makes the planets revolve around
the sun without us thinking

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:18.650 align:middle line:10%
about it, makes our heart beat
without us constantly thinking

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.600 align:middle line:10%
about it, take a breath.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.700 align:middle line:90%
And you can harness this energy.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.790 align:middle line:84%
And it's this ultimate,
infinite energy.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can harness
it to focus it

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.540 align:middle line:84%
on different areas of your
life and get whatever you want.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, what's interesting
is, in my travels,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.270 align:middle line:84%
I have found that there are some
people who believe this way.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:90%
Well, Stacy has it, but I don't.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.077 align:middle line:90%
>> We all have it.

00:01:43.077 --> 00:01:43.910 align:middle line:90%
You know what it is?

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a technical skill.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.740 align:middle line:84%
It's a technical skill
that we can all use,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.020 align:middle line:90%
that's very immediate.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can all harness
it to change our lives.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely so easy.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.430 align:middle line:84%
I think the thing
is that we were all

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.430 align:middle line:90%
taught we don't have it.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And we were also taught
that it's very esoteric

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and takes years to develop,
which is not true, absolutely

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.050 align:middle line:90%
not true.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.039 align:middle line:84%
We're not taught just how to
open up and look within and ask

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.706 align:middle line:84%
ourselves the right questions in
order to get the right answers.

00:02:12.706 --> 00:02:14.840 align:middle line:84%
We're not taught that
skill, that plug-in skill.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:84%
And it really does take
five or 10 minutes a day.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And it really is--
immediate results

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.910 align:middle line:84%
happen when you start
plugging into this energy.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You're so right.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, until you said
that, I didn't realize it.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.500 align:middle line:90%
But you're right.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
We're taught-- we're taught
that we don't have it.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.710 align:middle line:90%
Are people afraid of it?

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Were our parents afraid of it?

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Were their parents afraid of it?

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you know what?

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.660 align:middle line:90%
I guess so.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't-- I always rejected
what I was always--

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.573 align:middle line:84%
even when I was in high
school and I became interested

00:02:44.573 --> 00:02:46.490 align:middle line:84%
in this, I would go to
the library and look up

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.550 align:middle line:90%
in the esoteric section.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
And I would get all
these books out.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And they all said, oh, well,
you have to stand on your head,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.660 align:middle line:84%
and meditate for 20 hours,
and give up all your worldly

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.500 align:middle line:90%
possessions.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:55.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's not true.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.430 align:middle line:84%
You can have great
things and have

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.080 align:middle line:84%
a great sense of inner
power at the same time.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:10%
And you don't have to--

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.140 align:middle line:10%
I think way back when,
someone shysted us and said

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.360 align:middle line:10%
that we had to give up all
our worldly possessions

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.000 align:middle line:10%
and all our desires in order
to be spiritual in this sense.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.770 align:middle line:10%
And it's just not true.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:10%
I just-- I also think there
wasn't a need to connect

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.750 align:middle line:10%
with it as there is today.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very important point.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that way back when
my parents were growing up,

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.570 align:middle line:84%
they had an ideal
for themselves,

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
and it didn't include
this sixth sense.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And there was rules
that were just--

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.500 align:middle line:90%
society lived by certain rules.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.540 align:middle line:90%
And there are no rules today.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
And you can even look
at the stock market

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and look at the way we live our
lives, and there are no rules.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we need--
that sixth sense is the rule,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.880 align:middle line:90%
is the way to get--

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.660 align:middle line:84%
to be safe, and to prosper,
and to enhance your life

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.920 align:middle line:84%
in such a way that you can
have everything you want.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.295 align:middle line:84%
>> And here's
what's interesting.

00:04:00.295 --> 00:04:03.470 align:middle line:84%
Your generation-- what
are you, Generation Xers?

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.010 align:middle line:90%
Is that--

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.550 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, one of the older
versions of the Gen Xers, yes.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.070 align:middle line:84%
>> You're one of the older
versions out of the Generation

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.050 align:middle line:90%
Xers.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.940 align:middle line:84%
Have the Gen Xers become, in a
sense, the teachers of today?

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I think-- this is
the thing with Gen X.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.270 align:middle line:84%
When we were first
graduating from college,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.730 align:middle line:84%
people used to say, oh,
we're such slackers,

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.700 align:middle line:84%
because we really rejected the
places that society had for us.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And the more-- we are so
much more independent.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.150 align:middle line:84%
We are-- more entrepreneurs
are in their 20s and early 30s

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.910 align:middle line:90%
and are making new rules.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- in that
way, I think it's great,

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:90%
I think, in a way that we are.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.360 align:middle line:84%
But for a long time we
were rejected by society.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And now I think that this
sort of new expansive

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.480 align:middle line:84%
thought that we
have sort of added--

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
as we grow and as we find
our place in the world,

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.980 align:middle line:84%
I think that is
really catching on.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:01.820 align:middle line:90%
And I like that.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I do too.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.390 align:middle line:84%
It's very interesting
having young teachers.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.740 align:middle line:90%
>> It gives us all a place.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.460 align:middle line:84%
It gives us all a
place to fit in.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.440 align:middle line:90%
>> When did you know you had--

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.920 align:middle line:90%
well, would I call it a gift?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes and no.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.280 align:middle line:84%
This is my whole thing
about psychic abilities.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we all have it.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.920 align:middle line:84%
But just like
basketball players--

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we can all
play basketball.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.940 align:middle line:84%
But how many Michael Jordans
or how many professional NBA

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.070 align:middle line:90%
players are out there?

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.580 align:middle line:90%
So we all have it.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.470 align:middle line:90%
It just depends on what degree.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.893 align:middle line:84%
And I definitely
think this is a gift.

00:05:33.893 --> 00:05:35.810 align:middle line:84%
But just like an opera
singer, an opera singer

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:90%
can have the greatest gift.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.608 align:middle line:84%
But unless they devote
their entire life to it,

00:05:38.608 --> 00:05:39.590 align:middle line:90%
they wouldn't know.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And I had my first
experience when I was three.

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Three?

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Three.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.140 align:middle line:84%
We were waiting for the nursery
school bus, my mother and I.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.460 align:middle line:90%
And the bus was late.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.260 align:middle line:10%
And I initially
looked up and said,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.630 align:middle line:10%
well, you know,
Ma, the bus is late

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.153 align:middle line:10%
because Miss Mary broke
her arm last night.

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:10%
And Miss Mary is the driver.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.790 align:middle line:10%
And sure enough,
the bus came late,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:57.840 align:middle line:10%
and Miss Mary wasn't driving.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.215 align:middle line:84%
And nobody could
figure out how I

00:05:59.215 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:84%
knew that Miss Mary had broken
her arm the night before.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:90%
And that was it.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.310 align:middle line:84%
My parents were so freaked
by that, they were like--

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So I don't think I made
another prediction for many

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.400 align:middle line:90%
years after that.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.950 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.730 align:middle line:84%
>> So then somewhere, you
picked up the thread again

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.850 align:middle line:84%
in your life and you realized,
I have something here.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:90%
How did that manifest?

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was growing up, it
manifested in that I would be

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.790 align:middle line:84%
able to find things
around the house.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.090 align:middle line:84%
So my mother would say, you
know, go find the ice bucket.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.400 align:middle line:84%
And I would just be able
to find things in our very

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.210 align:middle line:90%
cluttered closets in the house

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.580 align:middle line:84%
And then when I
was in high school,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.342 align:middle line:84%
the little trend was to carry
a teeny little sports-type bag

00:06:37.342 --> 00:06:38.550 align:middle line:90%
with you to school every day.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:90%
And I would know--

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.740 align:middle line:84%
every day, I would
know what to put in it.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.850 align:middle line:84%
So I would say, I need a
bobby pin, a safety pin,

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.100 align:middle line:84%
an extra pen, a pencil, a
nail file, whatever, like,

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.270 align:middle line:90%
the most obscure little things.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And people would
always say to me,

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.273 align:middle line:84%
you know, you always
have everything, Stacy.

00:06:51.273 --> 00:06:54.720 align:middle line:84%
And my answer was always,
no, I only have what I need.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And I started
becoming fascinated

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.860 align:middle line:84%
with all sorts of
occult, fascinated

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.050 align:middle line:84%
with all sorts of
occult studies.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:05.107 align:middle line:84%
And I studied palm reading and
handwriting and those studies

00:07:05.107 --> 00:07:06.190 align:middle line:90%
when I was in high school.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.130 align:middle line:84%
And I guess it started
from there again.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.840 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about
enhancing your life.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:84%
Was there a time when
your life was not good,

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:15.610 align:middle line:84%
when you were unhappy,
when things around you

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:16.410 align:middle line:90%
were miserable?

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I can-- it was not so long
ago that I could tell you that

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.320 align:middle line:90%
I was really unhappy.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.200 align:middle line:90%
I was working at MTV.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.060 align:middle line:84%
I was a writer and
associate producer.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't feel like my
career was going anywhere.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:84%
I was at least 15 pounds
heavier than I am now.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
I can look back and say,
when I was 25, I looked 30.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.990 align:middle line:90%
I just was so unhappy.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.148 align:middle line:90%
And then I was fired.

00:07:40.148 --> 00:07:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the whole staff
was fired from the show.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:90%
And I had nothing to do.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.420 align:middle line:84%
And all my light bulbs
blew out in my apartment.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:46.560 align:middle line:84%
I had nothing to do
but sit and study

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.150 align:middle line:84%
tarot card books
and spiritual books.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's what was my
spiritual awakening.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.550 align:middle line:84%
And I emerged from that
year, which was the end

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.070 align:middle line:90%
of '91 to '92--

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and I emerged from that
year at the end of '92

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.310 align:middle line:90%
as a tarot card reader.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.980 align:middle line:84%
And I did stand-up
comedy and an actress.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And that's what started
me on my psychic

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.450 align:middle line:90%
and my spiritual career.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.050 align:middle line:84%
And I remember when
I had no faith.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.095 align:middle line:84%
And this is why I tell
people in my lectures.

00:08:09.095 --> 00:08:10.720 align:middle line:84%
I was there, and I
know what it's like,

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.337 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't too
long ago, that when

00:08:12.337 --> 00:08:13.920 align:middle line:84%
you invite this
energy into your life,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:84%
it does all sorts
of amazing things.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:84%
And it makes you
more of who you are,

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.290 align:middle line:90%
who you are supposed to be.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it a specific act
when you invite this energy

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:22.710 align:middle line:90%
into your life--

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:23.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>> --because I think a lot of
people watching this now are

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.920 align:middle line:90%
where you were not too long ago.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So their question
will be, what do I do?

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.749 align:middle line:90%
Do I sit down?

00:08:34.749 --> 00:08:35.549 align:middle line:90%
Do I stand up?

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:36.480 align:middle line:90%
Do I get on my knees?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.970 align:middle line:90%
How do I say, come on down?

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:90%
>> I think however, actually.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't like rules.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:44.670 align:middle line:10%
And that's another thing
about the meditation books

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:45.630 align:middle line:10%
and spiritual books out there.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.340 align:middle line:10%
You have to sit still,
and you can't move.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.882 align:middle line:84%
And oh, I'd say, if you want to
stand on your head and do it,

00:08:49.882 --> 00:08:51.330 align:middle line:90%
go ahead.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.440 align:middle line:10%
I also think that--

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.260 align:middle line:10%
well, there are great
books out there now

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.330 align:middle line:10%
that weren't around
just a few years

00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:10%
ago that tell you how
to do it in, like,

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.110 align:middle line:10%
two minutes, that
you can really invite

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.580 align:middle line:10%
this energy into your life.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.290 align:middle line:84%
But I think trust
it is the big thing.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.673 align:middle line:84%
People don't usually-- again,
we're all taught that life is

00:09:07.673 --> 00:09:09.840 align:middle line:84%
a crap shoot, that not
everyone's meant to be happy,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:90%
that only--

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:middle line:84%
money and happiness
only go to a select few.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.170 align:middle line:84%
And we're really taught
that we're supposed

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.460 align:middle line:90%
to compromise in our lives.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.420 align:middle line:90%
And it's simply not true.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think part of inviting
the energy into your life

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:84%
and saying, I can harness
this, I have the power,

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.470 align:middle line:84%
is also-- the other part is
rejecting what doesn't work

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:30.790 align:middle line:84%
and rejecting those beliefs
that we're all taught.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:84%
And I think unless you
reject that, inviting it

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.860 align:middle line:84%
into your life isn't
really going to do a lot.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.133 align:middle line:84%
So you first have to
say, this doesn't--

00:09:39.133 --> 00:09:40.050 align:middle line:90%
my life isn't working.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:90%
This doesn't work.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.390 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me get rid
of what doesn't work.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:48.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's an
acknowledgment initially.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Your book is very,
very interesting to me

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.050 align:middle line:84%
because you talk about
all of the things

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:54.580 align:middle line:90%
you can do psychically.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.820 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think a lot of
people will turn to the page

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.550 align:middle line:84%
where it says
psychic weight loss.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.510 align:middle line:90%
Talk to me about that.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It really works.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.840 align:middle line:84%
There are two ways that you can
use universal energy to think

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:84%
yourself-- one is just
thinking yourself thin,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.520 align:middle line:84%
is doing a visualization
process, where first, you

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.050 align:middle line:90%
connect to the energy.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.480 align:middle line:84%
You find that perfect place
when you're in the flow.

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.550 align:middle line:10%
And then you start visualizing
an image of you thinner,

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.360 align:middle line:10%
and thinner, and thinner,
and own the image.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:10%
So one thing is, literally,
just harnessing the energy

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:24.980 align:middle line:10%
and thinking yourself thin.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.570 align:middle line:10%
And the other way
is to use the energy

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:10%
to connect with
your higher self,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.130 align:middle line:10%
with that infinite
source, and say, well,

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:10%
what's wrong in my life?

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:90%
What's blocking me?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.563 align:middle line:84%
What's my relationship
with my weight?

00:10:36.563 --> 00:10:37.390 align:middle line:90%
What's not working?

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:39.180 align:middle line:90%
What beliefs do I have?

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:84%
What's the perfect diet
and exercise plan for me?

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.060 align:middle line:84%
About weight loss,
we're all taught that,

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.490 align:middle line:84%
with all the products, that
it's something outside us.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.200 align:middle line:90%
We need outside us to heal.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.902 align:middle line:84%
And what my thing is,
that it's inside us,

00:10:51.902 --> 00:10:53.610 align:middle line:84%
and that there's
something we're missing,

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.070 align:middle line:84%
a vitamin pill that we're
not getting from inside us,

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.290 align:middle line:84%
and that people
really-- we're not

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.540 align:middle line:90%
taught that we can control it.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.957 align:middle line:84%
And we're also taught that the
only way to control it is--

00:11:01.957 --> 00:11:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't even like
the word "control"

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.990 align:middle line:84%
because there's something
that says about weight,

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:90%
we have to do without.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
We have to restrict
ourselves and do without.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen so
many clients who

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:84%
have invited this
energy into their lives

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:19.680 align:middle line:84%
and have lost 20
pounds in no time

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.770 align:middle line:84%
because somehow, when
they get into this flow,

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:84%
it washes away what
doesn't belong there.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.763 align:middle line:84%
And I have had so many
people say, you know,

00:11:27.763 --> 00:11:29.430 align:middle line:84%
I didn't believe you
when you said this,

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.930 align:middle line:84%
but I could eat
anything I want now.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.080 align:middle line:90%
And it's really amazing.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And I can understand
what happened.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.030 align:middle line:90%
And it just makes no sense.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:37.958 align:middle line:90%
But it really works.

00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.886 align:middle line:90%

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:54.010 align:middle line:90%
What is psychic shopping?

I love psychic shopping.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.330 align:middle line:10%
Well, there are so many ways
you can do psychic shopping

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:07.360 align:middle line:10%
when you're open, when
you're in the flow of energy.

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:12.162 align:middle line:84%
One way is to set up a list
of things that you want,

00:12:12.162 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:84%
especially if you can't-- if
you think you can afford them,

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.010 align:middle line:90%
it's great.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.160 align:middle line:84%
Because you tell the
universe what you want.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And you can tell the universe
what price you want it at.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.070 align:middle line:84%
And then they'll
just wake you up

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:25.120 align:middle line:84%
and let you know when you can
find this item, where it is.

I'll tell you, this my
favorite example of this

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:35.748 align:middle line:84%
is, last spring,
there was a suede coat

00:12:35.748 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:84%
that I saw a few blocks
away from my house,

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:90%
and I really liked it.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:39.572 align:middle line:90%
I tried it on, really liked it.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.372 align:middle line:90%
I think it was about $150.

00:12:43.372 --> 00:12:44.830 align:middle line:84%
I said, you know,
I really like it.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.840 align:middle line:84%
And it was on sale, but
it wasn't enough on sale

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.040 align:middle line:90%
and I said, you know what?

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.640 align:middle line:90%
I would spend $50 on this coat.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:84%
And I just sort of
blurted out a number.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And a week later, I was
waking up in the morning.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And I just got the strongest
need, this impression

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.440 align:middle line:90%
to go to that store.

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.680 align:middle line:84%
So it opened at 10
o'clock in the morning.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:04.870 align:middle line:90%
And I was there for 10:05.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.790 align:middle line:90%
And there it was, $50.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:10.340 align:middle line:84%
So it's amazing how
these things work.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:14.410 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is, if
you're open to shopping,

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:84%
if you're going to a
big mall, or if you're

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.333 align:middle line:84%
going to a flea market,
and you don't exactly

00:13:18.333 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:84%
know what you
want-- this is great

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:84%
if you have a friend you
want to buy a gift for,

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and you want to get
the perfect gift,

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.162 align:middle line:84%
and you don't really
know exactly what that

00:13:24.162 --> 00:13:26.878 align:middle line:84%
is, you can tell-- you can
have a moment with yourself,

00:13:26.878 --> 00:13:29.170 align:middle line:84%
with your higher self, with
your angels, spirit guides,

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.907 align:middle line:84%
with that energy,
before you go there.

00:13:30.907 --> 00:13:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And you say, this is
what I'd like to spend.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.282 align:middle line:84%
This is what I think
I'd like to get.

00:13:34.282 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:90%
You tell me where I need to go.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.410 align:middle line:84%
And you'll feel drawn
to go through the aisles

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.790 align:middle line:90%
or through the different booths.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.990 align:middle line:90%
And boom, there you find it.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.610 align:middle line:90%
And then boom, there it is.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:47.360 align:middle line:84%
So when you let this
otherworldly energy guide you,

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.050 align:middle line:84%
you can also go shopping-- and
if you go into a drugstore,

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:84%
and you have, let's
say, five minutes,

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.252 align:middle line:84%
and you're really
in a hurry, and you

00:13:53.252 --> 00:13:55.330 align:middle line:84%
need to go get 10
items, and especially,

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:56.710 align:middle line:84%
if it's a store you don't
know-- and you could try

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.180 align:middle line:90%
this in a store you don't know.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.263 align:middle line:90%
You can-- this is my list.

00:13:59.263 --> 00:14:01.138 align:middle line:84%
These are the five or
six things that I need.

00:14:01.138 --> 00:14:02.080 align:middle line:90%
This is what I need.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.230 align:middle line:90%
Where can I find them?

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
having to go and look

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.970 align:middle line:84%
at all the little
descriptions in every aisle

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.040 align:middle line:84%
and saunter through and stare
at everything, you could just,

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is where I need to go.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:11.500 align:middle line:90%
OK, this is where I need to go.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.240 align:middle line:84%
And you can really get
led through the store.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And it just makes shopping
such a great experience.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:17.543 align:middle line:10%
>> Is having a psychic ability--

00:14:17.543 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:23.290 align:middle line:10%
let me rephrase this.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.890 align:middle line:10%
When you are looking to
have psychic abilities,

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.760 align:middle line:10%
is a great part
of that listening?

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:29.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Because so often, we get
a feeling about something.

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.115 align:middle line:84%
We think, you know, I'm going--
nah, I'm late, and you go on.

00:14:37.115 --> 00:14:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Should we listen to
that first thought?

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.780 align:middle line:84%
>> We refuse to
know what we know.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.825 align:middle line:84%
That is my thing is
we all pick up things,

00:14:42.825 --> 00:14:44.200 align:middle line:84%
and we just don't
want to listen.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:90%
We just refuse to listen.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:90%
Yes, the listening and the--

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.260 align:middle line:84%
There's two ways to
use universal energy.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.410 align:middle line:84%
An active way is the way we were
just thinking ourselves thin

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:84%
is an active way to use it,
harnessing-- programming

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
a business meeting,
programming your career the way

00:14:57.700 --> 00:14:58.100 align:middle line:90%
you want it to go.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.810 align:middle line:90%
That's an active way to harness.

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:84%
And a passive way to
harness the energy

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.600 align:middle line:84%
is to ask, like, what does
my soulmate look like?

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Where is there a good parking
space for me in this busy mall?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Am I going in the
right direction?

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Am I going to hit
traffic on my way home?

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.880 align:middle line:84%
So yes, the receiving and the
trusting and the listening

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.935 align:middle line:90%
is a really big thing.

00:15:16.935 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, that's an interesting
point because I think

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.180 align:middle line:84%
that's what people are starting
to do more and more these days.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:26.980 align:middle line:84%
People are literally starting
to ask for the things they want,

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.830 align:middle line:90%
to ask this universal energy.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Somehow we were taught that
that's not a spiritual thing,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.850 align:middle line:84%
to have desires is
not a spiritual thing.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:39.148 align:middle line:10%
And my-- at some point in your
growth, your desires change

00:15:39.148 --> 00:15:41.440 align:middle line:10%
and you don't want the material
things that you wanted.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:10%
But it doesn't make wanting
material things bad.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:45.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's the first step.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong
with wanting things.

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing wrong with
having desires and nothing

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.900 align:middle line:90%
wrong with asking--

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Some people were taught you
can pray for a sick relative,

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.740 align:middle line:84%
but you can't really
pray for a candy bar.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.573 align:middle line:90%
And that's not true.

00:15:54.573 --> 00:15:56.660 align:middle line:90%
You can really-- it's a skill.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.790 align:middle line:90%
It's a technical skill.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.670 align:middle line:84%
And the receiving
end isn't this--

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.800 align:middle line:84%
this big receiving
station in the sky,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:07.070 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't really say, oh, well,
that's a spiritual request.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:07.870 align:middle line:90%
You can have that.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's not a spiritual
quest, so you can't have that.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:12.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a technical
skill, and you can just

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:14.770 align:middle line:84%
sort of harness it
to ask for anything.

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:16.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can pray
for a soulmate?

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you?

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.240 align:middle line:90%
You know what?

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.230 align:middle line:84%
This is my thing is
people always ask me that.

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:24.688 align:middle line:84%
When I do lectures,
they say, well,

00:16:24.688 --> 00:16:25.897 align:middle line:90%
why aren't you a millionaire?

00:16:25.897 --> 00:16:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And I say, because it's
not important to me.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, you get
when you focus on,

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.860 align:middle line:84%
and you focus on what's
important to you.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:33.050 align:middle line:90%
>> And--

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm not talking
about millionaires.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.060 align:middle line:90%
I understand that part.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.393 align:middle line:84%
>> You can pray for a soulmate
if it's important to you.

00:16:39.393 --> 00:16:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And you-- and also,
this is the thing.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it will happen
when it happens.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.360 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of times,
when clients come to me

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:51.153 align:middle line:84%
and say, where's my
soulmate, and I'll say,

00:16:51.153 --> 00:16:53.445 align:middle line:84%
you have this great relationship
coming in the next six

00:16:53.445 --> 00:16:56.070 align:middle line:84%
to nine months, and well, let me
describe your soulmate to you,

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:57.060 align:middle line:84%
and I know you're not
going to like this,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.270 align:middle line:90%
but he's three years away.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And they say-- yes,
there's free will,

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and yes, you can make
it happen faster.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.425 align:middle line:84%
But you can also bring to you
an understanding that, OK, well,

00:17:05.425 --> 00:17:07.050 align:middle line:84%
maybe I have things
to learn and things

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.490 align:middle line:84%
to do before my
soulmate gets here so

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.230 align:middle line:84%
let me attract the love
that I need so I can be

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:90%
happy and safe and comfortable.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.233 align:middle line:84%
So then all of sudden,
the idea of soulmate,

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:15.770 align:middle line:84%
that need for soulmate
is not as strong in that

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.579 align:middle line:84%
when you're happy,
and you're busy,

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:21.569 align:middle line:84%
and you're in the
flow of energy, then--

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:23.868 align:middle line:84%
so that's the answer to,
do I ask for my soulmate,

00:17:23.868 --> 00:17:25.410 align:middle line:84%
you know, how do I
pray for soulmate.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And we often have,
according to your book--

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:33.460 align:middle line:84%
I'm paraphrasing, but I think
this is part of your message.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:84%
What we have at the moment
is exactly what we need,

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:84%
if we just pay
attention to that.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:45.540 align:middle line:10%
We're all taught then we can't--
that what we want is not what

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.920 align:middle line:10%
we're meant to have.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:10%
We all limit ourselves.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.988 align:middle line:10%
And we're also
taught that we're not

00:17:49.988 --> 00:17:51.780 align:middle line:10%
supposed to be really
happy in our careers,

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.190 align:middle line:10%
and we're supposed to
do one thing for money

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:54.500 align:middle line:10%
and one thing for happiness.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.190 align:middle line:10%
And we're all
taught these things.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.470 align:middle line:10%
And no, what you
want is your destiny.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.340 align:middle line:10%
Like, that's it.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you feel like you're
supposed go off and be a nurse,

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:84%
and be a healer, or be a
writer, or be an actress,

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
then if that's what
you want, that's

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.427 align:middle line:84%
your higher self, that's
that energy talking to you.

00:18:09.427 --> 00:18:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Like, that's what you're
supposed to go for.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:90%
Like, that's it.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Like, that's not
just some desire

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:15.948 align:middle line:84%
that you're supposed to put
in the back of your head,

00:18:15.948 --> 00:18:18.298 align:middle line:84%
while you're miserable
at this 9-to-5 job

00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:90%
as an administrative assistant.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So yes, what we want is
what we're supposed to have.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things
you say in your book is,

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
the closer you are
to your connection,

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.690 align:middle line:90%
the less you need ritual.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.740 align:middle line:84%
The less-- and the easier it
is to manifest what you want.

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.630 align:middle line:90%
>> What does that mean?

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, this is the thing I
rejected about those books when

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.130 align:middle line:84%
I was in high
school and studying.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:42.600 align:middle line:84%
I picked up some
meditation books.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And they said, oh, you
have to think this for--

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.240 align:middle line:84%
the process they
had me go through

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.490 align:middle line:84%
was this whole 10-step
process before I could even

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.860 align:middle line:90%
get to a meditative state.

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:90%
And I said, no, it just--

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.797 align:middle line:84%
it takes 10 seconds,
30 seconds, a minute.

00:18:55.797 --> 00:18:56.880 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't take that long.

00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.892 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you call it,
instant gratification?

00:18:58.892 --> 00:19:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Instant gratification
psychic ability,

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.120 align:middle line:90%
instant gratification intuition.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It really is.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:05.910 align:middle line:90%
The closer you live to that.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.827 align:middle line:84%
Now, I've seen plenty
of people in my lectures

00:19:07.827 --> 00:19:10.020 align:middle line:84%
that are really far
away from getting there.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Because they feel like they
have to sit down and do this,

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:13.290 align:middle line:90%
and om and--

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And you know what?

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:14.770 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:16.540 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> But if you are in a
car, and you are driving,

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.352 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a mall, and you
need a parking space right now,

00:19:21.352 --> 00:19:24.030 align:middle line:90%
you don't have time for that.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:90%
So it's nice to have the option.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.770 align:middle line:84%
But the more you get
into this perfect place--

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.325 align:middle line:84%
and we've all had moments
where time has just flown by.

00:19:31.325 --> 00:19:32.700 align:middle line:84%
We've all had
moments where we've

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:84%
been with friends, or family,
or with our mates, where

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
we felt really great about
ourselves, where we felt

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.307 align:middle line:84%
like everything
is possible, where

00:19:39.307 --> 00:19:44.070 align:middle line:84%
we felt not limited by fear
and by the outside influences.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.050 align:middle line:84%
And what I teach
people is, you can

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:47.550 align:middle line:90%
get into that perfect place.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And you can not only get
into it for fleeting moments,

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.400 align:middle line:84%
but you can make it
happen all the time.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I mean by you
don't need ritual to get there.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And the more you let this
energy into your life,

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:03.330 align:middle line:84%
there's like a
little place there.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.380 align:middle line:90%
Maybe it's in your heart.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.172 align:middle line:84%
And it grows and grows
and grows and grows.

00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:08.250 align:middle line:84%
So you can actually get
into this perfect place.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And you can be sitting in
traffic in this perfect place

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:84%
or standing on this crowded
bus in this perfect place.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.358 align:middle line:90%
And also, nothing bothers you.

00:20:15.358 --> 00:20:17.400 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden, you know
everything is possible.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.873 align:middle line:84%
So it's those fleeting
moments that you can get

00:20:19.873 --> 00:20:21.040 align:middle line:90%
them to happen all the time.

00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's no ritual that's
necessary at that point

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.907 align:middle line:84%
in order to get into
this deep state.

00:20:25.907 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:90%
All's you have to do is open up.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.233 align:middle line:90%
>> So you don't need ceremony.

00:20:29.233 --> 00:20:30.150 align:middle line:90%
You can just go there.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:33.090 align:middle line:90%


00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:36.780 align:middle line:84%
Talk to me a little bit about
being here at Whole Life Expos.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.220 align:middle line:90%
What does it do for you?

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.020 align:middle line:84%
What do you find
in the people here?

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:90%
What draws you here?

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I love doing the Whole
Life Expo, I have to say.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.370 align:middle line:10%
First of all, the
people that run it

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:10%
are so spiritual and so fabulous
that it just trickles down

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:10%
to everything, everywhere.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.652 align:middle line:10%
And you just-- there's
this zap of energy

00:20:53.652 --> 00:20:55.860 align:middle line:10%
that you get when you just
sort of come to this place

00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.110 align:middle line:10%
where there's a group of
like-minded souls doing this.

00:20:58.110 --> 00:21:01.380 align:middle line:84%
But I really feel like
it's really important to me

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.505 align:middle line:84%
to be very closely connected
with the people that

00:21:03.505 --> 00:21:05.130 align:middle line:84%
are reading my book
and the people that

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.390 align:middle line:90%
are picking up the message.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:07.560 align:middle line:90%
Because I feel like--

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.720 align:middle line:84%
I always remind myself,
like, without them, I

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.330 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be able to do my job.

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Without those people
sitting in the lecture,

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
without those people
that come to readings,

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:16.660 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't be able
to do what I do.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:84%
And I think so often,
healers forget that.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the feeling you
get when you end a lecture

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and people are starting
to get up and move around?

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm so inspired
when I end a lecture.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.160 align:middle line:84%
I've just finished harnessing my
own energy and the whole group,

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.098 align:middle line:84%
and everybody's zzzz, buzzing,
that I just feel so good.

00:21:36.098 --> 00:21:37.140 align:middle line:90%
I feel like I'm floating.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:39.750 align:middle line:84%
And then sometimes, at
the end of the lectures,

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.912 align:middle line:84%
people come up to
me and share with me

00:21:41.912 --> 00:21:43.620 align:middle line:84%
some of the experiences
that they've had.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
They haven't had a chance
to share during the lecture.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Some little hugs
pass back and forth.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:48.550 align:middle line:90%
And it's so healing.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:90%
It's so nice.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's so-- that oneness
and that universality

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.080 align:middle line:90%
is just an amazing feeling.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:55.490 align:middle line:90%
And it's very contagious.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:56.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:56.590 align:middle line:90%
>> You've captured--

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.190 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>> You've captured this room.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Stacy--

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, well, thank you.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.640 align:middle line:90%
>> --for sharing with us today.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.210 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my pleasure.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:04.510 align:middle line:90%
