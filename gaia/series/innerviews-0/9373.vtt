00:00:00.988 --> 00:00:03.952 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:31.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.193 align:middle line:84%
>> Tom, what a pleasure
to sit and talk with you.

00:00:34.193 --> 00:00:35.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Chantal.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Great to be here.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:10%
>> You have written a
remarkable and surprising book.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.492 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I
say surprising is

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:44.200 align:middle line:10%
that I think a lot of
people in the world

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.240 align:middle line:10%
would say bringing
spirituality into a workplace

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.830 align:middle line:10%
is not such a good idea.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Have you heard that philosophy
before, that theory?

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.660 align:middle line:10%
And I would say that you're
not bringing anything

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.910 align:middle line:10%
in that's not already there.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.100 align:middle line:10%
Spirituality is already there.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.849 align:middle line:10%
It's allowing it to come forth.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I think the second premise
is that we're not espousing

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.040 align:middle line:90%
religion in the workplace.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.240 align:middle line:90%
We're talking spirituality.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So I think those are the kind
of two things that I think maybe

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.107 align:middle line:84%
solve the concern that maybe
some people would have.

00:01:21.107 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I think some
people would also say,

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.590 align:middle line:84%
once you bring that feel into an
office atmosphere, a workplace,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:84%
that somehow it changes
the relationship with

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.780 align:middle line:90%
your employees.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.168 align:middle line:84%
It makes it more maybe
intimate, maybe closer.

00:01:40.168 --> 00:01:41.710 align:middle line:84%
Someone said this
to me the other day

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.260 align:middle line:90%
in reference to your book.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.970 align:middle line:90%
And I thought, yes, and?

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.680 align:middle line:84%
So what would you
say to someone who

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.030 align:middle line:84%
says, but you get a
different relationship going?

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.340 align:middle line:84%
First of all, spirituality
is one of about 10 elements

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.730 align:middle line:90%
in my book.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.977 align:middle line:84%
>> I blame a holistic,
integrated approach.

00:01:58.977 --> 00:02:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But if we're going to take
the spirituality aspect

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.930 align:middle line:84%
of the book, I would say, yes,
that people do feel closer.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:84%
Because I think that's a
lot of what spirituality is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.750 align:middle line:84%
is feeling more connected
with those around you.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
So I would say that
closeness is a part of it.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.770 align:middle line:84%
It also is about
feeling more caring,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:90%
actually caring about people.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.840 align:middle line:84%
Because I think the real gain,
Chantal, of spirituality--

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, spiritual
practice is one thing.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.190 align:middle line:84%
But I think the real game is,
how are we showing up each day?

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Are we smiling at the other
person, or are we frowning?

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Are we encouraging them
or discouraging them?

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.630 align:middle line:84%
>> What began this
journey for you?

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:90%
I mean, here you are.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.930 align:middle line:84%
You're the president
of a company.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:84%
You're one of the big guys
in the world of business.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.220 align:middle line:84%
How did this journey
begin for you?

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm going to be careful in
taking in one of the big guys.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.540 align:middle line:84%
I think we're all unique,
important creatures.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's very difficult
for me to say, if I'm big

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.360 align:middle line:84%
and everybody else
is big, great.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.200 align:middle line:90%
>> True.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.210 align:middle line:84%
But realistically
speaking, president, CEO.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Head coach, I call myself.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Even better.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.990 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.140 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't have any CEOs
or managers in our company.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>> On your business
card, what does it say?

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Head coach.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.735 align:middle line:90%
>> I love that.

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:23.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll tell you
a story on that.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.110 align:middle line:84%
After a CEO seminar, I was
talking with Lee Iacocca.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I'll send
you some materials.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.650 align:middle line:90%
Give me your business card.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.450 align:middle line:90%
I handed it to him.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.840 align:middle line:84%
He said, come on, boy,
don't you want to be a CEO?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.400 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, Mr. Iaccoca.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.460 align:middle line:90%
He thought I was pretty weird.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>> I can imagine he saying that.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.130 align:middle line:90%
I can see that very, very well.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.810 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate your point of view.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:47.620 align:middle line:90%
And I love it.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.880 align:middle line:90%
And I embrace it.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.390 align:middle line:84%
But to the world, because
you do have that title,

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
and let's say head
coach, it puts you

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.600 align:middle line:90%
in the position of leadership.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.433 align:middle line:90%
That's what I meant.

00:03:57.433 --> 00:04:00.230 align:middle line:84%
It puts you in the
position of leadership.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's a
bold move to move

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.890 align:middle line:84%
in the direction of holistic
health, of Feng shui,

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.650 align:middle line:84%
of spirituality
in the workplace.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:90%
And it's a good move.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.890 align:middle line:90%
I wonder how you took that step.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:21.519 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I took the step due to
a three ring wake up call that

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.990 align:middle line:90%
I had in 1989.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.198 align:middle line:90%
>> A three ring wake up call?

00:04:24.198 --> 00:04:25.865 align:middle line:84%
>> I call it my three
ring wake up call.

00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:90%
>> What happened?

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Divorce, end of
a 25 year marriage.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Cancer.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.130 align:middle line:84%
I found a lump
shaving one morning.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.070 align:middle line:90%
And they took it out.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.940 align:middle line:90%
And I had radiation.

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.120 align:middle line:84%
And thirdly, my business
was on the ropes.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:84%
One morning my chief financial
officer came in and said, Tom,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.160 align:middle line:90%
our credit line's exhausted.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:84%
And we're $1 million
short on the bank account.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.500 align:middle line:84%
All three of those things
happened within four months

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:90%
in 1989.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.752 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:04:53.752 --> 00:04:56.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And those are the three
major wake up calls that happen

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.400 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Love relationship,
health, and career.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And all three of
those happened to me.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So before that,
I was looking at,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:84%
how do I manage and control
wife, kids, employees.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.380 align:middle line:90%
And I had to go, wait a minute.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.430 align:middle line:90%
That's not working.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Looks like I don't know how
to manage myself very well.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.690 align:middle line:84%
So then I went within
and determined,

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.650 align:middle line:90%
I need a different game plan.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.220 align:middle line:84%
So out of that
came this game plan

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that I developed over
the last 10 years

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.950 align:middle line:90%
in winning in the game of life.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a phrase in your
book that resonates with me.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:84%
You referred to working out and
working in and the differences.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:90%
I love that.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'd love to hear
you talk about it.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that was not my phrase.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:49.350 align:middle line:84%
My tai chi instructor one
day in late '89, early '90,

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.390 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't been practicing
as much when I

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.680 align:middle line:90%
wasn't in our weekly sessions.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So he asked me if
I'd been practicing.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:58.880 align:middle line:90%
I really haven't had time.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.060 align:middle line:90%
I've been working out a lot.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.768 align:middle line:84%
In other words, I was
playing basketball.

00:06:01.768 --> 00:06:03.268 align:middle line:84%
I said, I've been
working out a lot,

00:06:03.268 --> 00:06:05.370 align:middle line:84%
but I haven't had a
chance to do my tai chi.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me and
said, working out,

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.500 align:middle line:90%
as opposed to working in.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:15.560 align:middle line:90%
Busted.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Busted.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Big time.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Busted.

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So that meant I was
still, at that point,

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.320 align:middle line:84%
engaged in intellectual
pursuits, working out,

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.310 align:middle line:84%
building up, and not
really going inside.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I hope you're aware of
the gifts that you pass

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.630 align:middle line:90%
on to the world.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Because, for example,
that's a phrase

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.483 align:middle line:84%
that I will remember and
use for the rest of my life.

00:06:42.483 --> 00:06:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I pass it on and got
it from somebody else.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.500 align:middle line:84%
I think that's what
it's all about.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Precisely.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:47.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Learning and teaching.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.230 align:middle line:90%
Learning and teaching.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Precisely.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Precisely.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:84%
It's just a wonderful
aspect of it.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Were there people
in your life, as you

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.740 align:middle line:84%
began this new way of working,
that said to you, Tom,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.880 align:middle line:90%
you're nuts.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Don't do this?

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.910 align:middle line:84%
I think with regard
to meditation

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and a macrobiotic,
primarily vegetarian diet,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:19.240 align:middle line:84%
some of the things that
were very different

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:84%
than those types of
things, a lot of people

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:25.910 align:middle line:90%
just won't say anything.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.868 align:middle line:90%
They'll be thinking it.

00:07:26.868 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:90%
But some would say that.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.180 align:middle line:84%
But I really
developed this sense.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.260 align:middle line:84%
As I cleared and the alcohol
consumption went down

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:84%
to virtually nothing, healthier
food coming into my body,

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.960 align:middle line:84%
the meditation, which began
to clear the ravaging thoughts

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle line:84%
that were coming through,
toxic relationships ending,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.360 align:middle line:84%
then I began to really clear,
and innately began knowing what

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:84%
was right for me
and what wasn't.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.810 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just when you
clear out, our bodies

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.070 align:middle line:84%
have this innate wisdom
that is incredible.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what's striking to
me about this as well is when I

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:84%
hear you speak
this way, I'm very,

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:17.250 align:middle line:84%
very impressed to hear a man,
and a powerful man speaking

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:90%
that way.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.370 align:middle line:84%
Because so often people
have thought over the years,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:24.060 align:middle line:84%
this is very much
a woman's world,

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:26.450 align:middle line:84%
the idea of spirituality,
and good eating, and getting

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:28.490 align:middle line:90%
rid of toxic relationships.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But to see a man right
smack dab in the middle

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.330 align:middle line:84%
of corporate America setting
examples for other men,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.250 align:middle line:90%
it's remarkable.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to hear you talk
about how you have affected

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.290 align:middle line:90%
other men in this business.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:48.740 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, I want to
credit those I've learned from.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.050 align:middle line:84%
And I've learned from women
who've run with the wolves.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:52.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:56.570 align:middle line:84%
>> And probably of
my personal mentors,

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:02.310 align:middle line:84%
of six or seven of them, five
or six of them are women.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.960 align:middle line:10%
So I've learned, I was real
heavy on the masculine.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.290 align:middle line:10%
And I really wasn't utilizing
the feminine part of me.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:17.120 align:middle line:10%
And they awakened that
through my psychologist,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.700 align:middle line:10%
through my energy
and body workers,

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.180 align:middle line:10%
through others that
mentored me, with me.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.950 align:middle line:90%
So I want to credit that first.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, how is that
accepted by other men?

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:31.095 align:middle line:84%
Or how has that
affected other men?

00:09:31.095 --> 00:09:31.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that the question?

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It is the question.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.970 align:middle line:84%
Because you're such
a great example.

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:39.060 align:middle line:84%
And I think men will have a
hard time looking at a woman

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:39.860 align:middle line:90%
and saying, yeah.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:40.735 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to do that.

00:09:40.735 --> 00:09:45.510 align:middle line:84%
But when they see a guy like
you who is just all-male--

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.430 align:middle line:90%
You're just a guy's guy.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:84%
And to see you setting
that example is remarkable.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.230 align:middle line:84%
So do you see differences in
corporate America, in men?

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:00.860 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's almost a
question that makes you shy.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.440 align:middle line:84%
But I'd love to hear you
talk about it, because it

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:90%
is what it is.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.420 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about who I
maybe had a good fortune

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.050 align:middle line:90%
to affect in recent years.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:11.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Up until now.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:23.460 align:middle line:84%
Have been people that I've been
exposed to in a tighter vein.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:25.970 align:middle line:84%
Whereas with the book and
things that are happening now,

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I think it will
be a wider range.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:84%
But right now, there's, I
think, a bell curve going.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.265 align:middle line:84%
I think that a third of
them think, he's nuts,

00:10:35.265 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
and I wouldn't do
this in a minute.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.890 align:middle line:90%
A third of them say, wow.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Wait a minute.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.850 align:middle line:84%
He's achieving some of the kind
of things maybe I'd like to.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.560 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to listen up.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.400 align:middle line:84%
And some of this stuff I'm going
to really seriously consider.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And maybe a third
that are saying, wow,

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:90%
this really makes sense.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:58.530 align:middle line:84%
And they're making significant
changes and modifications.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:01.650 align:middle line:84%
So I see kind of the
bell curve going there.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:05.610 align:middle line:84%
And these permissions,
you're right.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:84%
And I consider myself
somewhat of a Trojan horse

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:13.350 align:middle line:84%
in terms of being in
this corporate world.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.940 align:middle line:84%
And fortunately because of
maybe the way I look and act,

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:84%
and my experience, and I talk
like them, and act like them,

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:26.200 align:middle line:84%
then I think they are more open
to hearing what I have to say,

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.460 align:middle line:84%
even though some other people
have at least as much, or maybe

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.740 align:middle line:84%
more to say on some
of these subjects,

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.560 align:middle line:84%
I consider myself
kind of a translator

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:39.030 align:middle line:84%
in merging the personal growth,
higher consciousness movement

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:90%
with the business world.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, they each have
a lot to share with each other.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And what this book
is about is taking

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.778 align:middle line:84%
the best of what I've learned
in the business world,

00:11:47.778 --> 00:11:50.070 align:middle line:84%
with the best I've learned
in the higher consciousness,

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:51.600 align:middle line:90%
personal growth movement.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And each of them have a lot
to learn from each other.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:57.180 align:middle line:84%
And winning in the game of
life is merge the lessons

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.440 align:middle line:90%
in both of these.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And merge the masculine and
the feminine, intuitive and the

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:02.070 align:middle line:90%
linear.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And merge them together,
and kind of a fun thing.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.820 align:middle line:84%
>> With remarkable
results, I might add.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:90%
Truly remarkable.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Remarkable results.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:90%
By results you mean?

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:15.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the success
of your business.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.250 align:middle line:90%
The happiness of your employees.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:19.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:21.600 align:middle line:84%
In terms of results,
that would be one.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.420 align:middle line:90%
You're right.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.220 align:middle line:90%
Our employees.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.838 align:middle line:84%
The teammate
enthusiasm index is up.

00:12:27.838 --> 00:12:29.880 align:middle line:84%
Profitability is significantly
up over the years.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.410 align:middle line:84%
We've grown from '89, where we
had 24 stores, to 150 stores

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.940 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:90%
That's career success.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we talked about I was
on the rocks in three areas.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.100 align:middle line:84%
So career success is
changed tremendously.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about your
personal success then,

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:90%
in your life.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
Then the second element is the
personal relationship success,

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.250 align:middle line:90%
and winning in relationships.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And by winning,
I mean deeper,

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.188 align:middle line:90%
more fulfilling relationships.

00:12:59.188 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I would venture to
guess you're not in a toxic

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.460 align:middle line:90%
relationship now.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.290 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.750 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:04.750 align:middle line:90%
Not at all.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that
toxicity was shared.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:11.290 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't like, oh boy, she
was toxic, and I wasn't.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:12.890 align:middle line:90%
I understand that.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:84%
>> We were both dancing
and playing that game.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:21.590 align:middle line:84%
And both of us have grown
tremendously as a result.

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:22.590 align:middle line:90%
So I want to be careful.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.120 align:middle line:90%
She did this.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.550 align:middle line:84%
I was at least
equally, or more so.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I think by those of us
who know toxic relationships,

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:32.900 align:middle line:90%
we know it takes two.

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Two to tango.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.300 align:middle line:84%
People watching this
say, I get toxic.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Because it takes two people
to dance that dance for sure.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.580 align:middle line:84%
So the relationships are
much, much deeper, Chantal.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.380 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:48.090 align:middle line:90%
With my mate, Mary.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.998 align:middle line:90%
With my children.

00:13:49.998 --> 00:13:51.540 align:middle line:84%
Before it was kind
of on the surface.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.335 align:middle line:90%
I mean, did we interact?

00:13:53.335 --> 00:13:54.960 align:middle line:84%
Did we have a pretty
good relationship?

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:00.480 align:middle line:84%
But the depth with which we now
communicate, it's much deeper.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.220 align:middle line:90%
Same with my parents.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.600 align:middle line:90%
Same with co-workers.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:84%
There's another level there
that I didn't know existed.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was a little
too surfacy before.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:14.410 align:middle line:84%
And I really think that
is what life is about.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.400 align:middle line:84%
It's about how deep are
those relationships?

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.090 align:middle line:84%
If we're on the surface,
we're really not living fully.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So those are the first
two areas that have really

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:90%
changed tremendously.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>> And the third?

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The third is that
of physical health.

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
Out of the throes of cancer,
with radiation, surgery

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.030 align:middle line:84%
and radiation in '89
a couple of years

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.840 align:middle line:84%
ago I needed to get increased
amounts of insurance.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.740 align:middle line:84%
Cause as our company
grew, the insurance on me

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.540 align:middle line:90%
needed to go up.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.800 align:middle line:84%
So we needed many millions of
dollars in insurance money.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So we approached
my insurance agent,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.280 align:middle line:84%
and he just kind of
laughed and said, well,

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:57.360 align:middle line:84%
with the cancer and
radiation, really

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:59.760 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can get
any more insurance for you.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, well, listen,
let's give it a try anyway.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.490 align:middle line:90%
So I took a complete physical.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:07.120 align:middle line:90%
And he called back one night.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'd known him
for like 35 years.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:09.938 align:middle line:90%
And he was virtually in tears.

00:15:09.938 --> 00:15:11.480 align:middle line:84%
And he said, I've
never seen anything

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:84%
like this in 35 years of
being an insurance agent.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.380 align:middle line:84%
He says, you were dinged for
the cancer and the radiation.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.920 align:middle line:84%
But when everything
else was factored in,

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.420 align:middle line:84%
you did so well
on everything else

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:84%
that not only can we insure you,
but of the six risk categories

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:29.780 align:middle line:84%
that we have, you're
in the lowest.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>> So it was very affirming.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:36.000 align:middle line:84%
He said, I used to laugh at the
mediation, and the way you eat,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.725 align:middle line:84%
and some of the other
things, body work, and some

00:15:38.725 --> 00:15:40.100 align:middle line:84%
of the other things
in your life.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.930 align:middle line:84%
But he says, this
is unbelievable.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:44.018 align:middle line:90%
Never in 35 years.

00:15:44.018 --> 00:15:47.441 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:51.850 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.310 align:middle line:10%
So this was 1989, in
a four month period.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.988 align:middle line:10%
All three of our potential
areas for wake up calls.

00:15:56.988 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:10%
Not that there aren't
others, but those are three

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:10%
of the biggest came at once.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:08.130 align:middle line:84%
So I had to look and
say, OK, how have I been?

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.480 align:middle line:84%
It's a reassessment
time, obviously.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So what I discovered
in that reassessment

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:18.960 align:middle line:84%
was that I spent a lot of
time controlling other people,

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.980 align:middle line:90%
managing other people.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:23.040 align:middle line:84%
Man, I was the ultimate
manage, control.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.470 align:middle line:90%
Kids, spouse, employees.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.270 align:middle line:90%
Man, oh, man.

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:29.810 align:middle line:84%
And if I heard
something in a seminar,

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.030 align:middle line:84%
or I read it in
a book, never did

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.560 align:middle line:90%
I say, wow, I could use that.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I'd say, oh, yeah,
she ought to do that.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:39.300 align:middle line:90%
Or yeah.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.025 align:middle line:84%
The kids, they
need to read this.

00:16:41.025 --> 00:16:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I'll probably
underline it for them.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.690 align:middle line:90%
Or the employees, yeah.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.060 align:middle line:90%
We'll get them going on that.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.530 align:middle line:90%
I didn't get it.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:56.020 align:middle line:84%
But this caused a tremendous
reassessment that said, no.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:90%
You can't look outside anymore.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.830 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't send
enough endorphins

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:90%
to the rescue with my workouts.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.820 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't outhink it.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't have the kind of
psychological and spiritual

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:09.410 align:middle line:90%
depth to be able to handle it.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:14.450 align:middle line:84%
So those things sent
me crashing down.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.599 align:middle line:90%
So how did I get out?

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:20.599 align:middle line:90%
I limped in to a therapist.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:84%
After I interviewed
five, I found

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:26.660 align:middle line:84%
a person who ended up being
my most valuable mentor

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.680 align:middle line:90%
and therapist.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.490 align:middle line:84%
And that woman happens
to be in the room.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Brenda, would you come up,
please, for just a sec?

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.160 align:middle line:90%
And that is Brenda Schafer.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.010 align:middle line:84%
And Brenda, I want to
thank you a million.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.510 align:middle line:84%
Big round of applause
for this lady.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.940 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.840 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:54.340 align:middle line:84%
With Brenda, and reading
Yogananda, Krishnamurti,

00:17:54.340 --> 00:18:03.720 align:middle line:84%
Uspenski, Gurdjieff, Dalte
Ching, "Course of Miracles,"

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.980 align:middle line:84%
many, many things,
psychologically, many books

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:90%
on psychology.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:14.260 align:middle line:84%
Brenda, incredible
help with psychology.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So psychological,
spiritual things.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.587 align:middle line:90%
Took tai chi classes.

00:18:19.587 --> 00:18:20.920 align:middle line:90%
I went full court press on this.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:25.420 align:middle line:84%
I figured at 42 years
old, how easy is it

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:90%
to change a 42-year-old male?

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.210 align:middle line:90%
We're talking tough stuff.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:35.070 align:middle line:84%
So I figured I
couldn't just have

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.165 align:middle line:90%
these kind of part measures.

00:18:38.165 --> 00:18:39.790 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll just
kind of dabble and go

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.530 align:middle line:84%
in and see a therapist
for a couple, three months

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.400 align:middle line:84%
to find out where everybody
else is screwed up.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.200 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.380 align:middle line:90%
That wasn't going to fly.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:54.360 align:middle line:84%
So or or for me, born again,
and just kind of in denial,

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.860 align:middle line:84%
but everything else was just
determined, I'll be born again.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.900 align:middle line:84%
It took full court press,
all cylinders going.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.990 align:middle line:90%
So out of that came--

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:03.898 align:middle line:84%
and I had no idea
in those days there

00:19:03.898 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:84%
was going to be any
book out of that.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.630 align:middle line:84%
That only surfaced in
the last three years,

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:12.280 align:middle line:84%
after tremendous amount of
making tons of mistakes.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.370 align:middle line:84%
And I kind of considered my
company and my personal life

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.220 align:middle line:90%
kind of like my laboratory.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:18.580 align:middle line:90%
I'd mix this up and try this.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.090 align:middle line:90%
And whoop.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:19.760 align:middle line:90%
That didn't work.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.050 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:20.850 align:middle line:90%
I'll try this.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:21.790 align:middle line:90%
And this works.

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.500 align:middle line:84%
And after a lot of
trial and error,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:30.160 align:middle line:84%
I came up with a game plan
that really works for me.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.640 align:middle line:84%
It's served up, however, to
everybody else buffet style.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.440 align:middle line:84%
So in this book, for
instance, the word

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.780 align:middle line:84%
should you won't be able to
find anywhere in that book,

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:84%
unless Random House
slipped it in somewhere.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.752 align:middle line:84%
Because every time I
saw that was in there,

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:90%
we got it out of there.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.270 align:middle line:90%
The word oughta is not in there.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.010 align:middle line:84%
The word need to
is not in there.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.580 align:middle line:84%
Cause we're all CEO and head
coach of our own existence.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Now there are probably--

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:02.160 align:middle line:84%
there are likely CEOs, heads
of companies watching this now.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And the thought running
through their head

00:20:03.910 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:90%
is, well, how do I begin this?

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.350 align:middle line:10%
So what would you say
to those men and women?

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.640 align:middle line:10%
What's the first step?

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.490 align:middle line:10%
Because it seems huge.

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:14.300 align:middle line:90%
It seems so daunting.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:16.490 align:middle line:90%
What's the first step?

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:19.090 align:middle line:10%
>> The first step, as I say in
my book "Winning in the Game

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:22.270 align:middle line:10%
of Life," is to
discover our mission.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.110 align:middle line:10%
This is a 10 element
game plan, of which

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.343 align:middle line:10%
there's like 10 plays in
each of these elements.

00:20:28.343 --> 00:20:30.010 align:middle line:84%
Because the bad news
is, everybody says,

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.520 align:middle line:90%
what's the secret to success?

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:84%
The bad news is,
there's a ton of them.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.980 align:middle line:84%
The good news is, none of
them are that difficult.

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:41.380 align:middle line:84%
So the first step is that
of discovering or clarifying

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:44.110 align:middle line:84%
your mission, your
why, why I'm here.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this where you talk
about in "Winning in the Game

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.300 align:middle line:84%
of Life," the personal
mission statement?

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.137 align:middle line:84%
>> What is a personal
mission statement?

00:20:53.137 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a personal
mission statement,

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.440 align:middle line:84%
you know how companies
have mission statements?

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.240 align:middle line:90%
Their purpose.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.710 align:middle line:90%
Their reason for being.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, individually, I think
we're all like CEO or head

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.560 align:middle line:84%
coach of ourselves,
our own existence.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So why shouldn't we have a
mission statement, a purpose,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.340 align:middle line:90%
a reason for being.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.830 align:middle line:90%
>> And it can be one sentence.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.320 align:middle line:90%
Or it can be two pages.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.000 align:middle line:90%
Mine's seven sentences.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.910 align:middle line:90%
>> What are they?

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The first is to become
more awakened, more conscious,

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:90%
more in the present moment.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:25.330 align:middle line:84%
Second is to live
by the principles

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.530 align:middle line:90%
that help get me there.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And that's the principles
according to "Winning

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:31.300 align:middle line:90%
in the Game of Life."

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.220 align:middle line:84%
The third is to share love and
any information with regard

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.910 align:middle line:84%
to this game plan when asked,
with family and friends.

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:46.240 align:middle line:84%
The fourth is to share it
in my business organization.

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Not shoulds.

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:48.670 align:middle line:90%
Not oughtas.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:50.860 align:middle line:84%
By the way, you won't find
the word should, oughta,

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.200 align:middle line:84%
or need to anywhere
in that book,

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.060 align:middle line:84%
or anywhere in anything
in our company.

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:57.940 align:middle line:90%
It's serving it up buffet style.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:02.420 align:middle line:84%
So sharing this in our business
