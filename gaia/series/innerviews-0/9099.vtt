>> She calls it the new
American spirituality,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.250 align:middle line:90%
and she should know.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.740 align:middle line:84%
Her name is Elizabeth Lesser,
and for the last 23 years,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.520 align:middle line:84%
she's been a driving force
behind the Omega Institute, one

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.500 align:middle line:84%
of this country's
leading teaching centers

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.100 align:middle line:84%
for human development
and spiritual growth.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Her work has given her
the rare opportunity

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to learn and teach
beside great healers,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.630 align:middle line:84%
like Ram Dass and
Pir Vilayat Khan.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I was in my early 20s
when I started Omega,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:84%
and a bunch of us were actually
living in one of those typical

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.400 align:middle line:84%
late 60s, early 70s commune
with a meditation teacher.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And we had this wonderful
parade of teachers

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.860 align:middle line:84%
coming from all over the
country, all over the world,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.350 align:middle line:84%
teaching us different
aspects of living

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.700 align:middle line:90%
a healthy spiritual life.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.038 align:middle line:84%
And we had the idea,
maybe other people

00:01:22.038 --> 00:01:24.080 align:middle line:84%
who don't want to actually
live what we're living

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:84%
would like to learn some
of what we're doing.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.980 align:middle line:84%
We had no idea that
once we started Omega,

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.590 align:middle line:84%
so many people
would be interested.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.790 align:middle line:10%
>> Elizabeth, I'm so, so pleased
to sit down and talk with you.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.380 align:middle line:10%
Not the least of many
reasons is to tell you

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:10%
how much I loved your book,
The New American Spirituality.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.877 align:middle line:90%
>> There's a reason--

00:01:47.877 --> 00:01:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and I didn't realize this
till halfway through the book,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.290 align:middle line:90%
by the way--

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.750 align:middle line:84%
that it's called the New
American Spirituality.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Is it because Americans as
a whole, America as a place,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.360 align:middle line:84%
hasn't really had
its own spirituality,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.910 align:middle line:84%
that over the years
we've begun to gather it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.000 align:middle line:84%
from the Sufis, the
Indians, the Chinese?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, there's several
things about the spirituality

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.500 align:middle line:10%
we're seeing in our culture
now that I think are American.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.240 align:middle line:84%
First of all, Americans
are so individualistic.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.720 align:middle line:84%
We've now had a couple hundred
years for the American psyche

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.130 align:middle line:90%
to congeal.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
And the most telling
part about being American

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.860 align:middle line:90%
is I vote for what I want.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:90%
I know what I want.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:90%
And I'm going to go after it.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Just because my
parents were plumbers

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.170 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean I'm
going to be a plumber.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.460 align:middle line:90%
And I am fully an individual.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:54.370 align:middle line:84%
>> It's almost like you are
a cartographer of our souls.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.480 align:middle line:84%
And I wonder why
now more than ever

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
you think it is
that we need that.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.410 align:middle line:84%
Everybody I gave the book to
said, it's just what I needed.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Why do we need
this guide so much?

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, as Americans-- and
that's why I titled the book

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.410 align:middle line:84%
"The New American
Spirituality"--

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
as Americans, our lives are so
fast-paced and so disjointed.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And the center has dropped
out of a lot of people's lives

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.830 align:middle line:84%
as we run from one work
thing to family thing

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
to leisure time
filling every moment.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.130 align:middle line:84%
And most of us don't
have a chance just

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.450 align:middle line:84%
to stop and to drop down into
the part of ourselves that

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.440 align:middle line:90%
is quiet and peaceful.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.430 align:middle line:84%
And there there's a
great hunger for anything

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.760 align:middle line:84%
that will remind us hey,
there's something more.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:90%
Your life has meaning and depth.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
And the pain and confusion
you feel, there is an answer.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.460 align:middle line:84%
But you gotta slow
down to find it.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of people
have that I call it a hole

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.970 align:middle line:84%
in your soul, that feeling
that you're talking about,

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.080 align:middle line:90%
that hunger.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.727 align:middle line:84%
And I think now that
people have identified it--

00:04:09.727 --> 00:04:11.560 align:middle line:84%
and before, by the way,
I think they didn't.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:90%
It was just what's this?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.360 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.010 align:middle line:84%
How do you think they begin to
fill the hole in their soul?

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.280 align:middle line:90%
How do they do that?

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think you pointed
out the most important thing--

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.510 align:middle line:90%
identifying it.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason we're
beginning to just beginning

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
to identify it is we've
gone to the end of a time

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.810 align:middle line:84%
in our culture where
we were still filling

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.190 align:middle line:84%
and we were thinking this
prosperity, this mobility,

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.300 align:middle line:84%
this ability to define
myself in the material world

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.690 align:middle line:84%
is going to bring me the
pain relief I'm looking for.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.370 align:middle line:84%
It's going to fill the
God-shaped hole in myself.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:00.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's taken a while for
it to show up that yes, it

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.170 align:middle line:90%
fills some wonderful things.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of our
prosperity and our goods

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.990 align:middle line:90%
are gifts, marvelous gifts.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm not at all belittling
American culture completely.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.580 align:middle line:84%
But the parts that can't
be filled by material

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.500 align:middle line:90%
are just beginning to show up.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So identifying it and being
brave enough to identify it,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.590 align:middle line:84%
that's really the first and
biggest step on the path.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:28.600 align:middle line:84%
>> That's an interesting
thing to say--

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.710 align:middle line:90%
to be brave enough.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.630 align:middle line:84%
What do we do when
we're not brave enough?

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.750 align:middle line:84%
Do we say, well,
I'll take a Valium?

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>> We say, I'll take a Valium.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:84%
I'll spend two
extra hours at work

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.960 align:middle line:84%
so I don't have to
go home and feel

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.950 align:middle line:84%
how out-of-joint things are
with my wife or my husband

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.210 align:middle line:90%
or my kids.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:90%
I'll go to the gym.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.680 align:middle line:90%
I'll take that second vacation.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, I have to
work harder to get there,

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.180 align:middle line:84%
running toward always
something that we

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.570 align:middle line:84%
think is going to bring us
meaning and peace of mind.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.880 align:middle line:84%
Whereas stopping after
we've been running so hard,

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.960 align:middle line:84%
often we feel like we're getting
hit by years of not having

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.990 align:middle line:84%
dealt, not having looked,
not having stopped

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:90%
to feel something's missing.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:19.820 align:middle line:90%
I feel-- I'm in pain.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:84%
My level of intimacy with my
friends is just not happening.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.000 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is
that's deeply off,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.250 align:middle line:84%
it's easier sometimes
to keep running.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it not astonishing to
you as a follower and a teacher

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and a student of this for so
many years how many people

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
there are in pain, the
number of people in pain?

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think human beings
have always been in pain.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Way back when the Buddha
was teaching and preaching,

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:84%
the first noble truth of
Buddhism is life is suffering.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:90%
There is suffering in life.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to sink and
accept that a big part of life

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.090 align:middle line:90%
is suffering.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So we paddle as
fast as we can away

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
from the first noble truth,
which is life in this realm,

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.090 align:middle line:84%
in this human realm,
is full of pain.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And so much of the pedaling
away from our spiritual center

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.760 align:middle line:84%
is pretending we're
not in pain, putting

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.350 align:middle line:84%
on a face to our friends and our
people at work, our colleagues.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.150 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.950 align:middle line:90%
I'm great.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:90%
My life works.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.040 align:middle line:90%
And then oh, his life works.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Her life works.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:42.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, mine doesn't.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.130 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'll pretend even more.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And we're in this masquerade
ball together where I'm fine,

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:49.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm fine.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.420 align:middle line:90%
And none of us are fine.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.310 align:middle line:90%
We all suffer.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd be so curious to know
why and how you begin your own

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:90%
search.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:84%
If what you say is
true about all of us,

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:05.760 align:middle line:90%
it had to begin with pain.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.590 align:middle line:84%
What was your pain that made
you say, I gotta look at this?

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:12.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was one
of those children,

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.690 align:middle line:84%
one of those little children
at four or five years old,

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:19.380 align:middle line:84%
I'd lie in bed, not really
afraid of monsters under

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:20.970 align:middle line:90%
the bed but of death.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I was plagued by fear of
death and the great void

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:29.370 align:middle line:84%
and where would I go
after my body died.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.350 align:middle line:84%
Since I can
remember, I would say

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.900 align:middle line:84%
that was the number
one propelling

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:37.390 align:middle line:84%
pain that made me a seeker
at a very early age.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.140 align:middle line:84%
By the time I was
15, 16, I was already

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:43.830 align:middle line:84%
looking for spiritual
teachings, that pain

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.220 align:middle line:84%
being the fear of
death, which I think

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.860 align:middle line:84%
is at the base of
most of our fears

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:84%
and most of our pain,
our sense of how

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.060 align:middle line:84%
groundless our existence is
here, how much things change,

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:58.860 align:middle line:90%
ultimately.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Every second.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>> The big change.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Every second.

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And then little deaths as I
think are our crises and pains

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.100 align:middle line:84%
are in life, little deaths began
to accumulate as I got older.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Divorce was a major
propelling force

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.820 align:middle line:90%
in my life to seek even deeper.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I think divorce is such
a huge issue in America.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know-- maybe
I'll get letters on this--

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.300 align:middle line:84%
but I think it's so
difficult for women

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.850 align:middle line:84%
because women feel
like they failed.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.110 align:middle line:90%
I think men tend to go on.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And women feel like
they've failed.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.120 align:middle line:84%
So people would be
most interested to hear

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.310 align:middle line:84%
you talk about what happened
when Elizabeth Lesser, one

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.280 align:middle line:84%
of the founders of the Omega
Institute, known for love

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and searching and connecting and
communicating, gets divorced.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:49.980 align:middle line:90%
Were you guilty?

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.960 align:middle line:90%
What went on inside you?

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:56.260 align:middle line:90%
All of the above.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.910 align:middle line:84%
It was the great dark
night of my soul.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.220 align:middle line:84%
The great Christian
mystic Saint John

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:08.340 align:middle line:84%
of the Cross talks about how
every seeker needs and comes

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.130 align:middle line:84%
to a dark night of the
soul where everything you

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.790 align:middle line:84%
know and you think
about yourself crashes.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.820 align:middle line:84%
And you're left just
you and the universe.

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:21.330 align:middle line:84%
And you pick up the
pieces and start again.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.120 align:middle line:84%
That's what divorce was
for me because I was so

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.420 align:middle line:84%
identified with myself
as a mother and a wife.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:31.110 align:middle line:84%
Even though I had this career
that was so fascinating and so

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:84%
important, my main identity
was to me in my heart of hearts

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.380 align:middle line:90%
a mother and a wife.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And I think maybe that's
why it's so hard for women.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.970 align:middle line:84%
Although I think it's
very hard for men

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.420 align:middle line:84%
too, very hard,
especially for dads

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.900 align:middle line:84%
to learn a new way
to be a parent.

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:54.240 align:middle line:84%
So divorce was my greatest
fall and my greatest redemption

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:90%
in the end.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
recover from divorce

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:84%
with some degree
of consciousness,

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and you want to make it one of
those teaching, great teachings

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.970 align:middle line:84%
in your life, what
it taught me was

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:14.400 align:middle line:84%
a lot of what I had blamed on my
husband, I began to own myself.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:20.640 align:middle line:84%
As I stood alone
and I saw everything

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.040 align:middle line:84%
that I saw in him that
I projected onto him,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.630 align:middle line:90%
I owned myself.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And I became whole
through that process

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:84%
having to stand
alone in the world

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:84%
having done something and
been part of something

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.280 align:middle line:84%
that I had shame
about and having

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:40.150 align:middle line:84%
to own my shame and my
fear and my dark side,

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.310 align:middle line:90%
to come into my dark side.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's such a
remarkable thing to say

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:84%
and such a courageous
thing to say.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Is there something
you did, something

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:84%
you read, something you
saw, something that occurred

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.460 align:middle line:84%
to you in order for you to make
that change, in order for you

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
to say, well, I'm responsible
here, it's not just him?

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:05.480 align:middle line:10%
>> I would say everything
prepared me to take the journey

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.280 align:middle line:10%
of divorce.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:10%
And for some people, it's
a diagnosis of cancer

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.000 align:middle line:10%
or a parent dying,
whatever that fall,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.280 align:middle line:10%
the fall that you
read about in all

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.050 align:middle line:10%
the great spiritual literature.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:21.220 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is, that's what the
spiritual practice is for so

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.950 align:middle line:84%
that you go through your
falls and you come out

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:90%
resurrected and redeemed.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:84%
That's the story of
Jesus on the cross.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Whatever cross we
bear, that's to me

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.030 align:middle line:90%
why we do spiritual practice.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:84%
We don't meditate or pray
to become great meditators

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:40.570 align:middle line:90%
or the best prayer around.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.200 align:middle line:84%
We do it so that these
moments of despair

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.370 align:middle line:84%
come out in the end as
moments of shining redemption

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:50.014 align:middle line:90%
and wisdom.

00:12:50.014 --> 00:12:52.966 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:52.966 --> 00:13:11.180 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:15.380 align:middle line:84%
I think people
often are attracted

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:19.160 align:middle line:84%
to spiritual traditions
that are really

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.520 align:middle line:84%
far away from their
everyday reality

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.420 align:middle line:84%
because it's a safer way
to enter spirituality

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.230 align:middle line:84%
than let's say the religious
tradition of your youth

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:34.150 align:middle line:90%
or something very American.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Like most seekers, Elizabeth
Lesser has pursued many

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.580 align:middle line:84%
different teachers and
experimented with many

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:43.120 align:middle line:84%
different spiritual practices
until she found the one that

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.700 align:middle line:90%
worked for her.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.910 align:middle line:90%
They say practice makes perfect.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Of course, with a
spiritual practice,

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:56.330 align:middle line:84%
the goal is never perfection,
only peace of mind.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.460 align:middle line:10%
>> So for me, my great spiritual
practice that I love and rely

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.430 align:middle line:10%
on is meditation.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.980 align:middle line:84%
All different traditions
teach meditation.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And it's up to each seeker
to decide which tradition

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.070 align:middle line:90%
speaks to him or her the most.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.560 align:middle line:84%
For me, classic
Buddhist meditation

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.880 align:middle line:84%
has been a great rock in
my life and a teacher.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Because to sit and meditate
and to empty yourself

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.830 align:middle line:84%
of all your conceptions of
who you are, how you fail,

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.530 align:middle line:84%
and how you succeed
and just to be,

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:84%
just to be purely
in the moment is

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.760 align:middle line:84%
a form of fall and redemption
every day in your practice.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:10%
>> How many people say to
you I just don't know how

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:44.660 align:middle line:10%
to meditate?

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:10%
It sounds good.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.780 align:middle line:10%
And I want to do it.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.230 align:middle line:90%
But I just don't know how.

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:52.285 align:middle line:90%
So many people say it to me.

00:14:52.285 --> 00:14:53.360 align:middle line:90%
Do a lot say it to you?

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, or they say, like I
was with my mother recently

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.150 align:middle line:90%
in a doctor's office.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:01.150 align:middle line:90%
She was having hypertension.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And the doctor said, do
you know how to meditate?

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.450 align:middle line:90%
And she said, yeah, yeah.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.310 align:middle line:90%
My daughter teaches meditation.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.540 align:middle line:90%
And I've had some tapes.

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.310 align:middle line:90%
And I've read some books.

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:15.670 align:middle line:84%
And he said, but
do you meditate?

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, I've read about it.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.330 align:middle line:90%
I know how to do it.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:20.890 align:middle line:90%
Well, but do you?

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.250 align:middle line:84%
And she was caught
as most of us are.

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:29.140 align:middle line:84%
We think because we're reading
about it that we're doing it.

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:35.350 align:middle line:84%
And the practice of meditation
is supremely boring and very

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.510 align:middle line:90%
hard because it's boring.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's hard.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we're so much
used to activity and filling

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:45.190 align:middle line:84%
the moment, and this is
about emptying the moment.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:48.040 align:middle line:84%
And that's hard
and scary for a lot

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
of people who aren't
used to just being

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:90%
confronted with emptiness.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Once we've achieved
a spiritual practice,

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of people struggle
with how to do it on a daily

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.040 align:middle line:90%
basis.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.730 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, it's just
been Sunday at church

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:10.450 align:middle line:84%
for example or just those
moments we meditate.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.780 align:middle line:90%
How do you keep it going?

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:84%
I guess that's the
best way to put it.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.060 align:middle line:90%
How do you maintain it?

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:23.740 align:middle line:84%
>> I live in a community of my
friends, our fellow seekers.

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And I-- it's important to me
that I have people in my life

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.468 align:middle line:84%
whom I can discuss things
of spiritual nature.

00:16:30.468 --> 00:16:31.510 align:middle line:90%
And they're there for me.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:90%
And they understand.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So having some sense of
community is important.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:90%
How do you find that?

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you join a yoga class.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you do join some kind of
congregation of an organized

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.180 align:middle line:90%
religion.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.680 align:middle line:90%
And you pick your friends.

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.990 align:middle line:90%
You seek out like-minded people.

00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:55.420 align:middle line:84%
The other is to have a practice,
to have a spiritual discipline,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.730 align:middle line:90%
and to learn it from--

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:00.700 align:middle line:84%
either from books-- although
a living teacher to me

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:05.980 align:middle line:84%
at workshops or retreat centers
or churches or Buddhist centers

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:08.630 align:middle line:84%
is important-- to
learn a practice,

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:12.880 align:middle line:84%
meaning a 20-minute meditation
practice where you sit down

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.550 align:middle line:84%
every morning before
you go to work.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:17.170 align:middle line:90%
And you watch your breath.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And you get in touch
with your body.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And you calm and clear your
mind and open your mind

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.450 align:middle line:90%
to the vastness of experience.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And no, no, I'm not just this
little person sitting here.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:32.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm part of some large,
meaningful universe.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.180 align:middle line:90%
That's what a practice does.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd like to talk a little bit
about teachers because I think

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.940 align:middle line:84%
a lot of people on a spiritual
path are quite disillusioned

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:84%
because they have found
teachers who are not authentic.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.830 align:middle line:84%
What do you do in
a case like that?

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It's such a good question
and such a difficult subject.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:03.300 align:middle line:84%
I've had several important
teachers in my life.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:07.580 align:middle line:84%
I've been around hundreds of
teachers at Omega Institute.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And I've observed
them from the most

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:17.760 align:middle line:84%
inauthentic to the most just
treasures of human beings.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.340 align:middle line:84%
My main teachers have
all disappointed me

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:26.360 align:middle line:84%
when I hold them up to this
level of since they are

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
such extraordinary
teachers, their lives

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.090 align:middle line:90%
therefore must be exemplary.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.620 align:middle line:90%
That isn't always the equation.

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So for example, my
teacher Chogyam Trungpa,

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:45.590 align:middle line:84%
the great Tibetan teacher who
ended up dying an alcoholic

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:52.670 align:middle line:84%
and was a wild
character, his wisdom,

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:56.890 align:middle line:84%
his books remain to me some of
the most profound books written

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.680 align:middle line:84%
in the 20th century
about the spiritual life.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.610 align:middle line:84%
So how is it that this man
who was such a fine teacher--

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and he was, I learned
so much from him--

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:08.790 align:middle line:90%
had a lot of trouble in life?

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:13.630 align:middle line:84%
And there's a sign at the
Esalen Institute in California

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.550 align:middle line:84%
that says, "We teach what
we most need to learn,

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.430 align:middle line:90%
and we are our worst students."

00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:24.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think many teachers
are great at what

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:84%
they teach because their
own lives are hard.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And they need to learn
it more than anyone else.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.825 align:middle line:90%
And they are wounded healers.

00:19:32.825 --> 00:19:35.950 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:41.750 align:middle line:84%
So if authenticity means the
teacher is perfect, good luck.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
You'll never find a teacher
because most human beings

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.300 align:middle line:90%
aren't perfect.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:52.700 align:middle line:84%
If authenticity means your
teacher's greatest desire is

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:56.750 align:middle line:84%
for you to awaken, they're
not after your money,

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle line:84%
they're not after
your adoration,

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:04.100 align:middle line:84%
they're not power tripping,
they're in it with you,

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:84%
and they're a few
steps ahead of you,

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.050 align:middle line:90%
that to me is authenticity.

00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Along the way, you must have
been disillusioned by more than

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:19.310 align:middle line:84%
one teacher who you thought
was just magnificent.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:90%
How did you deal with that?

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, different
times different ways.

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.760 align:middle line:84%
But I would say when I
add it all up together,

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:84%
great teachings came from my
disillusionment with teachers.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> And were you hurt?

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:35.680 align:middle line:84%
Were there any times when
you thought, oh, god,

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.840 align:middle line:84%
that hurts me so much
that he's that way?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, definitely.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Disappointed?

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Disappointed.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Angry?

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Confused, angry.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.340 align:middle line:84%
There's a great
saying in Buddhism.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:48.790 align:middle line:84%
"When you meet the Buddha
on the road, kill him."

00:20:48.790 --> 00:20:49.930 align:middle line:90%
It's a zen saying.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.550 align:middle line:90%
And people are like, what?

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:90%
Kill him, the teacher?

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.500 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.790 align:middle line:84%
And what it means
is that when you

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:84%
are ready to assume the
qualities of a teacher

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:07.180 align:middle line:84%
in yourself and stop projecting
wisdom onto someone else, then

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.240 align:middle line:90%
you kill the need for a teacher.

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.720 align:middle line:84%
I still have teachers, of
course, and people I admire.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:19.240 align:middle line:84%
But the point of studying with
a teacher is to become wise.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:24.010 align:middle line:84%
It's not to become that
teacher's disciple.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.460 align:middle line:84%
The point of reading
the great books,

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.310 align:middle line:84%
going to church,
having a teacher

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:34.720 align:middle line:84%
is so that you will ultimately
embody that wisdom yourself.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.680 align:middle line:90%
Of course, right?

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Why else would we do it?

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:84%
Why else would we study
with this man or woman

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.450 align:middle line:84%
if not to want to
become like that person?

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.520 align:middle line:90%
That person is our model.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.000 align:middle line:84%
So part of the
disillusionment process

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.450 align:middle line:90%
is taking it on yourself.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.920 align:middle line:90%
OK, I'm going to be that way.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
make that person

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.310 align:middle line:90%
have to always be that way.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:03.040 align:middle line:84%
Let's see how hard it is for
me to always be kind, always

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.420 align:middle line:84%
be wise, always have my
ego in the right place.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to take it on now.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And it often, hopefully,
the lucky among us,

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.000 align:middle line:90%
it happens like this.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.320 align:middle line:90%
You've learned a lot.

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.460 align:middle line:90%
You're ready.

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.550 align:middle line:84%
The disillusionment
comes at a good time

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.220 align:middle line:84%
when you're ready to
take it on yourself.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.910 align:middle line:90%
But that isn't always the case.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.420 align:middle line:84%
There are some
students who are really

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.290 align:middle line:84%
abused by teachers,
the guru who will

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.330 align:middle line:90%
sleep with women disciples.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.000 align:middle line:84%
That's a wounding,
wounding experience.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.960 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have
experiences like that.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.240 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to belittle how
difficult it is to be deeply

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.760 align:middle line:90%
disillusioned by a teacher.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So those are part of
the points that we look

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.770 align:middle line:84%
for in a good teacher,
someone who's happy,

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:84%
someone who has joy
in his or her life?

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right and someone
who when they aren't happy

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.070 align:middle line:84%
doesn't try to hide it,
doesn't have a holier than thou

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:07.420 align:middle line:84%
attitude that my life is always
wonderful because I meditate

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and because I commune
with the cosmos.

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, all my
problems have disappeared.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.210 align:middle line:84%
People who pretend
that I don't feel

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:18.730 align:middle line:84%
are doing a service
to their students

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:21.640 align:middle line:84%
because then the goal
looks unattainable.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.870 align:middle line:90%
And that's not the truth.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:29.180 align:middle line:84%
The truth about life is yes,
as you progress spiritually,

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.930 align:middle line:90%
life gets easier.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:33.320 align:middle line:90%
But then your father dies.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Then your friend gets cancer.

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.707 align:middle line:84%
Then your children
go to college.

00:23:37.707 --> 00:23:39.290 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
you're going to sail

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.510 align:middle line:84%
through those transitions
with no problem.

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.130 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have tools to
help you get them through them.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.380 align:middle line:90%
But you're going to feel.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.310 align:middle line:84%
>> How does one take all that
one learns on a spiritual

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.580 align:middle line:84%
journey and then put it out
there in the consciousness

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.480 align:middle line:90%
of the world?

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a good thing
to think about.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:59.520 align:middle line:84%
Because if one's
spiritual journey

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:04.560 align:middle line:84%
is only about one's own
happiness, it's only one half

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.430 align:middle line:90%
of the journey.

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:09.720 align:middle line:84%
So I would say the first
way about reaching out

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:15.360 align:middle line:84%
to the world is to heal, to
take the path of inner healing.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:18.150 align:middle line:84%
And at some point,
it naturally leads

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.260 align:middle line:84%
toward wanting to bring
it out in the world.

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And if it doesn't,
that's a good sign

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:28.800 align:middle line:84%
that it's not working
because a spiritual being is

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:29.940 align:middle line:90%
a happy being.

00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And a happy being delights
in the happiness of others.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:39.720 align:middle line:84%
A happy being is not jealous
or envious or covetous.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.470 align:middle line:84%
A happy person wants
other people to be happy.

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:47.250 align:middle line:10%
And so when one's desire to help
other people or save the planet

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:51.600 align:middle line:10%
comes from an understanding
that life is good,

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:57.810 align:middle line:10%
then that generosity in the
world is real and sustainable.

00:24:57.810 --> 00:25:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And it's always
important, though, to keep

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.850 align:middle line:84%
in one's mind on
the spiritual path

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:07.230 align:middle line:84%
that I want to be in
service to other people

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:11.550 align:middle line:84%
and to the planet, that the
point of this, the end of this

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:16.080 align:middle line:84%
is to be a healer in the world
and to be a lover in the world

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.408 align:middle line:84%
and not to just keep
it about me, me, me.

00:25:18.408 --> 00:25:20.700 align:middle line:84%
>> We were going to talk
about stress too a little bit.

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, stress.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.390 align:middle line:84%
>> I know you have looked
at it inside and out.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.070 align:middle line:90%
How do we deal with it?

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of stress management is
actually looking at your life

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.050 align:middle line:90%
and saying, what am I doing?

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:34.060 align:middle line:90%
Why am I doing all this stuff?

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:38.940 align:middle line:84%
If I'm after peace of mind,
happiness, good relationships,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:44.970 align:middle line:84%
and a sense of freedom, and a
sense of joy in everyday life,

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:49.270 align:middle line:84%
is all the activity
adding up to that?

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And if it's not, there's
just so many hours in the day

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and so many people in our
life that we can attend to.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.050 align:middle line:84%
Part of the spiritual
life is simplifying.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And I-- and people don't
always want to hear that.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's, again,
it's the first step they have

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.130 align:middle line:90%
to take.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.753 align:middle line:84%
It's like intending to
clean out your closet.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Life is a lot
more scattered now.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.050 align:middle line:84%
If you ask people
what's missing the most,

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.230 align:middle line:90%
it's a sense of community.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:21.850 align:middle line:90%
It's a sense of belonging.

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a way to know
like-minded people.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a way to slow
down, take stock

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.220 align:middle line:90%
of what does my life mean?

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:84%
Is it just work, home, gym,
this treadmill we're on?

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:38.100 align:middle line:84%
And the world needs
that tremendously now.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.330 align:middle line:84%
>> As Elizabeth Lesser knows
from her own experience,

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:45.450 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual path is riddled
with obstacles and roadblocks.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:47.790 align:middle line:84%
And no matter how
committed you are,

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:51.540 align:middle line:84%
you're still going to get
lost every now and then.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:57.210 align:middle line:10%
Elizabeth, when do we know when
we've made spiritual progress?

00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.820 align:middle line:10%
>> We're always making
spiritual progress.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:03.060 align:middle line:10%
We're always-- spirituality
is like the horizon.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.010 align:middle line:10%
It's always in front of us.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So we don't ever quite totally
arrive at Spirit Station

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.610 align:middle line:90%
and get off and live bliss.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:84%
But for me, signs of
progress are in my own life.

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And I reached a point in
my own path in progress

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.960 align:middle line:84%
where instead of
being mostly kind

00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.050 align:middle line:84%
of confused and
depressed and anxious all

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:36.370 align:middle line:84%
the time with little spices of
happiness every now and then

00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:42.070 align:middle line:84%
to being pretty much happy
all the time with bouts

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.590 align:middle line:90%
of depression and anger and--

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:45.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Blue moments.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:47.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Blue moments.

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:48.850 align:middle line:84%
In my life, it
took a lot of work.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Some people may be
born more that way.

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.430 align:middle line:90%
But I certainly wasn't.

00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:57.520 align:middle line:84%
And I don't think
many, many people are.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Does that mean that crossing
over into the landscape

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.610 align:middle line:84%
of happiness, if we're going
to talk in that language,

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.430 align:middle line:84%
was one of the more difficult
things for you to do?

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:13.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and let me qualify what
I mean by happy because often,

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:16.390 align:middle line:84%
this new spirituality is
accused of being this sort

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:84%
of narcissistic pursuit
of personal happiness

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:84%
at the exclusion of any kind
of giving to the world or other

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.850 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Happiness to me is a sense of
joy in whatever I do in life.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:36.470 align:middle line:84%
So if it's being a
mother, and therefore--

00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I've raised three sons.

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And for a large
chunk of those years,

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:44.760 align:middle line:84%
I think I missed every movie
that came out and never went

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.230 align:middle line:84%
on vacations because I really
gave myself to mothering.

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.200 align:middle line:84%
So if you give yourself to
something that's difficult,

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.300 align:middle line:90%
can you find joy in it?

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Happiness isn't
just like running

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:02.820 align:middle line:84%
after the elusive next
new thing to get better,

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:04.470 align:middle line:90%
cool place to go.

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:09.150 align:middle line:84%
It's fully embracing what
your life is in that moment.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:11.220 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
mean by happiness,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:16.620 align:middle line:84%
a sense of gratitude, a sense
of connection with other people,

00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.810 align:middle line:90%
and a sense of just--

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.800 align:middle line:84%
I have this postcard
on my refrigerator

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.040 align:middle line:84%
that's a woman standing
looking at the ice cubes

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:32.160 align:middle line:84%
in the freezer saying, oh my
god, perfect ice cubes again.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.160 align:middle line:84%
That sense of like
life is amazing,

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.845 align:middle line:84%
life is a miracle without
being a sap about it.

00:29:38.845 --> 00:29:41.740 align:middle line:84%
But that's what I
mean by happiness,

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.340 align:middle line:90%
the ice cubes making you happy.

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:50.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So yes, it was a struggle
and a journey for me to arrive

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:51.300 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:56.730 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd be interested to know
how you came to that conclusion

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.790 align:middle line:84%
because I think it's important
once again to identify

00:29:59.790 --> 00:30:00.600 align:middle line:90%
the problem.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think there are men and
women watching this broadcast

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.340 align:middle line:84%
right now who will
say, that's it.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.710 align:middle line:90%
I'm not happy.

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.390 align:middle line:90%
What do I do about that?

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:14.250 align:middle line:84%
Because identifying
it is one thing.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:18.375 align:middle line:84%
Taking the step towards
happiness is another.

00:30:18.375 --> 00:30:26.080 align:middle line:84%
>> A big, unglamorous step is
first of all understanding that

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.320 align:middle line:84%
the landscape of the heart,
the landscape of the emotions--

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is where
happiness would be found.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Which is one place
where happiness is found.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.860 align:middle line:84%
Because it also is
found in our bodies,

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:40.290 align:middle line:84%
the landscape of the
body, physical healing.

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:43.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's found in the
landscape of the soul, which

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.770 align:middle line:84%
is the landscape
where we identify

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:48.260 align:middle line:84%
with something
greater than ourselves

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.910 align:middle line:90%
and an eternity to life.

00:30:50.910 --> 00:30:54.920 align:middle line:84%
But the landscape of
relationships and daily life

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.960 align:middle line:84%
is very much the landscape of
the heart and the emotions.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.990 align:middle line:84%
If we shut down to
any of the emotions

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:06.980 align:middle line:84%
in the landscape of the heart,
let's say sadness or fear,

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:11.360 align:middle line:84%
and if we don't want to
deal with it, I'm not sad,

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.430 align:middle line:90%
I'm not afraid, I'm not weak--

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:14.750 align:middle line:90%
that's a big one--

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm fine, and we
keep going around it

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and don't want to go through
either painful memories

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.300 align:middle line:84%
or the fact that our
life isn't working,

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:29.240 align:middle line:84%
we're not happy with our mate,
let's say, or ourself as a--

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:32.150 align:middle line:84%
at work, our profession
isn't meaningful.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.913 align:middle line:84%
If we just want to
keep going around it

00:31:33.913 --> 00:31:36.080 align:middle line:84%
and come home and have a
few drinks so we don't have

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.880 align:middle line:84%
to deal or watch television
instead of really confronting

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.360 align:middle line:84%
that other person in our
life in a healthy way,

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.580 align:middle line:84%
if we shut down
to those emotions

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and then try to pursue
happiness, doesn't work.

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:middle line:90%
The open heart feels everything.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:55.700 align:middle line:90%
An open heart feels pain.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.830 align:middle line:84%
It feels other
people's pain so you

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:03.380 align:middle line:84%
can no longer act like a jerk
and not know what you're doing.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.110 align:middle line:90%
An open heart is very sensitive.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.010 align:middle line:90%
It feels everything.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:12.130 align:middle line:84%
So the first step
in being happy is

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:16.240 align:middle line:84%
being willing to feel sad as
strange as that may sound.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.550 align:middle line:90%
They are hand in glove.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:22.570 align:middle line:84%
You can't have one
without the other.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:26.290 align:middle line:84%
There's something
beautiful about our ability

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:29.200 align:middle line:90%
to feel sadness and grief.

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:33.940 align:middle line:84%
And when you go through
a time of great loss

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.940 align:middle line:84%
in life, through the death
of someone or breaking

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:42.070 align:middle line:84%
off a relationship, if you don't
let yourself feel the grief

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:46.930 align:middle line:84%
and you harden around
it, you are shutting down

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:51.020 align:middle line:84%
the possibility toward
true freedom and happiness.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:56.200 align:middle line:84%
So the ability to feel
grief and to feel sadness

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.260 align:middle line:84%
is the first step toward
feeling happiness.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:03.490 align:middle line:84%
>> In your book, one of the
things that brings clarity

00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:08.680 align:middle line:84%
to it is that you allow us
to walk through landscapes,

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.730 align:middle line:84%
the landscape of the heart,
the landscape of the soul.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:15.640 align:middle line:84%
You also talk a great
deal about therapy.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:22.180 align:middle line:84%
Do people ever use
a spiritual practice

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:26.410 align:middle line:84%
in order to avoid something
that would be best dealt

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:90%
with in therapy?

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Some people go into
spirituality as a way to run

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:31.270 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:38.830 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, calm only comes
after other ways of being.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:44.020 align:middle line:84%
To be calm all the time doesn't
mean we are a spiritual person.

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:48.400 align:middle line:84%
If you are suffering abuse,
let's say, being calm

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:52.000 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't necessarily
be the most courageous

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.920 align:middle line:84%
and adventurous and spiritual
way to deal with a situation.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:01.840 align:middle line:84%
So some people bypass life
by taking on what they

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.390 align:middle line:90%
call a spiritual way of being.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:09.370 align:middle line:10%
And there's nothing more to me
frustrating to be with someone

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:14.340 align:middle line:10%
who has a happy face smile
plastered on everything in life

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:18.909 align:middle line:10%
and is using
miracles and a sense

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:22.780 align:middle line:10%
of being saved by
God to not deal.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:25.330 align:middle line:84%
And we've all seen
people who are--

00:34:25.330 --> 00:34:28.870 align:middle line:84%
call themselves spiritual
meditators, go to workshops.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:32.679 align:middle line:84%
Meanwhile, their kids aren't
being cared for correctly

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:84%
or their lives are
just not shining

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.790 align:middle line:84%
examples of what
I would consider

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.489 align:middle line:90%
to be spiritual behavior.

00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:43.659 align:middle line:84%
We always could feel awake
to the splendor of life.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:46.210 align:middle line:84%
But things often are
standing in the way.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:48.310 align:middle line:84%
Our history, our
psychological history,

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.710 align:middle line:84%
the way we were
treated as children,

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:54.969 align:middle line:84%
the way our life has
shaped up is a roadblock.

00:34:54.969 --> 00:34:58.900 align:middle line:84%
And until we go and unravel
our defense mechanisms

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:03.160 align:middle line:84%
toward the rapture
of life, we're stuck.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we just plaster
a spiritual discipline

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:09.850 align:middle line:84%
on top of the roadblocks, we're
not going to get anywhere.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:11.800 align:middle line:84%
We're just going to
kind of go around

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.988 align:middle line:90%
where we have to go through.

00:35:13.988 --> 00:35:16.952 align:middle line:90%

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.570 align:middle line:90%
for Elizabeth Lesser.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:28.260 align:middle line:10%
She survived a divorce,
raised three children,

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.720 align:middle line:10%
helped create the
Omega Institute,

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:34.620 align:middle line:10%
and then in writing "The New
American Spirituality" has

00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:38.610 align:middle line:10%
given each of us a gift,
our own personal guide

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:43.450 align:middle line:10%
to a practical and
meaningful spiritual life.

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.140 align:middle line:10%
What is your life
like now, Elizabeth?

00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.230 align:middle line:10%
Because I get the impression
that the reason you wrote

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:55.150 align:middle line:10%
this book was that life
was difficult. And then

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.780 align:middle line:10%
you shared that journey with us.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.700 align:middle line:90%
Is life easier now?

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:02.920 align:middle line:90%
Is it less difficult for you?

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, profoundly.

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:10.150 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's a combination
of older and wiser, years

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:15.280 align:middle line:10%
of working on myself through
meditation and psychotherapy,

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.690 align:middle line:10%
the fact that my three children
are grown up and in college

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:21.250 align:middle line:10%
and doing well.

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:28.420 align:middle line:84%
And raising kids is
a daily difficulty

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.060 align:middle line:90%
and takes a lot of energy.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:90%
And my-- I have--

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:38.560 align:middle line:84%
my second marriage is built
on the foundation of both

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.140 align:middle line:84%
of our spiritual
work, which is a joy

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:84%
to share the journey
with one's mate,

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:52.060 align:middle line:84%
and bearing the fruits of
having gone through the journey.

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:54.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Was the book difficult
for you to write?

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:56.770 align:middle line:90%
Was it a hard task?

00:36:56.770 --> 00:37:00.100 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was writing the book,
my father died in the middle

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:01.700 align:middle line:90%
of writing the book.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:05.770 align:middle line:84%
So I was in the
rhythm of writing.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:08.650 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to
use writing to get me

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:11.580 align:middle line:84%
through the grief
of losing my father.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:14.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
a great boon to me

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.840 align:middle line:90%
to be able to write it down.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:21.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Particularly since I know
your father was as difficult

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:24.150 align:middle line:90%
a man as he was a lovable man.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:27.400 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he was.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And I was able to use
writing about my feelings.

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:38.650 align:middle line:84%
When a parent dies or when
someone you love dies,

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:41.620 align:middle line:84%
your whole life with
them is churned up.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.860 align:middle line:90%
It's cultivated again.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.360 align:middle line:90%
So you get to relive.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I've relived
some aspects of my life

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:50.980 align:middle line:84%
with my father that
I had forgotten.

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:54.760 align:middle line:84%
Writing about it and just
letting myself really

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:58.520 align:middle line:90%
feel it was very healing.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.910 align:middle line:84%
I felt I was able to
really go through it.

00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Along the way, one of
the friends you met is a man

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:09.190 align:middle line:84%
by the name of Baba Olatunji
who was so helpful to you when

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:10.720 align:middle line:90%
your father died.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:17.990 align:middle line:84%
>> When my father died, I asked
Baba, how should I do this?

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:22.220 align:middle line:84%
How can I create a ceremony
that will speak to everyone?

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.300 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
in my village,

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.610 align:middle line:90%
every person had a song.

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:31.880 align:middle line:84%
And when they passed,
we sing the song.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And that escorts their
spirit into the other world.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:36.860 align:middle line:90%
What was your father's song?

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And sure enough,
when it came time

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.590 align:middle line:84%
in the memorial service for
me to give my little speech,

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I said, and now I'm going
to sing my father's song.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Does anybody know what
my father's song is?

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And all my sisters,
my three sisters,

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.750 align:middle line:90%
chimed in right on beat.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:54.890 align:middle line:90%
They knew nothing about it.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:55.932 align:middle line:90%
But they chimed right in.

00:38:55.932 --> 00:38:59.660 align:middle line:84%
[VOCALIZING] So we
sang that for a while

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.810 align:middle line:90%
and escorted his spirit on.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:09.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting how many
people in my peer group today

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.940 align:middle line:84%
are asking questions
about death.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.170 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden,
they're aware of it.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:14.412 align:middle line:90%
They're afraid of it.

00:39:14.412 --> 00:39:15.620 align:middle line:90%
They have questions about it.

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.740 align:middle line:90%


00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:24.500 align:middle line:90%
Is that answerable these days?

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.100 align:middle line:84%
>> If we're looking for an
answer like this is where we go

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:31.550 align:middle line:84%
when we die, it's not
answerable because I think

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.410 align:middle line:90%
it's the ultimate mystery.

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:37.160 align:middle line:84%
And what the
spiritual path does is

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.540 align:middle line:84%
it gives you the ability to
relax into that mystery instead

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.690 align:middle line:84%
of closing down to it
out of fear or just

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:48.290 align:middle line:84%
out of not knowing what to
do with such an unknown.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:54.110 align:middle line:84%
To be able to relax one's
idea of what it might be like

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:57.410 align:middle line:84%
and just to stand before
it with a sense of openness

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:03.870 align:middle line:84%
and reverence and awe makes
life much more wonderful.

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And how to practice that so
that you can be open to death

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:12.000 align:middle line:84%
is first of all,
it's such a shame

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.360 align:middle line:84%
that people die now in
hospitals or in nursing homes.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And we don't get to be
with people when they die.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:21.300 align:middle line:84%
I have been with several
people as they die and take

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.290 align:middle line:90%
their last breath.

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:25.860 align:middle line:84%
And I can tell you, if
anything has helped me

00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:28.320 align:middle line:84%
with my anxiety
about dying, it's

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.450 align:middle line:90%
being with people as they die.

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:33.960 align:middle line:84%
>> You were with your
best friend when she died.

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Of leukemia.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And that was my first--
the first person

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:42.200 align:middle line:90%
I was with as she died.

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And I felt I went a little
way with her into whatever

00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:47.940 align:middle line:90%
the next world is.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And it gave me a
sense of confidence

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:57.970 align:middle line:90%
in the eternity of the soul.

00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And since then, I've been
with other people as they die.

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:04.690 align:middle line:90%
And I recommend it highly.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:07.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It's greatly comforting
to hear you say that,

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:11.180 align:middle line:84%
to hear you say, it gave
me a sense of confidence.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Because when someone is
with someone when they die,

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:21.010 align:middle line:84%
we are all afraid that the
sense it will give us is sorrow.

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But that's not what
you experienced,

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:24.190 align:middle line:84%
even though she was your
best friend, someone

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.100 align:middle line:90%
you loved for years.

00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:32.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I sensed her
rejoining the undivided sense

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:34.740 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:41.580 align:middle line:84%
I sensed her being freed
from the condensed life

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.070 align:middle line:90%
we live in the body.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:48.150 align:middle line:84%
And it's hard to wrap
words around what I sensed.

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:51.840 align:middle line:84%
And it begins to sound
like something contrived.

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:55.140 align:middle line:84%
But in moments of
meditation, and when

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.930 align:middle line:84%
I am with people who
are dying, or when

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:00.150 align:middle line:84%
I'm listening to
great gospel music

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:middle line:84%
or taking a walk in nature, and
I feel that sense of oneness

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:11.130 align:middle line:84%
with everything that is, that's
when my resistance to death

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:12.240 align:middle line:90%
melts.

00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:17.010 align:middle line:84%
And I know that what
is so now is so forever

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:22.322 align:middle line:84%
and that I'm just part
of an evolving life.

00:42:22.322 --> 00:42:24.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Before I let you go, I'd
like to talk a little bit about

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.280 align:middle line:90%
the Omega Institute.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.430 align:middle line:90%
How did that begin?

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Omega began an idea in
a few young people's minds.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.740 align:middle line:84%
We were-- one of
us was a doctor.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.890 align:middle line:90%
We were in education.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:36.590 align:middle line:90%
We were in spirituality.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And we were a little
ahead of the wave.

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:42.280 align:middle line:84%
We didn't really
know it at the time.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.510 align:middle line:84%
We were just interested
in these things, which

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:48.230 align:middle line:84%
by now are household
words in America-- yoga,

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:50.660 align:middle line:90%
holistic health, meditation.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.530 align:middle line:84%
These were very out there
subjects in those days.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.110 align:middle line:84%
We started very small,
couple of hundred people.

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:00.530 align:middle line:84%
We rented a prep school
in upstate New York,

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.570 align:middle line:90%
had about four or five teachers.

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:84%
But every year, it surprised
us more than anyone what

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.330 align:middle line:90%
the attendance was like.

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:11.090 align:middle line:84%
There was a tremendous
response and hunger.

00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:14.120 align:middle line:84%
We would bring teachers like
Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, who

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.980 align:middle line:84%
was bringing the
subject of death

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.930 align:middle line:90%
and dying into medical schools.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.490 align:middle line:90%
No one knew who she was.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:20.480 align:middle line:90%
But we'd read a book.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:21.860 align:middle line:90%
And we'd bring her.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And then it began to catch
on more in the culture.

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:29.570 align:middle line:84%
Last year, 20,000 people came
to Omega in our summer season.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:34.700 align:middle line:84%
So we have grown so fast
and learned on our way

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.150 align:middle line:84%
how to run an organization
as large as we are now.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:42.860 align:middle line:84%
>> When you began your serious
spiritual journey, it was what,

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.210 align:middle line:90%
25, 30 years ago?

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, it actually started
when you were a little girl.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:51.950 align:middle line:84%
But as a grown-up, there
must have been so many times

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:55.220 align:middle line:84%
when you were the only
woman in the room.

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:59.810 align:middle line:84%
It had to have not been easy
and sometimes infuriating.

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.480 align:middle line:84%
>> It was so
infuriating at times.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.300 align:middle line:84%
I would want to get
on top of the table

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.240 align:middle line:90%
and just beat my chest and wail.

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.790 align:middle line:84%
And I remember once
seeing a documentary

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:14.210 align:middle line:90%
about this Brazilian tribe.

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:16.700 align:middle line:84%
And their habitat
was being encroached

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.020 align:middle line:90%
upon by an oil company.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.980 align:middle line:84%
And they marched into
the capital city.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.300 align:middle line:84%
And the men went with
their spears and war paint.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And they were like fighting
with the officials.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:31.010 align:middle line:90%
And the women took their hands.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:33.170 align:middle line:90%
And they circled all the men.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:35.210 align:middle line:90%
And they started crying.

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:36.500 align:middle line:90%
And they started wailing.

00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:39.200 align:middle line:84%
And tears were streaming
down their cheeks.

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.230 align:middle line:84%
And everyone stopped
and looked at them.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And the head of the tribe said,
the women are speaking for us.

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:47.840 align:middle line:90%
You are hurting us.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.110 align:middle line:84%
And I often at work
would feel the truth.

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And I would want to express
it the way I know how to.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Many years ago when you
began the Omega Institute,

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:01.970 align:middle line:84%
you had great
insight as to where

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:06.050 align:middle line:84%
we were going as a nation
on a spiritual path.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:11.540 align:middle line:84%
As we sit here now and you look
forward, where are we headed?

00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:17.000 align:middle line:84%
What difference will all
this have made in our future?

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I hold as so
hopeful about the coming years,

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.490 align:middle line:84%
what I love the most about what
I see happening in America,

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:28.610 align:middle line:84%
is that we are
becoming one people,

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:35.980 align:middle line:84%
that we are learning to
truly appreciate each race,

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:40.990 align:middle line:84%
each religion, each sex, as
part of this necklace that is

00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:44.260 align:middle line:84%
the world, not that we all
are going to become the same--

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:45.940 align:middle line:90%
God help us.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:52.660 align:middle line:10%
That's why I pray that the
mauling of America stops

00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:57.290 align:middle line:10%
and that we do maintain some of
the diversity around the world.

00:45:57.290 --> 00:46:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But what brings me hope is
our becoming one people.

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.910 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's a metaphor
for becoming unified

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:10.930 align:middle line:84%
within and without
as the many voices

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:17.260 align:middle line:84%
that occupy our internal selves,
our childhood, our training,

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:20.140 align:middle line:84%
becomes one, and we become
a whole strong person,

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.130 align:middle line:90%
and we heal.

00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:24.730 align:middle line:84%
I also see it happening outside
where all the different voices

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.460 align:middle line:84%
in America are
becoming one voice,

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:31.450 align:middle line:84%
maintaining their
beautiful individuality

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:33.740 align:middle line:90%
and becoming unified.

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think spiritually, you can
see that in religions accepting

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:40.360 align:middle line:90%
each other.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:44.140 align:middle line:84%
But beyond religion, I
think the unity of mankind

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.260 align:middle line:90%
is a spiritual endeavor.

00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.020 align:middle line:84%
>> It's certainly gratifying to
see that kind of hopefulness,

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.120 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:53.710 align:middle line:90%
We need hope.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:58.660 align:middle line:84%
Hope is a good
emotion to cultivate.

00:46:58.660 --> 00:46:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.940 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Elizabeth Lesser.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.390 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much.

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.
