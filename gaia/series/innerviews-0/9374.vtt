00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.898 align:middle line:84%
>> "Creating True Prosperity"
is a wonderful book.

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:34.190 align:middle line:90%
And I thank you for writing it.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.480 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the things
that's interesting to me,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.870 align:middle line:10%
and I'd love to hear
you talk about it,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.560 align:middle line:10%
just to personalize it, to
put myself out on a limb,

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.580 align:middle line:10%
I have less now than
I did five years ago.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Less in terms of
the material things?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Material goods,
make less money.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.990 align:middle line:90%
And I'm happier.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, how does that
equate to prosperity?

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.379 align:middle line:84%
You'd think I'd be saying, if
I only made this much money

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.457 align:middle line:90%
or had this much stuff.

00:01:06.457 --> 00:01:07.790 align:middle line:90%
But I have less and I'm happier.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.980 align:middle line:10%
Well, as I say in
the book, most of us

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.940 align:middle line:10%
automatically equate
prosperity with money,

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.780 align:middle line:10%
that if we have a
certain amount of money,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.300 align:middle line:10%
then we'll be prosperous.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.820 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, most
people I know have

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.130 align:middle line:84%
more the kind of experience
you're talking about which

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.380 align:middle line:84%
is, no matter how
much money we make,

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.040 align:middle line:84%
even if we're really making a
lot of money or good incomes,

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
life gets very complex
and very stressful.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.015 align:middle line:84%
And along with the money
comes a lot of complications--

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:38.815 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:42.170 align:middle line:84%
>> --and more responsibilities,
and stress, and so forth.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people I know
have simplified their lives

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
and gotten more clear on
priorities, and, like you,

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
let go of some of the things
that aren't so important

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.580 align:middle line:84%
and are focusing on
what is important,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.580 align:middle line:90%
work that's meaningful--

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.340 align:middle line:84%
>> --deep relationships,
just time for oneself,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:84%
which are the things we tend
to lose when we get more

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.945 align:middle line:90%
"financially prosperous."

00:02:07.945 --> 00:02:10.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I find our world
today to be so hectic.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.670 align:middle line:90%
It moves so fast.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's so insane.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:84%
And so many people are
seeking that simplicity.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.520 align:middle line:84%
What would you say
to those people

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.530 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the first step?

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.510 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people are
filled with intention,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.280 align:middle line:84%
but they don't
know how to start.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.187 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:02:29.187 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:90%
That's a tricky one.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
what you're describing

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.840 align:middle line:84%
is what I call the epidemic of
our culture, which is actually

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.040 align:middle line:90%
time poverty.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.920 align:middle line:84%
>> More of us, or many of
us, who are fairly prosperous

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.420 align:middle line:84%
financially, or
relatively speaking,

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.360 align:middle line:84%
the more prosperous
we get financially,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.655 align:middle line:84%
the more poverty of
time we experience.

00:02:49.655 --> 00:02:50.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Very interesting.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.400 align:middle line:10%
>> How to address that, one
thing is to begin to recognize

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:10%
the value of being.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:10%
In our culture,
we so value doing.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:10%
We're supposed to
be doing something.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:10%
We're supposed to be
achieving, and accomplishing,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.350 align:middle line:10%
and producing
something all the time.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.650 align:middle line:84%
And we think of being
as wasting our time.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Whereas being is a profound
human experience that we need

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:90%
to balance.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Being is a time of
quietness, and reflection,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.570 align:middle line:84%
and replenishment that we
need to balance that outgoing

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.830 align:middle line:90%
and doing.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.950 align:middle line:84%
So we have to create some
space for that in our lives.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
>> And in order to do that, we
have to value and experience

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So any form of meditation, or
relaxation, or self-nurturing,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.100 align:middle line:84%
taking a hot bath and listening
to some beautiful music,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:90%
taking a walk.

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.310 align:middle line:84%
Being in contact
with nature, that's

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
another thing we're
so missing that

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.360 align:middle line:90%
can be so deeply fulfilling.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to see if I
get what you're saying.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.990 align:middle line:84%
We've been taught that
simply being is not doing,

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.170 align:middle line:90%
but doing nothing.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.595 align:middle line:84%
>> And people feel
that's not valuable.

00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:03.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.760 align:middle line:84%
If you're not actively
engaged in moving forward

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.240 align:middle line:84%
toward a goal, or
creating something,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.630 align:middle line:84%
accomplishing something, we
think of that as wasting time.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.540 align:middle line:84%
And the people who are more
inclined in that direction

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.860 align:middle line:84%
are often thought of as
dreamers, and time wasters,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:22.812 align:middle line:90%
non-productive people.

00:04:22.812 --> 00:04:23.612 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:23.612 --> 00:04:24.412 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:04:24.412 --> 00:04:27.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of us super productive,
active people manage to attract

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:84%
somebody into our life,
whether our partner, or friend,

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.630 align:middle line:84%
or our child who is the more
being type of person because we

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:35.950 align:middle line:90%
need that balance.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.582 align:middle line:84%
>> Then maybe I had
this as a child,

00:04:37.582 --> 00:04:39.040 align:middle line:84%
because my report
card always said,

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.270 align:middle line:84%
Chantal is too
much of a dreamer.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.417 align:middle line:90%
>> You probably did.

00:04:42.417 --> 00:04:44.500 align:middle line:84%
>> So I had it going on
back then, So that's good.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.510 align:middle line:90%
>> And good for you, you know?

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.945 align:middle line:90%
So we need to have that balance.

00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:48.745 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:48.745 --> 00:04:50.710 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's tough.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a difficult
thing in our culture.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to find some way
of making a commitment to that,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.410 align:middle line:84%
and having some, even if it's
a few minutes, of quiet time.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very interesting
you use the word balance,

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.300 align:middle line:84%
because as I travel about the
country with WISDOM Television

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:16.120 align:middle line:84%
and I talk to healers,
and seers, and chanters,

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.470 align:middle line:84%
and so many of the authors who
are really making a difference

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.650 align:middle line:84%
in our world today, so
many spiritual leaders,

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.285 align:middle line:84%
and the word I hear, almost
every day, is balance.

00:05:28.285 --> 00:05:33.130 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the word I find
myself saying and using the most

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.335 align:middle line:84%
in my workshops and
in my life as well.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is that?

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.270 align:middle line:84%
>> To me, it seems that is
one of our fundamental needs

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.730 align:middle line:84%
in life is to develop all
the many different aspects

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.090 align:middle line:90%
of ourselves.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.150 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
we find a certain kind

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.130 align:middle line:90%
of balance and wholeness.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.930 align:middle line:84%
But most of us, we have certain
qualities very developed.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have other qualities
that are undeveloped in us.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.990 align:middle line:84%
And that leads to a kind of
a lopsided experience of life

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
which, ultimately, is
painful and frustrating.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.670 align:middle line:84%
For example, we've talked about
the doing and being polarities.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Let's talk about responsibility.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm a super responsible
person, which

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.790 align:middle line:84%
means that I kind
of automatically

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.390 align:middle line:84%
take on responsibilities
and will always

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.025 align:middle line:84%
try to do the responsible thing,
which is a wonderful quality.

00:06:25.025 --> 00:06:25.825 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:25.825 --> 00:06:27.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And it can be too much.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:84%
I can take on too much
and practically die

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.825 align:middle line:84%
trying to fulfill all
my responsibilities.

00:06:32.825 --> 00:06:33.625 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:37.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So there's an opposite
quality there which you could

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.890 align:middle line:84%
think of as irresponsible, if
you look at it in a negative

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:40.690 align:middle line:90%
way.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, if you look at
it in terms of polarities.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Responsible.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.900 align:middle line:90%
Non-responsible.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so nobody wants
to be irresponsible.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But if you look
beneath that judgment

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.070 align:middle line:84%
to find what is the positive
essence of that quality

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:59.710 align:middle line:84%
that we need, it's relax, the
ability to relax, or carefree,

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.710 align:middle line:84%
being a little lighter
and more carefree.

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.670 align:middle line:90%
And that's a balance.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:08.590 align:middle line:84%
I need more carefree
energy in my life,

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:84%
so I have to do the work of
being a little less identified

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.080 align:middle line:84%
with being so responsible and
bringing a little bit more

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
of that lighthearted
and carefree quality.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.660 align:middle line:84%
And then I feel better
and my life works better.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.660 align:middle line:90%
>> And we know, we have a sense.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it's
just us baby boomers,

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.380 align:middle line:84%
I would say not,
because even kids,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.440 align:middle line:84%
even kids that I
talk to today, they

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.100 align:middle line:84%
have a sense that something is
out of balance in the world.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.470 align:middle line:84%
They have a sense that
something is out of balance

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:84%
with them, within themselves,
individually, I mean.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.080 align:middle line:84%
I don't know a
time in my lifetime

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.490 align:middle line:84%
when we've recognized
it more than we do now.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.330 align:middle line:90%
Why is that?

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.430 align:middle line:84%
What is happening in the
world, if I can ask you

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.610 align:middle line:90%
such a global question--

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:02.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.700 align:middle line:84%
>> --because I've talked
about this stuff all my life.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.566 align:middle line:84%
But never have I talked
so much about balance.

00:08:08.566 --> 00:08:13.090 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just what's up in
our evolutionary process,

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
as I believe that humanity
is in an ongoing evolutionary

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
process, and all of
us are a part of that.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And whatever we're
working with, whatever

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.880 align:middle line:84%
issues we're working within
our own individual lives,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:26.860 align:middle line:84%
they're also part of
the collective issues

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.110 align:middle line:84%
that we're working
on in our world.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And so balance, we've gotten
to a place where we actually

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:37.990 align:middle line:90%
can address quality of life.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.652 align:middle line:84%
Up until now, most of
us have been preoccupied

00:08:40.652 --> 00:08:41.819 align:middle line:90%
with just trying to survive.

00:08:41.819 --> 00:08:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.685 align:middle line:84%
>> And most of humanity still
is preoccupied with just trying

00:08:45.685 --> 00:08:46.485 align:middle line:90%
to survive.

00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:47.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:47.285 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We're extremely fortunate,
those of us who have enough

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.520 align:middle line:84%
affluence to live
in this culture,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.700 align:middle line:84%
that we don't have to
just try to survive,

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:02.560 align:middle line:84%
we now have the luxury of
trying to find deeper meaning,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and purpose, and
fulfillment in life.

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that we also
have a responsibility, then,

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.850 align:middle line:84%
That's our piece that
we can contribute

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:14.670 align:middle line:90%
to the whole of humanity.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:84%
>> So you mean when we
recognize we're out of balance,

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.110 align:middle line:90%
it's up to us to find a balance.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.400 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that in our own
individual lives, whatever

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:28.220 align:middle line:84%
step of healing, and
development, and growth

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.600 align:middle line:84%
we do as individuals,
we also contribute that

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:84%
into the collective
consciousness.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:36.880 align:middle line:84%
And, in fact, to me,
that's the only way

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:42.040 align:middle line:84%
we can truly change the
world and change and heal

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.390 align:middle line:84%
what's happening on our planet
is by doing the deep healing

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.060 align:middle line:84%
work in ourselves, finding
more of that balance,

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.180 align:middle line:84%
that integration in
ourselves and in our lives.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.095 align:middle line:84%
And then that's how we bring
balance into the world.

00:09:56.095 --> 00:10:00.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And oddly enough,
when that balance comes,

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.910 align:middle line:84%
that is one of the things,
one of the very things,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:90%
that does lead us to prosperity.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:08.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's essentially
what I'm saying in this book--

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.040 align:middle line:10%
>> --and in these workshops
is that prosperity is

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:10%
a reflection-- first of all,
prosperity is not a thing out

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:15.700 align:middle line:10%
there.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.070 align:middle line:10%
It's an experience.

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.740 align:middle line:84%
You can have all the money in
the world and not experience

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.595 align:middle line:84%
prosperity because it's
an internal experience.

00:10:23.595 --> 00:10:27.125 align:middle line:84%
>> I want you to say that again,
because it's very important.

00:10:27.125 --> 00:10:28.040 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:28.840 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Prosperity--

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.810 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, prosperity
is not caused by money.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:84%
You can have a very high
degree of prosperity

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
with a very simple life
and not much money,

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.990 align:middle line:84%
or you can have a high degree of
prosperity with a lot of money.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.980 align:middle line:84%
But most people, at
every level of income,

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.110 align:middle line:84%
don't experience
very much prosperity.

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.510 align:middle line:84%
They experience
stress, and troubles,

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:49.610 align:middle line:84%
and unfulfilled feelings,
and all kinds of things.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:53.540 align:middle line:84%
So it's not that money can
really bring us prosperity.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:90%
It may be a part of that.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:90%
But prosperity is an experience.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:03.010 align:middle line:84%
And it comes from being in touch
with our hearts, and our souls,

00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.920 align:middle line:84%
and what we truly need,
want, and value in life.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And the more we are fulfilled,
in terms of what we truly

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:84%
need and want on all levels,
spiritually, emotionally,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.300 align:middle line:84%
mentally, and
physically, then the more

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:19.720 align:middle line:84%
we're in touch with that, the
more prosperity we experience.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So what I said is, prosperity
isn't really external.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.990 align:middle line:84%
It's an internal experience
that comes, basically,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.560 align:middle line:84%
as a result of having
our needs met, and not

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.610 align:middle line:90%
just our physical needs.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:31.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why,
materialistically,

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:84%
you can have all the money and
possessions in the world and it

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.710 align:middle line:84%
might make you
happy on some level,

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:41.860 align:middle line:84%
but it won't fulfill the
spiritual or the emotional

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.272 align:middle line:90%
needs that we have.

00:11:43.272 --> 00:11:46.576 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:46.576 --> 00:11:48.464 align:middle line:10%


00:11:48.464 --> 00:11:54.070 align:middle line:10%
>> On the road to prosperity,
I love the exercises we have

00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:10%
to do in the book, where
you go someplace quiet--

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.240 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, there's a really
simple exercise I do with people

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:10%
in workshops where first,
I ask them to think about

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.330 align:middle line:10%
the prosperity you
already have in your life.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.163 align:middle line:10%
Because we all already
have certain things--

00:12:09.163 --> 00:12:09.963 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes

00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:10%
>> --that are very--

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:12.950 align:middle line:10%
make us feel good,
make us happy.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.110 align:middle line:90%
>> The gratitude exercise.

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so then we start
by having appreciation

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and gratitude for
what we already have.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Then the second step is the
more challenging one, for most

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:84%
of us, which is then to take
a real good honest look inside

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.540 align:middle line:84%
to see, what don't
you have in your life?

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And that's more scary,
because in order--

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:31.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Very.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:31.945 align:middle line:90%
>> -- to do that--

00:12:31.945 --> 00:12:33.000 align:middle line:90%
>> For a lot of people.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.600 align:middle line:84%
We have to be willing to
feel some of our pain.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.450 align:middle line:84%
Now, I happen to believe
that feeling the pain that's

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:84%
in there, or the discomfort,
or the emptiness,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.975 align:middle line:84%
or whatever it might be, is a
necessary step in addressing

00:12:48.975 --> 00:12:51.090 align:middle line:90%
it and beginning to heal it.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But our whole culture
tells us, if you have pain,

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.280 align:middle line:84%
try to get away from it
as quickly as possible.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.740 align:middle line:90%
Take a pill.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't feel it.

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't feel it.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Don't feel it, it's too scary.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And most of us are very afraid
of our own deep feelings

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.500 align:middle line:90%
for that reason.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:12.060 align:middle line:84%
So taking a look at, what part
of your life isn't fulfilling?

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:16.080 align:middle line:84%
Usually, most of us tend to
have some places in our life

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.760 align:middle line:84%
where we feel pretty good, or
things are working pretty well.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
There's a certain
fulfillment there.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.380 align:middle line:84%
For example, in my life,
in terms of my work,

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.360 align:middle line:90%
I love my work.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.170 align:middle line:84%
My work has been
very successful.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:28.680 align:middle line:84%
I feel kind of filled
up in the part of me

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.770 align:middle line:84%
that wants to make a
contribution to life

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:33.420 align:middle line:84%
and wants to have
meaningful work.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.650 align:middle line:90%
That really works for me.

00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:37.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's get down
to the nitty-gritty.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> So OK--

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Where's your pain?

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:38.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:39.250 align:middle line:90%
>> In the personal part.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The pain is more
on the personal level.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Like many people who
are very successful,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.550 align:middle line:90%
my work takes over my life.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.540 align:middle line:84%
And even though I love it,
there's not enough time for me.

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.140 align:middle line:84%
And there's not enough time
for my intimate relationships,

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.172 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:13:53.172 --> 00:13:55.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this as
something that I work on

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.910 align:middle line:90%
on an ongoing basis.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:59.347 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, it's
more the longing is--

00:13:59.347 --> 00:14:00.930 align:middle line:84%
actually, for me,
you know what it is?

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.730 align:middle line:84%
It's to stay home because
I travel all the time.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I have this exciting life
and wonderful in many ways.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.175 align:middle line:84%
But I've been doing
it for a long time.

00:14:10.175 --> 00:14:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> And people are always saying,
oh, your life is so glamorous,

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.770 align:middle line:90%
I wish I had it.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.840 align:middle line:90%
And you go, right.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:15.640 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.150 align:middle line:84%
>> For most people, the thought
of all that traveling would be

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.020 align:middle line:90%
exciting.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
For me, it's like,
oh, I just want

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.380 align:middle line:90%
to stay home for the weekend.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.963 align:middle line:84%
I just want to have
a weekend at home.

00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:90%
And when I do, I'm so happy.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's part of the
reason why I think your books

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:33.360 align:middle line:84%
are so successful and your
workshops are so huge,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.260 align:middle line:84%
because you have
enough integrity,

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:40.530 align:middle line:84%
and enough emotional
availability,

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:44.340 align:middle line:84%
and honesty to say, OK, do you
want to know what my pain is,

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:46.725 align:middle line:84%
because that's the same pain
that a lot of people have.

00:14:46.725 --> 00:14:47.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.630 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.020 align:middle line:90%
I thank you.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.780 align:middle line:90%
And lots of people thank you.

00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.890 align:middle line:84%
But that's the pain
a lot of people have.

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's very difficult.
And sometimes,

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.290 align:middle line:84%
I think it's almost
embarrassing to say,

00:14:58.290 --> 00:14:59.790 align:middle line:90%
you know where my pain is?

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:01.920 align:middle line:90%
It's the personal part.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.860 align:middle line:84%
It's the intimate
relationships part.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you have rooms
filled with people

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:11.100 align:middle line:90%
listening to you saying, yeah.

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the
most important things

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:18.430 align:middle line:84%
I've learned over the years
is that as human beings,

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.070 align:middle line:90%
we're all very vulnerable.

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:21.070 align:middle line:90%
>> You talk about that--

00:15:21.070 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:90%
>> We have a lot--

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:21.510 align:middle line:90%
>> --a lot.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:22.427 align:middle line:90%
>> --of vulnerability.

00:15:22.427 --> 00:15:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of the
most disowned qualities

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.940 align:middle line:90%
in our culture too.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We're supposed to be very
strong, and together,

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:33.060 align:middle line:84%
and not need
anybody or anything,

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.780 align:middle line:90%
and have all the answers.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.320 align:middle line:84%
That's how most of
us try to be, anyway.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.990 align:middle line:90%
And we disown our vulnerability.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we all have
lots of emotional needs,

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.580 align:middle line:90%
and feelings, and sensitivities.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:46.890 align:middle line:84%
And to me, it's
an act of courage

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:51.030 align:middle line:84%
to own the vulnerable
part, and the power too.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.400 align:middle line:84%
We have power and we
have vulnerability.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.855 align:middle line:90%
How do we balance?

00:15:54.855 --> 00:15:56.076 align:middle line:90%
>> Balance?

00:15:56.076 --> 00:16:00.180 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we hold and own
both those polarities?

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I would suggest that I
think a lot of people stay away

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.830 align:middle line:84%
from the vulnerable parts,
because people associate

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:06.955 align:middle line:90%
hurting with vulnerability.

00:16:06.955 --> 00:16:07.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Vulnerability means
able to be hurt.

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.330 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's what it implies.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:16.640 align:middle line:10%
If we're invulnerable,
it means nobody

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:20.220 align:middle line:10%
can penetrate, nobody can get
to us, nobody can hurt us.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.540 align:middle line:10%
But nobody can deeply
relate to us either.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:10%
So vulnerability is the risk
that if you open and you

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:34.040 align:middle line:10%
show your feelings, you show
your needs, you can get hurt.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:90%
That's the risk.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.860 align:middle line:90%
That's the risk of intimacy.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.320 align:middle line:84%
Because if we want real
intimacy in our lives,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.320 align:middle line:84%
we have to be willing to
show our vulnerability.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:44.900 align:middle line:84%
>> We have to show ourselves to
another person in order to feel

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:90%
intimate.

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Not like you take
your vulnerability

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and you just throw
it on the floor

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.680 align:middle line:90%
there for people to walk on.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.710 align:middle line:84%
You have to have wisdom
in how you use it,

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.500 align:middle line:84%
that it's a trustworthy
situation, as far as you

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:01.732 align:middle line:84%
can tell, and you have
boundaries with it.

00:17:01.732 --> 00:17:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time,
that's the only way

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.185 align:middle line:84%
we can have that deep
connection with one another.

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:08.869 align:middle line:84%
>> Going back to the
prosperity for a second,

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:10.869 align:middle line:84%
although that was
its own prosperity,

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:13.369 align:middle line:84%
one of the things you say in
your book that I'd love to hear

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.865 align:middle line:84%
you talk more about is
that money is energy.

00:17:15.865 --> 00:17:17.162 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:17:17.162 --> 00:17:18.540 align:middle line:90%
>> How is that so?

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:84%
>> As I mentioned
earlier, what is money?

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:84%
Really, literally,
it's just pieces

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.480 align:middle line:90%
of paper, metal, plastic.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.280 align:middle line:90%
It has no intrinsic value.

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.940 align:middle line:84%
It is a symbol that
we have agreed upon

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:35.760 align:middle line:84%
to represent our exchange
of creative energy.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.250 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand that
money is a symbol of energy,

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.150 align:middle line:84%
you begin to understand
how it works in our lives.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.860 align:middle line:84%
>> How is it a change
of our creative energy?

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Because you don't need money
to exchange creative energy.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.630 align:middle line:90%
We're exchanging that now.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what I'm
saying, for example,

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.850 align:middle line:84%
is I use my creative
energy to write a book.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:55.982 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:55.982 --> 00:17:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> My publisher pays
me money in exchange--

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:90%
>> --for that creative energy.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.390 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.660 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:02.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:03.610 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Then my publisher sells
the book to the bookstore,

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.393 align:middle line:84%
gets money for his
creative energy.

00:18:09.393 --> 00:18:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're simplifying
here a little bit.

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.102 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, but I'm with you.

00:18:12.102 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:84%
>> You walk into the bookstore,
you use the money you get from

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.600 align:middle line:90%
doing this--

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>> From WISDOM Television.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:18.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:90%
>> And I buy--

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.060 align:middle line:90%
>> And you buy my book.

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:21.740 align:middle line:90%
>> You see, so--

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:22.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.940 align:middle line:84%
>> --we have each done whatever
our creative energy is,

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:31.658 align:middle line:84%
and our skills, and money
is the medium that we use.

00:18:31.658 --> 00:18:33.950 align:middle line:84%
Back in the good old days,
we lived in little villages,

00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:34.760 align:middle line:90%
we just exchanged.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:35.560 align:middle line:90%
We just bartered.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:36.680 align:middle line:90%
We didn't need money.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.560 align:middle line:84%
But life got more complicated
and we couldn't just

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.210 align:middle line:90%
do that anymore.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So money is simply a symbol of
the creative energy and skill

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
that we have to exchange
with one another.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:51.170 align:middle line:84%
So if you understand
that money is really

00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:53.850 align:middle line:90%
just a symbol of energy--

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Of energy.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.790 align:middle line:84%
>> --then you can see how it
reflects how energy is flowing

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.490 align:middle line:90%
in our lives.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.295 align:middle line:84%
If you are doing
what you really need

00:19:04.295 --> 00:19:06.170 align:middle line:84%
to be doing, if you're
being true to yourself

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:84%
and you're just walking along
your path step by step, just

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.790 align:middle line:84%
right where you want
to be, and need to be,

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.540 align:middle line:84%
and in the flow of your
life, usually money

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.350 align:middle line:84%
is flowing through your life
in the exact appropriate amount

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:90%
that you need.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:20.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if
you've noticed this.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:21.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I have.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:84%
>> When you're really
right where you need to be,

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.200 align:middle line:84%
there's just the
right amount of money.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:24.740 align:middle line:90%
>> There's enough.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.910 align:middle line:84%
>> There's not usually a
whole lot more than you need--

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:27.110 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.740 align:middle line:90%
>> --I find.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.150 align:middle line:90%
Once you're--

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:28.370 align:middle line:90%
>> But there's enough.

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> --doing this in a conscious
way, there's just enough.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:31.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's not a problem.

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.050 align:middle line:90%
It's not an issue.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.990 align:middle line:84%
You're supported and moving
along the way you need to.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.030 align:middle line:84%
If you have a money
problem, especially

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.450 align:middle line:84%
like a temporary financial
crisis or setback,

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.310 align:middle line:84%
I find that, more
often than not,

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.620 align:middle line:84%
that's a reflection that,
on some other level,

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.433 align:middle line:90%
the energy is getting blocked.

00:19:49.433 --> 00:19:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's sort of like a
wake up call, hey, something

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:90%
needs attention.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.720 align:middle line:84%
Something needs
healing or changing.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.760 align:middle line:84%
Some way I'm not
being true to myself,

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.500 align:middle line:84%
or I'm not taking
care of myself,

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:84%
or I'm not taking that
risk that I need to,

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.450 align:middle line:84%
or I'm taking some risk that
I really shouldn't be taking.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So then it's a matter
of looking, ah, where's

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.670 align:middle line:90%
the energy blocked here?

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:11.250 align:middle line:84%
So money can be a
teacher and a reflection

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.370 align:middle line:84%
that can help us see what's
going on inside of us.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.710 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it may relate
specifically to money,

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.558 align:middle line:84%
like you need to learn something
more about managing money.

00:20:20.558 --> 00:20:23.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's a problem here and
it's showing you, hey, wake up,

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:24.090 align:middle line:90%
something to learn.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.450 align:middle line:84%
But often, it may not even
have to do with money itself.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:33.270 align:middle line:84%
It may have to do with you're
not nurturing yourself enough.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:84%
You're not setting clear
boundaries for yourself.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:84%
You're giving away too
much, or something.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:37.900 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:38.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.520 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's interesting
to look at it that way.

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.430 align:middle line:84%
People who have
chronic money issues,

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.040 align:middle line:84%
like always struggling, never
quite making it, or just--

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.255 align:middle line:90%
>> They had to buy the dress.

00:20:49.255 --> 00:20:49.940 align:middle line:90%
>> --barely making it.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>> They had to buy the shoes.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:52.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Those kind of people.

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.490 align:middle line:84%
>> --OK, that's a
different thing.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it?

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:54.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.340 align:middle line:84%
But basically, there's a lot
of addictions around money.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.135 align:middle line:84%
>> Just different ways that
we use money to try to satisfy

00:21:00.135 --> 00:21:02.160 align:middle line:84%
some craving we have
that doesn't really work.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.770 align:middle line:84%
>> The devil made
me buy those shoes.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:04.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's just definitely a
whole big issue for many of us.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.860 align:middle line:84%
We all have some kind
of addiction or other.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And money, different ways
of working with money,

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:17.513 align:middle line:84%
sometimes are different
addictive processes.

00:21:17.513 --> 00:21:18.930 align:middle line:84%
But what I was
actually addressing

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.840 align:middle line:84%
was people who just
have chronic struggle

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:24.420 align:middle line:84%
to just have enough
money to make ends meet.

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:84%
Very often, it has to
do with issues of power.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.060 align:middle line:84%
Money gives us a certain
amount of power in the world.

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:84%
So if we're afraid of power,
then we sort of unconsciously

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.790 align:middle line:84%
may choose not to
have very much money

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and to always be
struggling about money.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we're afraid to step
into the power of having more

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.115 align:middle line:90%
money.

00:21:49.115 --> 00:21:51.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not saying there's
anything better or worse

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.040 align:middle line:90%
about more money.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.360 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's only what you
do with it that matters.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.400 align:middle line:84%
But it is an issue
for many people

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:84%
that they don't realize the
real issue is about power.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So if you have-- what I'm
suggesting to people--

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.830 align:middle line:84%
is if you have a chronic
issue of lack of money,

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.830 align:middle line:84%
or struggle around
money, or self-sabotage,

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:13.998 align:middle line:84%
look honestly to see how
you feel about power, that

00:22:13.998 --> 00:22:16.290 align:middle line:84%
moving into being more
powerful, because that's usually

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.295 align:middle line:90%
what it's about.

00:22:17.295 --> 00:22:21.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Before you go, now that
you're a successful author

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.040 align:middle line:84%
and well-known speaker, how's
your life balance going?

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Are you practicing
what you're preaching?

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Are you spending
more time at home?

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.760 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I'm always
practicing what I'm preaching

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:34.135 align:middle line:90%
in terms of--

00:22:34.135 --> 00:22:36.990 align:middle line:84%
in fact, ask my husband,
and any of my friends,

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:38.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm practically obsessed
with consciousness.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm always looking,
and trying to learn,

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.780 align:middle line:84%
and working on
myself, and all that.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.510 align:middle line:84%
In fact, a of times what I
need to do to be more balanced

00:22:45.510 --> 00:22:48.150 align:middle line:84%
is let go of all that
and just have some fun.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:51.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I do that.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
So, yeah, I do really
work on practicing--

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:54.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>> --what I'm preaching.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's an ongoing
process, for sure.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.290 align:middle line:84%
And I do deal and grapple
with things on a daily basis

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:02.640 align:middle line:90%
just like everybody does.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And as I mentioned
earlier, for me,

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.130 align:middle line:84%
the balance issue
mostly has to do

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:16.860 align:middle line:84%
with balancing my work, career,
responsible parts with the ones

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:20.820 align:middle line:84%
that need more time,
quiet, nurturing.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:23.547 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for me, you've been
a great example of balance.

00:23:23.547 --> 00:23:25.380 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for
talking to us at WISDOM.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:25.895 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

00:23:25.895 --> 00:23:27.000 align:middle line:90%
>> And I hope we talk again.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:27.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, me too.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:28.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd love that.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I have a
feeling we will.

00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:29.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:30.730 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.320 align:middle line:90%
