00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.500 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:30.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>> What a pleasure it is for
me to sit and talk with you.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.230 align:middle line:84%
Your book is so enrolling
and so intriguing.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.070 align:middle line:10%
The first reason I find it so
is that you're doing something

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.490 align:middle line:10%
that very few people do.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.665 align:middle line:10%
Is that right, or are
there other curanderas?

00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:51.560 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, in
the United States,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:84%
there's not that
many curanderas.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.660 align:middle line:10%
We really weren't
validated to be curanderas.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.590 align:middle line:10%
For those of us that were
born with the gift to heal,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.370 align:middle line:10%
you know, we call it
[SPEAKING SPANISH]..

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.590 align:middle line:10%
We were encouraged to be
nurses or be social workers--

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:10%
>> And practice
Western medicine.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And practice
Western medicine.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.135 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, before I get ahead
of myself because I've read

00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:16.760 align:middle line:84%
the book and I'm
fascinated, of course,

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.030 align:middle line:84%
I want to share it
with our viewers.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.930 align:middle line:84%
Let us first define
what you do as a healer.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.060 align:middle line:10%
Curanderismo is a
medicine that came

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.350 align:middle line:10%
from peoples sharing medicine--

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.290 align:middle line:10%
the Spanish people that
came to this continent,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:10%
the indigenous people
that were already here,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.100 align:middle line:10%
and the African people.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
So all of these
peoples came together,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.270 align:middle line:90%
and they shared like we share.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Some herbs that were
brought from Spain

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.590 align:middle line:84%
were shared with the
indigenous people.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:84%
The Africans believe
that the soul

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.600 align:middle line:90%
can get scared and run away.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.060 align:middle line:90%
You've seen that as a metaphor.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.600 align:middle line:90%
It was also shared.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.990 align:middle line:84%
And from all of that sharing and
assimilating came curanderismo.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So then your kind of healing,
not only covers something

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.870 align:middle line:84%
as simple like a migraine
headache-- to some people,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:84%
a migraine headache isn't
simple-- but a headache.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> While you're having
it, it's not very simple.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.780 align:middle line:84%
While you're having
it, it's very painful.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.788 align:middle line:90%
I know, I've had them.

00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:23.330 align:middle line:84%
It's probably why
it came to my mind.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>> A sore throat
or a stomach ache.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.020 align:middle line:84%
It heals physical things, but
it also heals emotional things,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.090 align:middle line:90%
like let's say rage.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.930 align:middle line:90%
You cover both?

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We call it
[SPEAKING SPANISH],, rage.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a comprehensive medicine.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.410 align:middle line:84%
Curanderismo is a
comprehensive medicine.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.600 align:middle line:84%
So the curandera
or the curandero

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.900 align:middle line:84%
might treat somebody with
diabetes or heart problems,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.490 align:middle line:84%
but they might
also treat somebody

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.890 align:middle line:84%
that's having spiritual
problems or emotional problems,

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.350 align:middle line:90%
for instance, envy.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.410 align:middle line:84%
These are what we call
folk diseases, what

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.670 align:middle line:84%
us regular people notice
what makes us sick

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.650 align:middle line:90%
and what makes us well.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So we noticed that
envy can make us sick.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So the emotion
can make you sick.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.940 align:middle line:90%
An emotion.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.040 align:middle line:90%
>> An emotion can make you sick.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.280 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I call
envy the twisted heart.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.360 align:middle line:90%
It's a normal emotion.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.220 align:middle line:10%
We all have envy.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.470 align:middle line:10%
We wish we were younger,
thinner, had more money.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.710 align:middle line:84%
It's a normal emotion, but
it can get very twisted,

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.360 align:middle line:84%
where we start to
spend a lot of time

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.890 align:middle line:90%
wishing we were somebody else.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Folk diseases, we do
that all the time.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.800 align:middle line:84%
For instance, we
identify diseases

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:90%
right now as road rage.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.930 align:middle line:84%
I fly a lot, so I identify a
disease called frequent flyer

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.805 align:middle line:90%
depression.

00:03:50.805 --> 00:03:52.490 align:middle line:84%
>> So you must
have it sometimes.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I have it sometimes.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:57.580 align:middle line:90%
>> So, physician, heal thyself.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.060 align:middle line:90%
What do you do for it?

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Well--

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:84%
>> I know it's a
question of remembering.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.070 align:middle line:90%
>> But what do you do for it?

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I take certain supplements.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.230 align:middle line:84%
I try to eat as healthy as
I can while I am traveling.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.350 align:middle line:84%
I try to carry
some foods with me

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.769 align:middle line:84%
instead of eating the junk--
you know, the peanuts that's

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.899 align:middle line:90%
given on airlines.

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:21.130 align:middle line:90%
I give myself space.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.410 align:middle line:84%
For instance, I talk
to a lot of people.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.700 align:middle line:90%
I lecture.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.250 align:middle line:84%
So I create a
space for myself so

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:84%
that I can go somewhere, go take
a walk, go connect with nature.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.670 align:middle line:84%
I think that's one of
the most important things

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.760 align:middle line:84%
is to find a place
even in a large city

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.270 align:middle line:90%
to connect with nature.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.500 align:middle line:84%
Any place, any little spot
where I can sit on the grass

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.770 align:middle line:84%
or look at the sky, any
place to connect with nature.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.580 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the pitfalls,
I would imagine,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.310 align:middle line:90%
of being a curandera is this.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.700 align:middle line:84%
Because you have a
gift, some curanderas

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.790 align:middle line:84%
must feel the need to
just cure as many people

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.430 align:middle line:84%
as they possibly
can in a day and not

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.057 align:middle line:90%
take care of their own spirit.

00:05:08.057 --> 00:05:10.390 align:middle line:84%
>> We want to stamp out disease
and suffering, you know,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.800 align:middle line:90%
everywhere we see it.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.900 align:middle line:84%
That's been one of
my biggest challenges

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.460 align:middle line:84%
is to learn how to
take care of myself.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.290 align:middle line:84%
>> And the Aztecs call
it [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.720 align:middle line:90%
knowledge of my essence.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.720 align:middle line:84%
If I have knowledge
of my essence,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.700 align:middle line:84%
including the part of me that
is so compassionate that I

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.750 align:middle line:84%
will leave myself, I will
not take care of myself.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.430 align:middle line:84%
I will leave that part of
me, reject a part of me,

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.680 align:middle line:90%
to take care of somebody else.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.680 align:middle line:84%
If I know that I
have that in me,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.160 align:middle line:84%
then I have learned how to
take care of that aspect of me.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.960 align:middle line:90%
To learn to pick priorities.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:84%
There's times that I need
to just let people go.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.590 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be fine.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.750 align:middle line:84%
It's actually ego to
think that they need me.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.550 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.008 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, they don't
need me because one of the most

00:06:07.008 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:84%
important messages that I like
to express to people is that

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.600 align:middle line:90%
we're all medicine.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.770 align:middle line:90%
We have medicine inside of us.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
We don't need the
famous curandera,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.400 align:middle line:84%
or the famous doctor, or
all the fancy supplements,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.780 align:middle line:90%
or all the fancy diets.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.910 align:middle line:84%
What we need is
knowledge of our essence,

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:84%
how to bring out the medicine
that is inside of us.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> That would be the role,
then, of the curandera.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.590 align:middle line:84%
>> That is the role
of the curandera.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.610 align:middle line:84%
The curandera always
brings spirit in.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.860 align:middle line:90%
Always.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I notice.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>> We never leave spirit out.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:90%
I am a spirited human being.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a soul and
spirit as I have a body.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.680 align:middle line:84%
So I have a mind
as I have feelings.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.252 align:middle line:90%
So why would I expect--

00:06:53.252 --> 00:06:54.710 align:middle line:84%
when I treat
somebody-- why would I

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.710 align:middle line:84%
expect for them to leave
certain aspects out

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.750 align:middle line:90%
of the consultation?

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.440 align:middle line:84%
>> What you have here, in
essence, is kind of an altar.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.190 align:middle line:84%
Can I touch something
on the altar?

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:90%
>> This--

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> These are my feathers.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> These are used for what?

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I do what's called
limpia, spiritual cleansings.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.640 align:middle line:10%
And we are energy.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.800 align:middle line:10%
We are always emitting energy.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.700 align:middle line:84%
By what we eat, we
have a certain meal,

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.360 align:middle line:84%
in two hours, we will have
created a certain energy

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.240 align:middle line:90%
around us, good or bad.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Hopefully good.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:33.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Hopefully good if
we had a good meal.

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:90%
>> A healthy meal.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:84%
If we have a lot of thoughts
and they're very positive,

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.190 align:middle line:84%
then we will have created
an aura around us.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.990 align:middle line:84%
But if we have a
lot of sad thoughts,

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.160 align:middle line:84%
if we have a lot of
what we call thoughts

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.760 align:middle line:84%
that are not good
for us, then we're

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:90%
also creating a certain energy.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:90%
>> So these are used.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So the feathers are used.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.150 align:middle line:84%
Eggs are used to
rub over your body

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.330 align:middle line:84%
to pick up energy that
doesn't belong to you.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.860 align:middle line:90%
Herbs like romero, rosemary.

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Depending on the area where
you live, you might use those.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:84%
You might use a whole
bunch of flowers.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.200 align:middle line:84%
So these flowers would
create a beautiful limpia.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.990 align:middle line:84%
I could get several
of these flowers

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:middle line:84%
and work with your energy,
cleanse the energy.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Cleansing, what I
mean is, take energy

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.900 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't belong to you,
energy that you've picked up.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:41.870 align:middle line:84%
And then I might end
up with the feathers,

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:46.420 align:middle line:84%
which also create a certain
kind of energy to cleanse.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.360 align:middle line:84%
This energy is different
from this energy,

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.450 align:middle line:90%
but they're natural.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.250 align:middle line:90%
They're natural.

00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:55.250 align:middle line:84%
They come from nature,
and they help cleanse you

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.530 align:middle line:90%
because you are nature also.

00:08:57.530 --> 00:09:01.190 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things in your
book that I found particularly

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:84%
intriguing, and maybe I
find it so because I think

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:84%
that's what's happening
in the world today.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:84%
It's something in your
book called susto.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:90%
Tell me about that.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I devoted a whole chapter to
susto because as so many of us

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.770 align:middle line:90%
suffer.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:90%
It's a universal disease.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Susto comes from,
as I said before,

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.470 align:middle line:84%
your [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that essence
gets injured by abuse,

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:37.520 align:middle line:84%
by witnessing traumas, by people
not seeing who we really are,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:90%
especially children.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.900 align:middle line:84%
Children that are growing
up with parents that

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.730 align:middle line:90%
don't see who they really are.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.840 align:middle line:84%
They want to make them
into something else.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:84%
>> So would I be
right in saying--

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.610 align:middle line:84%
because this is what
I thought it was--

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.620 align:middle line:90%
it's injury to the soul?

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:57.650 align:middle line:10%
>> It's injury to the soul, and
that injury can be incredibly

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.060 align:middle line:10%
deep.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.070 align:middle line:90%
Incredibly deep.

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:04.100 align:middle line:90%
Or it could be a slight injury.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:06.380 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is,
then, we go along

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.820 align:middle line:84%
with the soul being
injured, handicapped.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.950 align:middle line:90%
It's not whole.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:18.650 align:middle line:84%
The energy is leaking out, let's
say, for lack of a better word.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.650 align:middle line:10%
It's going other places

>> I suppose this sounds like
such a simplified question.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.170 align:middle line:10%
But how do you
fix a broken soul?

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:10%
How do you do that?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And I must say, in your book,
there are testimonials to it.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.890 align:middle line:10%
>> It's one of the most
beautiful things that I

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:47.800 align:middle line:10%
experienced because I can't
really say that I'm the one

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:10%
that brings the soul back.

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:55.060 align:middle line:84%
I help that person bring
their soul back themselves.

little embers of that soul,

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.650 align:middle line:90%
that lost soul.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:05.960 align:middle line:84%
When we say that
the soul is lost

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:84%
or it has gone from our
bodies, we're using a metaphor.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.790 align:middle line:84%
It's these aspects
of ourselves that

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:19.610 align:middle line:84%
stay very buried deep inside
of us for whatever reason.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.470 align:middle line:84%
We grew up believing that
it's not OK to be that.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:29.733 align:middle line:84%
It's not OK to be
passionate, or to be poetic.

>> Or to be different.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:32.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Or to be different.

Or to be tall, or whatever
our parents, or society,

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.340 align:middle line:84%

Because one of the things
that comes to my mind

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.880 align:middle line:84%
when there is soul injury in
Western medicine is people

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.770 align:middle line:90%

And sometimes, they're
in therapy for years.

You were a psychiatric nurse.

>> Yes.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.000 align:middle line:10%
There's no chemical that can
be given to that person that

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.520 align:middle line:10%
would bring their soul back.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:15.910 align:middle line:10%
There's just no
chemical that will work.

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.070 align:middle line:84%
What that person

in the divine, to
bring in a ritual

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.310 align:middle line:84%
or a ceremony that's specific
for that particular soul.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.740 align:middle line:90%
Each soul is different.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%

because, very often,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.110 align:middle line:84%
ceremony and ritual
works as a great healer.

The shooting in Littleton,
Colorado, of course,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:48.460 align:middle line:84%
is such a good
example of soul injury

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.260 align:middle line:90%

Is that part of regaining?

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.290 align:middle line:90%
We can't intellectualize it.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.070 align:middle line:90%
We can't at the soul.

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:84%
The soul doesn't listen
to intellectuallization.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.320 align:middle line:90%
It just doesn't listen to that.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.280 align:middle line:90%
The soul listens to poetry.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.670 align:middle line:84%
The soul listens to
dreams or to a song.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.020 align:middle line:90%
>> To music, yes, it would.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Or to a certain smell.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.050 align:middle line:84%
So you take the
soul to that place.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:29.330 align:middle line:84%
If, preferably, you take that
soul to that place of injury,

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.990 align:middle line:90%
if you can, you go there.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:36.480 align:middle line:84%
For instance, let's say that
you were in a horrible accident,

You have soul loss.

If it's possible,
you take that person

to where that car
accident happened,

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.360 align:middle line:84%

>> Right on the road
see where they died.

00:13:58.378 --> 00:13:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Yes, well, you see
what they're doing

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.530 align:middle line:84%
is they're doing
a soul retrieval.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.470 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Maybe their own soul
retrieval so that they

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.940 align:middle line:90%
can find some sort of comfort.

Why when there's an injury
like Oklahoma bombings

or what happened
here in Colorado

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.990 align:middle line:84%
with all these
teenagers dying, why

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.960 align:middle line:84%
do they go and put flowers
and teddy bears at that site?

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.040 align:middle line:90%
>> On their cars.

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.290 align:middle line:90%
>> And on their cars, why?

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.400 align:middle line:84%
Because they're
doing it intuitively.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:84%
They're doing they're doing
something that is of nature.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.040 align:middle line:90%
We are nature.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.440 align:middle line:90%
We go to the place of injury.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.310 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so true.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.235 align:middle line:84%
>> That's so true because
when we watch television,

This is the beauty

It's not just the medicine,
the intellectual medicine,

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.870 align:middle line:90%

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:90%
their families surround them.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:45.160 align:middle line:84%
They died with
susto in their eyes.

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things that we're
doing is trying to heal that.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:55.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking of which, one of
the things that a curandera does

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.420 align:middle line:84%
that I find almost a little
different from Western doctors

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:02.080 align:middle line:90%
is something called platicas.

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Platicas, yes.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Platicas.

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:08.440 align:middle line:84%
That is when you get to
know the person, is that it?

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:10.510 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a heart to heart talk.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.690 align:middle line:10%
You know, I have a master's
in psychiatric nursing.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:10%
So I actually had to
unlearn a lot of my training

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.390 align:middle line:10%
in Western medicine
to learn platicas.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.460 align:middle line:84%
First of all, one of
the concepts of platica

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:26.880 align:middle line:84%
is that the curandera needs to
allow the patient to desogar.

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Desogar is a word
that means to undrown.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh.

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.230 align:middle line:90%
>> To let everything out.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:37.660 align:middle line:10%
I cannot sit across from
my patient and be ruled

00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:40.400 align:middle line:10%
by my intellect, my mind.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.480 align:middle line:10%
My heart needs to
connect to your heart.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.240 align:middle line:90%
That's a platica.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.480 align:middle line:90%
My heart and your heart.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.790 align:middle line:84%
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Heart heals heart.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.720 align:middle line:84%
>> So when a patient
comes to you, Elena,

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.720 align:middle line:84%
it's not like a 15
minute, how tall are you?

00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.770 align:middle line:90%
How much do you weigh?

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Let me check your throat.

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.670 align:middle line:84%
>> You must spend a
great deal of platicas.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:07.839 align:middle line:90%
>> A great deal.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Time.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> A great deal.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.099 align:middle line:84%
I do a combination
of platicas, and soul

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:90%
retrievals, and limpias.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:16.420 align:middle line:84%
A platica is a
wonderful opportunity

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:90%
to hear that person's story.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
People are dying to
tell their story.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:22.900 align:middle line:84%
There's no place
that they can go.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:84%
Many times, a psychotherapist
might have a certain form

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:30.830 align:middle line:90%
that they use from their school.

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.890 align:middle line:84%
With the platica,
the curandera has

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:38.080 align:middle line:84%
to be totally open and creative,
and just come from their heart,

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:40.210 align:middle line:90%
and be open to the divine.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:46.150 align:middle line:84%
Let the divine energy
guide that platica.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.900 align:middle line:84%
>> To be a curandera, how many
years do you have to study?

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Forever.

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:52.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Forever.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It takes forever.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm always having to go back
to Mexico-- that's my source--

00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.110 align:middle line:90%
and continue to study.

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.510 align:middle line:90%
I still have teachers.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:05.950 align:middle line:84%
It's a medicine that is so
broad and expansive that I'll

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:07.960 align:middle line:84%
be an [SPEAKING SPANISH],,
and I'll still

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:84%
be learning things
about curanderismo.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a college
of curanderismo?

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>> There's no college
of curanderos.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.230 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, where
do you go to learn?

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:22.075 align:middle line:90%
It must be another curandera.

00:18:22.075 --> 00:18:23.200 align:middle line:90%
>> It is another curandera.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.740 align:middle line:84%
It used to be passed from mother
to daughter and from father

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:31.132 align:middle line:90%
to son, but that stopped.

00:18:31.132 --> 00:18:34.050 align:middle line:84%
For me, I went to Mexico, and
I continue to go to Mexico.

00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.810 align:middle line:90%
And I continue to learn.

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.580 align:middle line:84%
Curanderismo is
very compassionate.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:43.050 align:middle line:84%
It is spiritual and
compassionate medicine.

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.020 align:middle line:84%
My teacher taught me a
very important lesson.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.860 align:middle line:84%
I became very attached, like
we all do, to our tools,

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.680 align:middle line:84%
to my feathers, and
to the herbs that I

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.310 align:middle line:84%
use for my cleansings
and my ceremonies.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And one time, he
told me, I'm going

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.390 align:middle line:90%
to take away your feathers.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.070 align:middle line:84%
You no longer have
your feathers.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, how are you going
to help a person?

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well, I
still have the egg that I

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.600 align:middle line:90%
use to rub over their body.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.490 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll take away the egg.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do you have?

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:19.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, I have my romero,
my rosemary, the herbs.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:21.390 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll take that away too.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.170 align:middle line:90%
What do you have?

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:24.768 align:middle line:90%
Well, I have my hands.

00:19:24.768 --> 00:19:26.310 align:middle line:84%
I'll give them a
[SPEAKING SPANISH]..

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:27.587 align:middle line:90%
I'll give them a massage.

00:19:27.587 --> 00:19:28.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll take away your hands.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.950 align:middle line:90%
What do you have?

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:35.420 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that what
I have, my most important tool,

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.010 align:middle line:90%
is my heart.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:37.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.810 align:middle line:84%
>> [SPEAKING SPANISH]
Heart heals heart.

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:44.060 align:middle line:84%
That's been the
most profound lesson

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.492 align:middle line:84%
that I have learned as
I practice curanderismo.

00:19:47.492 --> 00:19:50.650 align:middle line:84%
>> The heart energy has so
much power to it, doesn't I?

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.184 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:52.184 --> 00:19:54.420 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:58.230 align:middle line:84%
>> You were rolling along in
your life as a psychiatric

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.412 align:middle line:90%
nurse making--

00:19:59.412 --> 00:20:00.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I was cruising.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Good money.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.835 align:middle line:90%
>> I was making good money.

00:20:02.835 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Doing fine.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.370 align:middle line:90%
You were jiving.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.470 align:middle line:90%
Everything was cool.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:11.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What stopped you and said,
no, no, no, no, no, no no.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Elena, you're supposed
to be a curandera.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.718 align:middle line:90%
How did you change?

00:20:15.718 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:90%
A lot of women wouldn't change.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
A lot of women would
stay right on that track

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.230 align:middle line:90%
because it's good money.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:21.030 align:middle line:90%
It's nice.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's scary.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:84%
It's scary to leave health
insurance, and a pension,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.572 align:middle line:84%
and life insurance, and
all of those security.

00:20:28.572 --> 00:20:30.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I bet you there's no
pension for curanderas.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.665 align:middle line:90%
>> No, there's no pension.

00:20:31.665 --> 00:20:32.790 align:middle line:90%
>> There's no pension plan.

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.340 align:middle line:84%
>> No, and you don't make
a lot of money either.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.220 align:middle line:84%
It's not about making
a lot of money either.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.950 align:middle line:84%
I had to or else my own
soul was going to die.

00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:42.600 align:middle line:90%
I was born to be a healer.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Ever since I was a little girl,
that's what I was drawn to.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately,
in Western medicine,

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.830 align:middle line:84%
I didn't see enough
people get well.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.000 align:middle line:90%
And my own soul was dying.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.140 align:middle line:84%
And all alongside all of
my top positions at UCLA

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:84%
and director of nursing, I
was studying curanderismo.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:05.880 align:middle line:84%
So all along, I was
working both medicines.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I realized that if
I didn't leave Western medicine

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.730 align:middle line:84%
and practice this intuitive,
creative medicine,

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.470 align:middle line:84%
then my own soul
would have died.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you see a leaning of
Western medicine into more

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:29.690 align:middle line:84%
homeopathic, more herbal,
more energizing healing?

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:32.390 align:middle line:84%
Do you see people starting
to mix that a little bit?

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:33.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:34.580 align:middle line:90%
I see that.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:84%
I have been lecturing on
curanderismo for many years,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.690 align:middle line:84%
so I've become very
much aware of what's

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:41.720 align:middle line:84%
out there in the
health profession

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
because I lecture to doctors
and nurses, people that want

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.230 align:middle line:90%
to learn about curanderismo.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, that's
interesting to me.

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:51.472 align:middle line:84%
Do you know 10 years
ago, five years ago, you

00:21:51.472 --> 00:21:53.180 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't have looked
out to your audience

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and seen doctors and nurses?

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I know.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:56.870 align:middle line:90%
>> But now you do.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Because doctors and nurses
are also getting dissatisfied

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.850 align:middle line:84%
with the kind of
care they're giving.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.090 align:middle line:90%
There are too many rules.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.070 align:middle line:84%
The institution
that they work for

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.980 align:middle line:84%
has too many rules
and boundaries.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.700 align:middle line:90%
There's not enough compassion.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:84%
There's not enough time for them
to express their own creativity

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.330 align:middle line:84%
and intuition, so they're
getting tired of it too.

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:19.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an interesting direction
that the world is going in.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:20.650 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:26.150 align:middle line:10%
So yes, and also people
have seeing the trend.

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.510 align:middle line:10%
More and more regular
folk are becoming

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:middle line:10%
dissatisfied with
the kind of care

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:10%
that Western medicine
is giving them,

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:35.570 align:middle line:10%
so they're going to
alternative medicine.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:37.880 align:middle line:84%
They're going to the
health food joint

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.600 align:middle line:84%
and buying their
own herbs for sleep

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.670 align:middle line:90%
or for digestion or whatever.

They're becoming their
own doctors as we should.

00:22:46.370 --> 00:22:49.100 align:middle line:84%
As I said before,
we are medicine.

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:84%
You know, so it's not so
much that we should give away

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:84%
our power to doctors, or
curanderos, or any other health

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.950 align:middle line:90%
practitioner.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.630 align:middle line:84%
You know, we need to go inside

what kind of medicine do I need?

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you have given our
audience and me a lot of what

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:09.780 align:middle line:90%
we need today.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I thank you so much for
your wonderful conversation

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:13.650 align:middle line:90%

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:14.450 align:middle line:90%
>> My pleasure.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:15.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I've really enjoyed you.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:90%

Thank you.
