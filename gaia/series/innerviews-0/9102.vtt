00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.460 align:middle line:84%
One of the best parts
of the wisdom workshops

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.700 align:middle line:84%
are the up close and
personal conversations

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.800 align:middle line:84%
with the leading
practitioners and authors

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.420 align:middle line:90%
in the holistic field.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:84%
This gives all of
us an opportunity

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.920 align:middle line:84%
to know these people
just a little bit better.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.456 align:middle line:84%
So join me as they share
their wisdom with us.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It's funny because
everything that you mentioned

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:90%
is sort of my background.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.870 align:middle line:84%
I was in a monastery at one
time, studying to be a priest--

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.080 align:middle line:84%
Franciscan-- when
I was like 18, 19.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.890 align:middle line:84%
That was really--
when I was growing up,

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.080 align:middle line:84%
my whole frame of reference was
that Catholic, institutional

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.280 align:middle line:90%
type path.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.420 align:middle line:84%
>> But of course, there's
that folkie in me and--

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how much country,
but maybe a little bit.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.720 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, a little
bit in the chords.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.975 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of what
Willie Nelson and Waylon

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:28.830 align:middle line:90%
Jennings used to do.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.802 align:middle line:84%
Just a little bit of that
soulful kind of music.

00:03:31.802 --> 00:03:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, well, soulful.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.218 align:middle line:84%
That's a good way
of looking at it.

00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:35.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.140 align:middle line:84%
>> I think soulful is important,
and whether it's quiet

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.140 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's loud,
it's got to have soul,

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.473 align:middle line:84%
especially when you're
doing this kind of music.

00:03:42.473 --> 00:03:44.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And especially when
you're doing the kind of work

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.070 align:middle line:84%
you're doing, because I can't
remember a time when the world

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.070 align:middle line:90%
has seemed more troubled to me.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:84%
Even during war times,
the war was there.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:84%
But it feels to me
now as if there's

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:90%
trouble all over the world.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hm.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And your work is traveling
to those places and taking

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.080 align:middle line:90%
your music there.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.830 align:middle line:84%
What do you do with your music
in these troubled places?

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well first of all, the
interesting thing is I think

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.690 align:middle line:84%
what you're saying is true,
and yet at the same time,

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.690 align:middle line:90%
we can also say the opposite.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.250 align:middle line:10%
In many other ways,
things have never

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:10%
been better than
they are right now.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.170 align:middle line:10%
There are more people turning--

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.420 align:middle line:10%
opening up themselves,
turning toward each other,

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.790 align:middle line:10%
serving, giving
than ever before.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.870 align:middle line:84%
And I think that it's
interesting that both are true.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.510 align:middle line:84%
It's almost like a
rubber band that's

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
being pulled in two
different directions.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And the tension of a rubber
band is greatest right before

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.275 align:middle line:90%
it snaps.

00:04:43.275 --> 00:04:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So you've got-- things are worse
than they've ever been before.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.900 align:middle line:84%
Things are better than
they've ever been before.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And it's stretching the
entire thought system.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you're so right because
where there is more pain,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.590 align:middle line:84%
out of that pain
comes awareness.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, exactly.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.660 align:middle line:84%
We hear so much about
things like the Y2K problem

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of fear
about what that means.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And you can look at that
in a very fearful way

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.680 align:middle line:84%
or you can look at it as one of
these incredible opportunities

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.780 align:middle line:84%
that we have to come together
in extraordinary new ways.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that my traveling
around to different places

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:84%
in the world like Bosnia
or Baghdad or Belfast--

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.970 align:middle line:90%
all the B places, it seems--

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:84%
it's sort of been that for me,
just having the opportunity

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.610 align:middle line:84%
to go into places where
violence seems to have won,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.340 align:middle line:84%
and then to demonstrate
that it hasn't

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.390 align:middle line:90%
through music, through prayer--

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.110 align:middle line:90%
a simple-- just singing.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.000 align:middle line:90%
>> How I am curious--

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.850 align:middle line:84%
how did all of
this begin for you?

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.750 align:middle line:84%
Because that's
exactly what you do.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:84%
You travel to a place of
violence, and your message,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.330 align:middle line:90%
through your music--

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.090 align:middle line:84%
through your words--
is not so bad.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:90%
There's hope.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:90%
How did this begin for you?

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:01.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in 1994, a friend
of mine gave to me a sheet

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
of paper that had the 12 peace
prayers from the 12 major

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.400 align:middle line:90%
religions on it.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.960 align:middle line:84%
And as I began to read each one
of them, a miracle happened.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.570 align:middle line:84%
It was as if I could
hear the music--

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.903 align:middle line:84%
as if it was being played in
the next room or something.

00:06:13.903 --> 00:06:16.390 align:middle line:84%
And I picked up my guitar
and just began to play along.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.490 align:middle line:84%
And not one of the songs took
more than five or 10 minutes,

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and before I knew it,
all 12 peace prayers

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.690 align:middle line:90%
had been arranged to music.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.170 align:middle line:84%
And I was soon coined
the peace troubadour

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:84%
and began traveling around to
different places in the world,

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.960 align:middle line:84%
performing these prayers
as a way of showing

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that spirituality is
always about peace.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.270 align:middle line:84%
And it was in the summer
of 1995 that I received

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.240 align:middle line:84%
my first invitation to
come to a country at war,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.280 align:middle line:84%
and that was in
Bosnia and Croatia.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.620 align:middle line:84%
The war was at its
height at that time,

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:84%
and I traveled there thinking
that maybe through music

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.220 align:middle line:84%
and through prayer, people
could hear the message that they

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.580 align:middle line:84%
weren't hearing in other ways,
and that there was another way.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.290 align:middle line:84%
The great thing about
music is that it

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
slides past those
barriers or those filters

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.500 align:middle line:90%
that we use to judge everything.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.310 align:middle line:10%
We hear music
differently, and it just

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.640 align:middle line:10%
goes right to our heart.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.480 align:middle line:10%
And so being able to
go and just to pray

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:17.460 align:middle line:10%
and to sing these prayers, I
wondered what kind of impact

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.780 align:middle line:10%
it would have.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And I discovered
very quickly that it

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.340 align:middle line:84%
had a very powerful impact,
not only on the people

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.910 align:middle line:90%
in these countries, but on me.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.970 align:middle line:84%
And of course, that's
really the main thing,

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:31.150 align:middle line:84%
is that I have to-- we all
have to allow ourselves

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.890 align:middle line:90%
to become instruments of peace.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.540 align:middle line:84%
And like the guitar,
it can't play itself.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.340 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.040 align:middle line:84%
>> It's only when it surrenders
and when it allows itself to be

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.870 align:middle line:84%
played that it
really is effective.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And you paint such a
fascinating picture because we

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:50.320 align:middle line:84%
so often think of government
officials or military men

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.130 align:middle line:84%
and women, for that matter,
who lead these countries

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.550 align:middle line:90%
as impenetrable, if you will.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:02.000 align:middle line:84%
But your music must penetrate
the hardest of them.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.990 align:middle line:84%
When I was in Iraq in February
of 1998, I experienced that--

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.180 align:middle line:90%
what you were just saying--

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:84%
this impenetrable
barrier falling down

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.760 align:middle line:90%
in the person of Saddam Hussein.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Someone that-- and it seems that
the whole world is convinced

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.940 align:middle line:84%
is this monster, and
certainly, his policies

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:90%
haven't proven otherwise.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And yet I think being
able to go there at a time

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.520 align:middle line:84%
when war seemed imminent
just to pray these prayers

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.620 align:middle line:84%
and to sing them at
the National Theater

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.610 align:middle line:84%
and to know that he was
watching that concert,

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.710 align:middle line:84%
and then to receive a phone call
from one of his secretaries--

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:42.460 align:middle line:84%
actually the Minister
of Information--

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.310 align:middle line:84%
who said that Saddam
Hussein himself wanted

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.680 align:middle line:84%
me to be called to let me
know that he had actually

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.218 align:middle line:84%
stopped to watch this
concert and to pray

00:08:50.218 --> 00:08:52.510 align:middle line:84%
with the rest of the world--
all the millions of people

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.150 align:middle line:84%
that were praying at that
time for peace in Iraq.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.937 align:middle line:84%
It showed me that ultimately,
we all want the same thing,

00:08:58.937 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:84%
regardless of who
we are, whether it's

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:90%
Saddam Hussein or whoever.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:84%
That message-- that
music-- those prayers

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:11.290 align:middle line:84%
can slide past the most
impenetrable suit of armor

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.950 align:middle line:90%
and touch the heart.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well it's been said that
a miracle is simply a shift

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.977 align:middle line:90%
in perception--

00:09:19.977 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:90%
in the way we look at something.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.090 align:middle line:84%
A miracle is just
one little shift.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And by your
telling me that story,

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:31.180 align:middle line:84%
you shifted the perception that
I have and hopefully others

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:35.770 align:middle line:84%
of Saddam Hussein in some
small way because he was moved

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.570 align:middle line:90%
by your music.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.550 align:middle line:84%
We would not think of
him as a man who could

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.900 align:middle line:90%
be moved by any kind of music.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.270 align:middle line:10%
Well, I think one of
the important things

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.570 align:middle line:10%
for us today is to be able to
look past all of our judgments

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.780 align:middle line:10%
and to realize that regardless
of what the outer picture is

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.850 align:middle line:10%
showing us, that behind
that mask is the same face,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:10%
whether it be Adolf Hitler or
you and I. That ultimately,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.230 align:middle line:10%
we're all coming from
the same essential place,

00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:05.230 align:middle line:10%
and as people who are
trying to live this,

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:10%
it's our responsibility to be
the ones to look past that mask

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:10%
and to see that face
of holiness or however

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.080 align:middle line:10%
you want to describe that.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.410 align:middle line:84%
And it's by focusing on
that, not on the mask,

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:19.670 align:middle line:84%
that we allow that
to step forward.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And I think that that's what
happened with Saddam Hussein is

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.910 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't looking at this
image of Saddam Hussein

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.330 align:middle line:90%
that I had in my mind.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.600 align:middle line:84%
I was just going there
to sing prayers of peace.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.630 align:middle line:84%
>> And what is fascinating
is no matter where you are,

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:37.420 align:middle line:84%
no matter how difficult
the situation, somehow,

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.230 align:middle line:90%
music is a universal language.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It astonishes me.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Wherever you are, if you start
to sing, people can understand.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.150 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:90%
It is a universal language.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And as we said
before, even if it's

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.020 align:middle line:84%
a language we don't understand,
it still touches us.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons for that
is because music is actually

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.570 align:middle line:90%
a carrier wave.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:08.950 align:middle line:84%
We can actually implant or
imprint spiritual vibration

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.210 align:middle line:90%
onto music.

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:84%
That's often what happens when
you hear someone chanting--

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.230 align:middle line:84%
say someone who has a very
deep spiritual connection

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:21.190 align:middle line:84%
themselves, and even if the
music is not particularly

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:25.240 align:middle line:84%
professional or
pleasing, something still

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.050 align:middle line:90%
connects with us.

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Something-- it's like that music
is carrying something that's

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:90%
deeper than the music itself.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
connects with us.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, we can
also hear someone

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.900 align:middle line:84%
who has a beautiful voice
or performs beautifully,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:40.427 align:middle line:84%
but it does not connect
with us in the same way.

00:11:40.427 --> 00:11:42.010 align:middle line:84%
That's because it
does not necessarily

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:84%
have that same vibration
imprinted onto it.

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:84%
So it's so important for
us to realize that music

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.600 align:middle line:90%
is a multidimensional tool.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:52.090 align:middle line:90%
It's wonderful.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:84%
I'd never thought of
that until you just

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:84%
said that-- that it is
a spiritual vibration.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you see a shift in
people in our country today?

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.370 align:middle line:84%
Because I've been
talking all day to people

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:10.060 align:middle line:90%
about the holes in our souls.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.792 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do see a shift.

00:12:12.792 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
The funny thing is I
think the reason why

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm seeing this shift is because
I'm feeling a shift in myself

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.340 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.632 align:middle line:90%
>> How very interesting, James.

00:12:18.632 --> 00:12:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>> You always see that which
is happening within yourself.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:25.190 align:middle line:84%
If I was not-- if
I was in pain--

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:28.300 align:middle line:84%
if I was in a dark
place, well then

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.060 align:middle line:84%
I would probably see
a lot of darkness

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of people
the same way.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.250 align:middle line:84%
But I've discovered that as
I've opened up my own heart

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.700 align:middle line:84%
and my own mind, suddenly
I'm finding myself

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.820 align:middle line:84%
in contact and touching
and being with people

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.440 align:middle line:90%
who are doing the same thing.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.212 align:middle line:84%
When I was in the
mountains of Bosnia in 1995

00:12:46.212 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:84%
with the emissaries
of light, which

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
is what the book, "Emissary
of Light," is based on,

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.500 align:middle line:84%
they had like this little
chant that they would say,

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.920 align:middle line:84%
and the words were,
seek not peace here,

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.080 align:middle line:90%
but find it everywhere.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Seek not peace here,
but find it everywhere.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:06.818 align:middle line:84%
In other words, don't even
look for peace out here

00:13:06.818 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
because it's the surest
way not to find it.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.068 align:middle line:84%
If you're looking for it in
the world or outside yourself--

00:13:11.068 --> 00:13:14.850 align:middle line:84%
but if you look for it where it
is, which is inside yourself,

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:16.950 align:middle line:84%
then that's where
the miracle occurs.

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.722 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly that same
peace, which we found--

00:13:18.722 --> 00:13:20.430 align:middle line:84%
which is the only
place it can be found--

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:20.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It begins to out-picture.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly we find
it even in the place

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.528 align:middle line:84%
where a moment before, we
couldn't see it at all.

00:13:27.528 --> 00:13:29.070 align:middle line:84%
You know, that's
what the miracle is.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.900 align:middle line:84%
You take someone
like Mother Theresa

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
living in Calcutta--
one of the poorest

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.750 align:middle line:84%
cities in the world with
all of the poverty and all

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.510 align:middle line:84%
the terrible situations
that they had there.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:42.840 align:middle line:84%
She would walk down the
street and in a pile of dung,

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:90%
she would see a flower growing.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And that would
bring her to heaven.

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Or you could have
someone in Hawaii--

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.577 align:middle line:90%
in a beautiful place--

00:13:50.577 --> 00:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
but if they're not
connected with that place

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.327 align:middle line:84%
within themselves that
is joy, that is beauty,

00:13:54.327 --> 00:13:56.285 align:middle line:84%
then they're not going
to even see that beauty.

00:13:56.285 --> 00:13:57.630 align:middle line:90%
They're going to be in hell.

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.490 align:middle line:90%
So that's the key.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:84%
Of course people are
shifting, but I'm not going

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:90%
to see that until I shift.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.574 align:middle line:90%
And that's the key to it.

00:14:06.574 --> 00:14:08.486 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:08.486 --> 00:14:13.760 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:90%
>> How different a man are you?

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.110 align:middle line:10%
How have you changed
on a personal level

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:10%
between the James who
existed before meeting

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.530 align:middle line:10%
the emissaries of light--

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Wow.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And the James after he
met the emissaries of light.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.587 align:middle line:90%
How have you shifted?

00:14:30.587 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.520 align:middle line:90%


00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:40.610 align:middle line:84%
I think things have become
so much simpler for me.

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:10%
I realized that this is not
so complicated, after all.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:47.330 align:middle line:10%
Waking up, enlightenment--
whatever you want to call it.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.840 align:middle line:10%
It's not this
complicated thing--

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.010 align:middle line:10%
going to workshops, reading
every book under the sun,

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.280 align:middle line:10%
like I thought, perhaps, it was.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.300 align:middle line:84%
I think I began to realize
that this is not something

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.840 align:middle line:90%
that we have to do.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.810 align:middle line:84%
It's something that
we have to undo.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And when we allow
that to happen,

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.770 align:middle line:90%
the process becomes very simple.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:11.400 align:middle line:84%
It's this constant stepping back
or surrender into the divine,

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.360 align:middle line:84%
and I think for me, that has
been the major shift is--

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Lovely.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Allowing that to happen.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And it's been a
wonderful process

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:25.080 align:middle line:84%
because my life has
become so much brighter.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think the
other major thing

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
that I learned from
the emissaries--

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.000 align:middle line:84%
and this is, I think,
really the culmination

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.880 align:middle line:84%
of all spiritual practice--
if you want something,

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.300 align:middle line:84%
then you have to
give that thing.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.670 align:middle line:84%
If I want peace, then
I have to give peace.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.630 align:middle line:84%
If I want only love, then
I must give only love.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.890 align:middle line:84%
And if we allow that to
be our simple guidepost,

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:84%
then every moment gives
us a new opportunity

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.930 align:middle line:90%
to express what we want--

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.040 align:middle line:90%
to give what we want.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Every person like you,
sitting here in front of me

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.120 align:middle line:90%
now--

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.290 align:middle line:84%
this is my opportunity to be in
heaven simply by seeing heaven

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.450 align:middle line:90%
in you.

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And when I do that, I suddenly
find myself just irresistibly

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.640 align:middle line:90%
pulled into a new reality.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh yes.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though this
may not change.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> You know?

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:13.580 align:middle line:90%
And yet sometimes, it does.

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.880 align:middle line:84%
>> But I suddenly find myself in
heaven, where a moment before,

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.490 align:middle line:84%
perhaps I was in hell just
because I decided that I wanted

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.380 align:middle line:90%
that and I gave it.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.330 align:middle line:84%
>> Who are the
emissaries of light?

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:25.430 align:middle line:90%
How did you come upon them?

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:28.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well I'm actually just
beginning to realize, myself,

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:29.570 align:middle line:90%
who they are.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.550 align:middle line:84%
For a very long
time, I didn't have

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:32.820 align:middle line:90%
an answer to that question.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.870 align:middle line:10%
I just-- it was a very
mysterious thing, even to me.

00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:38.660 align:middle line:10%
The short version of the story,
in terms of how I met them,

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:10%
was while I was in
Croatia and Bosnia

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.850 align:middle line:10%
in 1995, I began to
hear these rumors

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.013 align:middle line:10%
about this secret society
in the mountains somewhere,

00:16:47.013 --> 00:16:48.680 align:middle line:10%
but had no way of
knowing if it was true

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.720 align:middle line:10%
or not until I
finally met a man who

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.850 align:middle line:10%
claimed to be the
liaison between the world

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:53.852 align:middle line:10%
and this community.

00:16:53.852 --> 00:16:55.310 align:middle line:84%
And he said that
this community had

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:57.560 align:middle line:90%
existed for thousands of years.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Not the same people,
of course, but it

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:03.680 align:middle line:84%
was almost like a lineage
of spiritual masters

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.510 align:middle line:84%
that would always
be in total secrecy,

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.504 align:middle line:84%
doing a very important and
very subtle type of prayer--

00:17:09.504 --> 00:17:13.819 align:middle line:84%
a meditation that they
felt would help all of us

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:16.490 align:middle line:84%
to continue this evolution
into this world based

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.250 align:middle line:84%
upon the laws of love,
like we said before.

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:22.280 align:middle line:84%
And this person that I
met said that their role

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.140 align:middle line:90%
was about to come to an end--

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.099 align:middle line:84%
that the community was
about to disband because--

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:32.120 align:middle line:84%
almost as if us,
as an adolescent,

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.750 align:middle line:84%
had become an adult. And
when one becomes an adult,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.745 align:middle line:90%
the guardian steps back.

00:17:37.745 --> 00:17:40.370 align:middle line:84%
And that is essentially what was
happening with the emissaries.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:44.250 align:middle line:84%
We're ready now to be
giving this same light--

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:47.180 align:middle line:84%
the same gift that they had been
giving to us-- to each other.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have a sense
of why you were picked?

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I do.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:52.050 align:middle line:84%
It took a while
for me to get it.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.035 align:middle line:90%
At first, when I was there--

00:17:54.035 --> 00:17:56.400 align:middle line:84%
or when I got back, really,
it was like, why me?

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Who am I?

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.515 align:middle line:84%
And then after
about three months

00:17:59.515 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
of wandering around, asking
that question, it hit me.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:05.793 align:middle line:84%
And I think that the reason why
it was me is very important.

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:08.210 align:middle line:84%
The reason why I was the one
brought up into the mountains

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:11.810 align:middle line:84%
to be with these emissaries--
to be given this incredible

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:12.980 align:middle line:90%
message--

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:19.460 align:middle line:84%
is simply because I am no
different than anybody else.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Now that may sound like a
very silly, simple reason,

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:84%
but the fact is
it's very profound.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:27.580 align:middle line:84%
Someone that was this
master wasn't drawn up.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.690 align:middle line:84%
Someone who-- a world
leader-- it wasn't someone

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
like that because so
often, we pick teachers

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.153 align:middle line:84%
of people who are
different from us,

00:18:34.153 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:84%
like someone from a different
country, different language,

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:37.790 align:middle line:90%
different religion.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.890 align:middle line:84%
It makes it easy for us to
say, well, it's easy for you,

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.240 align:middle line:90%
but look how different I am.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.040 align:middle line:90%
Well guess what?

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm not different
than other people.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm very ordinary.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
I was the one that

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.200 align:middle line:84%
was brought up
there, I believe, was

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle line:90%
because this is for all of us.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:55.040 align:middle line:84%
It has nothing to do with
being extraordinary anymore.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.560 align:middle line:84%
This has to do with each one
of us realizing that even

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.195 align:middle line:84%
in my ordinariness,
I'm extraordinary.

00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:00.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And do you find now that
you have this that projects

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.430 align:middle line:90%
are put in front of you?

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
And do you know what
you have to do next?

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.320 align:middle line:84%
What's the next
project that's been

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.770 align:middle line:84%
placed in front of James that
says, here's where you go next?

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.780 align:middle line:84%
You just show up
and say, present.

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, that seems to
be the way it happens.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.890 align:middle line:90%
I certainly can't--

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.930 align:middle line:90%
I can't come up with it myself.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:22.670 align:middle line:10%
The thing that seems
to be happening now

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:26.150 align:middle line:10%
as we approach the dawn
of a new millennium

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.700 align:middle line:10%
is we're starting a
project called the Cloth

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.500 align:middle line:10%
of Many Colors
Peace Project, where

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.170 align:middle line:10%
we're going to be asking
5 million people, which

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:39.050 align:middle line:10%
is about 1/10 of 1% of the whole
population of the planet Earth,

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.290 align:middle line:10%
to cut off a piece of cloth
off a piece of clothing,

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.230 align:middle line:10%
hold that piece of
cloth, and feel--

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:46.490 align:middle line:10%
like charge it with peace.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.802 align:middle line:90%
And all those cloths--

00:19:47.802 --> 00:19:49.760 align:middle line:84%
pieces of cloth-- are
going to be sewn together

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.110 align:middle line:84%
into an enormous banner,
that on January 1 of 2000

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:84%
is going to be wrapped around
the base of the United Nations

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.500 align:middle line:90%
building in New York.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And then what we're going
to do with that cloth

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:03.140 align:middle line:84%
is it'll be cut up into
hundreds of prayer shawls,

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to be
dedicating my year

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.070 align:middle line:84%
2000 to traveling
around the world,

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.290 align:middle line:84%
presenting these prayer shawls
to the leaders of the world--

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:11.960 align:middle line:84%
a symbol-- more than
a symbol, really.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.190 align:middle line:84%
A tangible, energetic form
representing the prayers

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.430 align:middle line:84%
of 1/10 of 1% of the
whole population.

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:23.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And does the United
Nations embrace this idea?

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, the United Nations--

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm being helped with this
by a nongovernmental agency

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:30.790 align:middle line:90%
at the United Nations.

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:33.285 align:middle line:84%
And so far, it seems
to be going quite well.

00:20:33.285 --> 00:20:34.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Because sometimes
they're resistant.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:35.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, they're
resistant to the idea,

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:38.680 align:middle line:84%
and then at the last
minute, they say, yeah.

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:38.940 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:39.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Wrapping around the base
may be a tricky thing,

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.590 align:middle line:84%
but at the very
least, we can wrap it

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.430 align:middle line:84%
around the sidewalk
of the base of the UN.

00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:47.900 align:middle line:90%
We'll find a way to do it.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Somehow, James, knowing
you in this particular

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.060 align:middle line:84%
conversation, as I
say goodbye to you,

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:57.560 align:middle line:84%
I have a sense that it will
be wrapped completely around

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.210 align:middle line:90%
the United Nations building.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.060 align:middle line:84%
Would you play us out, as
they say on television?

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.770 align:middle line:90%
Pick your favorite prayer.

00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:04.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.900 align:middle line:84%
To me, this is the
prayer that says it all.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the prayer
that began my journey.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.570 align:middle line:84%
It's the prayer
of Saint Francis.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:12.986 align:middle line:90%
[GUITAR PLAYING]

00:21:12.986 --> 00:21:23.274 align:middle line:84%

Oh, divine master, grant
that I may not seek

00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:03.452 align:middle line:10%
to be consoled, as to console.
