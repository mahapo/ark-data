He gives heartfelt expression to his belief in our need to return to the original spirit of those teachings. \r\n\r\nNext is Barbara DeAngelis, author of How to Make Love All of the Time, who discusses spirituality, compassion, and relationships today. Barbara talks about “living from the inside out” – coming to the realization that it’s not what’s on the outside (the house, the car) that makes us happy, but what’s inside. She describes how relationships have changed; how women no longer need to seek only stability, but can instead choose growth – and how that can put tremendous pressure on relationships, and how change is natural.","teaser":"In this two-part interview, first Nick Bunick describes how he writes his books and the need to reconnect to the spirit of Jesus’ teaching, then Barbara DeAngelis offers gems of wisdom on spirituality and relationships.","keyart16x9WithText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/31393885-338a-4a1c-b4b1-8b5bad6f75ce/2384_innerviews_nick-bunick-and-barbara-deangelis_16x9.jpg"},"keyart16x9NoText":{"small":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/05acdcbd-68e5-4e96-9912-b1eef57fef8c/2384_innerviews_nick-bunick-and-barbara-deangelis_clean_16x9.jpg","medium":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/05acdcbd-68e5-4e96-9912-b1eef57fef8c/2384_innerviews_nick-bunick-and-barbara-deangelis_clean_16x9.jpg","large":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/05acdcbd-68e5-4e96-9912-b1eef57fef8c/2384_innerviews_nick-bunick-and-barbara-deangelis_clean_16x9.jpg"}},{"seriesId":3362,"seriesTitle":"INNERVIEWS","seriesPath":"series/innerviews-0","seriesVoteDownCount":6,"seriesVoteUpCount":31,"coverartImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/0400ad8d-a18c-42f1-9b21-1e3bebf175a6/LynnAndrews.jpg","created":"2010-09-22","episode":3,"classicFacets":{},"fitnessLevel":[],"fitnessStyle":[],"heroImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/32f7525d-9b2a-4776-bab3-aad83af1bcf9/2855_innerviews_an-interview-w-lynn-andrews_16x9.jpg","heroImageNotext":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/2374ec56-2862-49f6-b578-f363fd7be9d6/2855_innerviews_an-interview-w-lynn-andrews_clean_16x9.jpg","host":null,"meditationStyle":null,"path":"video/interview-lynn-andrews","previewImage":"https://brooklyn.gaia.com/v1/image-render/0400ad8d-a18c-42f1-9b21-1e3bebf175a6/LynnAndrews.jpg","published":true,"season":1,"title":"An Interview with Lynn Andrews","type":{"content":"video","display":"normal","product":"episode"},"voteDownCount":2,"voteUpCount":15,"yogaLevel":[],"yogaStyle":[],"episodeCount":18,"seasonCount":1,"preview":{"duration":88,"mediaId":9147,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"free","subscriptions":[]},"id":9147,"isFree":true},"feature":{"duration":1431,"mediaId":9104,"georestrictions":{"availability":"worldwide","countries":[]},"offerings":{"availability":"onlyWith","subscriptions":[253,280,290]},"id":9104,"isFree":false},"id":2855,"isNew":false,"featuredType":null,"body":"Chantal Westerman interviews Lynn Andrews, author of Medicine Woman, a beloved inspirational teacher and mystic.
