00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.110 align:middle line:90%
I'm nuts.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.690 align:middle line:84%
I just say, well, you know,
if that's the way you see it,

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.080 align:middle line:90%
you see it.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.372 align:middle line:90%
I see it differently, you know?

00:03:27.372 --> 00:03:30.720 align:middle line:84%
So I never allow
that to bother me.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And I learned, you know, over
the last maybe 15, 20 years,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.450 align:middle line:84%
you just don't allow
other people to upset you

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.030 align:middle line:84%
or to get to you or
to make you angry,

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.850 align:middle line:84%
although I had trouble
developing that over the years.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.580 align:middle line:84%
And now, today, what I feel we
should do with our young people

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.620 align:middle line:84%
is to train them to not allow
other people to get to them,

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.590 align:middle line:84%
make them angry, or
upset them in any way,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.370 align:middle line:90%
and become detached.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.270 align:middle line:84%
You know, all of these things
that I've done in my life--

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.380 align:middle line:84%
not in my life, but in
the last few years anyway,

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.720 align:middle line:84%
I have kind of detached
myself from it.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.620 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> From it, stress?

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.620 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
You see, if you have to
have something, it owns you.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.870 align:middle line:90%
You don't own it.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:26.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.530 align:middle line:90%
>> It owns you.

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.430 align:middle line:84%
And you are controlled
by it, whatever it is.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you can just
detach yourself

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.830 align:middle line:84%
from your automobile or your
home or your business or a deal

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:90%
that you're about to make--

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:84%
you say, well, if
it works out, great.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.260 align:middle line:90%
If it doesn't, we're OK.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:84%
>> I like the idea,
and I want to do it,

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and I think a lot of people
watching this broadcast want

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.180 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:90%
But you've done it.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.350 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk
about how to do it.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.420 align:middle line:84%
It's very easy to
say, well, just

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.130 align:middle line:90%
detach yourself from stress.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
your techniques.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.230 align:middle line:84%
Because clearly, on you
and for you, it works.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.230 align:middle line:90%
>> So what did you do?

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.580 align:middle line:84%
>> You really have to be
careful what you think about,

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.660 align:middle line:84%
because see, what you
think about, you become.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.160 align:middle line:90%
You really become.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
profound idea, statement,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.110 align:middle line:84%
is that Earl Nightingale
said the strangest

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.800 align:middle line:84%
secret is that you become
what you think about all day.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.560 align:middle line:84%
And in the Bible, it says, "As
a man thinketh in his heart,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:90%
so is he."

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.087 align:middle line:84%
And I've studied the power
of your subconscious mind.

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:39.420 align:middle line:90%
And you've got a conscious mind.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.710 align:middle line:90%
You've got a subconscious.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.830 align:middle line:84%
And what you consciously
think about every day

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.670 align:middle line:84%
eventually sinks into
your subconscious,

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
and then you become that,
whatever it is, good or bad.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Illness, for example.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.560 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.120 align:middle line:90%
You can create your illness.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.830 align:middle line:90%
You can create your health.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.050 align:middle line:84%
You can create wealth
by the way you think.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.132 align:middle line:84%
You do not become wealthy
by thinking poverty thoughts

00:06:08.132 --> 00:06:09.340 align:middle line:90%
or thinking about being poor.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm just going
to be poor all my life.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.430 align:middle line:84%
If you think those
kind of thoughts,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.560 align:middle line:90%
then you will be that.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.280 align:middle line:90%
So we know how the mind works.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.080 align:middle line:84%
Now, and since you have a
conscious and subconscious

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:84%
and what you consciously
focus on, you become--

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:32.470 align:middle line:84%
so why can't we now start
out training our young people

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:84%
to think kind thoughts, good
thoughts, loving thoughts,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.080 align:middle line:84%
take responsibility thoughts,
and helping other people?

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's the kind of thinking
that if we can get ourselves

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.030 align:middle line:90%
to doing, then we become that.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:51.580 align:middle line:90%
Our children can become that.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.740 align:middle line:10%
And you know, as an example, you
know, we've got our grandson.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.660 align:middle line:90%
He's nine years old now.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.840 align:middle line:84%
He was three months
premature, and no one

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.598 align:middle line:90%
expected him to live.

00:07:04.598 --> 00:07:05.492 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:07:05.492 --> 00:07:06.390 align:middle line:90%


00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.980 align:middle line:84%
My wife and his mother,
Trish, when he was born,

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.710 align:middle line:84%
they stayed with
him 24 hours a day

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.160 align:middle line:84%
in intensive care
for six months.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:84%
My wife played semi-classical
music with a little cassette

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.130 align:middle line:90%
player beside him.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.830 align:middle line:84%
They touched him every day,
stroked him a little bit.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.570 align:middle line:90%
Just touched him, talked to him.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And he grew, and he
grew, and he's fine now.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.080 align:middle line:84%
Later, I learned-- I've listened
to Deepak Chopra's tapes.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.760 align:middle line:84%
One day, he was
talking about preemies.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:84%
And he says, if you stroke
a preemie three times a day

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.570 align:middle line:84%
for 10 minutes, they
grow 49% more per day.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.320 align:middle line:90%


00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.735 align:middle line:84%
And my wife and his mother,
Trish, stroked him every day,

00:07:54.735 --> 00:07:56.890 align:middle line:90%
you know, several times.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:59.180 align:middle line:84%
And I'm sure he
grew more than that.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.650 align:middle line:84%
And they call it kinesthetic
tactile stimulation.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:90%
God forbid, call it love.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.550 align:middle line:90%
You know--

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I was thinking
that very same thing.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:15.440 align:middle line:84%
And I can feel what he felt,
because he felt like something

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.500 align:middle line:90%
outside loved him.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And he just wanted to grow
and find out what it--

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.600 align:middle line:90%
you know, and he's fine.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.070 align:middle line:90%
He's fine.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.640 align:middle line:90%
He's doing great.

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.640 align:middle line:84%
He's such a lovable
little fellow.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.770 align:middle line:84%
You know, he comes up to
me every one in a while

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and he says, Grandpa,
I need a hug.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.000 align:middle line:90%
I said, I do too.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.470 align:middle line:90%
So we hug.

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.679 align:middle line:84%
And he does this to his
grandma and to his mother

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:42.030 align:middle line:90%
and to everybody.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.140 align:middle line:10%
And one day, he
was five years old.

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.830 align:middle line:10%
I was in my office, and I
was looking at my stock.

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.080 align:middle line:84%
You know, I invest
in the stock market.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was-- all my charts
were on four screens.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:84%
And I had, you know,
like, 24 charts on there.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And he usually comes
in and plays with them

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.090 align:middle line:84%
and moves them around,
and I let him do that.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And one day, he was moving the
mouse and he was clicking it,

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:90%
and he got my charts off.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:07.723 align:middle line:84%
And it took me an hour to
get them back, you know?

00:09:07.723 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:84%
And the next time he
came in, he was doing it.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.150 align:middle line:90%
I said, no, Dustin, like that.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:14.300 align:middle line:90%


00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:18.180 align:middle line:84%
He looked at me, and
tears came to his eyes.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And I said, Dustin,
what's wrong, honey?

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.720 align:middle line:84%
He says, Grandpa,
you hurt my feelings.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.200 align:middle line:90%
I said, oh, come on.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.540 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I can
hurt your feelings

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:90%
without your permission.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:84%
I said, it's how
you processed it.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.750 align:middle line:90%
You know, his tears dried up.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.460 align:middle line:84%
And a couple days
later he came back in,

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.002 align:middle line:84%
and he put his hands
on his shoulder.

00:09:45.002 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:84%
He says, Grandpa, you
can't hurt my feelings.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.705 align:middle line:90%
You know, I said, fantastic.

00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:51.080 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you
want to teach him?

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.750 align:middle line:84%
What do you want to instill
in him as a young man?

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.330 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to instill in
him to be kind to everyone,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:04.810 align:middle line:84%
to love everybody, to work for
improving people's attitude

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:90%
towards other people.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.275 align:middle line:90%
Nondiscrimination.

00:10:08.275 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And really, when you
teach him that, I think--

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.760 align:middle line:84%
and they can be prosperous
at the same time.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.780 align:middle line:84%
They can be financially
wealthy doing that.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:21.425 align:middle line:84%
It has worked for me
in the last few years.

00:10:21.425 --> 00:10:24.290 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.980 align:middle line:84%
I have made more
money since I've

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:84%
been on this path of
learning about how

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.975 align:middle line:90%
to become enlightened.

00:10:34.975 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I made more money in
one year than I made in 40 years

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.570 align:middle line:84%
when I was in the cable
television business driving.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do you suppose that
is, this kind of success?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.320 align:middle line:90%
>> I think you just let loose.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.370 align:middle line:90%
You just let it go.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.370 align:middle line:84%
You're not attached
to it, again.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.850 align:middle line:90%
You just let it happen.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.600 align:middle line:84%
And you do all of the
things that is right.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting,
isn't it, Mr. Turner,

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:03.380 align:middle line:84%
how people can sense
and recognize integrity.

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.150 align:middle line:84%
In our ads, we would put little
messages in there, you know?

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:84%
And most of them was
from Dr. Wayne Dyer.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.183 align:middle line:90%
And we put his name in it.

00:11:13.183 --> 00:11:14.680 align:middle line:90%
You know, by Dr. Wayne Dyer.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And Deepak, you
know, and whomever.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.480 align:middle line:84%
And we put these little messages
in with our ads, and it says--

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.440 align:middle line:84%
it was like, there is
no way to happiness.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.290 align:middle line:90%
Happiness is the way.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And you know, you don't go to
the beach to find happiness.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.900 align:middle line:84%
You don't go to another
country to find it.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.210 align:middle line:90%
You take it with you.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.096 align:middle line:84%
You take it with
you wherever you go.

00:11:38.096 --> 00:11:43.760 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.190 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> William Turner is wealthy
by almost anyone's standards,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.220 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't always so.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.100 align:middle line:84%
He's the quintessential
self-made man.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.640 align:middle line:84%
After his discharge from the
army following World War II,

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.840 align:middle line:84%
he moved quickly to remedy
his lack of formal education.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Then with about
$50 in his pocket,

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.270 align:middle line:84%
he found an investor
for what would

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:11.650 align:middle line:84%
become only the second cable
TV system in the country.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Within a year, he'd
repaid his backer

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and was at the helm of
a thriving business.

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:24.280 align:middle line:10%
I want to learn a little
bit more about you

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:25.990 align:middle line:10%
as you were growing
up, because I

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:10%
want to know what
it took to create

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:10%
the man who sits before me.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to know a little
bit about your parents.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my parents,
we were very poor.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>> You were?

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.615 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, absolutely.

00:12:40.615 --> 00:12:42.130 align:middle line:90%
We lived on a farm.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.320 align:middle line:84%
And guess what we
raised on the farm.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Chickens.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:45.420 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.110 align:middle line:84%
Well, we had chickens too, but
we had all kinds of animals.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.170 align:middle line:90%
But we raised tobacco.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm amazed to
hear you say that.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:52.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.300 align:middle line:90%
And tobacco was our cash crop.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:10%
And we raised everything.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:03.160 align:middle line:10%
We raised wheat, corn, peanuts,
you know, cotton, everything.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.700 align:middle line:90%
But tobacco was our cash.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so odd to hear
you say that today.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And the amazing thing
about it, I thought it was OK.

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.310 align:middle line:84%
Because see, I was
brought up that way.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:84%
I was educated that way,
conditioned that way.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.550 align:middle line:84%
And so all of us,
whatever our background is

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
is what we are today because
we saw something there

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.890 align:middle line:90%
that we didn't want to do.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:29.702 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when I was drafted
into the army in 1944--

00:13:29.702 --> 00:13:30.910 align:middle line:90%
>> And how old were you then?

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:31.570 align:middle line:90%
>> I was 18.

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:32.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:36.490 align:middle line:84%
>> And I told my dad I was not
going to come back to the farm.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.117 align:middle line:84%
And when I got out of
the army, I went back,

00:13:39.117 --> 00:13:40.700 align:middle line:84%
and I worked in the
farm a little bit.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.410 align:middle line:84%
I helped get the tobacco
in and stuff like that.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't-- I just left,
and I went out and I went

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.180 align:middle line:90%
to school.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Mr. Turner, what
was your mother like?

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.356 align:middle line:90%
>> My mother was wonderful.

00:13:53.356 --> 00:13:57.730 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:03.040 align:middle line:10%
She always loved me, and she was
always holding me in her arms.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.560 align:middle line:84%
And I always felt so
good to sit in her lap

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.250 align:middle line:90%
and cuddle with my mother.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:14.620 align:middle line:10%
My father was-- he wanted
to be a good person,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.750 align:middle line:10%
and he was in certain ways.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.790 align:middle line:84%
But there's many
ways that he wasn't.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.100 align:middle line:90%
He liked to drink a lot.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:28.600 align:middle line:10%
And when he would get high
every third week or something

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle line:10%
like that, he was
difficult to live with,

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.030 align:middle line:10%
and he was kind of threatening.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:35.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Was he an abusive man?

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:90%
>> He was kind of abusive.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.200 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.032 align:middle line:90%
He would whip me really hard.

00:14:39.032 --> 00:14:40.490 align:middle line:84%
My mother would
whip me too, but it

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:41.740 align:middle line:90%
wasn't near as hard, you know?

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:42.617 align:middle line:90%
It was a love whip.

00:14:42.617 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a difference
between whipping with love

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:90%
and a whipping.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:46.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:52.240 align:middle line:10%
And well, you know, my parents
really had no education.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:57.520 align:middle line:10%
And I didn't get a lot of
basic education myself,

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.420 align:middle line:10%
because when I went in
the army, for instance--

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.950 align:middle line:10%
see, I could work on a farm,
and we stayed out of school

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.410 align:middle line:10%
so much that I
didn't get promoted.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:08.020 align:middle line:84%
I was 18 years old
in the fifth grade.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.610 align:middle line:84%
>> 18 years old in
the fifth grade.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:90%
So did you graduate from--

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I did take a
correspondence course after--

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.793 align:middle line:90%
>> From high school?

00:15:14.793 --> 00:15:16.793 align:middle line:84%
>> From high school after
I got out of the army.

00:15:16.793 --> 00:15:17.650 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.540 align:middle line:90%
And then I went--

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.160 align:middle line:84%
I enrolled in Temple
University in Philadelphia,

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
and I got my broadcasting
education there.

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.310 align:middle line:10%
And I finished
three years of it.

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.450 align:middle line:84%
I still need to go
back one more year.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:33.010 align:middle line:84%
>> That's incredible to be 18
years old and in fifth grade.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.330 align:middle line:90%
Was it awkward?

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:35.730 align:middle line:84%
Did you look around
and realize--

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you remember that feeling?

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:38.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:39.740 align:middle line:90%
It was embarrassing.

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.000 align:middle line:10%
It was embarrassing.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.870 align:middle line:10%
And so when I was
drafted in the army,

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:48.640 align:middle line:10%
I began to see where I
was lacking in education.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.675 align:middle line:10%
And so I didn't get a lot of--

00:15:50.675 --> 00:15:52.420 align:middle line:10%
you know, I still
can't spell today.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:53.370 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.537 align:middle line:84%
>> Neither can I, if that
makes you feel any better.

00:15:55.537 --> 00:15:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And I worked for
you, Mr. Turner,

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.480 align:middle line:90%
so feel better about that.

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.700 align:middle line:84%
Were you always fascinated
with technology?

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.300 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yes.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.910 align:middle line:84%
I mean, television--
when we were in combat--

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:08.740 align:middle line:84%
and of course, we could
go behind the lines

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.210 align:middle line:90%
and see a movie, you know?

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.050 align:middle line:90%
It was drive-in.

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:12.925 align:middle line:90%
It was walk-in.

00:16:12.925 --> 00:16:17.000 align:middle line:84%
And I saw an excerpt
about television.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.880 align:middle line:90%
I said, my God.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.900 align:middle line:90%
Television.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:24.160 align:middle line:10%
You mean you can see
someone here in New York,

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.410 align:middle line:10%
and you can see them here,
wherever you are, you know?

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:27.687 align:middle line:90%
I mean, how does that work?

00:16:27.687 --> 00:16:29.270 align:middle line:84%
>> And you'd never
heard of it before?

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:30.490 align:middle line:84%
>> I had never
heard of it before.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:31.370 align:middle line:90%
>> You'd never seen it before?

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:90%
I'd just heard of radio.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:32.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:34.180 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd never seen it before.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:39.070 align:middle line:10%
And I thought, how can they
transmit someone's picture

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:42.430 align:middle line:10%
from a great distance,
and you can see it here?

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:45.560 align:middle line:84%
You know, I was so
curious, I picked up a book

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.260 align:middle line:84%
and I started reading
at that moment.

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.210 align:middle line:84%
When I was still in
the army in combat,

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:84%
between shelling the
Japanese and resting,

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
I would read the book
and how electrons flow.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:58.745 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH]

00:16:58.745 --> 00:17:01.030 align:middle line:84%
How signals were
transmitted and picked up

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and received, detected,
and go to the speaker,

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:05.500 align:middle line:90%
go to the picture tube.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:07.464 align:middle line:84%
I was reading all of
that stuff back then.

00:17:07.464 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
So when I got out, that
why I went to school.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:10.881 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, to me
that's fascinating,

00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:15.650 align:middle line:84%
because almost every time
I see you, still today--

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.119 align:middle line:90%
and here you are.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:20.220 align:middle line:84%
You own this multi-million
dollar company.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.890 align:middle line:84%
You're one of the
most recognized

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:90%
men in the television industry.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:90%
And you are still fascinated.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:84%
You're tinkering with
something, or trying

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:28.920 align:middle line:90%
to figure out how it works.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.110 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm trying to figure
out how people work,

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:36.260 align:middle line:84%
how your mind works and how your
body works, how your soul works

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.940 align:middle line:90%
and how your spirit works.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:42.110 align:middle line:84%
And you know, what
are we, you know?

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:46.070 align:middle line:84%
We're evolving from then to
something new and different

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.720 align:middle line:84%
now, which I look
forward to every day

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.040 align:middle line:84%
learning more
about spirituality.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:54.380 align:middle line:84%
You know, the
mind-body connection.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.700 align:middle line:90%
The mind connected to the body.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.210 align:middle line:84%
The body is connected
to the mind.

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.490 align:middle line:84%
What the body feels,
it affects the mind,

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:05.770 align:middle line:84%
and what the mind
thinks affects the body.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And every cell in your
body is a thinking cell.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:11.750 align:middle line:90%
I mean, Deepak talks about this.

00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And so it has to be,
because how could one cell--

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:22.160 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you actually replace
98% of every atom, every cell

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.160 align:middle line:90%
in your body in a year.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:84%
So before-- one cell
can go off into space.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.470 align:middle line:84%
Another one is
generated, is made.

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So a cell can make itself,
can make another cell.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And is it the same
with our thoughts?

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:40.070 align:middle line:90%
[SIGH]

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.870 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.910 align:middle line:10%
>> Thoughts come from a
different place, I think.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.640 align:middle line:84%
I think thoughts
come from spirit

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.270 align:middle line:84%
or come from the
intuitiveness inside.

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.620 align:middle line:90%
What is inside.

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.840 align:middle line:84%
You know, I wonder,
sometimes you get quiet,

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.580 align:middle line:90%
and you start thinking--

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:01.940 align:middle line:84%
you just get quiet and
peaceful, and an idea comes in.

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:90%
Where did it come from?

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
I mean, are we connected
to a mainframe computer

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.300 align:middle line:84%
around the Earth, and we're
tapping into the wisdom

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:90%
of the universe?

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.730 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you think?

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm not so sure about that.

00:19:14.990 --> 00:19:19.400 align:middle line:84%
I think we might just be
connected to something

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.400 align:middle line:90%
in the universe that is--

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.070 align:middle line:90%
that's the answer.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:27.620 align:middle line:84%
I never make a business
decision or any kind of decision

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.910 align:middle line:84%
unless I consult my inner
signals, my inner feelings,

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:33.820 align:middle line:90%
my intuitiveness.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's here,
but it could be out there.

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:41.640 align:middle line:90%
I don't know for sure.

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.580 align:middle line:90%
I want to learn more about it.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.390 align:middle line:90%
But I know it works.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.950 align:middle line:84%
I know that inside
feelings work.

00:19:47.950 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:84%
You know, for an
instance, let me tell you

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.250 align:middle line:84%
about one situation, and
it made a big difference

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.660 align:middle line:90%
in our financial situation.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.735 align:middle line:84%
When I started
this business when

00:19:58.735 --> 00:20:01.700 align:middle line:84%
we were in the midst of it,
marketing a satellite network

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.970 align:middle line:84%
television station to the
satellite dish industry,

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.570 align:middle line:84%
we were given the
opportunity to buy franchises

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.910 align:middle line:84%
in different
counties in our area

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:16.160 align:middle line:84%
or in the country from DIRECTV
through another company

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:21.110 align:middle line:84%
called NRTC, National Royal
Telecommunication Corporation.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.210 align:middle line:84%
And they want to
sell me this county.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And they said, Bill, now you
can market DIRECTV service

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:27.740 align:middle line:90%
in this county.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:28.540 align:middle line:90%
You will own it.

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:29.840 align:middle line:90%
You will operate it.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:90%
And I said, oh, really?

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:34.380 align:middle line:90%
So I bought one county.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Then I said, I want some more.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:84%
I bought four more,
so I had five.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
We paid $800,000
for those franchises

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:45.560 align:middle line:84%
to right-- to market this
service in these counties.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, we did, and we
advertised, and we went gung ho.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:54.740 align:middle line:84%
And we built it up
to 6,000 customers.

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.640 align:middle line:90%
Not a big deal.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.630 align:middle line:84%
But a company came along,
and we had about a $1,200,000

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.370 align:middle line:90%
invested in the thing.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:84%
And a company came along
and offered us $8 million.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>> $8 million?

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:04.835 --> 00:21:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Oh yeah.

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And we negotiated with them
over a couple of weeks.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.710 align:middle line:90%
And for some reason, I just--

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:14.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, it got to the
point, they were pushing,

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.700 align:middle line:84%
and there were some
things in the contract

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.610 align:middle line:84%
that I didn't
particularly care about.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.610 align:middle line:84%
And it was on a Friday
night, and they said,

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:24.350 align:middle line:90%
Bill, we've got to do this deal.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:27.090 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, Monday's
going to be too late.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you
know, I don't know,

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.730 align:middle line:90%
but I don't want to do it.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:33.245 align:middle line:90%
>> So you asked your heart.

00:21:33.245 --> 00:21:34.045 align:middle line:90%
>> I consulted.

00:21:34.045 --> 00:21:34.845 align:middle line:90%
>> You went inside.

00:21:34.845 --> 00:21:35.790 align:middle line:90%
>> I went inside.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I felt like, this is not
something that I should do.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:41.070 align:middle line:84%
>> And something
inside says, no.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Said no.

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:42.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:43.130 align:middle line:90%
>> So I just--

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:90%
I just spoke it out.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.740 align:middle line:90%
I said, no.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do it.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:48.000 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know what it is.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.800 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.630 align:middle line:84%
But I just don't
feel good about it.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:54.080 align:middle line:84%
I picked up my briefcase at
9 o'clock on a Friday night,

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.430 align:middle line:90%
and I came home.

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:84%
And I told my wife
Brenda, I said, honey,

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.090 align:middle line:90%
I turned that deal down.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:00.350 align:middle line:84%
I said, I just didn't
feel good about it.

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:02.030 align:middle line:84%
She said, well, honey, if
you don't feel good about it,

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.020 align:middle line:90%
don't do it.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:90%
I said, well--

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.950 align:middle line:84%
I went to bed and
slept like a baby.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Got up Monday morning,
went back to the office.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.930 align:middle line:84%
At 10 o'clock, we got a
call from another company,

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.445 align:middle line:90%
offered us $10.

00:22:13.445 --> 00:22:15.680 align:middle line:90%
$10 million.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.680 align:middle line:90%
We wound up getting $11.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.190 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:24.940 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you think the face of
television would change today

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.830 align:middle line:84%
if most of the men and women
in the television industry made

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:84%
decisions like you do
where you stop, you focus,

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:39.230 align:middle line:84%
you go to your center, and
you answer the question from

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:40.040 align:middle line:90%
our heart?

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.280 align:middle line:90%
How different would it be?

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it would be different.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.960 align:middle line:84%
It would be a big
difference, because then you

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.930 align:middle line:84%
could deal with each
other without contracts.

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.410 align:middle line:84%
For the most part, you could
do business with anybody

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.160 align:middle line:84%
out there without having
to have a contract.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Incredible.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Because you trust everybody.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.160 align:middle line:90%
You say, look.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.548 align:middle line:90%
I want it to work for you.

00:22:59.548 --> 00:23:00.590 align:middle line:90%
I want it to work for me.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.530 align:middle line:84%
I want it to work for
everybody that's involved,

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.220 align:middle line:84%
including-- especially
the public, the people

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.900 align:middle line:90%
that we're serving.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.800 align:middle line:90%
We want to work for them.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.010 align:middle line:90%
That's our main objective.

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.120 align:middle line:90%
And if we could do that--

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.250 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it would be
easy to go negotiate

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:20.030 align:middle line:84%
with Time Warner, or any of
the DBS companies, or anyone

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:25.650 align:middle line:84%
out there if we all would
operate on trusting each other

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:26.450 align:middle line:90%
and knowing--

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:28.250 align:middle line:90%
and I'm not trying to cheat you.

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:31.072 align:middle line:84%
If something changes
tomorrow, we'll say, OK.

00:23:31.072 --> 00:23:32.030 align:middle line:90%
Look, this has changed.

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Can we change this
and do it this way?

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:35.990 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.100 align:middle line:90%
You can do those kind of things.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think if we all
could get to this point--

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.250 align:middle line:84%
you know those three guys
that you interviewed recently?

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Deepak's son and John--

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Robbins and Noah Levine.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle line:10%
>> And Noah Levine, yes.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.880 align:middle line:10%
You see how those three young
people has been brought up

00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:01.970 align:middle line:10%
in a family that's spiritual,
that's kind, that's loving,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.310 align:middle line:10%
taking responsibility.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.630 align:middle line:84%
And these three kids
are perfect examples

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
of what we should do
for the whole world.

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:10.932 align:middle line:90%


00:24:10.932 --> 00:24:16.656 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:16.656 --> 00:24:17.620 align:middle line:90%


00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:84%
>> In January of 1999, feeling
a bit run down and looking to be

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:84%
rejuvenated, Bill Turner visited
an alternative medical center

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.930 align:middle line:90%
just outside of Boston.

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.840 align:middle line:84%
He had no idea he was
about to hear some

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:34.570 align:middle line:90%
of the worst news of his life.

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:37.540 align:middle line:90%
He was diagnosed with lymphoma.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:39.610 align:middle line:84%
As of this taping,
though, the cancer

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:44.920 align:middle line:84%
is in remission, the result of
chemotherapy, dietary changes,

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:48.940 align:middle line:84%
and no doubt his resilient
spirit and faith.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.670 align:middle line:10%
You've always been
a healthy man.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:55.240 align:middle line:10%
A year ago, you went to
your doctor for a checkup?

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I went
to a doctor here,

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.920 align:middle line:10%
but they didn't find anything,
so I went to Lancaster.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.783 align:middle line:10%
My wife and I went up to
Lancaster, Massachusetts.

00:25:02.783 --> 00:25:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>> But why did you go?

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:04.910 align:middle line:90%
Because you didn't feel well?

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:05.710 align:middle line:90%
Something was off?

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:07.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I was OK.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.310 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't feeling really good.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:11.530 align:middle line:10%
But we went up there
to be rejuvenated,

00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.740 align:middle line:10%
you might say, to go
through their program

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.400 align:middle line:10%
with their massages and
their herb treatments and

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.530 align:middle line:10%
taking the herbs, and so forth.

00:25:20.530 --> 00:25:27.066 align:middle line:84%
And I got there, and Dr.
Cocarni, he checked my pulse.

00:25:27.066 --> 00:25:28.490 align:middle line:90%
He checked my pulse.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:32.870 align:middle line:84%
There are three fingers on
my pulse, for an instance,

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.410 align:middle line:84%
and each one of them
bounces a certain way.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:40.130 align:middle line:10%
With that, he was
able to, in effect,

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:44.210 align:middle line:10%
detect there was something
seriously wrong with my body.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:48.200 align:middle line:84%
And he indicated
this to Dr. Glasser,

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.760 align:middle line:84%
and he started checking
me, feeling my stomach,

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.460 align:middle line:84%
and checking under my arms and
my neck, and stuff like that.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:02.400 align:middle line:10%
And he found-- and he felt
a mass of stuff in there.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.450 align:middle line:84%
He said, Bill, we need
to go get this checked.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.413 align:middle line:10%
And I said, well, why?

00:26:08.413 --> 00:26:09.330 align:middle line:10%
You know what he said?

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:14.630 align:middle line:10%
Well, you may have something
that we need know what it is.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:20.920 align:middle line:10%
So we went to the hospital,
and we got it checked.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.760 align:middle line:84%
And it showed that
I did have cancer.

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.590 align:middle line:90%
And he suspected that.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.750 align:middle line:90%
So they found my cancer there.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:31.580 align:middle line:10%
And then he sent me to Boston
Mass General to another--

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.230 align:middle line:10%
one of the world's best doctors.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And they gave me four
chemo treatments.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.502 align:middle line:84%
And each one, I'd come back
and stay there at the Lancaster

00:26:40.502 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:84%
facility, and they would
give me treatments too

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.553 align:middle line:84%
and help me through
the time that--

00:26:45.553 --> 00:26:46.970 align:middle line:84%
you know, it was
difficult for me.

00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:47.960 align:middle line:90%
>> And were you resistant?

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.390 align:middle line:84%
Did you say, I don't
want to do chemo?

00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:49.680 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.570 align:middle line:90%
No, I did not.

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:53.230 align:middle line:84%
I took it, because they
both recommended it.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.030 align:middle line:90%
I said, look.

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:54.830 align:middle line:90%
He said, Bill--

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:57.410 align:middle line:84%
I said, can we cure this
by alternative treatments?

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:84%
He said, Bill,
it's too far gone.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.400 align:middle line:90%
We need chemo to help us.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.260 align:middle line:84%
We can't guarantee it this
way, but we can help you.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:05.330 align:middle line:90%
We can assist you.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.400 align:middle line:90%
So I went and got the chemo.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.120 align:middle line:84%
And it was the best thing
I've ever done in this case.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.480 align:middle line:10%
But I think-- I
really think if we

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:10%
will go to a facility similar
to the Lancaster facility

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.200 align:middle line:10%
once a year for one week
or two weeks or three weeks

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:30.710 align:middle line:10%
and take their treatments
and learn how to eat properly

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:35.210 align:middle line:10%
and how to think properly, you
know, and meditate each day, do

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:38.120 align:middle line:10%
your yoga exercise
and all that stuff,

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.175 align:middle line:10%
I don't think we would get sick.

00:27:41.175 --> 00:27:43.550 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I'm sure some people
are still going to get sick.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:46.880 align:middle line:10%
But for the most part, I
think the vast majority

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.430 align:middle line:10%
of people that would do
that would not get sick.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:51.080 align:middle line:10%
They could live a life.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.510 align:middle line:10%
What happens to you when you eat
all of these foods that we eat,

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:10%
which is the regular American
diet for the most part,

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.520 align:middle line:10%
we don't digest all that food.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And we drink ice
water, iced tea,

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.080 align:middle line:84%
something cold with
our meals, and that

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.250 align:middle line:90%
interferes with digestion.

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I noticed you only
drink warm water.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> That's correct, because
it's the same temperature

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:15.620 align:middle line:84%
as your body, and it
doesn't cause a reaction.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.560 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't interfere
with digestion.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.460 align:middle line:10%
See, when you don't
digest your food,

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:24.290 align:middle line:10%
it turns out what they call
at Lancaster and [INAUDIBLE],,

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:27.320 align:middle line:10%
it's called ama, A-M-A.

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:30.590 align:middle line:10%
This is a sticky substance
that runs through your veins,

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.150 align:middle line:10%
it runs through your body.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.270 align:middle line:10%
And it goes to the
weakest part of your body,

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:39.500 align:middle line:10%
and it stays there and
it creates your disease,

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:44.252 align:middle line:10%
whether that's arthritis,
cancer, or headaches,

00:28:44.252 --> 00:28:45.085 align:middle line:10%
high blood pressure.

00:28:45.085 --> 00:28:47.610 align:middle line:90%


00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:52.300 align:middle line:84%
That's what happens to you
when you don't eat properly

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.230 align:middle line:90%
and drink the right liquids.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.613 align:middle line:90%
And you should just drink water.

00:28:56.613 --> 00:28:58.780 align:middle line:10%
>> And you must feel such
a difference in your body.

00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:00.210 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Now that I'm on this program--

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.670 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I think
this is really what

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:08.950 align:middle line:90%
got me going from my chemo.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:13.590 align:middle line:84%
I think that got the big
majority of my disease out

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.520 align:middle line:84%
of my body, but the
other part certainly

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.860 align:middle line:90%
assisted that tremendously.

00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.470 align:middle line:10%
And I'm still taking
those treatments,

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:26.910 align:middle line:10%
and I'm still doing my program,
eating for the most part

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:29.610 align:middle line:10%
properly cooked vegetables.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:32.850 align:middle line:84%
I am now for the most
part a vegetarian.

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.230 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't eat any meat?

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I do.

00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Occasionally, I do eat some
fish and chicken occasionally,

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:40.060 align:middle line:90%
but I'm getting off that too.

00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.560 align:middle line:90%
But it takes a long time.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:41.830 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:42.640 align:middle line:90%
You can't just do--

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't just get off meat.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:48.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me ask you
this, Mr. Turner.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:54.150 align:middle line:84%
When you have an
illness like you had,

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.940 align:middle line:84%
you pretty much go
to death's door.

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:58.260 align:middle line:90%
Very close to it.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:01.300 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people die
of what you had.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.030 align:middle line:84%
>> When you are
that close to death,

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:84%
do you look at the world with
a kind of a fearlessness where

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.860 align:middle line:84%
before you were afraid of
things, and now you're not?

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm not afraid.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:18.630 align:middle line:10%
I wasn't-- I'm not
afraid of dying.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:22.830 align:middle line:10%
That doesn't bother
me at all, because I

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.010 align:middle line:10%
think that's part of
our living, you know?

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:84%
So I have accepted
that one of these days,

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.040 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to be here.

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.220 align:middle line:10%
And so I won't
have to go to work.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.200 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.060 align:middle line:84%
But not that I don't
love going to work.

00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:42.310 align:middle line:84%
I really do, because what
we're doing at Wisdom channel

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.110 align:middle line:90%
I think--

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:47.380 align:middle line:84%
I need to live and help
get that going really good,

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:51.210 align:middle line:84%
and get it spread out to
every home on this Earth,

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:52.030 align:middle line:90%
to every home.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:54.480 align:middle line:84%
I think that every
home on this earth

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.870 align:middle line:84%
should have our
programming in their home.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:58.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what--
I mean, it's going

00:30:58.370 --> 00:30:59.910 align:middle line:90%
to take a long time to do that.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:01.810 align:middle line:84%
It's going to take
a lot of money.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.870 align:middle line:10%
But I think the money will come.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, with an attitude like
yours and with leadership like

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:09.390 align:middle line:84%
yours, I don't think it'll
take as long as you think

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:10.140 align:middle line:90%
it'll take, actually.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I sure hope so.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.930 align:middle line:84%
I hope I can do
it in my lifetime.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:16.590 align:middle line:10%
But if I can just get it so
far out there that it can't

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:20.340 align:middle line:10%
turn around and do something
different and not work,

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.210 align:middle line:10%
I'll be happy.

00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.010 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:23.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be happy anyway.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:25.873 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to go back to
something you were talking

00:31:25.873 --> 00:31:29.880 align:middle line:84%
about a minute ago, because I
love to hear you talk about it.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.250 align:middle line:90%
Many people are afraid of death.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.830 align:middle line:90%
Many people are terrified of it.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you could
instill in those people

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:43.460 align:middle line:84%
your view of death, I think a
lot of people would be calmer.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.892 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:31:44.892 --> 00:31:46.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Where do you
find your attitude?

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:51.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, when you die,
I think of it as-- you know,

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.210 align:middle line:84%
do you remember anything
when you go to sleep?

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.950 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:32:00.050 align:middle line:84%
>> If you didn't wake
up, would you be sad?

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.160 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, you know,
when you think of it that way,

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.130 align:middle line:90%
it's OK.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.150 align:middle line:90%
I just don't fear it.

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:13.620 align:middle line:10%
I just don't-- when I was in the
war, I didn't even fear death.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.750 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't understand
it then at all.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I was strictly a
normal person back then.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, very ignorant.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:21.480 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.350 align:middle line:84%
Didn't know what
it was all about.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:25.350 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't want to be
killed either, you know?

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:27.492 align:middle line:84%
I thought that would be
a bad thing, because I

00:32:27.492 --> 00:32:28.450 align:middle line:90%
want to come back home.

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:31.440 align:middle line:84%
I want to work and I want
to accomplish something.

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And I look forward-- because
I like dealing with people

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.380 align:middle line:90%
and working with people.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:38.700 align:middle line:84%
And that's the reason I wanted
to come back home from the war.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.275 align:middle line:90%
I didn't want to die in the war.

00:32:40.275 --> 00:32:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, if you have a purpose--

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I had a purpose.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.560 align:middle line:90%
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.477 align:middle line:84%
I had to come back and
learn about television,

00:32:46.477 --> 00:32:47.800 align:middle line:90%
how that worked, you know.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.490 align:middle line:10%
And you know, I was looking
at strictly material things

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:52.200 align:middle line:10%
at that point in
time in my life.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You know something else that
I always remark about you, Mr.

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:55.820 align:middle line:90%
Turner?

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:57.630 align:middle line:84%
Let's see if you
can comment on this.

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:01.605 align:middle line:84%
And it's a rare
quality in a man.

00:33:01.605 --> 00:33:05.410 align:middle line:90%
You are a man with no secrets.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:06.210 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Not too many.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.810 align:middle line:10%
>> Really.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:09.350 align:middle line:10%
I mean, that's my
impression of you.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.840 align:middle line:84%
You talk freely of
things, and sometimes I

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.800 align:middle line:90%
think secrets make us sick.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.190 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:90%
I agree.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.340 align:middle line:84%
You're holding it in, and
if you can just let it out,

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.430 align:middle line:84%
whatever it might be,
what are you going to do?

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:23.880 align:middle line:10%
What can you say, you know?

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:10%
I'm sorry I did that if I did
something wrong, you know?

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:29.600 align:middle line:10%
I know better next time.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.500 align:middle line:90%
I've learned from it.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:90%
And you go on.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Now have you always
been a man of no secrets,

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:35.880 align:middle line:90%
or did you learn?

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.130 align:middle line:90%
Now think about that a minute.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:39.810 align:middle line:10%
>> I think I've always
been pretty much that way,

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:45.215 align:middle line:10%
but I've also learned how to let
go more, you know, and not to--

00:33:45.215 --> 00:33:47.077 align:middle line:10%
just say what's on your mind.

00:33:47.077 --> 00:33:48.410 align:middle line:10%
You know, no big deal, you know?

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:51.050 align:middle line:10%
I'll do things now
that I wouldn't

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:53.370 align:middle line:10%
have done 10 years ago.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.545 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I'll say
things about myself

00:33:55.545 --> 00:33:57.170 align:middle line:84%
that I wouldn't have
said 10 years ago.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.087 align:middle line:10%
>> Like, for example--

00:33:58.087 --> 00:34:01.540 align:middle line:90%


00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.940 align:middle line:10%

>> Five times.

00:34:11.419 --> 00:34:12.219 align:middle line:10%
>> Five times?

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:12.730 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH]

00:34:12.730 --> 00:34:13.330 align:middle line:10%

Yes.

00:34:13.810 --> 00:34:14.610 align:middle line:10%
I have.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:15.530 align:middle line:10%
Yeah.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:17.110 align:middle line:10%
And I used to [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:18.544 --> 00:34:19.980 align:middle line:10%


00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.250 align:middle line:10%
That's no big deal anymore.

>> How old are you?

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.810 align:middle line:10%

that I have your attitude

00:34:32.949 --> 00:34:35.302 align:middle line:90%
That is my prayer today.

00:34:35.302 --> 00:34:37.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you know, all of
my marriages, for instance,

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.699 align:middle line:10%
and everything I've done
in life that didn't work,

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:41.302 align:middle line:10%
I learned from them.

00:34:41.302 --> 00:34:43.719 align:middle line:10%
Hey, it's a learning experience
and I say, well, you know,

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:44.920 align:middle line:10%
I'm glad I--

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.230 align:middle line:10%
I'm not sorry that
I went through that.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:48.840 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you know, people--

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.330 align:middle line:10%
one of these days, you've got
to learn how to work through.

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:55.730 align:middle line:10%
You know, I used to, any time
we had a disagreement, I'd say,

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:57.610 align:middle line:10%
well, I'm going to leave you.

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Or you can-- you know,
I want you to leave,

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.240 align:middle line:84%
or something like
that, you know?

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.693 align:middle line:84%
But now I want to
work through it.

00:35:03.693 --> 00:35:05.610 align:middle line:10%
You know, I'm more open
to working through it.

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And I'm still having a
little trouble with that.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:09.220 align:middle line:10%
I mean, my wife and
I get in a little bit

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.970 align:middle line:10%
of a discussion about
something, you know,

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:13.250 align:middle line:10%
I begin to feel
like, you know, God,

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:15.250 align:middle line:10%
you know, I don't
want to do this.

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.180 align:middle line:10%
But I want to work
through it now.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:17.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.480 align:middle line:90%
You do something differently.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.630 align:middle line:90%
What do you do now?

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:21.460 align:middle line:90%
You stop?

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.380 align:middle line:90%
>> We talk.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.360 align:middle line:90%
We talk about it.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.160 align:middle line:90%
>> We talk.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:26.980 align:middle line:84%
>> We're able now
to talk about it.

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:28.990 align:middle line:10%
And I think that's
the key to it,

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:34.670 align:middle line:10%
to understanding and
explaining the whole thing,

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.000 align:middle line:10%
not holding anything back.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.170 align:middle line:84%
And just say, well,
I felt this way.

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:39.570 align:middle line:90%
She felt this way.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:40.370 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:46.075 align:middle line:10%
Honey, we can learn
from this and go on.

00:35:46.075 --> 00:35:51.520 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:52.510 align:middle line:90%


00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:56.470 align:middle line:84%
>> When William Turner
launched Wisdom back in 1997,

00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:59.470 align:middle line:84%
the television station was on
the air for only a few hours

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.200 align:middle line:84%
a day, but now it's
a different story.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.710 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's 24 hours a
day, seven days a week,

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:08.890 align:middle line:10%
along with Wisdom Radio
and Wisdom Internet,

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:11.290 align:middle line:10%
featuring some of today's
best known thinkers

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:14.105 align:middle line:10%
in the areas of body,
mind, and spirit.

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:17.660 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.120 align:middle line:10%
And Wisdom is growing quickly.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:84%
In all, Turner Vision
and Wisdom Media Group

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.690 align:middle line:84%
employ more than
500 people right

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:28.840 align:middle line:84%
here in the unlikely
media boom town

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.870 align:middle line:90%
of Bluefield, West Virginia.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.970 align:middle line:10%
One of the things that
a lot of people respect

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:35.680 align:middle line:10%
and love about
you, Mr. Turner, is

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:43.510 align:middle line:10%
that you have a capacity to love
this huge extended family you

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:44.410 align:middle line:10%
have.

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:45.280 align:middle line:10%
I mean, you have--

00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:46.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Unconditionally love.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.580 align:middle line:10%
To unconditional love.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.310 align:middle line:10%
It has to be unconditional.

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:54.490 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you always find
reasons not to love someone,

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:57.100 align:middle line:84%
and you always find
reasons to hate someone.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.350 align:middle line:10%
So you've got to drop
all of the things

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:02.260 align:middle line:10%
about anybody that
you don't particularly

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.110 align:middle line:10%
care about or rather
it wasn't there.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.130 align:middle line:10%
You've still got to
love them without that.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.930 align:middle line:10%
You're a person.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:08.830 align:middle line:90%
You're a human being.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:10.122 align:middle line:90%
You're a wonderful human being.

00:37:10.122 --> 00:37:12.310 align:middle line:90%
There's good in you.

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:18.310 align:middle line:84%
You know, I know we've got
500 something employees.

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:22.090 align:middle line:84%
I go out sometimes and find out
something that they have done.

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:24.160 align:middle line:84%
You know, somebody has
done something good.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And I go out, and I pat them
on the shoulder and say,

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I heard something good
about you the other day.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.890 align:middle line:84%
And I say, I just want you to
know I really appreciate it.

00:37:31.890 --> 00:37:32.928 align:middle line:90%
You are fantastic.

00:37:32.928 --> 00:37:33.970 align:middle line:90%
Pat them on the shoulder.

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:35.120 align:middle line:90%
Not even tell them what it was.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.037 align:middle line:90%
They say, what was it?

00:37:36.037 --> 00:37:37.770 align:middle line:10%
I says, I'm not
going to tell you.

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:38.570 align:middle line:90%
And go on.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:39.460 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.800 align:middle line:90%
But it perks them up.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.200 align:middle line:10%
One follow one day--

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.050 align:middle line:10%
this guy.

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:47.150 align:middle line:10%
We had a customer call.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:49.060 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you know,
my satellite system

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.250 align:middle line:84%
has been getting bad
for the last few days,

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:52.830 align:middle line:90%
and now it's gone altogether.

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:54.440 align:middle line:10%
I can't get any pictures.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.070 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we
offer the customer

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.040 align:middle line:90%
free technical support.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:58.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Free?

00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Even I didn't know
that, and I work for you.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.220 align:middle line:84%
>> We offer free technical
support with our satellite

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:04.570 align:middle line:90%
customers, you know?

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:07.403 align:middle line:84%
Even if they aren't our
customer, we will help them.

00:38:07.403 --> 00:38:09.820 align:middle line:10%
And some of the other companies
say, called Turner Vision,

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:12.520 align:middle line:10%
and they'll help you with
your technical support.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.020 align:middle line:10%
Anyway, this lady
called up one day.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.868 align:middle line:10%
She says, you know,
my satellite's

00:38:15.868 --> 00:38:17.910 align:middle line:10%
been getting bad for the
last three or four days.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:19.145 align:middle line:90%
It's gone altogether now.

00:38:19.145 --> 00:38:20.770 align:middle line:84%
So he went through
all the diagnostics.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:21.700 align:middle line:90%
Told her, punch this button.

00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:22.510 align:middle line:90%
Punch that button.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.770 align:middle line:90%
All the numbers came up.

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:27.970 align:middle line:84%
And he says, you know
something, Mrs. Jones?

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:31.030 align:middle line:10%
I don't know what's
wrong with your TV.

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:33.670 align:middle line:10%
But go out and look
under your LNB.

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:34.690 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGH]

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:36.820 align:middle line:90%
What is your LNB?

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Low noise block
converter, you know?

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:41.520 align:middle line:90%


00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:46.590 align:middle line:10%
And see if there's a wasp nest,
a bird nest, or trash under it.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:47.490 align:middle line:10%
So she said, OK.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:50.040 align:middle line:10%
So she went out, and there was
a wasp nest that had built up

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.160 align:middle line:10%
underneath her LNB,
and blocking the signal

00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.080 align:middle line:10%
from coming in so she could
receive it on her TV set.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.310 align:middle line:84%
And she got a broom,
and she knocked it out.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:00.710 align:middle line:90%
And she came back in the house.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:02.770 align:middle line:84%
He looked at the
TV, and it was fine.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:03.570 align:middle line:90%
She calls him back.

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:05.510 align:middle line:84%
She says, you're not
going to believe this,

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.730 align:middle line:90%
but you were right.

00:39:06.730 --> 00:39:09.120 align:middle line:10%
It was a wasp's nest.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.807 align:middle line:10%
Thank you so much.

00:39:10.807 --> 00:39:12.390 align:middle line:10%
Now you know that
person's going to be

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:13.550 align:middle line:10%
a customer for a long time.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:14.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Forever.

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:15.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Forever.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.450 align:middle line:84%
>> And we do that kind of thing
for all of them that call us,

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:19.560 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:24.420 align:middle line:10%
And she said, you saved me $50.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:29.820 align:middle line:10%
So you see, if you're in
business, for heaven's sakes,

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:32.040 align:middle line:10%
do what's right
for your customer.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.450 align:middle line:10%
And do it with happiness.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:34.890 align:middle line:90%
Do it with gladness.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:37.500 align:middle line:90%
Do it with enthusiasm.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.540 align:middle line:10%
And say, Mrs. Jones,
I am tickled to death

00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.100 align:middle line:10%
that we found your trouble.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.790 align:middle line:10%
Call us back any time you
have any more trouble.

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Mr. Turner, do people ever
think you're related to Ted

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:48.570 align:middle line:90%
Turner?

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:48.855 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGH]

00:39:48.855 --> 00:39:49.655 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:49.655 --> 00:39:50.820 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:52.440 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always wanted
to ask you that.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:53.980 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I got a little
story with that.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:04.350 align:middle line:84%
When I named my company back
in 1986, I believe it was--

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Turner Vision.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:07.800 align:middle line:84%
--from Welch Antenna Company,
which was a cable company

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.600 align:middle line:90%
name--

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:15.290 align:middle line:84%
--Turner wanted to use that
same name, but I already had it.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:17.187 align:middle line:84%
And a friend of mine
that works there said,

00:40:17.187 --> 00:40:19.770 align:middle line:84%
no, you can't use Turner Vision,
because Bill Turner's already

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:22.200 align:middle line:90%
got it.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Then I got a call from
one of their people,

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:27.810 align:middle line:84%
and sort of kind
of threatened me

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.270 align:middle line:84%
with the idea of
changing my name.

00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:32.380 align:middle line:90%
I says, look.

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:33.630 align:middle line:90%
I'm older than Ted.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:35.620 align:middle line:90%
I had my name first.

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.310 align:middle line:84%
All I attached
onto it was Vision.

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:39.540 align:middle line:90%
Turner Vision.

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And as far as I'm concerned,
he can change his name.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And she says, Mr. Turner, how
would it be if we both used it?

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:51.030 align:middle line:84%
And we signed a little
agreement to that effect.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:52.600 align:middle line:90%
I says, fine.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.413 align:middle line:90%
That'd be fine.

00:40:53.413 --> 00:40:54.580 align:middle line:90%
I have no problem with that.

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.738 align:middle line:90%
So they sent me one.

00:40:55.738 --> 00:40:56.780 align:middle line:90%
My attorney looked at it.

00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.140 align:middle line:84%
He made a little change into
it, sent it back to them.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.057 align:middle line:84%
And we've been operating
like that ever since.

00:41:01.057 --> 00:41:02.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you ever run into him?

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:06.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I haven't seen
Ted in probably--

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:09.998 align:middle line:84%
well, since he and
Jane got married.

00:41:09.998 --> 00:41:11.040 align:middle line:90%
>> That was 10 years ago.

00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:14.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Just before they got married,
I saw him and we talked.

00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:18.582 align:middle line:84%
And I used to go to his
ballgames a lot in Atlanta,

00:41:18.582 --> 00:41:20.040 align:middle line:84%

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:44.160 align:middle line:90%
How will it change?

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:84%
People talk about the internet
and television changing

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:48.660 align:middle line:90%
and programming and cable.

00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:51.540 align:middle line:90%
How do you see those changes?

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:55.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, of course, it's a
lot of digital programming now

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.060 align:middle line:10%
going on.

00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:57.050 align:middle line:10%
Digital everything.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:59.060 align:middle line:10%
Everything is going digital.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:00.970 align:middle line:10%
And the internet would
be digi-- everything

00:42:00.970 --> 00:42:05.280 align:middle line:10%
is going to be digital, and
that's going to allow thousands

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.500 align:middle line:10%
of more channels and
more programming,

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:10.560 align:middle line:10%
more options to choose
from in the future.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:13.950 align:middle line:10%
And your TV set is going to
be your computer combined

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:14.850 align:middle line:10%
with television.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:16.450 align:middle line:10%
It's going to be
television and computer.

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:17.450 align:middle line:10%
You'll be able to order.

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:21.090 align:middle line:10%
You'll be able to do everything
with your television set.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:23.070 align:middle line:10%
And far as the
internet is concerned,

00:42:23.070 --> 00:42:27.190 align:middle line:10%
you don't have a separate
computer for your internet

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:28.800 align:middle line:10%
and a TV for TV.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.900 align:middle line:10%
It'll be combined.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.320 align:middle line:10%
>> Sounds so futuristic.

00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:33.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, it is now,
but it won't later.

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.780 align:middle line:10%
It'll be a common thing.

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.338 align:middle line:10%
It'll be-- you know,
Dustin, this little fellow,

00:42:39.338 --> 00:42:40.380 align:middle line:10%
he's eight years old now.

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.630 align:middle line:10%
Nine years, maybe.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:49.770 align:middle line:10%
He said, Grandpa, what
if 1,000 years ago--

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:52.245 align:middle line:10%
1,000 years ago, we
are what we are now?

00:42:52.245 --> 00:42:53.760 align:middle line:10%
He said, what would
it be like now?

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.520 align:middle line:10%
I said, wow.

00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.360 align:middle line:10%
Far as I can look
at that, Dustin,

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:03.090 align:middle line:10%
we could probably fly
without airplanes.

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.370 align:middle line:84%
We could appear in
places, you know?

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.620 align:middle line:84%
We could be like
Jesus, you know?

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:09.660 align:middle line:90%
We'd be so enlightened.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.330 align:middle line:10%
We could appear in places.

00:43:12.330 --> 00:43:15.940 align:middle line:10%

be talking about you.

00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:26.770 align:middle line:84%
What do you think people
will be saying about you?

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.570 align:middle line:90%
What do you hope--

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:28.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:28.980 align:middle line:90%
I don't, really.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.940 align:middle line:90%

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.820 align:middle line:90%
Think about that.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:34.620 align:middle line:90%
Think about it.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, you know, I guess I do.

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.390 align:middle line:84%
I want them to say
something nice about me.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:40.390 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:44.340 align:middle line:84%
But if they say something
bad about me, that's OK too.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:45.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't think about that.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.962 align:middle line:84%
Very few people go through life
without having someone to think

00:43:49.962 --> 00:43:51.170 align:middle line:90%
some bad thoughts about them.

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:56.670 align:middle line:84%
Because you know, sometimes we
lay off people at the company

00:43:56.670 --> 00:44:01.560 align:middle line:84%
because they aren't
performing, and they can

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.060 align:middle line:90%
have some hate in that respect.

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:09.600 align:middle line:84%
But we want to teach them not to
hate, because that hurts them.

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.780 align:middle line:10%
If you hate someone--

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.142 align:middle line:10%
you know, when I talk to
the employees sometimes,

00:44:16.142 --> 00:44:17.850 align:middle line:10%
before I got sick, I
was talking to them.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:20.280 align:middle line:84%
Every group that came
in was a new group

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.748 align:middle line:84%
of people working
for our company.

00:44:22.748 --> 00:44:25.040 align:middle line:84%
I would talk to them, and I
would ask them all, I said,

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.180 align:middle line:84%
is there anyone in
your life that you

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.090 align:middle line:90%
don't like just a little bit?

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:34.260 align:middle line:84%
You know, 60% of
their hands go up.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:35.550 align:middle line:90%
I said, wow.

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:37.110 align:middle line:90%
I said, really?

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:39.600 align:middle line:84%
I says, I want to tell
you how to fix that.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:45.670 align:middle line:84%
I says, in your own mind,
just send them love.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:47.140 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to write.

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.610 align:middle line:90%
You don't have to call.

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:52.120 align:middle line:84%
In your own mind,
just send them love.

00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.380 align:middle line:90%
And guess what?

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:54.910 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel better.

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:57.160 align:middle line:90%
You'll feel better.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.620 align:middle line:90%
You just send them love.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:01.180 align:middle line:90%

is a very big part--

00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:04.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you must forgive.

00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:middle line:90%
You must forgive.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.290 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:90%
And yeah.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:13.060 align:middle line:90%
It's very important to forgive.

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:14.120 align:middle line:90%
You can't function.

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:15.710 align:middle line:84%
You're going to
create your sickness.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.190 align:middle line:84%
You're going to create your
cancer if you don't forgive.

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:20.510 align:middle line:90%
You've got to get it out.

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:23.440 align:middle line:84%
You've got to let your body,
every cell in your body

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:28.010 align:middle line:84%
be in love with each
other and everybody else.

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And just-- you
don't judge people.

00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.040 align:middle line:84%
You don't judge
them because they've

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:38.467 align:middle line:84%
done something wrong last week
or last year or 20 years ago.

00:45:38.467 --> 00:45:39.550 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I don't judge you.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I see you as a
wonderful person right now.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:42.640 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.682 align:middle line:90%
And that's the way it is.

00:45:43.682 --> 00:45:46.840 align:middle line:84%
What you've done in
your past is immaterial.

00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.420 align:middle line:90%
I don't judge it.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:53.610 align:middle line:84%
I just see everybody's
great, wonderful.

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:56.030 align:middle line:10%
And what you should
do in life and when

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.890 align:middle line:10%
you're dealing with
all your employees,

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:02.100 align:middle line:10%
all of the people on this
Earth, look for the good

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:03.690 align:middle line:10%
in each one of them.

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:07.260 align:middle line:84%
No matter how bad they might
be, there's some good in them.

00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:11.290 align:middle line:90%
Go and complement that good.

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:13.980 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we'll grow.

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:18.360 align:middle line:84%
If you look for the bad and
you complain about that,

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:20.940 align:middle line:84%
then that's what's
going to grow.

00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So be careful what
you think about,

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.490 align:middle line:84%
because what you think
about is going to grow.

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:29.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's what you're
going to become.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.820 align:middle line:84%
So think good thoughts, kind
thoughts, loving thoughts.

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:36.650 align:middle line:90%
Detachment.

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:40.820 align:middle line:84%
All of these things makes
life really wonderful.

00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:41.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, good.
