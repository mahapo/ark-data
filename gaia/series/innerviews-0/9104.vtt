00:00:01.425 --> 00:00:04.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, I'm Chantal Westerman.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.480 align:middle line:84%
One of the best parts
of the wisdom workshops

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.710 align:middle line:84%
are the up close and
personal conversations

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.780 align:middle line:84%
with the leading
practitioners and authors

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.430 align:middle line:90%
in the holistic field.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.680 align:middle line:84%
This gives all of
us an opportunity

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.930 align:middle line:84%
to know these people
just a little bit better.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.935 align:middle line:84%
So join me as they share
their wisdom with us.

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:25.905 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:53.180 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.325 align:middle line:84%
What a pleasure it is for me
to sit down and talk with you.

00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:57.200 align:middle line:90%
>> This is wonderful.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Truly a pleasure.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.427 align:middle line:10%
I read your first
book, I believe,

00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:01.347 align:middle line:10%
it was the end of 1981.

00:01:01.347 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:10%
And I've been reading
them ever since.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.900 align:middle line:10%
You've published
probably 15 books, 16?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:90%
>> 17, can you imagine?

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.930 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't imagine.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.720 align:middle line:90%
>> 17 books.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.830 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that struck
me then and still strikes me

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:84%
today is how we have lost
our sense of tradition,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:90%
our sense of ritual.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.250 align:middle line:84%
>> We've lost it, and your books
always remind me that that is

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.340 align:middle line:90%
from whence we came.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.420 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
strikes me and struck me

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.330 align:middle line:84%
in your very first book,
right up to the most recent,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:84%
is that we have no
sense of our tradition,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.210 align:middle line:84%
or at least a very
small group of us

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.750 align:middle line:84%
recall tradition and
incorporate it into our lives.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.760 align:middle line:90%
Why do we do that?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:90%
Why have we lost that?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think there's
so many, many reasons.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
We have so many religions
and faiths in this country.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.380 align:middle line:10%
And I think you have
to talk about men

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:10%
have certain ceremonies
and rituals that they do.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.490 align:middle line:10%
The football games and so
forth are a ritual, in a way.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Women, however, have
lost their ceremonies

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.100 align:middle line:90%
and are regaining them.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.800 align:middle line:84%
When I began this work, in 1980,
I published "Medicine Woman."

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.840 align:middle line:90%
They thought I was a nurse.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.417 align:middle line:84%
They had never heard
of a medicine woman.

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>> A medicine woman.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:90%
Nurse.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Nurse, of course.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.100 align:middle line:90%
>> What hospital do you work at?

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And I had to explain that
there is much more to life

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.620 align:middle line:90%
than what we see.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.530 align:middle line:84%
And I started
talking about things

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.130 align:middle line:84%
that people wouldn't even
approach the subject like they

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:84%
do today, that how you
are in your body, how

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:84%
you are physically
is an example,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:84%
is a great voice expressing
how you are spiritually.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.703 align:middle line:84%
And if you ask someone how
are you in your body today,

00:03:03.703 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:90%
they have to think about it.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.850 align:middle line:84%
They don't understand
that the two relate.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.450 align:middle line:84%
And ceremony and ritual,
which I incidentally think

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.060 align:middle line:84%
are two different things--
ritual is something

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:90%
that you do by rote.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.900 align:middle line:84%
Ceremony is something that you
put something of yourself into,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:84%
so that every time you
perform it, it's different.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.380 align:middle line:84%
I have a ceremony, for
instance, that I do every day.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.990 align:middle line:84%
And I meditate a little bit, and
I just simply create a dialogue

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.680 align:middle line:90%
with my god, the Great Spirit.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not a Native
American woman,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.080 align:middle line:84%
but my teachers
have been Native.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.482 align:middle line:84%
And I have had the most
extraordinary lessons

00:03:42.482 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:84%
and teachings from these
women that I've prayed with.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they the same teachers?

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:84%
You've always been
with the same teachers?

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I have been with these
extraordinary 43 women from

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.620 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.860 align:middle line:84%
And Agnes Whistling Elk
and Ruby Plenty Chiefs

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.717 align:middle line:90%
are the two mentors in my life.

00:03:59.717 --> 00:04:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they are the
first names I remember.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're the ones that I
write about in "Medicine Woman"

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.440 align:middle line:90%
and "All The Way Through."

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.230 align:middle line:84%
This latest book, which is "The
Love and Power Journal," which

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.770 align:middle line:84%
is part of "The Love and Power"
book is kind of a how to book.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:84%
My publisher said, now Lynn,
you have to write something

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.660 align:middle line:90%
that everybody can understand.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.850 align:middle line:84%
So I wrote a book
called "Love and Power,"

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:90%
about our passion in our lives.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Which was very easily
understood, I thought.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And of course, my
passion has been immense.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.950 align:middle line:84%
The immensity of thought,
of this incredible belief

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.260 align:middle line:84%
in something that is greater
than ourselves, somehow.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.800 align:middle line:84%
And yet, we're the sum
of its parts, in a way.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:90%
All of us create our reality.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.570 align:middle line:84%
And this wonderful
passion that we have

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.100 align:middle line:84%
has to be balanced with
the work that we do.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.750 align:middle line:10%
And I think you understand
that as well as anyone,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:10%
that there's a passion
in your life for what

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.390 align:middle line:10%
is the meaning of this life.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:10%
And yet you need
to make a living.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.180 align:middle line:10%
You want to be busy.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.940 align:middle line:10%
You want to be making a
difference in the world.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.230 align:middle line:10%
How do you do those two things
and not lose one for the other?

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.870 align:middle line:84%
How do you go to work every
day as a lawyer, in IBM,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.910 align:middle line:84%
or some big corporation
and not lose your soul?

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> How?

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a big order.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Well, I think that you can
bring your spirituality,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:84%
and your character, and your
integrity in a spiritual way

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.400 align:middle line:90%
into the workplace.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.400 align:middle line:90%
I think you can do that.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.240 align:middle line:84%
And I think you can
do that by becoming

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.120 align:middle line:84%
more intimate in a thoughtful
way with the people

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.920 align:middle line:90%
that work with you.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.230 align:middle line:84%
After all, everybody's
feeling the same.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.050 align:middle line:84%
I have found that with
working with thousands

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:84%
of people in the world that
everybody has the same fear.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.750 align:middle line:90%
We all have a fear of death.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Heaven knows we don't want to
talk about death, because we're

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.380 align:middle line:84%
afraid of dying more
than we are death.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.230 align:middle line:84%
But everyone has
the fears of being

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.950 align:middle line:84%
fired, of not being
able to survive,

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
of not being able to
express themselves

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:84%
in the world in
a meaningful way.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.807 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has fears,
terrors about moving

00:06:16.807 --> 00:06:18.390 align:middle line:84%
into the new millennium,
for instance.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:22.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody I talk to seems
to have fears about this sort

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.895 align:middle line:90%
of thing.

00:06:23.895 --> 00:06:28.120 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a perfect example,
but how do you change that?

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.275 align:middle line:84%
How do you convey to a person,
well, find your own power?

00:06:33.275 --> 00:06:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Because you're right.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Most people say, oh, I
had a terrible night.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.827 align:middle line:84%
My dog ran away, and my
boyfriend and I had a fight.

00:06:38.827 --> 00:06:41.160 align:middle line:84%
It's easier said than done,
I think, is what I'm saying.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.702 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a way
of communicating.

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:45.030 align:middle line:84%
We have learned to
communicate in that way,

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.770 align:middle line:84%
and that then leads us
to a deeper conversation.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.960 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is the deeper
conversation never happens.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So to talk about
that is one thing.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
To do something about
it is something else.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.890 align:middle line:90%
>> So what do we do?

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.720 align:middle line:84%
>> All of my books are about
finding those lessons within

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.870 align:middle line:84%
yourself that help you
find your true self.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:90%
How do you do that?

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:84%
I've written 17
books about that.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.250 align:middle line:84%
It's hard to put
it in one sentence.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.840 align:middle line:84%
>> But "Low and
Power" talks about it.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.210 align:middle line:84%
It's about balance, and
then it's about mastery.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.630 align:middle line:84%
You can have a technique
that is magnificent.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.770 align:middle line:84%
You can learn the technique
of, let's say, a computer.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.000 align:middle line:84%
But losing your
soul to that means

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.950 align:middle line:84%
that you've lost your
passion and your love

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.730 align:middle line:84%
for it, because the technique
takes so much of you

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.110 align:middle line:90%
that you have no life left.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Let me ask you this.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.540 align:middle line:84%
When you find your
true self, hopefully,

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.690 align:middle line:84%
through your amazing
books, which quite frankly,

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.838 align:middle line:90%
millions of people have--

00:07:46.838 --> 00:07:48.255 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you a
little commercial.

00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:49.055 align:middle line:90%
It's true.

00:07:49.055 --> 00:07:51.540 align:middle line:84%
People find themselves
through your work.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.990 align:middle line:84%
When you find your
true self, do you

00:07:54.990 --> 00:08:00.540 align:middle line:84%
find that the people around you
who haven't are drawn to it?

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.830 align:middle line:90%
They want what you have?

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:04.350 align:middle line:84%
Is that part of the healing
process in America, today?

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.770 align:middle line:90%
>> I think so.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
Or they're driven away, because
you provide a mirror that they

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.740 align:middle line:90%
can't bear to look in.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.380 align:middle line:84%
And they look at you, and
they're frightened by you,

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.060 align:middle line:84%
or they're put off
because they see

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.490 align:middle line:90%
that you've been doing work--

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> --that they have
not been doing.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.000 align:middle line:90%
So what did I do about that?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.030 align:middle line:84%
I saw that all over the place,
everywhere I went in the world.

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I
better start a school,

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.970 align:middle line:84%
where people, if
they choose to, can

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.630 align:middle line:84%
go very deeply into
the kinds of things

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:35.820 align:middle line:90%
that are so hard to deal with.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.299 align:middle line:84%
You realize, Chantal, a
lot of people in this world

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.120 align:middle line:90%
would rather die than change.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:10%
They get a disease, and diseases
come for lots of reasons.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.280 align:middle line:90%
There are genetics.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:90%
There are biological reasons.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.500 align:middle line:84%
There are reasons
in your environment,

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
but for the most part, we have
a final teacher in our lives.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.290 align:middle line:90%
And that's our body.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.900 align:middle line:84%
And the body says, I
see that you're not

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.760 align:middle line:84%
going to deal with
your problems,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:84%
therefore, I'm going to teach
you, in a symbolic sense.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And you produce a
disease in your life.

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:16.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, when you produce a
life threatening disease,

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:17.910 align:middle line:90%
you've got to look at yourself.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
You've got to look at the
way that you're living.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.520 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that we don't
know where to go for that.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:26.280 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just saying that
I dedicated my life,

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.050 align:middle line:84%
as many, many wonderful people
have these days, to producing

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:84%
a school, for instance,
called the Lynn Andrews

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.410 align:middle line:84%
School for Sacred Arts
and Creative Living.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And it deals with aesthetics
that we've lost in our lives.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Where is your school?

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a correspondence school,
because I realized that we

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:51.000 align:middle line:84%
needed discipline to our own
self-discipline to create

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.575 align:middle line:84%
the mirrors that
you need to grow.

00:09:52.575 --> 00:09:53.375 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And part of
discipline is writing.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Writing, it's artwork.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.570 align:middle line:90%
It's aesthetic things.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.370 align:middle line:90%
You take a drum.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.487 align:middle line:90%
You take your tools.

00:10:00.487 --> 00:10:02.070 align:middle line:84%
If you're going to
be a healer-- let's

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:03.880 align:middle line:84%
just say you want to make
a difference in the world,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:90%
but you don't know what to do.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.390 align:middle line:84%
You have no idea except that you
have this passion in your soul

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and in your heart, and
you're trying in every way.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.760 align:middle line:84%
You can't sit down and
tell people how to live.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.110 align:middle line:84%
It isn't going to
mean anything to them.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.440 align:middle line:90%
They've got to experience that.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the first things that
Agnes Whistling Elk ever

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:22.950 align:middle line:90%
told me--

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.010 align:middle line:84%
we were sitting in her cabin
in the north of Canada,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.980 align:middle line:84%
and the Aurora Borealis was
outside all over the sky,

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:30.810 align:middle line:90%
like curtains of light.

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And we were sitting there
in this amazing place,

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
and I'm thinking,
what am I doing here?

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.270 align:middle line:10%
And she looked at me with
this old, wonderful face--

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.140 align:middle line:10%
this great elder person--

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.900 align:middle line:10%
and she said, Lynn,
in your world,

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:10%
you live on borrowed knowledge.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.930 align:middle line:10%
And I said, what do you mean?

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.980 align:middle line:10%
And she said, you sit
there listening to people

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.360 align:middle line:10%
tell you about their dreams.

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:58.450 align:middle line:84%
But how do you make that
dream part of your life?

00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Good question.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:04.430 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that at that
moment she was my teacher.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.240 align:middle line:84%
And she began to teach
me through experience.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.270 align:middle line:84%
And of course, all my books
are about the experiences

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:13.730 align:middle line:84%
that they've taken me
through in Australia,

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:19.020 align:middle line:84%
in Central America, in Tibet,
and Nepal, and so forth.

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And it's the experience of life.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.236 align:middle line:90%
Experience the self.

00:11:24.236 --> 00:11:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's get into a topic
that may be a little dicey.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.920 align:middle line:84%
We may get some letters,
but let's be bold here.

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Why does it seem to me that
this quest for knowledge

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:84%
and this thirst for
knowledge we find

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.250 align:middle line:90%
much more among women than men?

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.916 align:middle line:84%
Now, guys, I'm not saying
guys don't do this.

00:11:47.916 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>> They do.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Because they do.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.360 align:middle line:90%
>> But it's different.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.610 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we have two different
lessons in this life,

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:54.410 align:middle line:90%
I believe.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.207 align:middle line:90%
It's been my experience.

00:11:56.207 --> 00:11:57.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't ask you to believe this.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:84%
It's just been my experience,
and I'll tell you what it is.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:04.400 align:middle line:84%
I think that this Earth is
truly a female sort of energy.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And a scientist will say what
in the world do you mean.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.220 align:middle line:84%
I think the women
relate to the earth.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.970 align:middle line:84%
I think women not
going out and working

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:84%
in the past several hundreds
of years, thousands of years,

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.910 align:middle line:84%
have probably had
the opportunity

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.940 align:middle line:84%
to protect their inner
life a little more.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:25.370 align:middle line:84%
Men, on the other hand, have
had to go out right away.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:26.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.047 align:middle line:84%
>> They've had to go out
and make their mark in life.

00:12:30.047 --> 00:12:31.130 align:middle line:90%
They've had to make money.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:36.740 align:middle line:84%
They've had to deal with those
incredibly difficult problems.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.650 align:middle line:84%
Women have not had to
do that until lately.

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:42.100 align:middle line:84%
Now, we're getting heart
attacks just like men.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure, stress--

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>> We are developing the same
diseases of stress that men

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:47.240 align:middle line:90%
have had.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that
women in the world

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.320 align:middle line:84%
are very different
than men in the world.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.243 align:middle line:90%
We have different problems--

00:12:53.243 --> 00:12:54.410 align:middle line:90%
a different set of problems.

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.470 align:middle line:84%
I think women are still
deeper in the sense

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.800 align:middle line:90%
of their own intuition, perhaps.

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.840 align:middle line:84%
I think the dark
side of the soul--

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.070 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book
called "Dark Sister."

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And what that was
about was someone

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:10.910 align:middle line:84%
who had been seduced by the
darkness, by a dark sorcerer.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Now, to me, darkness is not
only that kind of an energy,

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.940 align:middle line:84%
but it is also the
unexpressed intuitional sides

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.150 align:middle line:90%
of our nature.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:84%
In other words, if you
have impulses, emotions

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.490 align:middle line:84%
that you don't express
because of the kind of society

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:34.430 align:middle line:84%
that we live in, you
are going to develop

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.535 align:middle line:90%
a dark side of some kind.

00:13:37.535 --> 00:13:40.385 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:44.660 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:48.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you not find,
though, more and more,

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:10%
that the things that
we used to say--

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:56.810 align:middle line:10%
that's woo woo-- are
very, very modern, today.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Very mainstream.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Very mainstream.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:03.200 align:middle line:10%
>> But you'll notice that when
people are speaking mainstream,

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:10%
there are a few artists today
that are very mainstream that

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.730 align:middle line:10%
are talking about healing
the body with the mind.

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:16.370 align:middle line:10%
They are very, very tutored
and careful to use languaging

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.080 align:middle line:10%
that is acceptable to anybody.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.820 align:middle line:84%
They don't get into
auras and energy fields.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:24.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yet.

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:25.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet.

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:28.430 align:middle line:84%
They're talking about
it, and they're very much

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.700 align:middle line:90%
involved in it.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.500 align:middle line:84%
But what they are
saying to you or to me

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:84%
is hold your thought
patterns in a certain way.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.670 align:middle line:84%
Don't think that you can
live with negative thoughts

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.100 align:middle line:84%
and not have it
affect your body.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.570 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a different
way of expressing it.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:50.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I think of you, as do so
many other people in this world,

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.780 align:middle line:90%
as a pioneer in this field.

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.480 align:middle line:84%
Being a pioneer
in this field, I'd

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.280 align:middle line:84%
be very interested to know
the changes that you have seen

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.790 align:middle line:84%
in the way society looks
at your kind of work,

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:08.360 align:middle line:84%
in the way women have
changed and are changing.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.660 align:middle line:84%
What do you look at
today and you say, boy,

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.480 align:middle line:84%
they weren't doing
that back then?

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, we never
talked about spirituality.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.220 align:middle line:84%
It was the one thing that
drove me out of Beverly Hills

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.740 align:middle line:84%
and into the vast
wilderness of Canada.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Why would I leave
the life that I

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:29.090 align:middle line:84%
was leading to go work with
two very elder native women?

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Everybody forgets
that they're elders.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:32.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I remember.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.238 align:middle line:90%
People thought you were nuts.

00:15:33.238 --> 00:15:34.597 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, they did.

00:15:34.597 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:90%
>> People thought you were nuts.

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you doing?

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.920 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:84%
And I would say because there
is more life than what we're

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.360 align:middle line:84%
doing right now, than going and
get our getting our hair done

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and talking about the next
movie that's coming down,

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.730 align:middle line:90%
and so forth and so on.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.990 align:middle line:90%
I mean, it's a wonderful life.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.540 align:middle line:84%
There's nothing wrong with
the life I was leading.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.600 align:middle line:84%
I, just for me, had
a destiny that I

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.470 align:middle line:90%
felt I had to understand.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>> And if I may point out that
the same people who said, boy,

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.050 align:middle line:84%
Lynn, you are crazy, are
the people today who want

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.460 align:middle line:90%
the quality that you have.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, they do.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.750 align:middle line:84%
And the wonderful,
wonderful thing about that

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:84%
is that they're willing
to do the work that it

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:19.370 align:middle line:90%
takes to change.

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:22.400 align:middle line:84%
I think what happens
is that we think we

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.110 align:middle line:90%
can get instant enlightenment.

00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:84%
We can go to a seminar
or two and learn

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.430 align:middle line:84%
what it takes to
become a quote unquote

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.730 align:middle line:84%
"enlightened woman,"
which is a much

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.920 align:middle line:90%
misused word, incidentally.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:84%
In English, we
don't have the words

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.700 align:middle line:84%
to talk about the transformation
into spiritual life.

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
In the native
languages, they all

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:47.900 align:middle line:84%
talk about it
constantly, because it's

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.090 align:middle line:90%
part of their whole life.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:55.520 align:middle line:84%
We go to church on Sunday
to have our little ceremony.

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.990 align:middle line:84%
We don't have spirituality
that is part of every waking

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.280 align:middle line:90%
moment of our life.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I think you're right.

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.540 align:middle line:84%
We are talking more about
spirituality these days

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:08.270 align:middle line:84%
in circles where you would have
never thought you would hear.

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.339 align:middle line:84%
>> How does that manifest
in change, in people,

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:15.020 align:middle line:90%
in the workplace, in public?

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:90%
How are we, as a--

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:21.240 align:middle line:84%
dare I say something as lofty
as "as a nation," as a country,

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.859 align:middle line:90%
how are we changing?

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:23.860 align:middle line:90%
How do you see it?

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.359 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're changing
our mirrors for one thing.

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:32.660 align:middle line:84%
We are, as women, certainly
daring to create acts of power

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.860 align:middle line:90%
in our life.

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:38.450 align:middle line:84%
I learned very early on that
you have to find the teacher

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.830 align:middle line:90%
inside of you.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:42.470 align:middle line:84%
And you can find that teacher,
because you've already

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:43.760 align:middle line:90%
got the knowledge.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:45.990 align:middle line:84%
You just have got
to open up to it.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:47.660 align:middle line:84%
Somebody inside of
you has been trying

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:90%
to talk to you your whole life.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
what we found.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.080 align:middle line:84%
We have found that in
speaking to each other,

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
listening to seminars, reading
books that are truly written

00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:00.200 align:middle line:84%
with consciousness-- you can
tell the difference between

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual book that has no
consciousness whatsoever--

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.380 align:middle line:90%
it's kind of a how-to book--

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:09.885 align:middle line:84%
as compared to something that
is written from an experience

00:18:09.885 --> 00:18:10.760 align:middle line:90%
that someone has had.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:84%
I really think there's
a vast difference.

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:13.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, there is.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And one's more academic,
and one is more of the heart.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And when people are
speaking from their hearts,

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.070 align:middle line:84%
you're going to learn something
in the workplace, everywhere.

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And we are.

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:25.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.350 align:middle line:84%
People are expressing
themselves,

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:32.190 align:middle line:84%
and they're talking about things
that make their work better.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.990 align:middle line:84%
It's not a bad thing to
talk about spirituality.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:84%
I think before, we
were very enamored

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.910 align:middle line:90%
with organized religions.

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We were very careful not to
step past those boundaries.

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:47.340 align:middle line:84%
And I think now,
even the churches

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:52.050 align:middle line:84%
are opening to different
kinds of ceremonies,

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:56.070 align:middle line:84%
allowing maybe a woman to
preach as well as a man,

00:18:56.070 --> 00:19:00.270 align:middle line:84%
realizing that the spirituality
comes through everyone

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.090 align:middle line:90%
in different ways.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.800 align:middle line:84%
When I first began this
work, first of all,

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.140 align:middle line:84%
I was a woman,
which was a no-no.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So a woman putting her
head above the crowd

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.410 align:middle line:84%
was the most
difficult experience.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:15.840 align:middle line:84%
Had they warned me
about that, I don't

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.310 align:middle line:90%
know if I would have done it.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.740 align:middle line:84%
>> It makes me happy that
they didn't warn you,

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:84%
because you have set
a standard for us.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:25.590 align:middle line:10%
>> But everybody, I mean
ex-boyfriends, so forth,

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:29.250 align:middle line:10%
took pot shots at me, tried
to destroy me, literally.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.770 align:middle line:84%
And I have seen it
throughout history.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Women writers in
particular, but people

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:41.010 align:middle line:84%
who try to become powerful in
a way that is freeing for not

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:43.320 align:middle line:90%
only other women, but for men--

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.950 align:middle line:84%
look at the difference if
a woman has her freedom

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.580 align:middle line:84%
and works hard in the
world at what she loves.

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:54.720 align:middle line:84%
It allows a man to have all
the freedom in the world,

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.170 align:middle line:84%
because there aren't all these
people dependent upon him,

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:84%
pulling him down, and making
him fit into a little groove

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:04.710 align:middle line:90%
that maybe he's not enjoying.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:10.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that all of this
spiritual freedom, I guess,

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:13.200 align:middle line:84%
for want of a better
way of explaining it,

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.160 align:middle line:90%
has helped everybody.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.660 align:middle line:84%
I think it's helped
men, it's helped

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.880 align:middle line:84%
women find a way
of living that is

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:24.300 align:middle line:84%
more expressive and
certainly happier, more

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:90%
fulfilling in some way.

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.910 align:middle line:84%
I think before, people
were so stressed,

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.960 align:middle line:84%
and so unhappy, and so
separated from one another.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:39.480 align:middle line:84%
As this movement seems to go
forward, people are sharing.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.880 align:middle line:84%
They're friends
before they even meet,

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.255 align:middle line:84%
because they realize that we're
all part of the same fabric.

00:20:45.255 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we are.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:84%
I think you just coined a
new term, spiritual freedom.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a word I will use, and
I will give you full credit.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Thank you so much for
visiting with me, today.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:57.930 align:middle line:90%
I just love talking to you.

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.630 align:middle line:84%
>> It is such a pleasure,
and thank you for giving us

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:middle line:90%
a chance to do that.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.979 align:middle line:90%


00:21:04.979 --> 00:21:07.364 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:21:07.364 --> 00:21:11.660 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.120 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is a wheel
for healing hatred.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:10%
I'm not saying that this is you.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:20.300 align:middle line:90%


00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:25.400 align:middle line:10%
This is a wheel for healing
self, and healing self-hatred,

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.555 align:middle line:10%
and hatred in the world.

00:21:27.555 --> 00:21:29.180 align:middle line:10%
But you have to always
start with self.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.760 align:middle line:84%
You always have to
start with home.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.900 align:middle line:90%
Isn't that the truth?

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:10%
So what you do is you sit-in
the center of the wheel,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.340 align:middle line:10%
and you face the south.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:45.020 align:middle line:10%
And the south is always
physicalness or substance.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.690 align:middle line:10%
If you were going to
transform this wheel

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:51.470 align:middle line:10%
into a wheel for whatever
your endeavor is in life

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:54.685 align:middle line:10%
or for healing yourself,
you would sit in the center.

00:21:54.685 --> 00:21:56.060 align:middle line:10%
You would look
towards the south,

00:21:56.060 --> 00:21:58.580 align:middle line:10%
towards your physicalness.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:03.410 align:middle line:10%
What do I physically
feel about a situation?

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.580 align:middle line:10%
Maybe you're looking
at a new job.

00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:09.303 align:middle line:10%
What do I physically feel
about taking this new job?

00:22:09.303 --> 00:22:10.220 align:middle line:10%
What does it do to me?

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.600 align:middle line:10%
How is it going to
affect my physicalness?

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.400 align:middle line:10%
Am I ready?

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.260 align:middle line:10%
Have I done my homework?

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.870 align:middle line:10%
Am I prepared physically?

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:22.310 align:middle line:10%
For the wheel of
hatred, however,

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:25.640 align:middle line:10%
a person who is in
hatred physically

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.360 align:middle line:10%
feels like an outsider.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.700 align:middle line:10%
Enlightenment only happens
in movement from north

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:38.300 align:middle line:10%
to south, south to north.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:43.010 align:middle line:10%
But most people live in
east-west, west-east--

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:10%
what I think about
what you feel,

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.640 align:middle line:10%
what I feel about
what you think.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And they meet in the
physical less and less,

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.060 align:middle line:90%
and they make love.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.120 align:middle line:84%
Then they take out the garbage,
and they pay the bills.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:56.600 align:middle line:90%
What's left out of that circle?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Spirit.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:00.970 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.390 align:middle line:10%
If your relationship
is wobbling,

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:10%
that's probably what
is happening, if you

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.010 align:middle line:10%
will look at it carefully.

00:23:09.010 --> 00:23:14.690 align:middle line:10%
So you want to look at how to
bring spirit into your life.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:18.730 align:middle line:10%
How many times do you
go out in nature a day?
