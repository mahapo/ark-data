00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.170 align:middle line:90%
I'm Chantal Westerman.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.460 align:middle line:84%
One of the best parts of
"The Wisdom Workshops"

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.700 align:middle line:84%
are the up close and
personal conversations

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.800 align:middle line:84%
with the leading
practitioners and authors

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.420 align:middle line:90%
in the holistic field.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.700 align:middle line:84%
This gives all of
us an opportunity

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.920 align:middle line:84%
to know these people
just a little bit better.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.446 align:middle line:84%
So join me as they share
their wisdom with us.

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:23.911 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:50.550 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.520 align:middle line:10%
Nick, having read both your
books, particularly your most

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.720 align:middle line:10%
recent one, "In God's
Truth," it occurs to me

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.750 align:middle line:10%
that the messages of, I guess
it would be 2,000 years ago,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.930 align:middle line:10%
are the same messages
that we're hearing today.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.870 align:middle line:90%
Is that true?

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.330 align:middle line:90%
>> That is true.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.170 align:middle line:84%
In my case, that's a
commitment I've made.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.380 align:middle line:10%
In the 4th century AD the
messages of Jesus and Paul

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.550 align:middle line:10%
of 2,000 years ago
were distorted.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.280 align:middle line:10%
Messages of love were
changed to messages of fear.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.083 align:middle line:10%
Messages of compassion were
changed to messages of guilt.

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And messages that were
supposed to bring us together

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.505 align:middle line:84%
in brotherly and sisterly
love, [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:84%
were unfortunately changed,
which, in many cases,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.390 align:middle line:84%
polarized people, and created
prejudice and bigotry.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.000 align:middle line:84%
And today we're bringing
those messages back again.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:90%
>> What is it that allowed us?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, gratefully,
they're back.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.810 align:middle line:84%
Because compassion and love
are so universally important.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.942 align:middle line:90%
>> But what changed?

00:01:46.942 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
What is changing, I should
say, because I don't

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.150 align:middle line:90%
think it's changed completely.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.720 align:middle line:90%
But there's a shift.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.642 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe there's a spiritual
consciousness that is spreading

00:01:54.642 --> 00:01:56.100 align:middle line:84%
throughout the
United States today,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.690 align:middle line:84%
as well as the
rest of the world,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.210 align:middle line:84%
like never before in
the history of mankind.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are the gateways
to our hearts and soul.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
And more and more people
have opened up those gates,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.460 align:middle line:84%
allowing information to come
into the hearts and souls

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.040 align:middle line:84%
that four or five years ago
they couldn't have done.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.870 align:middle line:84%
>> "The Messengers"
was wildly successful.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.250 align:middle line:84%
If you had written that book,
let's say, 10 years ago, would

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.620 align:middle line:90%
it have been as successful.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.160 align:middle line:90%
Not even five years ago.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:84%
And you can just see this in the
makeup of the audiences, where

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.220 align:middle line:84%
six or seven years
ago the audience

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.932 align:middle line:90%
would almost all be female.

00:02:30.932 --> 00:02:33.390 align:middle line:84%
It would have been more what
we would describe as a new age

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.190 align:middle line:90%
audience.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.930 align:middle line:84%
But today it's a
cross-section of America.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.200 align:middle line:84%
We have people not only
of the different genders,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.060 align:middle line:84%
but from the different
walks of life.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.940 align:middle line:84%
I believe the bridge between
mainstream and new age

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.320 align:middle line:84%
is so small now that you
can't even distinguish it.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.900 align:middle line:84%
>> "In God's Truth" paints a
very interesting image of God.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.960 align:middle line:84%
Because we all tend to have
a particular image of him.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Kind of fire and brimstone
in some people's eyes.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.780 align:middle line:90%
>> You talk about who is God.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in
traditional religion,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.740 align:middle line:84%
coming from the Old Testament,
Isaiah described God

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.240 align:middle line:84%
as an elderly man with a white
beard, and long white hair,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.690 align:middle line:84%
with a gown, with a long
robe sitting on a throne.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.060 align:middle line:10%
But what if God
didn't have a beard?

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:10%
And what if God instead
had lipstick because God

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.330 align:middle line:10%
was a woman.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.250 align:middle line:10%
But in reality,
you can't see God.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:10%
We can only experience God.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.570 align:middle line:84%
We experience God in
the beautiful sunrises

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.800 align:middle line:84%
in the Phoenix
Valley, or the sunsets

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.620 align:middle line:84%
along the Western
shores of Hawaii,

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.160 align:middle line:84%
in the multicolored
beautiful faces

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.710 align:middle line:84%
of the people that walk along
the crowded streets of downtown

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.760 align:middle line:84%
New York, or London, or
Rome, or San Francisco.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So in reality, we only
can experience God.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And everything that we
feel and hear that's good,

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.200 align:middle line:84%
rather than actually
have an image

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:90%
of a physical person as God.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd love to hear you
speak more about the people

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.960 align:middle line:90%
at the Whole Life expos.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:84%
Because you could lecture
all over the place

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.010 align:middle line:90%
if you wanted to.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.270 align:middle line:90%
And yet, you're here.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And the audience here
is fascinated with you.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.900 align:middle line:84%
What do you get when you
come to Whole Life Expo?

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all, I think
it starts with the people who

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.160 align:middle line:84%
represent Whole Life
Expo, the staff.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's a genuine
love, and friendship,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.130 align:middle line:84%
and wanting to share the
spirituality that we all

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.470 align:middle line:84%
have inside of us with people
all around the country.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.850 align:middle line:10%
So this, to me,
is very important.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.510 align:middle line:10%
And I feel that when I'm working
with the Whole Life Expo.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.730 align:middle line:10%
And that's why I've chosen
Whole Life, as opposed

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:10%
to other expos.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:10%
But also the audiences.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.350 align:middle line:84%
The audiences truly
are an audience

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.507 align:middle line:84%
that are coming to
want to understand

00:04:39.507 --> 00:04:41.590 align:middle line:84%
their relationship with
God, as well as to enhance

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.828 align:middle line:90%
their own spirituality.

00:04:42.828 --> 00:04:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
commitment, I believe,

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.870 align:middle line:84%
that Whole Life Expo, as
well as myself has made.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to talk a little bit
about your creative process.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, I talked to you a long
time ago about "The Messengers."

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.667 align:middle line:84%
And it was fascinating,
because you were not

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:90%
writing it from your head.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.250 align:middle line:84%
It was somebody else speaking to
you, and through you, and even

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.870 align:middle line:90%
through your arms you wrote.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the same thing happen
with "In God's Truth?"

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.860 align:middle line:90%
It's interesting.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:84%
I wrote "In God's Truth"
in longhand with a pen.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:18.865 align:middle line:90%
>> You did?

00:05:18.865 --> 00:05:19.990 align:middle line:90%
How time consuming is that?

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I found that it was
totally different when I tried

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.390 align:middle line:84%
to dictate on a tape
machine, or on a computer.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.490 align:middle line:84%
I was getting totally
different information.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.350 align:middle line:10%
And I truly believed
that I could

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.320 align:middle line:10%
feel the energy changing with
every chapter I was writing.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.180 align:middle line:10%
And oftentimes, I wasn't
even aware of what

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.600 align:middle line:10%
I was going to write next.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.140 align:middle line:84%
And I'd find myself saying,
wow, did I write that?

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.160 align:middle line:90%
There's poetry in it.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.390 align:middle line:90%
And I'm not a poet.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.377 align:middle line:84%
And some of the poetry
is beautiful poetry.

00:05:42.377 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:84%
And I don't even
know when I wrote it.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.170 align:middle line:84%
I found it in a drawer with my
handwriting on a piece of paper

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
with my pen and didn't
have a date on it.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:84%
So I honestly believe that I
got a tremendous number of help

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.390 align:middle line:84%
from a number of
different co-authors

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:55.570 align:middle line:90%
in different chapters.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.997 align:middle line:10%
>> So then it wasn't a
situation where you would get up

00:05:57.997 --> 00:06:00.080 align:middle line:10%
in the morning, and have
a cup of coffee, and say,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to write
from 9:00 to 1:00?

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.340 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.950 align:middle line:84%
I found that I could
literally put myself

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.215 align:middle line:84%
in a position of
privacy, whether it

00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:13.680 align:middle line:84%
was in my home or my office,
and focus my attention,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.080 align:middle line:84%
and write an entire
chapter, almost

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.880 align:middle line:84%
without requiring any changes
within a period of 20,

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.010 align:middle line:90%
25 minutes.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.170 align:middle line:84%
>> And your publisher
wouldn't say, OK, Nick,

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:90%
this didn't work?

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.440 align:middle line:90%
This sentence.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.142 align:middle line:90%
It was just as it was?

00:06:25.142 --> 00:06:27.600 align:middle line:84%
>> There were no changes made
in publishing other than some

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.950 align:middle line:90%
grammar.

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.217 align:middle line:84%
But there were no changes as
far as the messages that we're

00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:34.050 align:middle line:84%
trying to convey or the
manner in which they

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:90%
were being conveyed.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you hear the beginnings
of other ideas rattling around

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:90%
in your head?

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Like when you complete a
book, when you completed

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.750 align:middle line:84%
"The Messengers,"
certainly there must

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.175 align:middle line:84%
have been something that
said, there's more to tell.

00:06:50.175 --> 00:06:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> It's true that when
I finished writing "In

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.990 align:middle line:84%
God's Truth," there were still
some additional things I wanted

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.220 align:middle line:90%
to say.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:84%
But what I got, literally,
was the message from spirit,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.620 align:middle line:90%
saying, no, Nick.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:02.440 align:middle line:90%
Not now.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.263 align:middle line:84%
There are some
incredible experiences

00:07:04.263 --> 00:07:06.180 align:middle line:84%
you're going to have
over the next few months.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And wait til you've
had those experiences.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.053 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll know you're
ready to write another book.

00:07:10.053 --> 00:07:13.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So often I think
not the answers,

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:18.670 align:middle line:84%
but the questions are what tell
us a great deal about people

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.470 align:middle line:90%
these days.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.380 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious as to the
questions that people ask you,

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.680 align:middle line:90%
like after you lecture.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:90%
What do people want to know?

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing that I found--
and I didn't anticipate this.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.618 align:middle line:10%
I did not realize this when
I first made the commitment

00:07:36.618 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:10%
to cross that threshold
and do what I'm doing now

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.840 align:middle line:10%
my life is the tremendous
number of people

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.330 align:middle line:10%
who are searching
for and understanding

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.640 align:middle line:10%
their relationship with
God who at one time

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.510 align:middle line:10%
were involved in a religion
and fell out of their religion

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:10%
because they could not take, any
longer, perhaps the punishing

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:01.730 align:middle line:10%
God perspective, a place
called hell, guilt and sin.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.980 align:middle line:84%
And what I find, many people
come up to me afterwards.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Or we receive over
200 letters a week

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
in our office saying, thank
you for bringing me back

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:11.552 align:middle line:84%
to a relationship with
God because of one

00:08:11.552 --> 00:08:14.010 align:middle line:84%
that they had lost earlier in
their life because of the way

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.490 align:middle line:90%
God was being presented to them.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Had you had a relationship
with God and then lost

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:26.650 align:middle line:10%
a relationship at any point in
your life, like in your youth?

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:32.553 align:middle line:84%
I'm curious as to your path,
how you found your way here.

00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84%
>> I went through a very
long period of time where I

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.640 align:middle line:90%
didn't have religion.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.988 align:middle line:10%
And I still don't have one now.

00:08:38.988 --> 00:08:41.530 align:middle line:10%
But what I always had in my life
was a spiritual relationship

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.520 align:middle line:10%
with God.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:10%
And there was a time when I
literally asked my guides, what

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.820 align:middle line:10%
I call the messengers of God,
how come you've chosen me

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.620 align:middle line:10%
for my mission.

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:52.030 align:middle line:90%
I don't even have a religion.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:84%
And their response was,
well, Nick, what religion

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:54.663 align:middle line:90%
do you think God is?

00:08:54.663 --> 00:08:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Do you think God is a
Mennonite, a Quaker, a Mormon?

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.200 align:middle line:84%
God doesn't have
a religion either,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:84%
but embraces all
of his children,

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.310 align:middle line:84%
and gives all of his
children his love.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.950 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
something beyond religion.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.760 align:middle line:84%
If you think of religion as a
series of different buildings,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.710 align:middle line:90%
beyond religion is a thread.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.260 align:middle line:84%
There's threads that come out
of those buildings that connect

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:16.450 align:middle line:90%
them with your spirituality.

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you so much, Nick.

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Every time I talk to you
I have a greater insight

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.803 align:middle line:90%
into my life and my God.

00:09:23.803 --> 00:09:25.220 align:middle line:84%
So I thank you
very much for that.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.012 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I really
appreciate that, Chantal.

00:09:27.012 --> 00:09:29.135 align:middle line:84%
But I recognize, it's
not me that's important.

00:09:29.135 --> 00:09:31.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the messages that
you and I are sharing.

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:31.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.210 align:middle line:90%
That's so true.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:33.010 align:middle line:90%
Thanks, Nick.

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.835 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:09:35.835 --> 00:09:38.817 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:38.817 --> 00:09:43.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.320 align:middle line:84%
>> What a pleasure it is
for me to talk to you as one

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite
people in the world.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>> The feeling is mutual.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:55.890 align:middle line:10%
>> And how gracious you are
to come and speak with us just

00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:00.540 align:middle line:10%
before you are about to speak,
which is unusual for people.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.060 align:middle line:84%
So many people say,
not before I speak.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.470 align:middle line:84%
How do you feel before
you address a huge crowd?

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.385 align:middle line:90%
And your crowd here is huge.

00:10:07.385 --> 00:10:08.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I hope so.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:08.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:09.060 align:middle line:90%
It's big in Baltimore.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't normally do
anything before I speak either.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:84%
But anything called The
Wisdom Channel is just going

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.190 align:middle line:90%
to get me tuned into wisdom.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:21.180 align:middle line:10%
So how do I feel before I speak?

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.290 align:middle line:10%
I actually try to feel empty.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.682 align:middle line:10%
Because I don't
talk from my head.

00:10:28.682 --> 00:10:30.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't even actually
talk from my heart.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.550 align:middle line:84%
>> I empty out and let
something else come through me.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.760 align:middle line:90%
So I really try to--

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.760 align:middle line:84%
this sounds really
strange, but not prepare.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:90%
Now, this isn't 20 years ago.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:43.860 align:middle line:90%
But now.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.390 align:middle line:90%
Not prepare.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.280 align:middle line:90%
Not focus on it.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.750 align:middle line:84%
To just get in a very
open, receptive space

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.510 align:middle line:84%
so I can get out
of the way, and let

00:10:54.510 --> 00:11:00.590 align:middle line:84%
myself develop a spontaneous
relationship with the audience,

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:02.880 align:middle line:90%
and with wisdom.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.595 align:middle line:84%
And then be the link
between the two.

00:11:05.595 --> 00:11:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, here is something
that occurred to me.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.940 align:middle line:84%
When I look at
Whole Life Expos, I

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:20.670 align:middle line:84%
think of them as very
spiritual gathering places.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.480 align:middle line:84%
You are known all over
the world, not just

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.920 align:middle line:90%
the United States.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.160 align:middle line:84%
You are known all over the world
for your work in relationships.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.570 align:middle line:84%
Some people might say,
the two don't connect.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:90%
But I bet you disagree.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle line:90%
Spirituality and relationships.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's
actually very ironic.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.400 align:middle line:84%
My personal growth work
started when I was 18

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.470 align:middle line:84%
and I became a
meditation teacher.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:50.370 align:middle line:10%
And until I was 30, and I
wasn't doing this career,

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:10%
I was teaching meditation.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.120 align:middle line:10%
That was my beginning.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.050 align:middle line:90%
These were my roots.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:84%
I was doing like the first
Whole Life Expos back in God

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.540 align:middle line:90%
knows when.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:00.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.673 align:middle line:90%
>> When they invented the wheel.

00:12:01.673 --> 00:12:08.100 align:middle line:84%
And then I happened to
write some books that

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:90%
became bestsellers.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.238 align:middle line:90%
And they were very commercial.

00:12:10.238 --> 00:12:12.030 align:middle line:84%
And the interesting
thing is, this was back

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.560 align:middle line:90%
in the early '80s.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I was
commercially successful

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.300 align:middle line:84%
the new age movement
decided I wasn't spiritual.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.570 align:middle line:84%
And I became very
commercially successful,

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.970 align:middle line:84%
and spoke to the
housewife in Nebraska,

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.410 align:middle line:84%
who didn't know any
new age phraseology,

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.860 align:middle line:84%
who didn't know what
the term new age meant,

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.690 align:middle line:90%
who was just a typical American.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And I found a way
to talk to her,

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.380 align:middle line:84%
to talk to the truck drivers, to
talk to the person who wouldn't

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.790 align:middle line:90%
go to a Whole Life Expo.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.590 align:middle line:90%
That was my purpose.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.570 align:middle line:84%
That was my, as they
say in the east, Dharma.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:50.070 align:middle line:84%
I got that at a
very early point,

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
that I had the ability
to take concepts

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.970 align:middle line:84%
that we might call spiritual,
and make them very, very

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.950 align:middle line:90%
colloquial.

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And so the challenge for me
has been to redefine myself

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:90%
again as who I really am.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.810 align:middle line:84%
And people will come up to
me or interview me and say

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.660 align:middle line:84%
things like, well,
gee, your latest book

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.770 align:middle line:90%
is kind of spiritual.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.050 align:middle line:90%
Did you just get into this?

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.675 align:middle line:84%
And I want to go,
don't you understand?

00:13:16.675 --> 00:13:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I've been doing
this since I was 18.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:84%
And so what's happened
in the last five

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:25.740 align:middle line:84%
years is now that the big
audience knows who I am,

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:28.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm able to bring them things
that I wasn't years ago.

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.960 align:middle line:84%
And my next book
coming out in September

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:36.330 align:middle line:84%
is, as I say, totally out
of the closet, spirituality

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:37.260 align:middle line:90%
off the deep end.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.420 align:middle line:90%
And my publisher is thrilled.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.060 align:middle line:84%
But I wouldn't have been able
to get that book published

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.700 align:middle line:90%
in a big way 10 years ago.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:90%
That just wasn't happening.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:50.160 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you account
for spirituality,

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.800 align:middle line:84%
and these kinds of discussions
now being so mainstream.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:59.712 align:middle line:84%
What have we done that
we finally have said,

00:13:59.712 --> 00:14:01.170 align:middle line:84%
you know what,
let's consider this.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's consider these
alternative options.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's a huge, huge
transformation that's been

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:08.680 align:middle line:90%
going on on the planet.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.305 align:middle line:84%
And it's been going
on for a long time.

00:14:10.305 --> 00:14:11.880 align:middle line:90%
And it started in the '60s.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And like anything, ideas start
with a core group of people

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.870 align:middle line:84%
who are, perhaps, more free,
more open, more courageous,

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:22.830 align:middle line:90%
and spread.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:25.608 align:middle line:84%
And as they reach people,
kind of like waves

00:14:25.608 --> 00:14:27.150 align:middle line:84%
when you drop
something in the water,

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.430 align:middle line:84%
eventually the waves
reach everything.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:34.290 align:middle line:84%
The ideas that perhaps were new
age in the '70s, little fringe

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.460 align:middle line:84%
in the '80s, now, again, you see
that same housewife in Nebraska

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.520 align:middle line:84%
reading a book about angels,
and reading about a medium,

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.180 align:middle line:84%
and doing Feng shui in her
house, and all kinds of things.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:51.490 align:middle line:84%
It's become pop culture, which
has its bad side as well.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's just a sign of the
evolution of the planet.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.100 align:middle line:90%
It was inevitable.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And like any growth
of consciousness,

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.140 align:middle line:90%
it starts in one place.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And eventually what was on the
edge, becomes in the center.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.540 align:middle line:84%
>> And beyond that, it seems
to me that we are in need

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:11.220 align:middle line:90%
of a healing.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.130 align:middle line:84%
We seem to be, a
lot of people, I

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.830 align:middle line:84%
don't know if I
should say in pain.

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:19.230 align:middle line:90%
>> We're out of balance.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:22.860 align:middle line:84%
We've been out of
balance for a long time.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.710 align:middle line:84%
We came out of society
post World War II,

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:29.880 align:middle line:84%
where people finally
thought, OK, now we

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.820 align:middle line:84%
can have the good life
that we couldn't have.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:90%
And the world is safe.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:90%
And so people began to acquire.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:37.650 align:middle line:90%
They began to accomplish.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:39.780 align:middle line:90%
You got the me generation.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.470 align:middle line:84%
You got the whole idea in the
'80s of acquiring more, better,

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:44.700 align:middle line:90%
bigger.

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:47.610 align:middle line:84%
And inevitably, as our
consciousness grows,

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:49.980 align:middle line:84%
you get enough, and you do
enough, and you have enough,

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and you realize that
it's not enough.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:90%
And it never will be enough.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.870 align:middle line:84%
And especially
people in their 30s,

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:59.820 align:middle line:84%
40s, even early 50s suddenly
began to say, is this it?

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:01.110 align:middle line:90%
Is this it?

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.290 align:middle line:90%
I have my house.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.090 align:middle line:90%
I have the car.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.580 align:middle line:90%
I had the relationship.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.940 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not happy.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.950 align:middle line:84%
And that's where that
search for the inside

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:11.310 align:middle line:84%
began in life, which I call
living from the inside out,

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:14.040 align:middle line:84%
realizing that it's not what's
outside that makes us happy.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.970 align:middle line:90%
It's what's on the inside.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And so we have been
very out of balance.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.132 align:middle line:84%
And there's a return
that's happening.

00:16:20.132 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's something
that's been predicted.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.640 align:middle line:90%
It's something that's exciting.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.530 align:middle line:84%
It's something
that's very healthy.

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:84%
>> And since this is
definitely your field,

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.230 align:middle line:84%
how does that manifest
in relationships?

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.470 align:middle line:84%
Of course, basically
I think relationships

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.548 align:middle line:84%
have been the same since
the beginning of time.

00:16:36.548 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:90%
But there's something shifting.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.930 align:middle line:84%
They're actually
very different now.

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:40.950 align:middle line:90%
>> They are.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:41.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:90%
Then that's interesting.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
>> My grandmother, my
great grandmother wanted

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.680 align:middle line:90%
a relationship for stability.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.870 align:middle line:84%
The role of women was
in the background,

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:84%
was to have children,
to support a man

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.110 align:middle line:90%
so he could support the family.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And so my grandmother,
great grandmother never

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.790 align:middle line:84%
would say to her
husband, you know,

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I don't really feel like
we're connecting lately.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:04.020 align:middle line:84%
Or I feel like your female
side isn't coming out.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:06.150 align:middle line:90%
Because she needed him there.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:07.599 align:middle line:90%
There was no birth control.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:09.810 align:middle line:90%
There was no job opportunity.

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:11.430 align:middle line:84%
For the first time
in the history

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:17.819 align:middle line:84%
of the world, which is really a
sobering thought, we want more.

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.390 align:middle line:90%
We want different.

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:20.230 align:middle line:90%
We want better.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.780 align:middle line:84%
We want relationships
that are not

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.440 align:middle line:84%
just there as a
social structure,

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.760 align:middle line:84%
but in which we can
grow as a human being,

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.319 align:middle line:90%
really evolve as a human being.

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:30.572 align:middle line:84%
That puts a tremendous
pressure on relationships.

00:17:30.572 --> 00:17:33.030 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I've been
talking about and writing about

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.720 align:middle line:84%
lately is the idea
that relationships

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.820 align:middle line:84%
aren't particularly
meant to last

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:84%
a lifetime if their purpose is
growth as opposed to stability.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.490 align:middle line:10%
See, if my purpose is to find
a husband, raise a family,

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:10%
have two cars in the garage.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.733 align:middle line:10%
>> That's stability.

00:17:49.733 --> 00:17:50.700 align:middle line:10%
>> That's stability.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.670 align:middle line:84%
If my purpose is to grow
as a woman, and to learn,

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.000 align:middle line:84%
perhaps the person I
meet at 20 isn't going

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.030 align:middle line:90%
to be my growth partner at 45.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And if that's OK
with me, that may

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:84%
look very different from
what my mother wanted

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.440 align:middle line:90%
in a relationship.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:09.930 align:middle line:84%
There's a lot of people
out there in society

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.030 align:middle line:84%
who are growing very,
very quickly, who've

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.830 align:middle line:84%
been working on
their consciousness,

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:84%
and are confused, because
their relationships

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:84%
are successful in that they
got them to a certain place.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:22.480 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
successful in the old way,

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.138 align:middle line:84%
which is that they
lasted until they died.

00:18:25.138 --> 00:18:27.180 align:middle line:84%
And so there's a lot of
people judging themselves

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.540 align:middle line:90%
for having growth relationships.

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And one thing I'm trying
to do is help people

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
understand that even
relationships now are going

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.420 align:middle line:90%
to look very, very different.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> You're so right.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:44.130 align:middle line:84%
Because people feel so guilty
when a relationship breaks up,

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.130 align:middle line:84%
when there's a separation,
when there's a divorce.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.210 align:middle line:90%
People are fraught with guilt.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:52.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a wonderful psychic
friend who I go to periodically

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:55.050 align:middle line:84%
to give me readings
about my life.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.820 align:middle line:90%
He's an amazing man.

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And I went to him
recently as I was

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
going through a period
of tremendous change,

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.033 align:middle line:90%
again, in my life.

00:19:03.033 --> 00:19:04.200 align:middle line:90%
Because we had this thought.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.283 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll get through my
changes and settle down.

00:19:06.283 --> 00:19:09.680 align:middle line:84%
And settling down is not a
really conscious concept.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.480 align:middle line:90%
Life.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.080 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the universe,
it never settles down.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.160 align:middle line:84%
Nature never settles
down and says,

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.010 align:middle line:84%
I think I'll skip the
seasons for two years.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything's always changing.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:84%
So we are always, if
we're in our natural mode,

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.700 align:middle line:84%
we are going to always change
if we have the courage to do it.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.750 align:middle line:84%
So I went to him going, my god,
everything's upheaved again.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:31.350 align:middle line:84%
And he said, Barbara, when
you came into this life,

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:34.690 align:middle line:84%
in the box that said, check
the kind of life you want,

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.330 align:middle line:90%
you didn't check stability.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:38.657 align:middle line:90%
You checked growth.

00:19:38.657 --> 00:19:40.240 align:middle line:84%
And I knew when he
said it that I had.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I had checked growth.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:84%
And growth and stability
are at odds with each other.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:84%
Because when there is
change, and growth is change,

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.690 align:middle line:90%
that means what was has to die.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:52.610 align:middle line:90%
It has to transform.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.410 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Your friends who aren't into
anything new age, everyone

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.683 align:middle line:84%
who's watching, may look
like they're happier.

00:19:58.683 --> 00:20:01.100 align:middle line:84%
You may even be embarrassed
to say to them, read this book

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:02.017 align:middle line:90%
or take this workshop.

00:20:02.017 --> 00:20:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Cause they're thinking, hey,
your life doesn't look too hot.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.080 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:10%
>> So we have to really
not judge ourselves by what

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.440 align:middle line:10%
our life looks like
on the outside,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.560 align:middle line:10%
but by what we're feeling
like, how we're growing,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.910 align:middle line:10%
how we're learning.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Am I becoming a more
loving human being?

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.230 align:middle line:84%
Am I becoming a more
wise human being?

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:26.570 align:middle line:84%
Not is my life looking the same
way today as it did yesterday?

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:29.180 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that
strikes so many people about

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:84%
you is that in your lectures,
without that going into any

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.720 align:middle line:84%
great detail, you are so
honest about your own life.

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I spill the beans.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:39.110 align:middle line:90%
>> You do.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.700 align:middle line:10%
You spill the beans, Barbara.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:42.920 align:middle line:90%
And it's so authentic.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.200 align:middle line:90%
It's so appealing.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:10%
Do you ever leave a workshop and
think, oh, man, I went too far?

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.720 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't think I went too far.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:53.850 align:middle line:90%
>> That's great.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:90%
>> You know, it's interesting.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:21:00.080 align:middle line:84%
I grew up watching
a lot of teachers

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:07.495 align:middle line:84%
who put themselves on pedestals,
who appeared to be perfect.

00:21:07.495 --> 00:21:09.620 align:middle line:84%
What I learned from that
was that it didn't give me

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.760 align:middle line:90%
room to be imperfect.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.200 align:middle line:90%
It didn't give me room to grow.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.890 align:middle line:84%
>> And not as a device, but as
a way of keeping myself honest,

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.710 align:middle line:84%
I decided a long time ago to
share my process with people.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And my process
has been dramatic.

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:26.970 align:middle line:90%
It's been different.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:27.890 align:middle line:90%
It's been eventful.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:28.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:33.200 align:middle line:90%
>> And for a reason.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I think when we
choose to be teachers,

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and I mean consciously
choose before we

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.770 align:middle line:84%
come into a life
to be teachers, we

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.678 align:middle line:90%
take on a certain kind of karma.

00:21:42.678 --> 00:21:44.720 align:middle line:84%
I bet you some of the
people you've interviewed--

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and I've talked to many of
them, cause they're my friends--

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:84%
we, behind the scenes, agree
that most teachers did not

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.655 align:middle line:84%
meet their high school
sweetheart at 19

00:21:53.655 --> 00:21:55.862 align:middle line:84%
and have lived for 40
years happily ever after.

00:21:55.862 --> 00:21:56.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I certainly did not.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>> They have had lives.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:59.540 align:middle line:90%
They have had stuff.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.430 align:middle line:90%
Because that's what's molded us.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:02.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the fire.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:84%
That's what's
given us and taught

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.600 align:middle line:90%
us compassion for other people.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I've been through
so much in my life.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.940 align:middle line:84%
Very few things anyone
could ever tell me

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:12.770 align:middle line:90%
I haven't experienced myself.

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.440 align:middle line:84%
What that's taught
me is compassion.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:17.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't judge people
when I hear them.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:84%
I don't think, well,
I've been this.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So I don't understand
what your problem is.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.370 align:middle line:84%
And I think people
really appreciate that.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.280 align:middle line:84%
That's the one
comment I always hear

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:29.480 align:middle line:84%
from people, which is your
honesty gives me permission

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.850 align:middle line:84%
to love myself, no matter
what I'm going through.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:36.305 align:middle line:84%
So people will
challenge me, saying,

00:22:36.305 --> 00:22:38.180 align:middle line:84%
what gives you the right
to teach about this?

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.222 align:middle line:84%
You've been married and
divorced all these times.

00:22:40.222 --> 00:22:43.220 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say, that's
exactly my credential.

00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:44.420 align:middle line:90%
That's my credential.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.650 align:middle line:90%
That's what I've taken on.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:49.400 align:middle line:84%
That's my sacrifice,
that I have taken on.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.530 align:middle line:84%
Let me have as many
experiences as possible.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.450 align:middle line:84%
Let me go through
as much as possible.

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:55.160 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm not just
here for myself.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.498 align:middle line:90%
I'm here to teach.

00:22:56.498 --> 00:22:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I know you have to go.

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:59.390 align:middle line:84%
But I do want to
say to you, I thank

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.920 align:middle line:84%
you so much for sitting down
and chatting with us here

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.970 align:middle line:90%
at Wisdom.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.880 align:middle line:84%
And having known you
for all these years,

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.850 align:middle line:84%
it's very gratifying to me
to see that you are still,

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.850 align:middle line:84%
from the first day I met
you, as much a truth seeker

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:15.780 align:middle line:90%
as you are a truth teller.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Barbara.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.850 align:middle line:90%
