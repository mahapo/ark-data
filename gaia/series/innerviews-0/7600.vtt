00:00:30.755 --> 00:00:32.380 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL WESTERMAN:
Thank you, Cheryl,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.010 align:middle line:90%
for sitting down with us.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:10%
With a title of a book like
"Take Time for Your Life,"

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.280 align:middle line:10%
people have to pull it
off the shelf every day

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.080 align:middle line:10%
because it's something
we all don't do.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CHERYL RICHARDSON: Right.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.950 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: Did you write the
book because there was a time

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.350 align:middle line:84%
when you didn't take
time for your life?

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: Absolutely.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.677 align:middle line:10%
I think probably the
underlying driving force

00:00:57.677 --> 00:00:59.260 align:middle line:10%
of why I wrote the
book is I went back

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.450 align:middle line:10%
over 20 years of
journals that I had kept,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.030 align:middle line:10%
and in the last 10
years of my journals,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.650 align:middle line:10%
my number one
complaint was that I

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.680 align:middle line:10%
didn't have time for the things
that were important to me.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And then when I began
developing a private practice

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.130 align:middle line:84%
as a coach seven years ago,
the number one complaint

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:84%
of my clients were that
they didn't have enough time

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.490 align:middle line:90%
for their lives as well.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.490 align:middle line:84%
So I began working on
the book without a title.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.140 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't sure exactly what
I was going to call it.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And one day it just
occurred to me that I just--

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.890 align:middle line:90%
I had done--

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.763 align:middle line:84%
I had made some changes that
allowed me to reclaim my life

00:01:33.763 --> 00:01:35.680 align:middle line:84%
and that that's exactly
what I wanted the book

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.170 align:middle line:84%
to do for my readers and
"Take Time for Your Life"

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.682 align:middle line:90%
would be a great thing to call.

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:41.140 align:middle line:84%
As matter of fact
it was originally

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
called "Make Time for Your
Life," and my assistant--

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.160 align:middle line:84%
my terrific assistant Stacy said
that sounds like too much work.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.310 align:middle line:84%
You really want to-- you might
want to use the word "take."

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And I went that's it,
"Take Time for Your Life."

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly it.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.707 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: Very
interesting because when

00:01:55.707 --> 00:01:59.560 align:middle line:84%
you say take time
for your life, you're

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.955 align:middle line:90%
making a choice to take it.

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: That's right.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.800 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: To own it.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.060 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: That's right.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.760 align:middle line:84%
That's the very-- that's the
most important message I think

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.060 align:middle line:84%
that I give in the beginning
of the book is that we--

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.660 align:middle line:84%
it's so easy to fall
victim to the job

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.670 align:middle line:84%
that you have to stay at
even though you hate it

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.990 align:middle line:84%
because you need
the money or it's

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.782 align:middle line:84%
easy to believe that
well I've got a family

00:02:18.782 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:84%
to raise so I have to
keep running from 6:00 AM

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.040 align:middle line:90%
until midnight.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.170 align:middle line:84%
I think the most
crippling excuse of all

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.590 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't have a
choice about how we live,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.630 align:middle line:84%
and I'm saying right up front in
the book you do have a choice.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.520 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you have
really tough choices

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.590 align:middle line:84%
like leaving a job
you can't stand

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.730 align:middle line:84%
or dedicating a year to
paying off your debts

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.750 align:middle line:84%
so that you really
can leave a company.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
But we can't confuse tough
choices with no choices.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.950 align:middle line:84%
We all have choices
about how we live.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.050 align:middle line:84%
And when we exercise
that choice,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.342 align:middle line:84%
immediately magical things
start to happen in our lives.

00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:51.800 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: I think
you're so right,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.140 align:middle line:84%
and I think that when we
feel we do not have a choice,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.097 align:middle line:84%
one of the things that happens
to us is we are paralyzed.

00:02:59.097 --> 00:02:59.930 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: Right.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:00.845 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: I've stood--

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: That's right.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.420 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: I've stood in my
living room thinking I have 18

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.385 align:middle line:84%
things to do today, and
I can't take a step--

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: That's right.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: To go anywhere.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.690 align:middle line:84%
So how do we begin
to change that?

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: Well, the truth
is that the whole profession

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.930 align:middle line:84%
of coaching that's been
you know wildly seen in

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.320 align:middle line:84%
the media now has really
taken off because most of us

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.330 align:middle line:90%
know what it is we ought to do.

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us
do feel paralyzed

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.690 align:middle line:84%
with all there is to take
care of during the day.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.220 align:middle line:84%
It's doing it
that's the problem.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.440 align:middle line:84%
And so that was actually
a challenge for me

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.230 align:middle line:84%
when I wrote the book because
I knew that a book couldn't

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.460 align:middle line:84%
replace a person who
was on your side saying,

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.260 align:middle line:90%
yes, you can do it.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.970 align:middle line:84%
What are you going
to do this week?

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.433 align:middle line:84%
Let's check in again next
week and see what you've done.

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:45.100 align:middle line:84%
But what I hope to do-- and I've
done it because I've heard from

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.710 align:middle line:84%
readers all over the country
that have read the book--

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.520 align:middle line:84%
is to provide practical
actions, practical simple

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.200 align:middle line:84%
steps along with inspiring
clients' stories and examples

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:84%
of how things miraculously start
improving in people's lives

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.100 align:middle line:84%
by just doing one easy
doable thing at a time.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And I think the other
thing that's important--

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.460 align:middle line:84%
and it's really the basic
philosophy of my work--

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.710 align:middle line:84%
is one of what I call
extreme self care.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.590 align:middle line:84%
And that means that when you
do have those 18 things to do

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.680 align:middle line:84%
and you're feeling totally
overwhelmed and paralyzed,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:84%
that's not the time
to get into action

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.279 align:middle line:84%
and try and do
anything because when

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.790 align:middle line:84%
we're the most overwhelmed,
we're the least resourceful.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.710 align:middle line:84%
In that moment, the
best thing you can do

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.550 align:middle line:84%
is to sit down, close your
eyes, take a deep breath,

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.200 align:middle line:84%
grab a cup of tea, or get
into a hot bath or something

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.253 align:middle line:84%
and just start to relax
and get centered again.

00:04:38.253 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
Because when we connect
with our inner wisdom, which

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.820 align:middle line:84%
is the foundation of
an authentic life,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.873 align:middle line:84%
then you'll know the
smart choices to make.

00:04:44.873 --> 00:04:46.540 align:middle line:84%
You'll be able to
look at the list of 18

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:84%
and say which one's most
important for me to do next

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.770 align:middle line:84%
instead of what most people do,
which is if I just get this one

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.860 align:middle line:84%
last thing done, if I just get
the dishes into the dishwasher,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.060 align:middle line:90%
then I'll be able to relax.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.025 align:middle line:84%
If I just make this
one last phone call,

00:05:00.025 --> 00:05:01.150 align:middle line:90%
then I'll be able to relax.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.460 align:middle line:84%
Oh, if I just answer
that one last email,

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:90%
then I'll be able to relax.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, the inbox of
life never empties.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.880 align:middle line:84%
There's always one
more thing to do.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.040 align:middle line:84%
And what we need to do
is say wait a second.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.290 align:middle line:84%
It's the relaxing piece
that has to come first.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Yes.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.282 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: Because when we
reconnect our head and our body

00:05:17.282 --> 00:05:19.140 align:middle line:84%
because most of us
are so disconnected,

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.665 align:middle line:90%
then we make better choices.

00:05:20.665 --> 00:05:22.130 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: One of
the many things

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.220 align:middle line:84%
I enjoyed about your book
was that you looked at

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.790 align:middle line:84%
not only the professional, the
business, the financial aspect

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:84%
of our lives that
is overwhelming

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.470 align:middle line:90%
but also the emotional.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.850 align:middle line:84%
And you talked about
toxic relationships,

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.290 align:middle line:84%
people who drain the
energy from our lives.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Is there an area--

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.830 align:middle line:84%
the professional,
business, financial as

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.035 align:middle line:84%
opposed to the emotional--
that is better to begin with.

00:05:46.035 --> 00:05:47.660 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: Well,
it was interesting.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.930 align:middle line:84%
When I was writing the
book, my biggest challenge

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.890 align:middle line:84%
was that I had to take a
non-linear intuitive process,

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.470 align:middle line:84%
which to me is what
coaching is, and put it

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:58.860 align:middle line:90%
into a linear practical form.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.860 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Yes, you did.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: Yes.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.850 align:middle line:84%
When I'm working with clients,
I start right where they are.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you were to come to me
and say my financial life is

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.070 align:middle line:84%
a wreck, I'd say great
let's start right there

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:84%
and look at what you
need to do to handle it.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.130 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm feeling totally
overwhelmed and exhausted,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.930 align:middle line:90%
I'd say great.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.190 align:middle line:84%
Let's make a list
of the 10 things

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.140 align:middle line:84%
that are draining your
energy, and let's start

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.140 align:middle line:90%
handling them right now.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.970 align:middle line:84%
You've got 30 days
to get it handled.

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.795 align:middle line:84%
And I'd support
you in doing that.

00:06:19.795 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:84%
But I couldn't do
that in a book.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.753 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't start
where the reader was.

00:06:22.753 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
So I would say to
the reader read

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.695 align:middle line:90%
the book through once quickly--

00:06:26.695 --> 00:06:27.950 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: And take the quiz.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.150 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: And
take the quizzes.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
Yes, the what's
draining you test--

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I know-- and the what's
fueling you test.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:33.260 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Wow.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.010 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: Those
were real eye openers.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.552 align:middle line:84%
That's why the publisher put it
on the end papers of the book

00:06:37.552 --> 00:06:39.500 align:middle line:84%
because it opened the
eyes of a lot of people

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.440 align:middle line:84%
that read the manuscript
before it got published.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Take the tests, read
through the book.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I intentionally made
the book simple and easy

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.140 align:middle line:84%
to read because
I don't have time

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
to plow through long
and difficult books.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.025 align:middle line:84%
I wanted it to be a
conversation with the reader,

00:06:53.025 --> 00:06:55.400 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted the reader to be
able to go through and then

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.830 align:middle line:84%
identify, oh,
where's the chapter

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
that you'd most
like not to work on.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.620 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Yeah.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.550 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: That's
probably the one

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.530 align:middle line:90%
you need to work on first.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.020 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Right.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.480 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: So if you feel
overwhelmed and exhausted,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:09.020 align:middle line:84%
go to the what's draining
you chapter, take the test,

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
make your top 10
procrastination list,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.470 align:middle line:90%
and then start handling it.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:14.810 align:middle line:84%
If you're feeling like
you've got your life pretty

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.290 align:middle line:84%
well handled but you're
missing a significant other

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.110 align:middle line:84%
or you're missing high quality
relationships, most of us

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.650 align:middle line:84%
are fed up with the
cocktail level of life.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.730 align:middle line:84%
We want deeper
connections with people.

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.430 align:middle line:84%
If you're missing that in
your life, go to chapter 6

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and start doing it-- take--
doing the work in that chapter.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.200 align:middle line:84%
So once you go through it once,
I say start where you are,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:84%
and what matters most
of all is taking action.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.910 align:middle line:84%
That's all I care about,
doing something different.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.150 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: Let's talk a
little bit about the chapters

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.540 align:middle line:84%
that I think most
people would migrate

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.100 align:middle line:84%
to, different
parts of our lives,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.330 align:middle line:90%
different times of our lives.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.872 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we go to
different arenas.

00:07:51.872 --> 00:07:54.890 align:middle line:84%
But I was really
intrigued by the chapters

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:58.010 align:middle line:84%
on what is draining
your life because I hear

00:07:58.010 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:84%
so many people in this business
and other businesses saying I'm

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.330 align:middle line:90%
so drained.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.687 align:middle line:90%
It's a term I hear a lot.

00:08:06.687 --> 00:08:08.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about what
drains people's energies.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.950 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: Well
what's draining you,

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.056 align:middle line:84%
it's actually my favorite
chapter in the book.

00:08:12.056 --> 00:08:12.290 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Is it?

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.123 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: It is.

00:08:13.123 --> 00:08:15.380 align:middle line:10%
It's my favorite
workshop to teach

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.510 align:middle line:10%
because it's the one that
can have the quickest

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.610 align:middle line:10%
impact in people's lives.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.880 align:middle line:10%
Most of us-- if you were to
imagine that there are cords

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:10%
of energy running from you
to everything that's undone

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.470 align:middle line:10%
or incomplete in your life--

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.804 align:middle line:10%
so, for example, you
go to your closet

00:08:29.804 --> 00:08:32.179 align:middle line:10%
to get ready for work and you
pull out your favorite suit

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:35.289 align:middle line:10%
and you notice the button is
missing and I still forgot--

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:38.360 align:middle line:10%
can't believe I keep forgetting
to get the button fixed.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.909 align:middle line:84%
It's taking energy through this
little cord right out of you

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.805 align:middle line:84%
even after you shut
the closet door.

00:08:42.805 --> 00:08:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Or you get into your
car and you think,

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:45.972 align:middle line:84%
oh, I've got to get
this car vacuumed

00:08:45.972 --> 00:08:48.650 align:middle line:84%
or I keep forgetting
to get the oil changed.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:50.360 align:middle line:90%
That's draining your energy.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes the drains are
even bigger-- an aging parent

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:54.770 align:middle line:84%
or a medical
problem that demands

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:84%
your constant attention
or the tax returns that

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:58.320 align:middle line:90%
haven't been filed.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.460 align:middle line:84%
That's like a pipe running
from you to the tax returns.

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.970 align:middle line:84%
Most of us are running on less
than a half a tank of fuel.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to imagine
that when we're born,

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.755 align:middle line:90%
we have a full tank of gas.

00:09:07.755 --> 00:09:08.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Yes.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.408 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: And as we
go through life and all

00:09:10.408 --> 00:09:12.950 align:middle line:90%
the responsibilities--

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:84%
we take on all these
responsibilities.

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
We have all these
things we have to do.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:84%
Before you know it, our
fuel starts going down

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.160 align:middle line:90%
and down and down.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.190 align:middle line:84%
And most people say they feel
totally exhausted and drained.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:23.608 align:middle line:84%
The tough part
about that is when

00:09:23.608 --> 00:09:26.150 align:middle line:84%
you feel totally drained you're
not motivated to do anything.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Right.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.250 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: And
so, once again,

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.995 align:middle line:84%
I think what's important to
know is you start with 10 items.

00:09:32.995 --> 00:09:35.120 align:middle line:84%
What are the 10 things that
you keep thinking about

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.780 align:middle line:84%
that you keep meaning to do that
you keep procrastinating about?

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:84%
Some of the common items
on my clients' list

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:84%
were things like
going to the dentist,

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.880 align:middle line:84%
going to the doctor,
relationships that drain you.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:84%
Popular conversation throughout
the country as I travel around,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.800 align:middle line:84%
everybody has somebody
who's draining their energy.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.730 align:middle line:84%
And as you just simply make
a list of those 10 items

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:57.560 align:middle line:84%
that are draining
your energy and you

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.050 align:middle line:90%
start handling them, very--

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
it's as if we ignite
a divine power that

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.250 align:middle line:90%
supports our every effort.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'll give you
an example of that.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.882 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a talk
at a bookstore,

00:10:07.882 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:84%
and there was a woman
in the audience who

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.640 align:middle line:90%
was a massage therapist.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.740 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking about
what's draining you.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And I said to the audience
make a list of the 10 things

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:16.320 align:middle line:90%
that are draining your energy.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.960 align:middle line:84%
Tomorrow when you wake
up, start handling them

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.480 align:middle line:84%
and then pay attention to
what shows up in your life.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:23.668 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next day at
5:00, I got a call from--

00:10:23.668 --> 00:10:25.710 align:middle line:84%
I received a call from
this massage therapist who

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
said this morning I woke
up, I made my top 10 list,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.920 align:middle line:84%
I handled the first four
items, and I can't believe it.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.850 align:middle line:84%
I received phone calls
from three new clients

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:90%
this afternoon.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.210 align:middle line:84%
Now to most people
that would sound

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:84%
like a magical coincidence, but
I've got hundreds of stories

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.190 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.830 align:middle line:84%
Or I used to-- when I was
coaching people in business

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.810 align:middle line:84%
let's say an attorney,
and the attorney

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.100 align:middle line:84%
would say I'd really like
to bring in more business.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:51.900 align:middle line:90%
I'd say, great.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.388 align:middle line:90%
Clean out a filing cabinet.

00:10:53.388 --> 00:10:54.555 align:middle line:90%
That's a marketing strategy.

00:10:54.555 --> 00:10:55.125 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Yes.

00:10:55.125 --> 00:10:56.833 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: Get your
office cleaned up.

00:10:56.833 --> 00:10:58.710 align:middle line:84%
Get rid of the
stuff in your life

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:01.990 align:middle line:84%
that is draining you not
only on a physical level

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.680 align:middle line:84%
but all of the stuff we hold
on to either in our lives

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.550 align:middle line:84%
or in our head drains us on an
emotional, spiritual, physical,

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:90%
and intellectual level.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.460 align:middle line:84%
If you've ever had
a box of old papers

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:84%
or files in your basement that
maybe represented love letters

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
from past boyfriends or
girlfriends or divorce

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.360 align:middle line:84%
papers or the things that
we're emotionally attached to,

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:84%
when you finally
pick that box up

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.815 align:middle line:84%
and you get it
out of your house,

00:11:27.815 --> 00:11:29.190 align:middle line:84%
you feel like a
different person.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:36.610 align:middle line:90%


00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.210 align:middle line:10%
Let's start by having you
identify some of your energy

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:42.515 align:middle line:10%
drains so then we can talk
about how do you handle it

00:11:42.515 --> 00:11:44.890 align:middle line:10%
and what do you do if you have
clutter all over the place

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.190 align:middle line:10%
and you think but I can't part
with those-- that information

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.690 align:middle line:10%
or I can't part
with those magazines

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.148 align:middle line:10%
or I'm afraid to
let this stuff go.

00:11:51.148 --> 00:11:53.330 align:middle line:84%
How are we going to deal
with those kinds of things?

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:84%
So first we're going to
look at relationships.

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.843 align:middle line:84%
There are people in my life who
continuously drain my energy.

00:12:00.843 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
So I want you to think is
there someone in your life

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:04.177 align:middle line:90%
that's draining your energy.

00:12:04.177 --> 00:12:07.520 align:middle line:84%
If so, write their name down
unless of course they're

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:08.690 align:middle line:90%
sitting next to you.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.820 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.180 align:middle line:90%
Don't do that.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.180 align:middle line:10%
Write somebody else's
name down or a little code

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.290 align:middle line:10%
name or something.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.020 align:middle line:10%
I have unreturned phone
calls, emails, or letters

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:10%
that need to be
handled, the kinds

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.870 align:middle line:10%
of things that are
weighing on your mind,

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.790 align:middle line:10%
like, oh, I really have
to write to Aunt Mary.

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.480 align:middle line:84%
It was over a month ago, and
she probably hates me now.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:84%
I feel a void in my life of
either a significant other

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:90%
or friendships.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.452 align:middle line:84%
That, too, can
drain your energy.

00:12:34.452 --> 00:12:36.660 align:middle line:84%
You're walking around feeling
lonely wishing that you

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.030 align:middle line:90%
had a partner in your life.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.642 align:middle line:84%
It's siphoning off
energy all the time.

00:12:41.642 --> 00:12:43.850 align:middle line:84%
There's a relationship in
my life that I need to end.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.950 align:middle line:90%
That's a big energy drain.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.915 align:middle line:84%
I remember I was working with
a gentleman, a doctor, who

00:12:51.915 --> 00:12:53.540 align:middle line:84%
had had a practice,
and he had hired me

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.100 align:middle line:84%
because his practice
started to really dwindle.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.850 align:middle line:10%
And during the course
of our coaching work

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.392 align:middle line:10%
together, he kept talking about
this woman that he was dating

00:13:01.392 --> 00:13:03.840 align:middle line:10%
and how unhappy he was and
they were always fighting

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:10%
and it wasn't working out.

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.010 align:middle line:10%
And every now and
then he'd say I really

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.907 align:middle line:10%
just need to end
this relationship.

00:13:08.907 --> 00:13:10.490 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
mirror that back, you

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:12.032 align:middle line:84%
keep talking about
that a lot and you

00:13:12.032 --> 00:13:14.480 align:middle line:84%
keep saying you want to
end this relationship.

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:90%
You might need to consider it.

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Well, as time went on, I was
planting the seed, mirroring

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:20.210 align:middle line:90%
back what I was hearing.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.370 align:middle line:84%
As time went on, it
became very clear

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:27.390 align:middle line:84%
that the relationship
was definitely

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:90%
impacting his business.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:30.492 align:middle line:10%
And I remember one time
sitting in his office,

00:13:30.492 --> 00:13:32.700 align:middle line:10%
we were doing a coaching
session, and I said to him--

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.020 align:middle line:10%
I'll call him Sam--

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.820 align:middle line:10%
I said, Sam, it's time for
you to end this relationship.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.650 align:middle line:84%
If you don't, this relationship
is going to kill your business.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.900 align:middle line:10%
I remember he stepped back
a little bit when I said it

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.025 align:middle line:10%
because that's the hardest
thing in the world to do

00:13:45.025 --> 00:13:46.225 align:middle line:10%
is to end a relationship.

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:84%
But this is something
he had been telling me.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.028 align:middle line:84%
So I said look you do
whatever you need to do.

00:13:50.028 --> 00:13:52.320 align:middle line:10%
You get whatever support you
need-- therapist, friends,

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.690 align:middle line:10%
support group, whatever--
to get this handled.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:56.640 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you're going
to lose your business.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.430 align:middle line:84%
Took him three months, he
put some support in place,

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.320 align:middle line:84%
ended the relationship
three months later,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:07.910 align:middle line:84%
and his business increased
by 50% within 30 days.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Fifty percent within 30
days, it was amazing.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.480 align:middle line:84%
That represent--
imagine what a huge pipe

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:90%
that was taking energy.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.590 align:middle line:84%
All of a sudden he cuts it
off and handles it and boom,

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:21.230 align:middle line:84%
all this energy-- remember
we're talking about energy

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:middle line:90%
on multiple levels here.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not just physical energy.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:10%
It's on psychic, intellectual,
spiritual, and emotional energy

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.276 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:14:29.276 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:10%
>>CHANTEL: What do
you say to people

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:35.610 align:middle line:10%
in terms of the energy
draining area when there's

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:37.890 align:middle line:10%
a relationship and
it's someone who's

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:10%
very difficult to
disconnect from because I

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.900 align:middle line:10%
see your point about
disconnecting from someone

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:45.460 align:middle line:10%
saying I can't do this anymore.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.080 align:middle line:84%
I choose not to
have you in my life.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.130 align:middle line:84%
What do you do if it's a
parent, a husband, and a wife,

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.970 align:middle line:90%
a boyfriend, girlfriend?

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:55.620 align:middle line:84%
What do you do when
it's somebody--

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.445 align:middle line:90%
it's easy to say--

00:14:56.445 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: That's right.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.753 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: But you
can't really do it.

00:14:58.753 --> 00:15:00.622 align:middle line:10%
>>RICHARDSON:
Well, first of all,

00:15:00.622 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:10%
this is a really
important question

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:10%
because I get asked this
everywhere I go to speak.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:06.630 align:middle line:10%
And there's a couple
things I want to say first.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:09.120 align:middle line:10%
First of all, I think that
the relationships in our lives

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.250 align:middle line:10%
are the most sacred
things we have.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.670 align:middle line:84%
I was very blessed many years
ago to spend the last month

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:18.630 align:middle line:84%
with a very dear friend of mine
of her life before she died,

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:20.845 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to
experience firsthand

00:15:20.845 --> 00:15:22.470 align:middle line:84%
the kinds of things
we think about when

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:23.670 align:middle line:90%
we're lying on her deathbed.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.740 align:middle line:84%
It's not how much
money we made, it's not

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.800 align:middle line:84%
how successful we were in our
careers, it's who loved us

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.090 align:middle line:90%
and who did we love.

00:15:30.090 --> 00:15:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So I think relationships
are sacred.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
That said no one has
the right to drain

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.022 align:middle line:90%
your energy consistently.

00:15:36.022 --> 00:15:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't care whether
it's a mother,

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:41.220 align:middle line:84%
a father, a wife, a husband,
doesn't matter to me.

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:84%
Because as a coach
and in my work,

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.330 align:middle line:84%
I am committed to
helping people raise

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.207 align:middle line:90%
the quality of their lives.

00:15:47.207 --> 00:15:49.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm committed to helping
them not settle for less.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.740 align:middle line:90%
So what does that mean?

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.760 align:middle line:84%
It means that usually
we're missing language

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.950 align:middle line:84%
that we can use to communicate
with the person who's

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.600 align:middle line:84%
draining us in a
gracious and loving way.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.340 align:middle line:84%
So, for example,
let's imagine-- we'll

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.340 align:middle line:84%
take an easier one-- let's
imagine that you have

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.960 align:middle line:84%
a friend that calls
you every week,

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.682 align:middle line:84%
and she complains
about her boss.

00:16:05.682 --> 00:16:07.140 align:middle line:84%
And it's getting
to the point where

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.848 align:middle line:84%
when you hear her
voice on the voicemail,

00:16:08.848 --> 00:16:11.220 align:middle line:84%
you think, oh, I don't
even want to call her back.

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.560 align:middle line:84%
You can feel it in your body
like the energy's already

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.450 align:middle line:84%
starting to get
sucked out of you.

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's important-- if
you care about that person--

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.270 align:middle line:84%
because see the first step is to
try and heal the relationship.

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.920 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying if they're
bugging you, get rid of them.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying transform
the relationship first.

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:28.895 align:middle line:84%
So you call your friend,
Mary-- we'll call her Mary--

00:16:28.895 --> 00:16:30.270 align:middle line:84%
and you say, Mary,
you know what,

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.580 align:middle line:84%
in an effort to honor
our relationship,

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.590 align:middle line:90%
I need to tell you the truth.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:37.410 align:middle line:84%
That's a great line for any
conversation about a draining

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:38.245 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:16:38.245 --> 00:16:39.870 align:middle line:84%
In an effort to honor
our relationship,

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:41.010 align:middle line:90%
I need to tell you the truth.

00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Yes.

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:43.138 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: When
you call me every week

00:16:43.138 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:84%
complaining about your boss,
I feel drained afterwards.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's starting to
affect our relationship.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.820 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, I
find myself even wanting

00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:52.500 align:middle line:90%
to avoid your phone calls.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.840 align:middle line:84%
I don't want that to
happen to us, Mary.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.520 align:middle line:84%
So here's what
I'm willing to do.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.930 align:middle line:84%
If you're willing to do
something about your boss,

00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:00.488 align:middle line:90%
I'll support you 100%.

00:17:00.488 --> 00:17:03.030 align:middle line:84%
But if you want to call and just
complain and whine about it,

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.109 align:middle line:90%
I can't do that anymore.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.349 align:middle line:90%
Now you have that conversation.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
When Mary calls
you the next week,

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:84%
which depending on how
challenging she is,

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.079 align:middle line:90%
she very well may do that.

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:14.430 align:middle line:90%
And she's going to test you.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:16.430 align:middle line:84%
You see when you start
to take care of yourself,

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.200 align:middle line:84%
the universe will test you
to see how committed you are.

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.720 align:middle line:84%
So Mary may call, and she starts
to have this conversation.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And she starts going down
that path about her boss,

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.119 align:middle line:84%
you have got to back up
boundaries with action.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.730 align:middle line:84%
Mary, before you go any further,
remember the conversation

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:30.542 align:middle line:90%
we had last week?

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:32.250 align:middle line:84%
Tell me what you're
going to do about it.

00:17:32.250 --> 00:17:33.780 align:middle line:90%
I'm behind you 100%.

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:84%
You want to complain, I
can't talk to you right now.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.940 align:middle line:84%
It's because I love you
that I'm saying this.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.410 align:middle line:84%
You can do the same
thing with mom.

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:41.868 align:middle line:84%
And I'll tell you,
I had one client

00:17:41.868 --> 00:17:43.860 align:middle line:84%
I worked with whose
mother was brutal.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Called her every day, was
emotionally abusive to her,

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.760 align:middle line:90%
just not--

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.470 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Yeah.

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.500 align:middle line:90%
I imagine that happens a lot.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.640 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: It happens a lot.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.848 align:middle line:84%
The very first thing I would
say as a coach is you've

00:17:52.848 --> 00:17:55.380 align:middle line:84%
got to get the support
of a very good therapist.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:84%
Coaching isn't therapy,
and I'm not a therapist.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:00.420 align:middle line:84%
And the first thing I do is
really encourage that client

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.980 align:middle line:90%
to get some support.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And then I would work
with that client.

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Once again I'd say
I don't care if it's

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:90%
your mother or your father.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.900 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has the right to
rob you of your life.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.710 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:12.793 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: Well, in a
sense, though, after reading

00:18:12.793 --> 00:18:18.045 align:middle line:84%
your book, I must say it's
like you are a soul therapist.

00:18:18.045 --> 00:18:20.070 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: I would be
really pleased to hear

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:84%
that because now that I've been
doing my work for seven years,

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.420 align:middle line:84%
I honestly feel like my
job-- the reason that I

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:84%
came here-- was to
help clients listen

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.960 align:middle line:90%
to the voice of their soul.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they hear it
and I mirror it back,

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:34.740 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes they
can't but I can hear it

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.180 align:middle line:90%
underneath their words.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And if I can help them to create
a life based on that voice,

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.840 align:middle line:90%
I will die a very happy woman.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: It's interesting
that as I travel across America

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:54.720 align:middle line:84%
with wisdom, I find that there
is a huge wave of spirituality.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.610 align:middle line:84%
It's like we all have holes
in our collective souls.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.380 align:middle line:90%
You must find that as well.

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.470 align:middle line:84%
You start off with
take time for your life

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.590 align:middle line:84%
and you think it's going to
be finances and energy drain

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:11.272 align:middle line:84%
and always it must drift
into the area of soul work.

00:19:11.272 --> 00:19:12.437 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: Yes.

00:19:12.437 --> 00:19:14.520 align:middle line:84%
Well, here's what I think
now that the book is out

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and I've written it a
year and a half ago.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.420 align:middle line:84%
We are so perpetually
outwardly focused.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:84%
We live in a culture that has
us looking outside constantly.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Yeah.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.540 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: We live
from the neck up.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Adrenaline has become the
drug of choice in America.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.680 align:middle line:84%
And we're so busy running
from one appointment

00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:33.840 align:middle line:84%
to another that we're
disconnected from our bodies

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.750 align:middle line:84%
and how we feel as
well as our intuition.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.677 align:middle line:84%
In addition to that, yes,
the information age is here,

00:19:39.677 --> 00:19:41.760 align:middle line:84%
and, yes, we've been
promised that the information

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:90%
age will set us free.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:84%
But all it's done is
perpetuated the myth

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.600 align:middle line:84%
that true wisdom lies
up here when in fact it

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:49.410 align:middle line:90%
lies right here.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:53.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: There's a
great chapter in your book

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:84%
where you talk about the
importance of connecting

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.460 align:middle line:90%
the mind to the heart.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: That's right.

00:19:57.150 --> 00:19:57.860 align:middle line:84%
That's right
connecting [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.520 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: How does one do that?

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.893 align:middle line:90%
I was so impressed with that.

00:20:01.893 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: If I could write a
second book on just that alone,

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:05.220 align:middle line:90%
I would.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:05.640 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Yes.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.890 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: Because I
think that ultimately,

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:09.150 align:middle line:90%
we've got to get--

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm committed to helping
people shift their vision

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.113 align:middle line:90%
from the outside in.

00:20:12.113 --> 00:20:14.550 align:middle line:84%
You see, that's where
the void is coming from.

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.108 align:middle line:84%
Nothing outside of
us can fill that.

00:20:17.108 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of us have
heard that by the way.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.470 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people say,
oh, external things

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.762 align:middle line:90%
aren't going to make you happy.

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:23.860 align:middle line:84%
But at this point we're
smart enough to know that.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:25.318 align:middle line:84%
But what we don't
hear enough about

00:20:25.318 --> 00:20:28.530 align:middle line:84%
are practical ways to
reconnect on the inside.

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.300 align:middle line:84%
The very best way
I know of quite

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.210 align:middle line:84%
honestly is to get up every
morning, open up a journal,

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.490 align:middle line:84%
and write at least three
or four pages of whatever

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:36.660 align:middle line:90%
comes to mind.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.350 align:middle line:84%
Julia Cameron said this a long
time ago in "The Artist's Way,"

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.430 align:middle line:90%
and she was absolutely right.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:43.710 align:middle line:84%
I heard that, and I've been
a journal writer for years

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.640 align:middle line:90%
but not consistent.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:48.180 align:middle line:84%
I heard that, I write three
pages minimum every morning

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.070 align:middle line:90%
without fail.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.112 align:middle line:90%
I care what city I'm in.

00:20:50.112 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what's
up for the day.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:90%
I get up early enough to do it.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And what that does is it starts
bringing my focus inward.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:21:00.000 align:middle line:84%
I start paying attention to
what's going on inside of me.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:84%
We also need to spend
time with ourselves.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.860 align:middle line:84%
I talk about taking a sacred
date night or a date afternoon

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.180 align:middle line:90%
every single week.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:11.305 align:middle line:84%
Right now, I would encourage
readers, viewers to go ahead--

00:21:11.305 --> 00:21:12.930 align:middle line:84%
take out your calendar,
your date book,

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:16.590 align:middle line:84%
and for the next six
months, schedule a time just

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:20.000 align:middle line:84%
for you in your appointment
book in ink, not pencil,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.907 align:middle line:84%
that you'll set
aside just for you.

00:21:21.907 --> 00:21:22.740 align:middle line:90%
And then know this--

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.295 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Alone.

00:21:23.295 --> 00:21:24.128 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: Alone.

00:21:24.128 --> 00:21:26.430 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: That's important
that our viewers know that.

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.740 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: This is about
re-establishing a connection

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:30.540 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Yeah.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.877 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: That's
where true security lies.

00:21:32.877 --> 00:21:34.230 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't come from money.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't come
from relationships.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.320 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't come from jobs.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.820 align:middle line:10%
This is why the great
meditators for years have said,

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.165 align:middle line:10%
oh, you want nirvana, go inside.

00:21:42.165 --> 00:21:44.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, sure but when you combine
that with adrenaline addiction,

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.920 align:middle line:84%
nobody can sit
still long enough.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.420 align:middle line:84%
So now the first
thing we need to do

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:51.900 align:middle line:84%
is use some practical steps to
slow the body down so that you

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.300 align:middle line:84%
consistently on a
daily basis start

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.890 align:middle line:90%
spending time with yourself.

00:21:55.890 --> 00:21:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And by the way,
when you do schedule

00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:59.220 align:middle line:84%
that time in your
appointment book in ink,

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:02.890 align:middle line:84%
once again, I want you to
know that you will be tested.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:06.080 align:middle line:84%
The minute you schedule Sunday
night as your sacred time,

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.778 align:middle line:84%
mom's going to call
and say, Jan, I

00:22:08.778 --> 00:22:10.570 align:middle line:84%
need you to take me
shopping Monday night--

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:10.920 align:middle line:90%
Sunday night.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.200 align:middle line:90%
It's the only time I can go.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:90%
Please, will you do that.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.340 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is, no,
mom, I'm not available.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.880 align:middle line:90%
Period.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.367 align:middle line:84%
And once the divine catches on
that you really mean business,

00:22:21.367 --> 00:22:22.950 align:middle line:84%
you'll stop getting
tested, and you'll

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:24.617 align:middle line:84%
find that life will
just naturally start

00:22:24.617 --> 00:22:27.430 align:middle line:84%
to settle in around the
time that you set aside

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:28.230 align:middle line:90%
for yourself.

00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:29.563 align:middle line:90%
And by the way, I'd increase it.

00:22:29.563 --> 00:22:31.770 align:middle line:84%
When I was working with
clients, individual clients,

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.270 align:middle line:84%
if they were self-employed, I'd
have them scheduled two days

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.060 align:middle line:84%
during the week,
one in their office

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.590 align:middle line:84%
where they never answered
the phone and one where

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:39.530 align:middle line:84%
they were completely
away from their business.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.540 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: Well, you are a
bright and shining example

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:43.410 align:middle line:90%
of your book.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.800 align:middle line:84%
And actually I look
forward to your next book--

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.800 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: Thank you.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.440 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTEL: Where you talk about
the ways and the importance

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.480 align:middle line:84%
of connecting your
mind to your heart.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.885 align:middle line:84%
So that's your next
assignment in life.

00:22:53.885 --> 00:22:54.710 align:middle line:90%
Write that book.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: Thank
you very much.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Thank you so much.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:57.502 align:middle line:84%
What a pleasure it
is to talk to you.

00:22:57.502 --> 00:22:58.170 align:middle line:84%
>>RICHARDSON: Pleasure
to meet you, too.

00:22:58.170 --> 00:22:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTEL: Thanks.

00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:00.020 align:middle line:90%
>>RICHARDSON: Thanks.

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:52.598 align:middle line:90%
