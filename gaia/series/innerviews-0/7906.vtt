00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:04.491 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.491 --> 00:00:26.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.540 align:middle line:84%
>> What a pleasure
to talk with you.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.040 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking
forward to talking

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.940 align:middle line:90%
with you for a long time.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.600 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it our karma that we
would be sitting here talking?

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.540 align:middle line:10%
That we would find ourselves
here in Austin, Texas talking?

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it must be a karma.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.970 align:middle line:90%
Everything is karma.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.820 align:middle line:90%
There are no accidents.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>> You are from New York.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.130 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>> You were brought up Jewish.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.077 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, Jewish on my parents'
side, as I always say.

00:00:49.077 --> 00:00:50.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Jewish on your parents' side.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.710 align:middle line:10%
>> A Buddhist by
inclination and training,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.870 align:middle line:10%
perhaps past lives as
the Tibetans tell me.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:90%
Who knows?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So tell me a little bit
about your karma, then,

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.019 align:middle line:84%
that you know of it, that
you could come from point A

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.570 align:middle line:90%
to point Z, actually.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.190 align:middle line:84%
Because one wouldn't think
from where you started,

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:84%
you would end up one of the
most well-respected, well-loved

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.080 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan lamas
existing in the world.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, thank you.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.310 align:middle line:84%
That's very flattering,
but I'm just a guy.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.910 align:middle line:90%
And it's a journey.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.670 align:middle line:90%
It's an infinite journey.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.660 align:middle line:90%
There's no end, really.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.810 align:middle line:10%
It's an infinite journey.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.750 align:middle line:10%
But I just-- it's just
one step at a time.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
And you can make the
journey too, Chantal.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.200 align:middle line:84%
It's not that
mysterious or mystical.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.700 align:middle line:90%
Anybody can make this journey.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.110 align:middle line:84%
I got interested
in these things.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.980 align:middle line:84%
I went to India when I graduated
from university in 1971

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to look more into this,
to trace the source

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:90%
to find something for myself.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:90%
And I found it in the Himalayas.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.980 align:middle line:84%
But I'm here to say you could
find it here, wherever you are.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:51.800 align:middle line:90%
It's everywhere.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you notice that
all across America--

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and wisdom travels
all over the country--

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.930 align:middle line:84%
that there is a more
remarked interest in Buddhism

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.480 align:middle line:90%
now than ever before?

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, Buddhism
seems to be hot now.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.820 align:middle line:90%
It may be even a bit of a fad.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.759 align:middle line:90%
I mean, that's fine.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.990 align:middle line:84%
But when the fad passes,
the invitation remains.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.400 align:middle line:84%
The gateway is
open for those who

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.038 align:middle line:90%
want to pursue it more deeply.

00:02:14.038 --> 00:02:15.580 align:middle line:84%
Of course, there's
a reason for that.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.450 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism is very congruent
with our post-modern beliefs.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.570 align:middle line:84%
It's very rational
and scientific.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.453 align:middle line:84%
There's no theology or
dogma you have to accept.

00:02:24.453 --> 00:02:25.870 align:middle line:84%
It's really not
so much a religion

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:84%
as an ethical, psychological
philosophy of awakening.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of awakening
from the dream of illusion

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.402 align:middle line:90%
and to suffering.

00:02:33.402 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of living
an enlightened life.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.090 align:middle line:84%
It's a way of finding
spiritual wellness.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.790 align:middle line:84%
Anybody can benefit
by this kind of path

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:84%
with or without converting
to anything or from anything.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.290 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so well said.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.450 align:middle line:84%
And I never heard it
put quite that way.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot
of people would assume--

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.060 align:middle line:84%
make the decision
in their own minds

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.370 align:middle line:90%
that Buddhism is a religion.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, of course, Buddhism
over 2,500 years has been

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:84%
institutionalized and is one of
the seven great world religions

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.220 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.300 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's not really how
we take it so much in the West

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.280 align:middle line:90%
and in America.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:84%
We're really looking
for it as a practice,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.320 align:middle line:84%
as a way of getting
some benefit that we

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.480 align:middle line:84%
can experience in this
life, not in the afterlife.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.740 align:middle line:84%
And I think meditation,
and yoga, and self-inquiry,

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:84%
and ethical and compassionate
living and service,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.700 align:middle line:90%
non-violence--

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.080 align:middle line:84%
all these Buddhist
principles are

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.955 align:middle line:84%
very congruent-- are very
applicable to daily life today.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:26.520 align:middle line:84%
With or without
converting to it,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.270 align:middle line:84%
you could be a better
Christian, or a Jew,

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.720 align:middle line:84%
or a better atheist
and agnostic if you

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
gain a little more spiritual
health through relaxing,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.320 align:middle line:90%
meditating, praying, yoga.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.120 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you choose.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.050 align:middle line:84%
There are many
exercises or practices

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:90%
on the path of enlightenment.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Ethical and practical
living, you said.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about
that for a while.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot
of people seek that.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.270 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people want to
live compassionately.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we all do.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.690 align:middle line:84%
And we all want
to open our hearts

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.180 align:middle line:84%
and experience more
love in our lives.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:84%
But we have to learn how to do
that, not just believe in it.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.890 align:middle line:10%
So I think that
Buddhism particularly--

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.230 align:middle line:10%
but all real, timeless,
spiritual paths

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.850 align:middle line:10%
help us to actualize what is
in us to make it actual or real

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:10%
and to live a more compassionate
and selfless life through love,

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.470 align:middle line:10%
through service, but also,
through the wisdom of awakening

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.667 align:middle line:10%
to who and what we are.

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:21.250 align:middle line:84%
That's very crucial, otherwise
we just give lip service to it.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.950 align:middle line:84%
But we can't really walk
our talk in daily life.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.230 align:middle line:84%
We become a living
contradiction.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Your energy when you walk
in a room is rather remarkable.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Don't mean to make
you uncomfortable

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:90%
with a compliment.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.370 align:middle line:84%
>> But when you
walk into a room,

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.070 align:middle line:84%
it's astonishing to me how
it affects other people

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.870 align:middle line:90%
in the room.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.780 align:middle line:90%
I've watched you do this.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.550 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.383 align:middle line:90%
I just don't know.

00:04:47.383 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:90%
There's something about you.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.970 align:middle line:90%
>> It must be good karma.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Karma is something that we
make through our action,

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.960 align:middle line:84%
through our words, and
deeds, and practice.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.610 align:middle line:84%
And through our
inner life, I feel

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.980 align:middle line:84%
like-- and from being with
people like His Holiness

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.130 align:middle line:84%
the Dalai Lama of Tibet or
my other gurus and masters

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.990 align:middle line:84%
during the 20 or 25 years
I lived in Asia with them,

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
that they carry their
own atmosphere with them

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.050 align:middle line:90%
wherever they go.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.860 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
something that sort of has

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.330 align:middle line:90%
been transmitted to me.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.550 align:middle line:84%
My mission as transmission
is to pass it on to you

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.450 align:middle line:90%
and to others.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, His
Holiness has it.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.830 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a calm.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
It's a calm that
ripples through a room.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.540 align:middle line:90%
Is that karma?

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's the karma from
spiritual practice from gaining

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.170 align:middle line:90%
inner strength.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.660 align:middle line:84%
When you do spiritual
practice, you

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.920 align:middle line:84%
strengthen your inner source,
your inner focus, your light.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Your inner light gets more
focused, but also more radiant.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So we call it in
Tibet [INAUDIBLE],,

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.015 align:middle line:90%
where authentic presence.

00:05:45.015 --> 00:05:46.890 align:middle line:84%
A cheap way of translating
would be charisma,

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.410 align:middle line:84%
but it's more like
authentic presence.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you've got it
going on, as they say.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It's also from not doing
anything if we can just be.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.110 align:middle line:84%
I'm not coming into a room
trying to make any ripples

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.420 align:middle line:84%
or anything, just
walking into the room

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.240 align:middle line:84%
and meeting people
maybe I've seen before.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:84%
We've never met in
this life, but I feel

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.470 align:middle line:90%
like you're my friend already.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.190 align:middle line:84%
We must have known
each other before.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I recognized you.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.808 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:13.350 align:middle line:84%
I do think when that happens,
it's a question of remembering.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.490 align:middle line:84%
Because when you came in
just a moment ago, I thought,

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.170 align:middle line:90%
I know him.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.970 align:middle line:90%
I know him.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.637 align:middle line:84%
It was like I'd gone
to school with you,

00:06:21.637 --> 00:06:23.830 align:middle line:84%
but it was probably
thousands of years ago.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.030 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a different school,
a different form of higher

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.300 align:middle line:90%
education.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Being a Buddhist who teaches
Buddhism all over the world,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.730 align:middle line:84%
are you concerned that
specifically here in America

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:42.570 align:middle line:84%
there seem to be so many
different kinds of Buddhism

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.220 align:middle line:84%
that it loses some of
the essence of Buddhism?

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.462 align:middle line:90%
>> Not really, Chantal.

00:06:48.462 --> 00:06:50.670 align:middle line:10%
There are many different
kinds of sects, and schools,

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.460 align:middle line:10%
and lineages as there
were in the old countries.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.480 align:middle line:10%
And this is natural.

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.640 align:middle line:10%
And people need to
find the essence

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.910 align:middle line:10%
of the path for themselves
individually and also as groups

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:00.900 align:middle line:10%
form.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.370 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's healthy.

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:05.270 align:middle line:84%
The essence never changes
anyway, but the forms change.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.660 align:middle line:84%
As any Dharma spiritual
teaching comes to a new culture,

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.580 align:middle line:84%
perhaps we meditate
in chairs in America,

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:12.663 align:middle line:90%
but it's still meditation.

00:07:12.663 --> 00:07:14.430 align:middle line:84%
It's something we
do with our heart

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.230 align:middle line:90%
and our mind, our mindfulness.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.270 align:middle line:84%
So the chairs or sitting on the
floor doesn't change anything.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.360 align:middle line:84%
So I think as there are
many kinds of people

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.310 align:middle line:84%
with various inclinations,
it's appropriate

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.920 align:middle line:84%
that there are different sects,
and schools, and lineages.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we have to recognize
that because of a new country,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.290 align:middle line:84%
and commercialism,
and our speedy times.

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:84%
It may be that if you have
some exposure to Buddhism,

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:36.420 align:middle line:90%
it might not be the most--

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.130 align:middle line:84%
you might not be meeting
the most experienced teacher

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.430 align:middle line:90%
with the oldest sect.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.740 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan Buddhism
is 2,000 years old.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.155 align:middle line:84%
But there are some new sects
that post-war Japanese sects--

00:07:47.155 --> 00:07:48.530 align:middle line:84%
that it started
where people were

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:51.550 align:middle line:84%
chanting to get cars
and get better jobs.

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:53.800 align:middle line:84%
So it's a little bit of
a dilution of the deeper

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.040 align:middle line:84%
spiritual message,
although we have to admit,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.470 align:middle line:84%
people are praying to God
to get better jobs, also.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.540 align:middle line:84%
So that's always been
part of spirituality.

00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.950 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the people that
I love most in the world,

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:06.750 align:middle line:84%
some of the people I
respect most in the world,

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.910 align:middle line:84%
and some of the people
that I want to emulate most

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.830 align:middle line:84%
in the world like
you, for example,

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.140 align:middle line:84%
that I want to be more
like across the boards,

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.830 align:middle line:90%
they're Buddhists.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.950 align:middle line:10%
What happens to the people
who go into Buddhism

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.950 align:middle line:10%
and come out and say, oh,
man, that didn't work.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm always puzzled by that.

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.310 align:middle line:84%
Because the people who are in
it are so happy and so centered.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Maybe it's not the right fit,
or maybe it wasn't the right

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.250 align:middle line:84%
time, or maybe they didn't
really take the medicine.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.230 align:middle line:84%
If you think of
spiritual teachings

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:40.799 align:middle line:84%
as medicine for what
ails us, then it's

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.270 align:middle line:84%
not just that a
doctor or a master

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.560 align:middle line:84%
prescribes it or shows
you how to use it.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.960 align:middle line:90%
You have to take it yourself.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And on the spiritual
journey, as you know,

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.550 align:middle line:84%
is something we have to look
into every day in every part

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.040 align:middle line:84%
of our life, not just
in church on Sunday

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:54.580 align:middle line:90%
or on the high holy days.

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.700 align:middle line:84%
So if we don't really
take the medicine,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.490 align:middle line:84%
if we don't heal ourselves,
if we don't do the spiritual

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
practices, if we don't change
our lives, if we don't--

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.560 align:middle line:84%
if we call ourselves
truth seekers,

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.127 align:middle line:84%
but we're not
truth tellers, it's

00:09:09.127 --> 00:09:10.710 align:middle line:84%
not going to bring
us the satisfaction

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
and the deathless
peace that we want.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it's certainly not.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.420 align:middle line:90%
It's certainly not.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.470 align:middle line:90%
How does one begin?

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right here.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.760 align:middle line:84%
We begin right
here, where we are.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:24.660 align:middle line:84%
We begin by waking up, perhaps
even now, like relaxing

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.530 align:middle line:90%
and taking a breath.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.490 align:middle line:90%


00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.165 align:middle line:90%
Breathe, relax, and smile.

00:09:31.165 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:90%
It's as easy as that.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.010 align:middle line:84%
We have a moment of,
quote, "enlightenment."

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
It's not deathless bliss, but
it's a moment of mindfulness.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And we can do that
anywhere at work.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:43.420 align:middle line:84%
We're sitting in a
car at a red light,

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.712 align:middle line:84%
or we're standing at the
elevator waiting for the doors

00:09:45.712 --> 00:09:46.530 align:middle line:90%
to open.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:84%
We can have a moment of
mindfulness or moment of prayer

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.440 align:middle line:84%
where we can look into
another and see-- recognize

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.883 align:middle line:90%
the light in them at anytime.

00:09:54.883 --> 00:09:57.300 align:middle line:84%
And that's something we need
to begin here and now, today,

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
not just later when we
study foreign languages

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.420 align:middle line:84%
or we wait for the Dalai Lama
to come to America next year.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.760 align:middle line:84%
I think we can start preparing
ourselves this moment.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:90%
>> You write about mindfulness.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.000 align:middle line:84%
And I've heard Thich Nhat
Hanh, the great zen master,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.350 align:middle line:90%
speak of it.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.630 align:middle line:84%
What is mindfulness for someone
watching this broadcast?

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.430 align:middle line:90%
What is it?

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Mindfulness is the
opposite of mindlessness.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.520 align:middle line:84%
We all know what
mindlessness is.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.310 align:middle line:84%
We all know what
sleepwalking is like.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:25.530 align:middle line:84%
Mindfulness helps
us be more awake

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.580 align:middle line:84%
rather than sleepwalking
through life.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.220 align:middle line:84%
So we are more
mindful rather than

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.560 align:middle line:84%
mindless with full
presence of mind

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.720 align:middle line:84%
and full attention to what
we're doing and seeing reality

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.520 align:middle line:90%
as it is.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.750 align:middle line:84%
Clear seeing rather than seeing
it as it ain't as we often do.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Just seeing our
projections or living

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.122 align:middle line:84%
in the past or the
future, we're overlooking

00:10:44.122 --> 00:10:46.080 align:middle line:84%
what's right here before
our eyes, which really

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:48.210 align:middle line:90%
is glorious and marvelous.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.710 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you
choose your teachers?

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Did you recognize them?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I recognized them, but
it's not as simple as that.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:55.320 align:middle line:90%
I followed my heart.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.170 align:middle line:84%
I traveled around in India
and the Himalayan countries

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and Far Eastern
countries in the '70s.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.370 align:middle line:84%
And I lived with
different teachers.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Finally, I became a monk in
the Tibetan Buddhist cloister.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.570 align:middle line:90%
And it's a matter of the heart.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.123 align:middle line:84%
And some people
have one teacher.

00:11:10.123 --> 00:11:11.790 align:middle line:84%
Some people find many
different teachers

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.207 align:middle line:84%
at different parts
of the journey.

00:11:13.207 --> 00:11:22.490 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.340 align:middle line:10%
>> When you are on the path to
Buddhism and you are looking

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.830 align:middle line:10%
for a teacher, are there
teachers that you can walk away

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:29.630 align:middle line:10%
from?

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:31.132 align:middle line:90%
>> This one's not for me?

00:11:31.132 --> 00:11:31.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, absolutely.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.800 align:middle line:10%
It's very important,
Chantal, today

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:10%
to realize that we live in
a multi-cultural, diverse

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:38.390 align:middle line:10%
reality.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.850 align:middle line:10%
There's all kinds of
melting pot karma here.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:10%
So we need melting pot Dharma.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.180 align:middle line:84%
We need to do some
window shopping.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.920 align:middle line:84%
We've probably-- many of us
left our pulpit of origin.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So we need to check
things out, not

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.793 align:middle line:84%
just inherit what our parents
did and window shopping.

00:11:51.793 --> 00:11:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And then not just
window shopping,

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.920 align:middle line:90%
but going in and trying it on.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And then maybe, quote,
"buying" it and taking it home.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like it,
you can still return it.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And there are different
levels of teachers, everything

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.040 align:middle line:84%
from enlightened
masters and gurus

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:07.700 align:middle line:84%
to mere teachers
and instructors,

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.370 align:middle line:84%
to just elders who have been
a little further ahead of us

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.400 align:middle line:90%
on the path.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.700 align:middle line:84%
And we certainly can check them
out and walk away from them.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.230 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if you sign on
with a guru who really requires

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:21.680 align:middle line:84%
devotion and obedience
then, as some do,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.278 align:middle line:84%
then it's a little
more complicated.

00:12:23.278 --> 00:12:24.320 align:middle line:90%
But that's a later stage.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:84%
That's not in the beginning
or even in the middle.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:31.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk a little bit about
the importance of a teacher.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot
of people think-- well,

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.240 align:middle line:90%
they can read a book.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:35.600 align:middle line:90%
They could read one of--

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:35.630 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.440 align:middle line:90%
>> --your books.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.898 align:middle line:84%
>> They could read
one of my books,

00:12:37.898 --> 00:12:39.640 align:middle line:90%
but those are just books.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.570 align:middle line:10%
Painted cakes don't
satisfy our hunger,

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:44.253 align:middle line:10%
as Ram Dass used to say.

00:12:44.253 --> 00:12:45.920 align:middle line:10%
And I think it's very
important to res--

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.750 align:middle line:10%
I got a lot out
of my relationship

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.710 align:middle line:10%
with spiritual teachers myself.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:10%
And I think we all have elders
and mentors in our life.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.355 align:middle line:84%
So although we may
be anti-authoritarian

00:12:55.355 --> 00:12:59.390 align:middle line:84%
at a certain point, we may
be cynical about gurus,

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:02.120 align:middle line:84%
because of various things
that have happened.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Still, there are many
people who can teach us

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.645 align:middle line:84%
a lot about the path and who
have been up to the mountaintop

00:13:07.645 --> 00:13:09.770 align:middle line:84%
before us and can save us
in trouble along the way,

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:11.150 align:middle line:90%
give us a tremendous boost.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.910 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it's not just about
finding an authentic teacher.

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.560 align:middle line:84%
One has to be an
authentic student,

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.640 align:middle line:84%
then into authentic spark where
transmission of relationship

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.727 align:middle line:90%
can transpire.

00:13:20.727 --> 00:13:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And that can really
change everything.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.540 align:middle line:90%
That's like booster rockets.

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.440 align:middle line:84%
That's not just a little more
learning in the mental memory

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.580 align:middle line:90%
banks.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And other whole
dimensions can open.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.623 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so well said.

00:13:32.623 --> 00:13:34.040 align:middle line:84%
I've never heard
anybody say that,

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:90%
but it makes great sense to me.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.080 align:middle line:84%
What are the qualities
of an authentic student?

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.928 align:middle line:90%
What must I be?

00:13:40.928 --> 00:13:43.220 align:middle line:84%
>> You just have to be yourself
and be very honest with

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.870 align:middle line:84%
yourself, like
what's bothering you.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.257 align:middle line:90%
And what are you looking for?

00:13:46.257 --> 00:13:47.090 align:middle line:90%
And you can find it.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.235 align:middle line:90%
You can go directly to it.

00:13:48.235 --> 00:13:49.610 align:middle line:84%
We're very honest
with ourselves.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.300 align:middle line:84%
Ask our questions,
not pretend, and not

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:84%
enter into the spiritual
path just in one more form

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.270 align:middle line:90%
of consumerism or materialism.

00:13:59.270 --> 00:14:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Like Rinpoche-- Chogyam Trungpa,
the great Buddhist pioneer

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.110 align:middle line:84%
from Tibet, founder of
Naropa institute in Colorado

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.480 align:middle line:84%
said-- called it
spiritual materialism.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.360 align:middle line:84%
We can get into the spirituality
just like materialism--

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.745 align:middle line:84%
having more experiences,
collecting teachers

00:14:13.745 --> 00:14:17.330 align:middle line:84%
or initiations, putting
religious and spiritual art

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
in our lives and not really
changing or transforming

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.580 align:middle line:84%
our hearts, not really
awakening our minds

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and opening our hearts to the
love and the truth that is

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.890 align:middle line:90%
within us and within everyone.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.390 align:middle line:84%
That would be
spiritual materialism.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So if we're very honest with
ourselves-- and I think we

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.810 align:middle line:90%
all are sincere.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:35.760 align:middle line:84%
We have a good heart,
innate goodness in us,

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.340 align:middle line:84%
tender hearted
underneath, whatever

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:84%
persona we've
accumulated, whatever

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.320 align:middle line:84%
armor we've donned
to get through life.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.260 align:middle line:84%
If we could access that little
Buddha, that little child,

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.368 align:middle line:84%
that pure spirit, that
tender heart in us

00:14:47.368 --> 00:14:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and bring that forth
on the spiritual path,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.260 align:middle line:90%
we're already halfway there.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I was just reading
Elizabeth Lesser's new book,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.690 align:middle line:90%
the "New American Spirituality."

00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And she speaks a great deal
about spiritual materialism,

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.230 align:middle line:84%
things to avoid as
you're on your path.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:84%
They are difficult
to avoid sometimes.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, well, we
all fall into those.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:08.420 align:middle line:90%
And that's fine.

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.220 align:middle line:90%
That's human.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.120 align:middle line:84%
We're very human, but we're
also very spiritual by nature.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's not think it's
impossible or difficult.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Just like I said, let's
be honest with ourselves

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.850 align:middle line:84%
about what's bothering us,
and what we're looking for,

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.490 align:middle line:84%
and not pretend that we know
it all, that we don't need

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:84%
anything, that we're
totally autonomous,

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:29.380 align:middle line:84%
independent grown-ups, we don't
need teachers, we know it all,

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:30.950 align:middle line:90%
or no one can help me.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.570 align:middle line:84%
I mean, sometimes
it's really helpful

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:36.980 align:middle line:84%
just to ask someone to help you,
ask a teacher for teachings.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's where bowing,
or requesting, or inviting,

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.030 align:middle line:90%
or making offerings--

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.300 align:middle line:84%
we get in relation
to what we receive.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.140 align:middle line:90%
We give.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.950 align:middle line:84%
The more we give, the
more we can receive.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.333 align:middle line:84%
So it's a way of
humbling ourselves,

00:15:49.333 --> 00:15:51.500 align:middle line:84%
emptying our cup a little
bit, so something else can

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.220 align:middle line:90%
be poured in.

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.170 align:middle line:84%
Usually, we're so full
that there's nothing--

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:56.450 align:middle line:84%
no room for any
grace to come in.

00:15:56.450 --> 00:16:00.230 align:middle line:90%
>> How does one begin to empty?

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.328 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a
really subtle question.

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:84%
I think we have to begin
by slowing down a little

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.150 align:middle line:84%
and seeing where we
are and take stock.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:11.285 align:middle line:84%
What is my real question
we could ask ourselves?

00:16:11.285 --> 00:16:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Not just, what is Buddhism?

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:84%
But what's really burning
up my bottom right now?

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.620 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem in my life?

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:20.770 align:middle line:90%
Not enough love?

00:16:20.770 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:90%
No time?

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.100 align:middle line:90%
Bad health?

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.410 align:middle line:90%
Bad relationships?

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:90%
Or just fear of death?

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:28.880 align:middle line:84%
"Just" means
everybody has these--

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.760 align:middle line:90%
>> --existential issues.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.100 align:middle line:84%
Why do we have to die
and things like that?

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.980 align:middle line:90%
Or why am I not often satisfied?

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:90%
Or why am I dissatisfied?

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's a basic issue.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.942 align:middle line:84%
If we could look at
that, that starts

00:16:40.942 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:84%
to empty out some of
the other concerns

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.557 align:middle line:84%
collecting what
kinds of experiences.

00:16:44.557 --> 00:16:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Having experience is not enough.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:47.432 align:middle line:84%
We need to learn
from our experiences

00:16:47.432 --> 00:16:49.330 align:middle line:90%
to become experienced elders.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.550 align:middle line:10%
>> That's interesting, because I
think a lot of people don't ask

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.350 align:middle line:10%
that question.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:57.090 align:middle line:10%
People's sense of malaise,
if you will, in their soul.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.960 align:middle line:90%
And they go try to fix it.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.300 align:middle line:84%
And most of the time when
we're trying to fix something,

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:90%
it's putting things in us.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.569 align:middle line:84%
Well, fixing it is just
one way of looking at it.

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:06.609 align:middle line:90%
I try to teach.

00:17:06.609 --> 00:17:09.460 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I come from the
tradition of Tibetan Buddhism

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:10%
called Dzogchen, the natural
perfection teachings,

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.753 align:middle line:10%
the natural Buddha teachings
that teaches us that we all

00:17:14.753 --> 00:17:16.420 align:middle line:10%
have it in us already,
so we're not just

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.770 align:middle line:10%
trying to fix ourselves.

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.869 align:middle line:10%
We're also learning to
love and accept ourselves

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:23.140 align:middle line:10%
as we are and see that the
Buddha is in me, Buddha meaning

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:10%
the light or the divine.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.430 align:middle line:84%
However you want to put it is
in me and is in you as we are.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:30.820 align:middle line:84%
Then we can keep perfecting
ourselves endlessly

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.615 align:middle line:84%
without feeling inferior or
that we're never good enough.

00:17:34.615 --> 00:17:35.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is very important.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Then we feel more motivated.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.730 align:middle line:84%
We kind of catch an updraft
that we can soar on.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't seem so far away.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.900 align:middle line:84%
We don't start to project it
outwards like, oh, the Dalai

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Lama, Mother Teresa have
it, but not little me.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:48.640 align:middle line:90%
>> We all have it?

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.250 align:middle line:90%
>> We all have it.

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:49.980 align:middle line:90%
We all are.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.470 align:middle line:84%
There's not one of
us that doesn't.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:52.870 align:middle line:90%
The light is in each of us.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's how we can
begin practicing, also

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:57.670 align:middle line:84%
by noticing that the
light is in each of us,

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.010 align:middle line:84%
not just the people
we like, also.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:84%
You mean, people
we might not like?

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.275 align:middle line:84%
>> Even the people
we don't agree with,

00:18:04.275 --> 00:18:06.850 align:middle line:84%
and even in the animals, and
the light shining on every blade

00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.550 align:middle line:84%
of grass, and every flower,
and every ant, also.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:10.420 align:middle line:90%
Every moment.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Everybody?

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.140 align:middle line:90%
Even the world's great tyrants?

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:14.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Hitler?

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.000 align:middle line:90%
People like that?

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.000 align:middle line:90%
Did Hitler have a light?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.290 align:middle line:84%
It was extremely occluded
and covered over.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:22.840 align:middle line:90%
But let's talk English.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Can we say Hitler was
not a child of God?

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.265 align:middle line:84%
He may have been a
benighted one, but--

00:18:28.265 --> 00:18:29.390 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I guess we couldn't.

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:30.930 align:middle line:84%
>> --aren't we all
children of God?

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:31.930 align:middle line:90%
So that's what it means.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And it's just a
matter of whether we

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.050 align:middle line:90%
use that potential or not.

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And he had some difficult
upbringing and other issues.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.690 align:middle line:90%
Also, many people in history--

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.480 align:middle line:84%
really, it's not just
them-- personality--

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.050 align:middle line:84%
but it's the convergence
of historical, and karmic,

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:50.170 align:middle line:84%
and social forces that
produces a Gandhi on one hand,

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.750 align:middle line:84%
Martin Luther King on one
hand, or Hitler, or Pol

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.130 align:middle line:90%
Pot on the other.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:55.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.420 align:middle line:90%
People talk about--

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.742 align:middle line:84%
>> Then we need to have
compassion for those people,

00:18:58.742 --> 00:18:59.950 align:middle line:90%
just like any other children.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.800 align:middle line:84%
The children who were
truants or delinquents--

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.210 align:middle line:90%
we don't give up on right away.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.570 align:middle line:84%
So Hitler was like
a spiritual child

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.820 align:middle line:90%
we don't need to give up on.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.110 align:middle line:90%
We can pray for him to go--

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:15.520 align:middle line:84%
when he pays his dues, to get to
a better place in another life.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:19.240 align:middle line:84%
>> I think some people who
are resistant to Buddhism are

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:24.370 align:middle line:84%
the people who say, I don't
understand how someone can use

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:84%
karma to explain something
away or to write something off,

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.950 align:middle line:84%
like the students in Columbine,
to use a painful example.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:36.707 align:middle line:90%
Was it their karma to die?

00:19:36.707 --> 00:19:37.540 align:middle line:90%
>> I suppose it was.

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:39.310 align:middle line:84%
But it's hard to
understand karma.

00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.900 align:middle line:90%
Karma really is not mysterious.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.310 align:middle line:90%
It just means cause and effect.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.640 align:middle line:90%
Nothing happens by accident.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> So there was some reason
that those children were there

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:49.420 align:middle line:90%
and others weren't.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But there are so many millions
of reasons that conspire

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.620 align:middle line:90%
to make any one thing happen.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:84%
It's very difficult to
say why so and so was

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.810 align:middle line:84%
in the library that
day, and the other ones

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:84%
stayed home from school
and didn't get shot.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.550 align:middle line:90%
Millions of reasons.

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:03.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:04.490 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's not that simple.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:05.907 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
like saying karma

00:20:05.907 --> 00:20:07.865 align:middle line:84%
doesn't mean everything
is scripted and written

00:20:07.865 --> 00:20:08.880 align:middle line:90%
down beforehand.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.950 align:middle line:84%
There's a confluence of millions
of forces that come together

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:84%
to bring us here in this room
together now, not just one.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I think so.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:84%
>> And similarly, things
happened at Columbine that

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.340 align:middle line:84%
we're all part of-- the
violence, and aggression,

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.710 align:middle line:90%
and the competition in society.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:middle line:90%
We're all part of that.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:26.345 align:middle line:84%
And I think the more
we recognize that,

00:20:26.345 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:84%
the more we can work on that
together to root that out

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.460 align:middle line:84%
or to heal those divisions in
ourselves, and in our families,

00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and in our communities
and schools.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:39.430 align:middle line:84%
>> I've heard people say it
would be hard for me to be

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.140 align:middle line:84%
a Buddhist, because I
don't have the discipline.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.495 align:middle line:84%
Well, people think different
things about Buddhism, just

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:46.370 align:middle line:90%
like everything else.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.950 align:middle line:84%
Some people think
the discipline.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:49.742 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else would
think it means you have

00:20:49.742 --> 00:20:52.570 align:middle line:90%
to be a pacifist, a vegetarian.

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:53.590 align:middle line:90%
>> You can't eat meat.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.860 align:middle line:84%
>> A heterosexual, a
teetotaler, or whatever.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.000 align:middle line:84%
But these are all
just tiny feathers

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.180 align:middle line:84%
on a multi-plumed,
beautiful bird.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.070 align:middle line:84%
There's really no
prescriptions in Buddhism

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.030 align:middle line:90%
for how you have to be.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.660 align:middle line:84%
The principles are ethical
and non-violent wise living.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:84%
And some people
like the Dalai Lama

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.150 align:middle line:84%
even eats meat by
doctor's orders now,

00:21:16.150 --> 00:21:18.250 align:middle line:84%
but not everybody
has to be vegetarian

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.030 align:middle line:90%
or any of those other things.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.330 align:middle line:84%
The point is that
we align ourselves

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.940 align:middle line:84%
with the path of enlightenment,
and that we take refuge,

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.350 align:middle line:84%
or we go towards this notion
that all can likewise awaken.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.277 align:middle line:84%
And we live in a somewhat
enlightened and ethical manner,

00:21:32.277 --> 00:21:33.360 align:middle line:90%
even if we're not perfect.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Maybe we're perfect
enough that we

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:36.610 align:middle line:90%
can love ourselves as we are.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.830 align:middle line:84%
That's the essence
of Buddhism to awaken

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:44.560 align:middle line:84%
to that innate perfection
in each of us right now.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.270 align:middle line:84%
>> How long have
you been a Buddhist?

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:47.860 align:middle line:90%
>> 30 years.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:49.960 align:middle line:90%
>> 30 years?

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.830 align:middle line:90%
Do you still lose your temper?

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.898 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I never lose my temper.

00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:55.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I'd like to get there.

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:56.857 align:middle line:90%
>> But maybe I should.

00:21:56.857 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.200 align:middle line:90%


00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I think a lot of people--

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.440 align:middle line:84%
I mean, to be angry is
a very normal thing.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, anger is fine.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:90%
Anger is just an energy.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:08.490 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
be afraid of it.

00:22:08.490 --> 00:22:09.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an energy.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.840 align:middle line:84%
>> We shouldn't suppress it,
nor do we need to act it out

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.800 align:middle line:90%
unconsciously.

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.970 align:middle line:90%
We can just experience it.

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.270 align:middle line:84%
And then we can express it more
skillfully, more consciously,

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:18.980 align:middle line:84%
more healthfully,
maybe creatively

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.100 align:middle line:84%
rather than just dumping
on people or being violent.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.040 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you personally--
if you don't mind my asking

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:84%
a personal question, have
now as a result of Buddhism--

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:32.110 align:middle line:84%
your practice, your
mindfulness that you didn't?

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Nothing but peace of mind.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.925 align:middle line:84%
>> You have nothing but
peace of mind in your life?

00:22:35.925 --> 00:22:36.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Peace of mind.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:37.560 align:middle line:90%
Peace of mind.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:38.852 align:middle line:90%
I found what I was looking for.

00:22:38.852 --> 00:22:40.550 align:middle line:90%
That's all I have.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.020 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I have a few computers
and things like that.

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:46.180 align:middle line:84%
But as the Buddha said
when he was enlightened--

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.340 align:middle line:84%
in the "Diamond Sutra," it says
this description of Buddhism.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.710 align:middle line:84%
When I was-- reached
full, perfect, unexcelled

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:54.920 align:middle line:84%
enlightenment, I had
not gained anything

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.260 align:middle line:90%
that I didn't have before.

00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.720 align:middle line:84%
But of course, that means
he awoke or realized who

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.225 align:middle line:90%
and what he was, what he had.

00:23:01.225 --> 00:23:02.600 align:middle line:84%
We can realize
the inner treasure

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.892 align:middle line:84%
is different than not knowing
there's a treasure buried

00:23:04.892 --> 00:23:06.590 align:middle line:90%
under our hearts.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.610 align:middle line:90%
We need to discover it.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:09.935 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's up to us to decide.

00:23:09.935 --> 00:23:11.268 align:middle line:90%
>> It's up to us to discover it.

00:23:11.268 --> 00:23:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Do a little digging to awaken
to who and what we really are.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.740 align:middle line:90%
That's the essence of Dharma.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.470 align:middle line:90%
That's timeless wisdom.

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:22.287 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I must say you
serve as a perfect example.

00:23:22.287 --> 00:23:23.370 align:middle line:90%
And I thank you for this--

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:24.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>> --conversation.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:25.700 align:middle line:90%
>> And God bless.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.460 align:middle line:90%
Buddha bless.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.300 align:middle line:90%
