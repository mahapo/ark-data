was a revolutionary.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And he revolutionized
the Indian society,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.570 align:middle line:84%
and Buddhism revolutionized
every society where it went.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.960 align:middle line:84%
But the reason why
people haven't noticed

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.290 align:middle line:84%
was that it wasn't what we
would call a hot revolution,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.430 align:middle line:90%
like Lenin or something.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.780 align:middle line:90%

in 1959.

These Tibetan monks, ,
performing recently in Phoenix

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.530 align:middle line:10%
were driven from their centuries
old monastery and-- along with

political activism,

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.720 align:middle line:84%
perhaps an unexpected quality
among gentle Buddhists,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.850 align:middle line:84%
is a natural outgrowth
of what it really

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.860 align:middle line:90%
means to be a Buddhist.

pleasure to sit down with you.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.492 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a great pleasure
to be with you, Chantal.

00:01:51.492 --> 00:01:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>> I thank you.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.760 align:middle line:10%
Because the Buddhist way--

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:10%
to the best of my knowledge--

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.420 align:middle line:10%
is a simple way, let's begin
with a simple question.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.230 align:middle line:90%
What is a Buddhist?

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.170 align:middle line:90%
>> What is a Buddhist?

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.970 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, a Buddhist can be
pretty much whatever they want

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.928 align:middle line:10%
to be, you could
say, in general.

00:02:10.928 --> 00:02:12.470 align:middle line:10%
Technically, you
would say a Buddhist

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.070 align:middle line:10%
is a person who has taken
refuge in the Three Jewels--

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.480 align:middle line:10%
of the Buddha,
who is the teacher

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.670 align:middle line:10%
of the way to
enlightenment, the Dharma,

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.800 align:middle line:10%
which is enlightenment
itself and the reality

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.730 align:middle line:10%
that underlies it and the
reality that unfolds our lives,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:10%
and the Sangha is
the community that--

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.190 align:middle line:10%
of those who are
seeking that same way.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.260 align:middle line:84%
So a Buddhist is one
who has taken refuge

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.060 align:middle line:90%
with those Three Jewels.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:84%
They're jewels because they're
so valuable and rare in sort

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.570 align:middle line:84%
of the ocean of life's
possibilities, you could say.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.500 align:middle line:90%
That's a Buddhist.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.600 align:middle line:84%
>> It is interesting to me
that, despite the huge variety

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.640 align:middle line:84%
of religions we have in
America, and so of them so old

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.580 align:middle line:84%
and so powerful, so strong, so
many millions of Americans are

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:84%
attracted to
Buddhism these days?

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.720 align:middle line:90%
Why do you suppose that is?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think because
Buddhism is basically a way

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.640 align:middle line:90%
to freedom.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.100 align:middle line:84%
The reason you take refuge
in those Three Jewels

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.850 align:middle line:84%
is that you want to find
freedom from suffering, freedom

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.400 align:middle line:84%
from sort of being
caught automatically

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.550 align:middle line:84%
in involuntary responses
and sort of bondage

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.550 align:middle line:84%
to this and that drives and
reactions and things like that.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.560 align:middle line:84%
And people in America, we
sort of admire freedom.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a constitutional right of
ours to have it and seek it.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.130 align:middle line:84%
We don't really doesn't
know what it is,

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
but we vaguely feel that
if we have more of it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.150 align:middle line:90%
we'll be more happy.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.950 align:middle line:90%


00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And so since Buddhism is a
sort of technical, inner way

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.518 align:middle line:84%
to freedom, it kind of fits
with our sense of the outer--

00:03:42.518 --> 00:03:44.060 align:middle line:84%
the outer world,
you know, our notion

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
of political freedom and
freedom of the individual,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.510 align:middle line:90%
this sort of thing.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.610 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism is very,
very suited for that.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.680 align:middle line:84%
It's a method of
how to achieve that.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.110 align:middle line:90%
And people are attracted to it.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Luckily, Chantal, most
of the Buddhist groups

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.860 align:middle line:84%
are not active proselytizers
or missionaries.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And they don't seek to
just increase their numbers

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.920 align:middle line:84%
by enrolling a lot of people
nominally in the Buddhist

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:90%
orders.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And so we're not making a
big campaign or something

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.652 align:middle line:84%
like that, which
I think would be--

00:04:12.652 --> 00:04:14.360 align:middle line:84%
would be-- it's the
wrong type of history

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.390 align:middle line:84%
to go around and have
religious competition, I think.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.029 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, there seem to
be so many different kinds

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:90%
of Buddhist groups.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Just in Los Angeles,
where I live,

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
there are so many
different Buddhist sects.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:90%
Mm-hmm.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Does that concern you, or
does it concern His Holiness,

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.430 align:middle line:84%
that the essence of Buddhism
will be lost when there are

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.830 align:middle line:90%
so many different kinds?

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.970 align:middle line:90%
>> No, I don't think so.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.620 align:middle line:84%
There have always been
many different kinds.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.412 align:middle line:84%
You know, the early
teaching of the Buddha,

00:04:41.412 --> 00:04:44.750 align:middle line:84%
the monastic teaching, divided
into 18 different orders,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.850 align:middle line:84%
based on minor things
like whether or not

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:49.310 align:middle line:84%
you could have three ounces
of salt in your wallet

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
or not as a monk,
minor sort of thing,

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.400 align:middle line:84%
whether, when a monk had a wet
dream, it was a sin or not--

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.917 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

00:04:56.917 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's just human
nature, I think, Chantal.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.190 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't worry His Holiness.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Actually, His Holiness has
an attitude, the Dalai Lama,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and a formal policy,
which he states regularly,

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.900 align:middle line:84%
that he would prefer
not to convert

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.580 align:middle line:90%
many people to Buddhism.

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And he hopes that Christians
will remain Christians, Jews,

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.920 align:middle line:90%
Jews, humanists, humanists.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But if they can find anything of
value from Buddhist meditation,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.340 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist philosophy or
psychology, Buddhist ethics,

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:84%
by all means, make
use of it, but stay

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.100 align:middle line:84%
within their own sort of ritual
and denominational matrix

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.410 align:middle line:84%
with their families
and their traditions

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.410 align:middle line:84%
so as to avoid stress and
conflict in their lives.

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.540 align:middle line:84%
Only the very few
who, at some point,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
decide they want to really
meditate in an advanced way

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.290 align:middle line:84%
or do something
like that, he thinks

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.310 align:middle line:84%
then, if they wish,
then, of course,

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.330 align:middle line:84%
they should be free
in a free country.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't encourage people
to shift denomination and as

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.843 align:middle line:84%
if that would solve
their problems.

00:05:47.843 --> 00:05:49.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Speaking of meditation
in the Buddhist way,

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:84%
I have a wonderful friend who is
a devout Buddhist, Jamie Otis.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:90%
On Sundays, he is silent.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Mm-hmm, that's right.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.630 align:middle line:84%
>> In fact, I think he's
writing a book called--

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.070 align:middle line:90%
let's give Jamie a plug.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.510 align:middle line:84%
He's writing a book called
"Silent Sundays, One Man's

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:90%
Journey."

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.540 align:middle line:84%
I didn't actually realize
that he was actually

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:06.415 align:middle line:90%
writing it as a book.

00:06:06.415 --> 00:06:07.670 align:middle line:90%
But I knew they have it.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, there's talk of it.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.543 align:middle line:84%
>> And his habit is to
be completely silent.

00:06:11.543 --> 00:06:12.343 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:06:12.343 --> 00:06:13.193 align:middle line:90%
He is.

00:06:13.193 --> 00:06:14.110 align:middle line:90%
He really does it too.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%
He writes you notes if you
try to say something to him.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.090 align:middle line:84%
>> And you know, because
I'm around Jamie,

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.257 align:middle line:90%
I try it every now and then.

00:06:20.257 --> 00:06:21.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's hard.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.685 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:21.685 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.320 align:middle line:90%
>> It's very hard.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.935 align:middle line:90%
>> It's good, though.

00:06:23.935 --> 00:06:25.300 align:middle line:90%
It makes you think about things.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.560 align:middle line:84%
He communicates with his
gestures, his expressions,

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.360 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.870 align:middle line:90%
Well, you've noticed that.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It's wonderful.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> So my question to you is,
what does silence bring to us?

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Because I know it is very
often the Buddhist way

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.500 align:middle line:84%
to meditate in silence, to be
silent, as our friend Jamie is.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:90%
What gift--

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, but sometimes we
do have type A Buddhists.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.480 align:middle line:90%
I am one of them.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Aha.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I am a noisy Buddhist.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So I don't reify
silence, although there

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:50.500 align:middle line:90%
is a famous thing.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.690 align:middle line:84%
There is a sutra
that I translated

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.120 align:middle line:84%
called "The Holy
Teaching of Vimalakirti."

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.470 align:middle line:10%
And in that, in chapter 9,
there is a very famous point

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.140 align:middle line:10%
where, after asking 32
different people what

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.240 align:middle line:10%
their view of the nature
of ultimate reality was,

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.470 align:middle line:10%
the highest reality
type of question--

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.220 align:middle line:84%
>> --they then turned
to Vimalakirti himself,

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.570 align:middle line:84%
who was presiding,
and they say, well,

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.593 align:middle line:84%
we've all said what
we wanted to say.

00:07:13.593 --> 00:07:15.010 align:middle line:84%
What do you think,
Vimalakirti, is

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:16.570 align:middle line:90%
the highest nature of reality?

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.640 align:middle line:84%
At which point, Vimalakirti
remained silent.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.480 align:middle line:84%
And they call that the lion's
roar of the Vimalakirti

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.650 align:middle line:90%
silence.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.080 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, they consider
it sort of the most profound.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:90%
It's sort of this--

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.460 align:middle line:84%
But now, in the
same sutra, there's

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
a goddess who comes out of
the woodwork at one point, who

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.260 align:middle line:90%
is a very enlightened goddess.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.420 align:middle line:84%
And she's teasing
the different monks.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:84%
And at one time, in teasing
this one head monk, who's

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:84%
a very enlightened
head monk, she

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.100 align:middle line:84%
asked him, well, how long
have you been enlightened,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.135 align:middle line:90%
by the way, type of thing.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.760 align:middle line:84%
Because he's asking
her some questions.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well, how long
have you been enlightened,

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:53.670 align:middle line:90%
she says.

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And then he doesn't
say anything.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.070 align:middle line:84%
So then she doesn't accept
that as something profound.

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.252 align:middle line:84%
And she says, excuse me,
Venerable Shariputra,

00:08:02.252 --> 00:08:03.210 align:middle line:90%
I asked you a question.

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.992 align:middle line:90%
It's your turn to respond.

00:08:04.992 --> 00:08:07.200 align:middle line:84%
Like, how come you're not
answering when I asked you,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.220 align:middle line:84%
how long have you
been enlightened?

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:09.360 align:middle line:84%
You just indicated something
about enlightenment.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.068 align:middle line:84%
Well, how long have
you been enlightened?

00:08:11.068 --> 00:08:12.693 align:middle line:84%
So he says, well, I
didn't say anything

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:14.850 align:middle line:84%
because I thought that,
really, you can't indicated

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:16.890 align:middle line:90%
enlightenment with any words.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, Venerable
Shariputra, do not say that.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
Do not try to point to
enlightenment by silence,

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:90%
she said.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.030 align:middle line:84%
The nature of words is neither
external, nor internal,

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:90%
nor somewhere in between.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.039 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, enlightenment is
neither external, nor internal,

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:33.510 align:middle line:90%
nor somewhere in between.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:37.530 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the nature of
words is itself enlightenment.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment itself
is the nature of words.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:90%
So the poor guy was like--

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.659 align:middle line:90%
he was a little bit--

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:44.700 align:middle line:84%
he was a little bit
upset by that in a way.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.000 align:middle line:90%
But he was illumined by it.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, we don't want
to romanticize-- in one case,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.260 align:middle line:84%
in one context, even
silence is in a context.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:56.910 align:middle line:84%
And in a context where silence
is a restraint and a refraining

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:59.610 align:middle line:84%
from pontificating about
ultimate reality, which,

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:01.830 align:middle line:84%
finally, life-- and not
only ultimate reality,

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.200 align:middle line:84%
but all reality is
somehow beyond words,

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.790 align:middle line:84%
it is something
marvelous and magical

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
that can be discovered,
never encapsulated

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.195 align:middle line:84%
in a verbal formula,
not anything.

00:09:10.195 --> 00:09:11.070 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you can't be.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.200 align:middle line:84%
Chantal is not
captured in a name.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:90%
Neither is Bob.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.590 align:middle line:90%
Nothing can be.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.615 align:middle line:84%
So all of life is, in this way,
marvelous, and inconceivable,

00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:21.240 align:middle line:84%
and almost full of
surprises, in a way.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:90%
And enlightenment is the same.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.810 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, silence
will open people

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.850 align:middle line:84%
to how close it is
to them and make

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.160 align:middle line:90%
them feel something exalted.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.253 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes silence can be
like a pompousness, you know?

00:09:32.253 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:90%
Like, I'm not going to say--

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:34.315 align:middle line:90%
I know, but you--

00:09:34.315 --> 00:09:35.940 align:middle line:84%
you can't know, so
I'm not going to say

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.800 align:middle line:84%
anything, sort of a withholding
silence, an excluding silence.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.680 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are these
different kinds of silence.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.530 align:middle line:90%
We always have to differentiate.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism loves to differentiate,
as well as to unite.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.670 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.978 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:49.978 --> 00:09:51.850 align:middle line:90%


00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.930 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
you say enlightenment

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.085 align:middle line:84%
is the tolerance of
cognitive dissonance.

00:09:58.085 --> 00:09:58.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.940 align:middle line:90%
>> What is that?

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.040 align:middle line:10%
>> What is the tolerance
of cognitive-- well,

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.230 align:middle line:10%
it's just what it says.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.710 align:middle line:10%
In other words, we
normally, because

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:13.320 align:middle line:10%
of the imbalanced, egocentric
nature of our daily awareness.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.570 align:middle line:10%
You know, like, I'm sort of
always focused on myself,

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:15.790 align:middle line:10%
you know?

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.550 align:middle line:84%
And like, what am I doing
and getting out of it?

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:18.350 align:middle line:90%
Or where am I?

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm nervously
worrying about that.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.980 align:middle line:84%
So life is kind of
a strain for me.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.650 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, I'm always hoping
I could boil something down

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.440 align:middle line:84%
to either this or that, reduce
it to either this or that.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll feel
more comfortable,

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:90%
like it's under mind control.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, life is not
like this or that, actually.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Things are always complicated.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:42.630 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes, things don't
fit in your neat categories.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.550 align:middle line:84%
And so the tolerance
of cognitive dissonance

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.950 align:middle line:84%
means that I don't
freak out when

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:51.360 align:middle line:84%
something exceeds my ability to
feel I have it under control.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.240 align:middle line:84%
I allow for it to have
its ambiguous nature.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.640 align:middle line:84%
And I can cope with
that ambiguous nature.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.490 align:middle line:90%
And so then I am more--

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I have a much more peaceful and
relaxed way of enlightenment,

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.720 align:middle line:90%
of dealing with things.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.240 align:middle line:84%
But I can only do
that if I'm not

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:11.190 align:middle line:84%
being totally egocentrically
wound up, tight, you see.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:middle line:90%
So that is really what it means.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
But it's specifically-- like
in the case of Buddhahood,

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.120 align:middle line:84%
like a really total
enlightenment,

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.490 align:middle line:84%
we tend to think,
because of the fatiguing

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:22.860 align:middle line:84%
nature of our egocentric
consciousness,

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:26.940 align:middle line:84%
that total enlightenment must
be something like a huge rest

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:28.260 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.800 align:middle line:84%
If you actually, honestly ask
people, Buddhists-- not only

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.308 align:middle line:84%
this or that kind of Buddhist
but any Buddhist, well, are you

00:11:36.308 --> 00:11:37.350 align:middle line:90%
enlightened or something?

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.280 align:middle line:90%
They will say, well, no not yet.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.280 align:middle line:84%
And they're assuming that
the reason they're not

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.937 align:middle line:90%
is because they're still there.

00:11:42.937 --> 00:11:44.520 align:middle line:84%
They're assuming
that one day, they're

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.080 align:middle line:84%
going to be on a
retreat, or meditation,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.538 align:middle line:84%
or in some life or
another, they're

00:11:47.538 --> 00:11:49.620 align:middle line:84%
going to have a eureka
experience and boom,

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:51.845 align:middle line:84%
they're going to disappear
from the universe.

00:11:51.845 --> 00:11:53.970 align:middle line:84%
Because they have a model
of enlightenment as if it

00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:57.620 align:middle line:84%
were a state of awareness
beyond deep sleep.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:00.700 align:middle line:84%
It is kind of a deeper oblivion
or something like that.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:03.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is totally false
and rejected by the Buddha.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.220 align:middle line:84%
You know, Buddha says wisdom
and compassion are indivisible,

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.840 align:middle line:90%
wisdom and compassion.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.300 align:middle line:84%
What that means is
that the wisdom would

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.490 align:middle line:84%
see through
everything in a sense

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:middle line:84%
that it wouldn't hold on to
anything as a thing in itself

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.890 align:middle line:84%
and be caught up by the
superficial, apparent solidity

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:26.760 align:middle line:84%
of things and develop stability
to realize that all things are

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.940 align:middle line:84%
empty space, or wide open,
or emptiness, or voidness,

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:32.670 align:middle line:84%
or selflessness, all
this kind of statement

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:34.860 align:middle line:84%
you can find about
wisdom, and basically,

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:37.110 align:middle line:84%
that you have an experience
as if the whole of reality

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.742 align:middle line:84%
were transparent, like a pane
of glass made of diamonds

00:12:40.742 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.130 align:middle line:84%
You have that kind of
an experience, right?

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:43.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But then why-- when it says
indivisible from compassion,

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.720 align:middle line:84%
that state in itself is not
a state separated from all

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.340 align:middle line:84%
the relational
things or yourself,

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.020 align:middle line:90%
who is a relational being.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Because if that were so, it
wouldn't be an ultimate state.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.990 align:middle line:84%
It would be just something that
had closed off the relative,

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.360 align:middle line:90%
you see.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:84%
It would be someplace you
would step out of the relative

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.290 align:middle line:90%
into a sort of super relative.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.540 align:middle line:84%
You'd escape from
everything, in other words.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you look for the
state of enlightenment itself,

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.820 align:middle line:84%
you find that enlightenment
also is empty.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.860 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, the transparent
is transparent of itself.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.630 align:middle line:84%
As soon as you know
that, suddenly,

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.730 align:middle line:84%
you see all the
differentiated things again,

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:84%
what they call a kind
of virtual reality,

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:90%
or like in a dreamlike state.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.800 align:middle line:90%
Do you follow me?

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:28.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's cognitive-- the
ultimate cognitive dissonance

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle line:84%
is that a Buddha doesn't have
to remember, oh, yesterday,

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:35.100 align:middle line:84%
I meditated and everything
dissolved into open space,

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.107 align:middle line:84%
and today, I'm sitting
here with Chantal.

00:13:37.107 --> 00:13:38.940 align:middle line:84%
So well, I could go
back and be enlightened,

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:84%
or I could just engage with the
world, but I go back and forth.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.520 align:middle line:84%
An enlightened
Buddha is right here,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.730 align:middle line:84%
totally present with
Chantal, or with Bob,

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.180 align:middle line:90%
or with wherever we are.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, this
is all total empty space,

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.680 align:middle line:84%
completely, almost
as if nonexistent.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that
being as free of being

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.000 align:middle line:84%
attached to any one
part of it or invested

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.960 align:middle line:84%
in this ego or that, or
this representation or that,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.780 align:middle line:84%
much freer in relating
to the individuated,

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:08.340 align:middle line:90%
differentiated reality.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So my definition
of the tolerance

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.750 align:middle line:84%
of cognitive dissonance has
to do with non-duality, what's

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
called the ultimate non-duality,
that you're totally in nirvana.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:21.340 align:middle line:84%
It's total space and freedom,
bliss-void indivisible,

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.640 align:middle line:84%
and at the same time,
totally sensitive

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.000 align:middle line:84%
to interrelating for
things and beings.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.850 align:middle line:84%
And especially, of course,
when you are like that,

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.730 align:middle line:84%
you feel great because
you're an infinite space.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:84%
But the beings feel trapped
in their differentiated

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.420 align:middle line:84%
individuality as if the
infinite was after them,

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.963 align:middle line:84%
and their state of
struggle with the universe.

00:14:41.963 --> 00:14:43.380 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't
just say, oh, I'm

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:45.005 align:middle line:84%
blissed out, you
should be blissed out,

00:14:45.005 --> 00:14:46.140 align:middle line:90%
forget you type of thing.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.015 align:middle line:84%
You actually feel their
state of trappedness.

00:14:48.015 --> 00:14:50.250 align:middle line:84%
And then you interact
with them in a way

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.990 align:middle line:84%
as to optimally
in introduce them

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.957 align:middle line:84%
to their own
possibility of freedom.

00:14:54.957 --> 00:14:56.290 align:middle line:90%
So that's wisdom and compassion.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.420 align:middle line:90%
That's cognitive dissonance.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:14:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Very well explained.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Sorry, a little,
maybe, lengthy.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.740 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not at all.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.090 align:middle line:84%
I mean, literally,
very well explained.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:06.690 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:10%
>> I think what people struggle
with is maintaining that.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:10%
Because a lot of
people would say,

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:18.010 align:middle line:10%
for example, it's easy for me
to maintain my Buddha nature

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:23.350 align:middle line:10%
when I am in a meditation
center on a hill somewhere.

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Very hard when I'm
on the San Diego

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.910 align:middle line:90%
freeway at quarter of 6:00.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.370 align:middle line:84%
How do I maintain
that Buddha Nature?

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:31.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's
difficult. And at first,

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.800 align:middle line:84%
they say when we approach it,
there's a kind of oscillatory

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.182 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:15:37.182 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:84%
So first thing people should
do is not worry about the fact

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.807 align:middle line:90%
that there's an oscillation.

00:15:40.807 --> 00:15:44.140 align:middle line:84%
Because that's a natural
process of oscillation.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:48.280 align:middle line:10%
And you have to simply deepen
your awareness of selflessness,

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.830 align:middle line:10%
vast space and
infinity type of thing,

00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:54.410 align:middle line:10%
and get less afraid of it,
and rest in it, and enjoy it.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.850 align:middle line:10%
And then when you come back
to the concrete, so to speak,

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.730 align:middle line:10%
remember that it is like a
dream, that it's illusory.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:01.610 align:middle line:90%
It's not an illusion.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:02.200 align:middle line:90%
It's really real.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.890 align:middle line:90%
Other people are real.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:03.690 align:middle line:90%
You're real.

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:84%
But don't get so
concretized about it.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle line:84%
And you can play with
it, more a relaxed way,

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and by remembering
that it's all really

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:14.470 align:middle line:84%
star stuff type of thing,
it's all really, like, empty,

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:15.277 align:middle line:90%
and open, and free.

00:16:15.277 --> 00:16:16.360 align:middle line:90%
It's like virtual reality.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.068 align:middle line:90%
It's like if you really can--

00:16:18.068 --> 00:16:19.360 align:middle line:90%
So you doing it back and forth.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:84%
And then you get
really tied up in it,

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.850 align:middle line:84%
and you become very emotional
or something like that,

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:24.050 align:middle line:90%
then it gets really solid again.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:25.210 align:middle line:90%
And you feel really solid again.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.670 align:middle line:84%
Then you go back and oscillate,
and you go and calm down,

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.060 align:middle line:90%
and see through it.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.393 align:middle line:90%
So for a while, that goes on.

00:16:30.393 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:84%
But then the oscillation
gets narrower and narrower,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.950 align:middle line:84%
And then, sooner or
later, patiently--

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:37.540 align:middle line:84%
See, one of the
illusions in America

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.397 align:middle line:84%
is that enlightenment
is a eureka thing,

00:16:40.397 --> 00:16:42.230 align:middle line:84%
and it's going to be
boom, and oh, then I'll

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.560 align:middle line:84%
be enlightened forever,
whereas actually, it's

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.947 align:middle line:90%
a gradual process, you see.

00:16:46.947 --> 00:16:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Because what is unenlightenment?

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:90%
Let's be simple.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:50.800 align:middle line:90%
It's not complicated.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.825 align:middle line:84%
Unenlightenment means that
you think you are totally real

00:16:54.825 --> 00:16:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and that you are the realest
thing in the universe.

00:16:56.950 --> 00:16:58.908 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's
natural that everything you

00:16:58.908 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:84%
focus on yourself, and you
take everything for yourself.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:84%
And you try to do
everything for yourself.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And the universe
never agrees with you,

00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.569 align:middle line:84%
because it thinks it's more
important than you are.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And so you're always in
stress with the universe.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.900 align:middle line:90%
That's not enlightenment.

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So enlightenment is
gradually reducing,

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.589 align:middle line:84%
seeing through the exaggeration
of self-importance,

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:20.349 align:middle line:84%
and self-aggrandizement,
and self-obsession,

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:21.940 align:middle line:90%
and self-preoccupation.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.470 align:middle line:84%
But when you do
that, you naturally

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:25.089 align:middle line:90%
become more aware of others.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:27.730 align:middle line:84%
You become more attuned
and fitting in with others.

00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:30.280 align:middle line:84%
You realize how you are
connected with them,

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:90%
automatically, you see.

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's a gradual thing.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like Atisha said,
the great Atisha,

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.830 align:middle line:84%
the 10th, 11th century Indian
master who went to Tibet.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.560 align:middle line:84%
He said it's like butter
melting in a broth.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.530 align:middle line:84%
It's like ironing the wrinkles
out of a wrinkled cotton

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.130 align:middle line:90%
cloth with a hot stone.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.180 align:middle line:84%
It's a gradual thing,
becoming enlightened.

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, finally, of
course, I think it is--

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.340 align:middle line:84%
the goal is to be like Keanu
in "The Matrix," you know?

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.682 align:middle line:10%
>> --when you are the one, when
you know it's just a computer

00:17:58.682 --> 00:17:59.557 align:middle line:10%
program in a way.

00:17:59.557 --> 00:18:01.890 align:middle line:10%
And yeah, of course, it's
very real to the people caught

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:04.977 align:middle line:10%
in it, so you remain dedicated
to helping them find freedom.

00:18:04.977 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:10%
But on the other hand, you know.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.862 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, that's when you
can stop the bullet, you know?

00:18:08.862 --> 00:18:11.320 align:middle line:84%
When that bullet is shooting
towards you, you just stop it.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Because you can master the
program as well as consent

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.690 align:middle line:84%
to its reality insofar as you
can help others by doing so.

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the goal, you see.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.510 align:middle line:90%
That's cognitive dissonance.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Got it.

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:24.860 align:middle line:90%
Got it.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:26.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And we're so-- it's
just that-- and you know,

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.692 align:middle line:84%
one thing people think
is they think, well,

00:18:28.692 --> 00:18:30.550 align:middle line:84%
if enlightenment is
great compassion,

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.730 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't that be awful, great
compassion meaning feeling

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:36.130 align:middle line:84%
the suffering of others and
willing to help them free

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:37.837 align:middle line:90%
themselves from it?

00:18:37.837 --> 00:18:38.920 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't that be terrible?

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Because I'm so caught
up in my own suffering,

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:43.153 align:middle line:84%
imagine if I was aware of
everybody else's suffering,

00:18:43.153 --> 00:18:44.320 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't walled off from it.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Wouldn't that be terrible?

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:47.620 align:middle line:90%
And yes, it would be terrible.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.080 align:middle line:84%
Enlightenment would be like hell
if your experience of others;

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.990 align:middle line:84%
suffering after
enlightenment was

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.120 align:middle line:84%
the old, concretized,
egocentric way we

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.950 align:middle line:90%
experience our own suffering.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:84%
But luckily, by cultivating that
wisdom side, where everything

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:04.030 align:middle line:84%
becomes transparent
as diamonds or glass,

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:08.010 align:middle line:84%
your own suffering becomes
kind of unreal to you.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:09.290 align:middle line:90%
It's still real.

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:90%
But it's not as real.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.830 align:middle line:90%
And you become more--

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.877 align:middle line:84%
it's like a virtual
suffering, you see.

00:19:13.877 --> 00:19:16.210 align:middle line:84%
And so then you are aware of
everybody else's suffering.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But to you, it's kind of
like a virtual suffering.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And yet-- And that's where
the dissonance comes in.

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:22.870 align:middle line:84%
To them, you realize
it's not virtual.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.500 align:middle line:90%
It's really real to them.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:26.170 align:middle line:84%
And it really pains
them therefore.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:84%
So then you can really
help them be free of it.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, how would
compassion be effective?

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:32.840 align:middle line:90%
If I feel your pain--

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:36.280 align:middle line:84%
>> --and I'm just as
dragged into it as you are,

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
then we'll just both enjoy the
pain and it won't help you.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:90%
But if I your pain, I feel it--

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:84%
I can diagnose it kind
of, at the same time,

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:84%
I can see your
potential joy, then

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I can help you move, since
you have to do it yourself

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:50.350 align:middle line:90%
ultimately--

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.270 align:middle line:84%
I can help you turn
the different corners

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.980 align:middle line:84%
you need to in
your understanding

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.740 align:middle line:84%
to move from seeing your
pain as pain to come

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.320 align:middle line:84%
into where you can find your
joy and empathy, something

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.576 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:20:00.576 --> 00:20:03.922 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:03.922 --> 00:20:05.360 align:middle line:90%


00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's very important
that you're a noisy Buddhist.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Well, that's lucky.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:12.407 align:middle line:84%
My wife wears ear
plugs sometimes.

00:20:12.407 --> 00:20:13.490 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's important.

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:14.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And my children do.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:18.797 align:middle line:10%
>> Because without you being
the noisy Buddhist you are--

00:20:18.797 --> 00:20:19.880 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, that's kind of you.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.820 align:middle line:90%
>> --you could not be as active.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh-huh.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You could not be
as active politically.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:84%
Because I think there
is a misconception

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.410 align:middle line:84%
that Buddhists have no political
view, that they are not--

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.210 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:34.480 align:middle line:84%
>> --active in the world,
when indeed they are.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.100 align:middle line:90%
They always have been, too.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:40.550 align:middle line:84%
My book, "Inner
Revolution," really, I hope

00:20:40.550 --> 00:20:42.620 align:middle line:84%
shows and proves,
an as long as it

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.670 align:middle line:84%
proves, that the Buddha
basically was a revolutionary.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:46.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, indeed.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.410 align:middle line:84%
>> And he revolutionized
Indian society.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:51.150 align:middle line:84%
And Buddhism revolutionized
every society where it went.

00:20:51.150 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:10%
But the reason why
people haven't noticed

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.550 align:middle line:10%
and they thought Buddhism
was sort of marginal or not

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:59.900 align:middle line:10%
involved was that it wasn't what
we would call a hot revolution,

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.040 align:middle line:10%
like Lenin or something.

00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.562 align:middle line:90%
It was a cool revolution.

00:21:02.562 --> 00:21:04.520 align:middle line:84%
It was content to see
the revolution take place

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.733 align:middle line:90%
over generations.

00:21:05.733 --> 00:21:07.400 align:middle line:84%
It was actually an
effective revolution.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:84%
It didn't bring about
huge backlashes,

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.930 align:middle line:84%
you know, just sort
of change the players

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
and leave the oppressive
structure in place.

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:17.660 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it was a revolution
from within by people changing

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:22.117 align:middle line:84%
that egocentric, dominating
personality from within that

00:21:22.117 --> 00:21:24.200 align:middle line:84%
then causes all the trouble
in politics, you know,

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.910 align:middle line:90%
the clash of egos.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Would this be a bit of a
hot potato question in some

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.530 align:middle line:90%
Buddhist circles?

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.050 align:middle line:84%
Is there a movement
within Buddhism today--

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.840 align:middle line:90%
some Buddhists, I should say--

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:44.060 align:middle line:84%
that the stand on non-violence
is not necessarily

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:48.200 align:middle line:84%
the way anymore because of
what's happening in Tibet?

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.100 align:middle line:90%
>> No, not exactly.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.750 align:middle line:84%
There has been a
movement in Buddhism,

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.050 align:middle line:90%
in Western Buddhism, called--

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.655 align:middle line:84%
sort of related to--
called engaged Buddhism.

00:21:57.655 --> 00:21:59.780 align:middle line:84%
And it relates to the
wonderful organization called

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.670 align:middle line:90%
the Buddhist Peace Fellowship.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:84%
And they went into war
protesting in the early days.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And then subsequently, they're
into activism in prisons,

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.520 align:middle line:84%
and with wife battering,
and with addiction,

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.500 align:middle line:84%
and you know, hospices
and what have you.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:15.200 align:middle line:84%
They're really doing great,
great things in collaboration

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.230 align:middle line:84%
with Christian colleagues
and brothers and sisters,

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and very much devoted to
non-violence, growing mostly

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:84%
out of the Zen, and a little
bit to the Vietnamese,

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.250 align:middle line:84%
actually, Thich Nhat Hanh
and the Sri Lankan or Burmese

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.740 align:middle line:84%
traditions, the
vipassana traditions.

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:32.420 align:middle line:84%
More recently, the
Tibetan movement

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:84%
has interacted with
that to some degree.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And the Tibetan movement
brings in a sort

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:84%
of philosophical thing
where surgical violence

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:44.750 align:middle line:84%
does become a part of the
strategies of non-violence.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.940 align:middle line:84%
It isn't that non-violence
is not the strategy.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.350 align:middle line:90%
It remains the strategy.

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.920 align:middle line:84%
His Holiness the Dalai Lama
has insisted consistently

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.630 align:middle line:90%
non-violence is the strategy.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:56.060 align:middle line:84%
There was a guerrilla
movement by the Tibetans

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.580 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s against the
Chinese, very likely

00:22:58.580 --> 00:22:59.750 align:middle line:90%
supported by the West.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:01.460 align:middle line:84%
But the Dalai Lama
never sanctioned it.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.417 align:middle line:90%
And he deplored it.

00:23:02.417 --> 00:23:03.750 align:middle line:90%
And he begged them not to do it.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.230 align:middle line:84%
And then he asked them to stop
when it was really hopeless.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.910 align:middle line:90%
And you know, they ignored him.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:12.260 align:middle line:84%
And he's always been
stuck on that, but not

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:84%
only out of the
principled reason,

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:84%
also because of the
pragmatic reason.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.710 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the Chinese invaded

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:90%
Tibet in the early '50s.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And they killed over a
million Tibetans since then.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.500 align:middle line:84%
And then there was
a little bit of--

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:25.875 align:middle line:84%
and then the
Cultural Revolution,

00:23:25.875 --> 00:23:27.470 align:middle line:84%
they destroyed all
the monasteries

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:29.330 align:middle line:84%
and all the
paintings, everything.

00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:30.260 align:middle line:90%
>> And still are.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.775 align:middle line:84%
>> And there was a brief
release in the '80s.

00:23:32.775 --> 00:23:34.400 align:middle line:84%
They let them kind
of rebuild a little.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:90%
They just let loose of them.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.350 align:middle line:84%
They didn't really
encourage them,

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:37.808 align:middle line:84%
but they let loose
of them and were

00:23:37.808 --> 00:23:41.330 align:middle line:84%
shocked to see that the Tibetans
still rebuilt everything.

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:43.880 align:middle line:84%
They, in their hearts,
had been unchanged

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.620 align:middle line:84%
by thought reform
and class struggle

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.660 align:middle line:90%
and Communist ideology.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.390 align:middle line:84%
But then, now, in the '90s,
they're crushing them again.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Because they're reverting
to a very regressive policy

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.810 align:middle line:84%
now in a kind of attempt to
make a final solution to avoid

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:58.942 align:middle line:84%
the fate of Russia,
which actually,

00:23:58.942 --> 00:24:01.400 align:middle line:84%
it will overtake them, whether
they try to avoid it or not.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.992 align:middle line:84%
But they're persisting
longer than Russia

00:24:03.992 --> 00:24:05.700 align:middle line:84%
because they're more
coddled by the West,

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:07.340 align:middle line:84%
whereas Russia was
blocked by the West.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And so they now are trying
to crush and finish off

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.380 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetans by
assimilating them,

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.160 align:middle line:84%
by moving in millions of Chinese
and intermarrying and giving

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:18.350 align:middle line:84%
the Chinese the economic
advantage and so forth.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.600 align:middle line:84%
So hopefully, they will marry
Tibetan women and things

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.030 align:middle line:90%
like that.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:22.488 align:middle line:84%
And then they will
have assimilated

00:24:22.488 --> 00:24:25.170 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetan population, which
is another form of genocide.

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:27.530 align:middle line:84%
It's called genocide
by population transfer

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.020 align:middle line:90%
in the human rights lingo.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.725 align:middle line:84%
But still, still-- so they've
done all these awful things,

00:24:33.725 --> 00:24:34.850 align:middle line:90%
though, is what I'm saying.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.360 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, for example,
a Dalai Lama in 1950,

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:41.270 align:middle line:84%
if he had had the capacity,
he would have found it--

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.700 align:middle line:84%
and there is Buddhist precedent
for this in the Mahayana

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:44.630 align:middle line:90%
sutras.

00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:47.980 align:middle line:84%
He could have defended
his country with violence,

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.240 align:middle line:84%
in other words, manned
the frontier if they

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.400 align:middle line:90%
could have kept them out.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And then that would
have saved the Chinese

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.715 align:middle line:84%
from committing all
these atrocities.

00:24:54.715 --> 00:24:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So although there
would have been

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.090 align:middle line:84%
some violence in a
struggle on the frontier,

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.710 align:middle line:84%
that would have prevented
a lot more violence.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:03.410 align:middle line:84%
So in the more
sophisticated bodhisattva

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:07.110 align:middle line:84%
theory, Mahayana theory,
surgical violence

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:08.910 align:middle line:90%
is not unrealistic.

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:10.450 align:middle line:90%
It is not impossible.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:13.440 align:middle line:84%
It's part of non-violence,
just like if you, Chantal, are

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.290 align:middle line:84%
bitten by a poisonous
snake today,

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:18.720 align:middle line:84%
non-violence would say,
oh, I can't take a knife

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:21.420 align:middle line:90%
and cut a hole in your leg.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.380 align:middle line:90%
That's violent.

00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.890 align:middle line:84%
But clearly, if a poison snake
bit you, we would take a knife,

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:29.070 align:middle line:84%
cut a hole, and suck the
poison out, and thereby

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.880 align:middle line:90%
save your life.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's surgical
violence, you see.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:32.840 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.132 align:middle line:84%
>> But the Dalai Lama doesn't
believe in it in the case

00:25:35.132 --> 00:25:37.560 align:middle line:84%
of Tibet because
it's impractical.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.850 align:middle line:84%
There's no way he could
have won a defense war.

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.600 align:middle line:84%
There's no way he could do a
lightning strike and eliminate,

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:44.970 align:middle line:90%
like, say, a million Chinese.

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.917 align:middle line:84%
You know, it has to be
done through dialogue.

00:25:46.917 --> 00:25:48.750 align:middle line:84%
It has to be done by
appealing to the hearts

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.340 align:middle line:84%
of the Chinese people
in the long run.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.792 align:middle line:84%
But there are some
Tibetans, younger ones,

00:25:52.792 --> 00:25:54.750 align:middle line:84%
ones who are annoyed by
Buddhism kind of-- they

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.460 align:middle line:84%
are annoyed by the restraint
of Buddhist non-violence--

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.190 align:middle line:84%
who are saying, we
should do violence.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.280 align:middle line:84%
They only hope that the
Kosovars, because they fought,

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.748 align:middle line:84%
they only helped whoever
they've helped, you know,

00:26:04.748 --> 00:26:05.790 align:middle line:90%
because they fought back.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And they think, we don't care,
because we don't fight back.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:08.940 align:middle line:84%
So we must-- we
should do violence.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.607 align:middle line:84%
And so far, the Xiangya
Lama has managed

00:26:10.607 --> 00:26:12.750 align:middle line:90%
to restrain those hotter heads.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:13.680 align:middle line:90%
But it's nip and tuck.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.080 align:middle line:84%
It's getting nip and tuck
because it's going on so long.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of Americans
are quite misinformed about

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:20.380 align:middle line:90%
what's happening in Tibet.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's totally true.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And it occurs to me
that one of the reasons

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:28.160 align:middle line:84%
they're misinformed is they say,
what does it have to do with

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:28.960 align:middle line:90%
me?

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.910 align:middle line:90%
I live in Boston.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:30.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:31.968 align:middle line:84%
>> What does it
have to do with me.

00:26:31.968 --> 00:26:32.930 align:middle line:90%
I live in Washington.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:33.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.010 align:middle line:90%
>> So--

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.300 align:middle line:84%
>> "Ask not for whom
the bell tolls," right?

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.600 align:middle line:90%
"It tolls for thee."

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It does.

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.310 align:middle line:90%
Freedom-- we love freedom.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:47.360 align:middle line:84%
We think our American
dream is based on freedom.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:84%
We cannot have freedom when
anyone doesn't have freedom.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:56.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the amazing, strange,
paradoxical, and unfortunate

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:59.080 align:middle line:84%
imperative that the
American people live with.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.490 align:middle line:10%
For example, we've never
really realized our freedom

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:05.750 align:middle line:10%
here because the signers of
our Declaration of Independence

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.250 align:middle line:10%
were slave owners.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.920 align:middle line:10%
And also, their women
didn't vote at that time.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.270 align:middle line:10%
And that was not real freedom.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:10%
It was freedom amongst a
certain collegiality, but not

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:10%
real freedom.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.727 align:middle line:84%
Then we went through
the Civil War.

00:27:17.727 --> 00:27:19.310 align:middle line:84%
We went through the
feminist movement,

00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:21.870 align:middle line:84%
you know, the universal
suffrage, et cetera, et cetera.

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.830 align:middle line:84%
But still, now, we are
imprisoning up to 2 million

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.580 align:middle line:90%
of our members of other races.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.340 align:middle line:84%
We have privatized
the prison industry.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.360 align:middle line:90%
We're sending them up.

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.520 align:middle line:84%
We don't build any schools
in the inner cities.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.450 align:middle line:84%
We are as bad or worse than
South Africa and Apartheid,

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:35.450 align:middle line:90%
in fact, now.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.730 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, we feel paranoid.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.980 align:middle line:90%
We don't feel free, even still.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.380 align:middle line:84%
Even we talk about
freedom and the new age,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.870 align:middle line:84%
whatever, but we actually
are living in a society

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:48.470 align:middle line:84%
where the injustices committed
to the first Americans,

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:51.200 align:middle line:84%
the Native Americans, the
broken treaties, the injustices

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.890 align:middle line:84%
committed to the
black Americans,

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.890 align:middle line:84%
the slavery, and now
the ghettoization

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:57.920 align:middle line:84%
and the imprisonment,
is still going on.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.360 align:middle line:90%
And we will not be free.

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And Tibet, although it's the
other side of the planet,

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:07.130 align:middle line:84%
ironically, is also a jail
of our own supporting.

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:08.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:11.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The Russians, in the
early '90s, did what

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:16.360 align:middle line:84%
the realpolitikers in our
country said would never happen

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.460 align:middle line:84%
and based our whole
military-industrial complex

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.230 align:middle line:84%
on the fact that it
would never happen.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:23.590 align:middle line:84%
The Russians gave
up without a fight.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.175 align:middle line:90%
They left all of Eastern Europe.

00:28:25.175 --> 00:28:26.050 align:middle line:90%
They said, forget it.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:28.460 align:middle line:84%
This life of armament
is not worth it.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:32.680 align:middle line:84%
We want to have some Mickey
Mouse, some TV, some pleasure,

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:34.330 align:middle line:90%
a decent icebox.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:35.600 align:middle line:90%
Forget about it.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:90%
America is not the deadly enemy.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.770 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
live like this anymore.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:42.850 align:middle line:84%
That's what we-- then let's join
the free world type of thing.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.000 align:middle line:84%
That's what we had been
hoping for actually, OK?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.260 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Very little help
to them actually.

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:51.310 align:middle line:90%
The Chinese refused to do that.

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:53.710 align:middle line:84%
They killed their students
in Tiananmen Square and all

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.790 align:middle line:90%
over China, not just in Beijing.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.480 align:middle line:84%
They killed anybody
who spoke for freedom.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.450 align:middle line:90%
And then what do we do?

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:02.860 align:middle line:84%
We invested hundreds of billions
of dollars in them since then.

00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Because our elite is
afraid of freedom.

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.610 align:middle line:84%
We are afraid of our American
dream, our own leadership.

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:12.340 align:middle line:84%
So Tibet is so
crucial because Tibet

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:17.500 align:middle line:84%
shows if we can liberate
Tibet, we liberate the Chinese

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.530 align:middle line:84%
from that oligarchy that is
supporting the Chinese, which

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:22.930 align:middle line:84%
our industry, military
industrial complex,

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:27.800 align:middle line:84%
is supporting, and then we free
ourselves from the same people.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.390 align:middle line:90%
>> We get rid of them.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:34.440 align:middle line:84%
We convert those prisons back
to schools for the ghettos.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.240 align:middle line:90%
We convert them back to--

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.700 align:middle line:84%
we educate the people
as youths rather than

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.380 align:middle line:84%
let them grow up
ignorant and alienated

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.840 align:middle line:84%
and then lure them into,
obviously, committing crime

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and then arrest them, which is
what we're doing with them now,

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.760 align:middle line:90%
you know.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.560 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is such a ripple
effect, what happens in--

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:49.950 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a total ripple effect.

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:52.640 align:middle line:84%
That's why our peacemaking
power of non-violence conference

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:55.850 align:middle line:84%
in San Francisco the Tibet House
did was so powerful, because--

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:57.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed it was.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:30:02.090 align:middle line:10%
>> --there was a moment where
all the losers on the planet

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:05.510 align:middle line:10%
had a moment of
shared connection,

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.210 align:middle line:10%
the losers in the American
inner cities with the losers

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.580 align:middle line:10%
in international world of
the so-called non-existent

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:10%
Tibetans, who are being
genocided because the world has

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.290 align:middle line:10%
decided they don't exist.

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:17.230 align:middle line:84%
The UN won't consider
that they exist

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.450 align:middle line:90%
for fear of offending China.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:19.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:22.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And those losers suddenly
embraced each other.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.640 align:middle line:84%
The meek inherited the
Earth, as Jesus said.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.260 align:middle line:90%
But of course, it was temporary.

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And it was only a
foretaste of what

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:33.350 align:middle line:84%
will happen whenever the
inner revolution emerges

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.890 align:middle line:84%
into the open and people are
confident enough about it

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:41.750 align:middle line:84%
and determined enough about
it to really take action.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:46.010 align:middle line:84%
18% of college age students
vote in this country, only 18%.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Tragic.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> 38% of the total
electorate, maximum, votes.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So naturally, we
are a country that's

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.050 align:middle line:84%
run by an oligarchy
that does not

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:57.590 align:middle line:84%
have the interests of 100%
of the people at its heart.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:01.880 align:middle line:84%
>> You do know that your passion
for this is extraordinarily

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.835 align:middle line:90%
enrolling.

00:31:02.835 --> 00:31:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, good.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.250 align:middle line:84%
>> There are people watching--
well, noisy Buddhist,

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.100 align:middle line:90%
it's important.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.300 align:middle line:84%
That's why I say
you're important.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:17.930 align:middle line:84%
People watching this broadcast
will say, OK, what do I do?

00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:20.900 align:middle line:84%
How can one person begin
to make a difference?

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Because I believe one person
can make a difference.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.338 align:middle line:84%
>> You're absolutely--
I believe so too.

00:31:25.338 --> 00:31:27.380 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the first
thing that person can do

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:29.270 align:middle line:84%
is recognize and
take responsibility

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:30.510 align:middle line:90%
that they make a difference.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.120 align:middle line:84%
>> I have noticed in talking in
America that the more powerful

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.590 align:middle line:84%
a person is, the less they
think they make a difference.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.480 align:middle line:84%
The more strongly
they argue the fact

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.000 align:middle line:84%
that I don't make a
difference, nothing I could do

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000 align:middle line:84%
would help, the more
ability they have to help.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.500 align:middle line:10%
The people in the
ghetto, the people

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.000 align:middle line:10%
we met at the
conference, the people

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.830 align:middle line:10%
I meet in the streets
in New York who

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.690 align:middle line:10%
have to deal with
immediate emergency

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:56.150 align:middle line:10%
situation, a child
in prison, have

00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:58.850 align:middle line:10%
to go upstate to meet that
child and keep some hope

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.760 align:middle line:10%
alive, et cetera, they do
not think that what they do

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.690 align:middle line:10%
doesn't matter.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:04.760 align:middle line:10%
They can't afford to think that.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.340 align:middle line:84%
They actually are much
more hopeful, as oppressed

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:11.420 align:middle line:84%
as they are, than the people
who have actual power, who

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:16.430 align:middle line:84%
could support candidates, who
can change their lifestyle, who

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.800 align:middle line:84%
can give money to help
this and that thing,

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.990 align:middle line:84%
who can create something,
and who have real power.

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.750 align:middle line:84%
They're the ones,
ironically, who say,

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.840 align:middle line:84%
I have nothing I could
do, to excuse themselves

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.632 align:middle line:84%
from the responsibility
of doing something.

00:32:28.632 --> 00:32:29.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes, yes.

00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And America, for
example, as a whole,

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.050 align:middle line:84%
is more than any country,
shown by the voting rate,

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:39.590 align:middle line:84%
that has decided its middle
classes, we can't do anything.

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:40.550 align:middle line:90%
And America sits.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.380 align:middle line:84%
And I think, by
not doing anything,

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:45.420 align:middle line:84%
what you do in America is you
totally add to the problem.

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:48.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You're consuming the
energy of the world.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.370 align:middle line:90%
You're polluting the world.

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Your investments
abroad are supporting

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:55.760 align:middle line:84%
the tyrants, and the torturers,
and the non-unionizing work

00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.070 align:middle line:84%
factories, slave owned
drivers and so forth.

00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.640 align:middle line:84%
You're supporting all of that
when you don't do anything.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.650 align:middle line:90%
And yet, America has the--

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:05.000 align:middle line:90%
America has the power.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.460 align:middle line:84%
If America could force
its State Department

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.940 align:middle line:84%
to make human rights part
of its commerce department,

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.410 align:middle line:84%
that would make
a vast difference

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:15.840 align:middle line:84%
in many parts of the
country, of the world.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And so the first
thing we do, simply,

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:22.190 align:middle line:84%
is take responsibility that
what we do absolutely matters.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:24.050 align:middle line:84%
And the second thing
everyone would do

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.840 align:middle line:90%
is register to vote and vote.

00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.130 align:middle line:90%
My wife is Swedish.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And she never tires of
telling me that in Sweden,

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.720 align:middle line:84%
in any election, 98.5%
of the population

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:38.470 align:middle line:90%
votes that is eligible to vote.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.220 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
have a government that

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.147 align:middle line:90%
cares about most of the people.

00:33:42.147 --> 00:33:43.730 align:middle line:84%
They don't always
do everything right.

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:44.880 align:middle line:90%
They're not perfect.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.640 align:middle line:84%
They have a difference-- it's
a country with different kinds

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.520 align:middle line:90%
of problems.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.780 align:middle line:84%
But they don't have a government
that radically does not

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:84%
reflect the will of the majority
of its people, as ours does,

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.210 align:middle line:90%
although we want our democracy.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.360 align:middle line:84%
But it is not a
democracy when 38% vote.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Then 20% of the people
can dominate the 100%.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:07.316 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:34:07.316 --> 00:34:10.090 align:middle line:90%


00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.860 align:middle line:10%
The other group of
people, it just occurs

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.650 align:middle line:10%
to me as I listen to you
today, who have a great

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.500 align:middle line:10%
say, obviously, in
what happens in Tibet

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:20.620 align:middle line:10%
and the future of Tibet are
the Tibetan leaders themselves.

00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:22.031 align:middle line:90%
How are they chosen?

00:34:22.031 --> 00:34:22.989 align:middle line:90%
>> The Tibetan leaders?

00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:23.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.705 align:middle line:90%
I mean, here we're elected.

00:34:24.705 --> 00:34:25.580 align:middle line:10%
How are the Tibetan--

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:28.659 align:middle line:10%
>> They-- well,
nowadays, in exile,

00:34:28.659 --> 00:34:31.090 align:middle line:10%
they're chosen by election.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.010 align:middle line:10%
And they have their
own electoral process

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:35.860 align:middle line:10%
because they have developed
a working constitution,

00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:38.880 align:middle line:10%
and a parliament,
and a supreme court,

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.780 align:middle line:10%
modeled on a combination
of the Indian,

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.568 align:middle line:10%
the British, and the
American systems,

00:34:42.568 --> 00:34:44.110 align:middle line:10%
which they hope to
implement in Tibet

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.630 align:middle line:10%
if they ever get true
self-rule in Tibet.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.130 align:middle line:84%
In Tibet, of course,
they're just--

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:49.210 align:middle line:90%
the ones who work--

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.088 align:middle line:84%
mainly, Chinese
run all the offices

00:34:51.088 --> 00:34:52.130 align:middle line:90%
at all the higher levels.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.190 align:middle line:84%
But they have
Tibetan collaborators

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:57.023 align:middle line:84%
who are appointed to the lower
levels of their bureaucracy.

00:34:57.023 --> 00:34:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So they don't have
any freedom in Tibet.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:01.180 align:middle line:84%
And you know, Communism
has no real elections.

00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:02.690 align:middle line:90%
The party controls everything.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:04.198 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:35:04.198 --> 00:35:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>> But in ancient time
in Tibet, of course,

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:07.990 align:middle line:84%
they had a funny
way of leadership,

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.300 align:middle line:84%
where you had to have many
lifetimes of on-the-job

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.420 align:middle line:90%
training.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.820 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you
didn't run for election.

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:14.710 align:middle line:84%
You just had to prove that,
well, I've already been

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:15.700 align:middle line:90%
sheriff for five lifetimes.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.160 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:16.420 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:18.482 align:middle line:84%
>> I practiced, and now
I'll be a good sheriff.

00:35:18.482 --> 00:35:20.440 align:middle line:84%
And then people say, OK,
he's the reincarnation

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:20.980 align:middle line:90%
of the sheriff.

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.522 align:middle line:84%
Let's let him go
back to the sheriff.

00:35:22.522 --> 00:35:24.340 align:middle line:84%
So ironically,
although they didn't

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.160 align:middle line:84%
have an electoral system,
they had one step, certainly,

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:32.003 align:middle line:84%
more towards the democratic than
the dynastic, imperial system,

00:35:32.003 --> 00:35:33.670 align:middle line:84%
where you just-- your
children inherited

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:35.110 align:middle line:90%
the throne type of thing.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:39.160 align:middle line:84%
Because those reincarnated
lamas, like the Dalai Lamas,

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.670 align:middle line:84%
all but one of them were born in
lower class, peasant families.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:45.040 align:middle line:84%
Only one was born as an
aristocratic and noble family,

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.480 align:middle line:90%
out of 14.

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:47.378 align:middle line:90%
The rest were all--

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:49.420 align:middle line:84%
and they were born in
different regions of Tibet.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:53.330 align:middle line:84%
So it was just like log cabin
to White House, Hope, Arkansas

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:54.170 align:middle line:90%
to White House.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:56.650 align:middle line:84%
It operated in a way
of effectively giving

00:35:56.650 --> 00:35:59.302 align:middle line:84%
a kind of turnover and social
mobility within the system,

00:35:59.302 --> 00:36:01.510 align:middle line:84%
but without, of course, the
modern electoral process.

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:03.580 align:middle line:84%
Because they didn't
have universal literacy.

00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.830 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't
have voting boxes,

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:07.730 align:middle line:84%
electronic communication,
this kind of thing.

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:09.438 align:middle line:84%
But they hope to have
that in the future.

00:36:09.438 --> 00:36:11.060 align:middle line:90%
And they hope to have democracy.

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.700 align:middle line:84%
Although I'm a
little bit concerned

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.580 align:middle line:84%
that there's a complexity
there because one

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.280 align:middle line:84%
of our aspects of
democracy is secularism,

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:21.520 align:middle line:84%
of American democracy, you know,
separation of church and state.

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.950 align:middle line:90%
But we have interpreted that--

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:26.265 align:middle line:84%
that was meant to protect
different religious movements,

00:36:26.265 --> 00:36:28.390 align:middle line:84%
minority religious movements,
from being persecuted

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.730 align:middle line:84%
by some majority religion
that would dominate

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:34.450 align:middle line:84%
the state because of our
ancestors' experience

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.580 align:middle line:90%
of persecution in Europe.

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:38.440 align:middle line:84%
But that was not
necessarily meant

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.180 align:middle line:84%
to keep all spiritual
perspectives out

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.060 align:middle line:84%
of the educational system and
out of the governmental system

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:47.410 align:middle line:84%
and sort of have a ethic of
money, an ethic of materialism.

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:49.600 align:middle line:84%
But that's what it's
resulted in, you see.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So there must be a middle
way between secularism

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:56.620 align:middle line:84%
that just leads to
materialism and some sort

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.010 align:middle line:84%
of religious dominance that is
one particular religion, where

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:04.720 align:middle line:84%
you have a spiritual infusion
in the ethic of the state

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.490 align:middle line:90%
and the ethic of the people.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.648 align:middle line:90%
You preserve that.

00:37:07.648 --> 00:37:09.440 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you don't
allow any one religion--

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.148 align:middle line:84%
you preserve pluralism
on the other hand,

00:37:11.148 --> 00:37:13.370 align:middle line:84%
and don't allow one religion
to persecute any other.

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.490 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that
Tibet will rethink

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:17.770 align:middle line:84%
its imitation of
Western democracy

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:19.750 align:middle line:84%
and come up with
more of a middle way.

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.400 align:middle line:90%
Do you know I mean?

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:23.600 align:middle line:90%
Without having an inquisition.

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.310 align:middle line:84%
But although, because Buddhism
is a less dogmatic religion

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:31.420 align:middle line:84%
than monotheistic religions,
not just Western ones, but even

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Indian or eastern
monotheistic religions,

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.270 align:middle line:84%
because it-- but they don't
believe in any superboss deity.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:40.570 align:middle line:84%
They believe in the
deities of love.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.400 align:middle line:90%
And there's a few naughty ones.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.920 align:middle line:84%
But they don't believe
in one big boss.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.260 align:middle line:84%
So therefore, they tend
to be less sort of--

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:48.938 align:middle line:84%
they never had an
Inquisition, where

00:37:48.938 --> 00:37:50.480 align:middle line:84%
they pulled out your
thumbs until you

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.090 align:middle line:90%
proclaimed this or that dogma.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:53.950 align:middle line:90%
They didn't do that in Buddhism.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:57.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you optimistic
about the future of Tibet?

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:37:58.650 --> 00:37:59.450 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how.

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:03.350 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] It's such a dire
situation at the moment.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:05.090 align:middle line:90%
But in fact, I am.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.985 align:middle line:84%
And not only for mystical
reasons, let's say,

00:38:08.985 --> 00:38:10.450 align:middle line:90%
because I'm fairly weak.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:12.650 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I mentally would
like to be more like that,

00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:16.130 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not that strong in
that area, by being too left

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:19.370 align:middle line:84%
brain and rationalistic, the
way I was educated, but really,

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:22.490 align:middle line:84%
from my view of this
socioeconomic, technological

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:24.150 align:middle line:90%
state of the planet.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:25.670 align:middle line:10%
In other words,
the British didn't

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.820 align:middle line:10%
give up their empire,
or the French Algeria,

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:29.900 align:middle line:10%
the British India, the
Portuguese, the Congo,

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:32.150 align:middle line:10%
whatever-- they didn't give
these up because they were

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:33.830 align:middle line:10%
all a bunch of bodhisattvas.

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:36.440 align:middle line:84%
The Russians didn't give up
all of their possessions,

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.390 align:middle line:84%
their empire, you
know, the Soviet Union,

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:42.050 align:middle line:84%
because they were suddenly
sainted or enlightened.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:46.460 align:middle line:84%
They did it because the
military industrial control

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.910 align:middle line:84%
of huge territory is
not cost effective

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.570 align:middle line:90%
in the modern economy.

00:38:51.570 --> 00:38:53.410 align:middle line:90%
Look at the case of China.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.320 align:middle line:84%
The Chinese who tried to control
a big territory and maintain

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:00.680 align:middle line:84%
an imperium in Mongolia,
Manchuria, Xiangyang,

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.175 align:middle line:84%
and Tibet, since their
liberation in 1950, 1949,

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:06.410 align:middle line:90%
the so-called liberation--

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.487 align:middle line:84%
they are still
totally poor, really,

00:39:08.487 --> 00:39:10.070 align:middle line:84%
except for all this
foreign investment

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:14.270 align:middle line:84%
lately, due to the fantasies of
Western, naive business people.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.510 align:middle line:84%
But Hong Kong,
with no territory,

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Taiwan, with a little island,
Singapore Chinese community,

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Indonesian Chinese community,
Malaysian Chinese community,

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.380 align:middle line:84%
the US overseas
Chinese community,

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:30.890 align:middle line:84%
have prospered mightily
with no territory,

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:35.240 align:middle line:84%
just by industrial creativity,
consumer savvy, marketing

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.430 align:middle line:90%
brilliance, inventions, genius.

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:39.530 align:middle line:84%
That's the way the
world economy is.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:42.740 align:middle line:84%
The idea that you pay some
troops, millions of them,

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.380 align:middle line:84%
some salary to go and
suppress people's creativity

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.370 align:middle line:84%
so you can say I own the land
is stupid in the modern economy.

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:51.770 align:middle line:84%
It leads, eventually,
to-- in the case of Tibet,

00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:54.993 align:middle line:84%
because of the religiosity and
non-violence of the Tibetans,

00:39:54.993 --> 00:39:56.660 align:middle line:84%
they haven't been
blowing up the bridges

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:59.120 align:middle line:84%
all the time, like in
Afghanistan or somewhere,

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.550 align:middle line:84%
or in Vietnam, because of
the particular intensity

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.710 align:middle line:84%
of the non-violence of
the Tibetan ideology.

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But eventually, they
will if this goes on.

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.682 align:middle line:84%
The Dalai Lama will not
be able to restrain them.

00:40:07.682 --> 00:40:09.890 align:middle line:84%
And the point is they haven't
done anything creative.

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:11.120 align:middle line:90%
They haven't been allowed to.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.310 align:middle line:84%
Whereas Tibetans in exile
have thrived and prospered

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.630 align:middle line:90%
with their creativity.

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.180 align:middle line:84%
And Tibet could be
a gem economically

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.950 align:middle line:90%
if China wasn't suppressing it.

00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:22.070 align:middle line:84%
It could be a fabulous tourist
destination, a fantastic health

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:22.940 align:middle line:90%
industry.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.370 align:middle line:84%
The Tibetans would make their
place as beautiful and as

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:27.470 align:middle line:84%
adorable and as cute as
when they come and give

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.450 align:middle line:84%
a teaching here or
make a mandala there

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.160 align:middle line:84%
or do chants in
the other places,

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.670 align:middle line:90%
or have shops out in the street.

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.128 align:middle line:84%
They're incredibly
creative people.

00:40:34.128 --> 00:40:35.910 align:middle line:84%
They're the Swiss
people of Asia.

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, the modern
economy, it is creative.

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:40.580 align:middle line:84%
I have a friend who
is a Chinologist who

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.980 align:middle line:84%
had his eyes open finally
learning about the "minority"

00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.660 align:middle line:84%
quote-unquote
situation in China,

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:45.980 align:middle line:90%
the Tibetans and everybody.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:50.058 align:middle line:84%
And he had a great thing when
his PRC people would say, oh,

00:40:50.058 --> 00:40:51.350 align:middle line:90%
it takes us so long to develop.

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:52.830 align:middle line:90%
We're so big.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.080 align:middle line:90%
Be patient with us.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:54.960 align:middle line:90%
We are third world.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.760 align:middle line:90%
We're so big.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.340 align:middle line:84%
And he would say, guys,
take a look at Hong Kong.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.250 align:middle line:84%
If bigness is a
problem, get small.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.960 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So for that reason,
I'm really optimistic.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Excellent.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> The military, and the PLA
and these people in China,

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.230 align:middle line:84%
People's Liberation Army,
they're making money ripping

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:15.200 align:middle line:84%
off the trees in
Tibet, some minerals.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And they have salaries
for their soldiers.

00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:18.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's a big
campaign for them.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:20.310 align:middle line:90%
It's a basic minus.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:23.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a deficit at this stage
in the national exchequer

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:24.620 align:middle line:90%
if somebody--

00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:27.770 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] or Jiang Zemin,
as economists from the coast,

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:29.540 align:middle line:84%
from Shanghai,
make a calculation,

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:32.240 align:middle line:84%
they are losing money on
Tibet, although individual PLA

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.003 align:middle line:90%
businesses are making money.

00:41:34.003 --> 00:41:35.420 align:middle line:84%
But the overall
Chinese people are

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.135 align:middle line:84%
losing money for this adventure
of theirs in the Himalayas.

00:41:38.135 --> 00:41:40.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:41.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So that's why I'm optimistic.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.405 align:middle line:84%
Because it's just not cost
effective to be nasty.

00:41:44.405 --> 00:41:45.205 align:middle line:90%
It's too expensive.

00:41:45.205 --> 00:41:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Besides being not
nice, it's too expensive.

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.010 align:middle line:84%
>> When people read
your most recent book,

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:54.240 align:middle line:84%
called "Circling the
Sacred Mountain"--

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.160 align:middle line:10%
>> --what would you want them
to know, to come away with?

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.380 align:middle line:10%
>> What I would want
them to come away with,

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.230 align:middle line:10%
besides a pleasant walk in
the mountains in this magic

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:05.990 align:middle line:10%
mountain, sacred not only
to Buddhists, but to Hindus,

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:07.910 align:middle line:10%
to Jains, to Bonpos--

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:10.790 align:middle line:10%
and I met a couple of
Japanese Christian monks

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:12.830 align:middle line:10%
who were circumnambulating
when I was there.

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.840 align:middle line:84%
I think it's one of the
holiest mountains in the world.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.310 align:middle line:84%
There's something
magical about it.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:21.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Isn't it said that when
you circle that mountain,

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:22.650 align:middle line:90%
your sins are eradicated.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:23.450 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's one of the--

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:25.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's a general
pilgrimage thing, know,

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.920 align:middle line:90%
lure in the same kind of thing.

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.950 align:middle line:90%
It's an Asian lure.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:28.950 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a lovely notion.

00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:29.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It is a lovely notion.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.530 align:middle line:84%
It's a rather harsh
mountain to get around

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:34.380 align:middle line:84%
because the high pass going
around is 18,600 feet.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> [GASPS]

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.860 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's quite a hike.

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.370 align:middle line:84%
But that's also kind of macho
and challenging and nice.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:40.170 align:middle line:90%
It's not dangerous.

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:41.160 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
climb with ropes.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:42.278 align:middle line:90%
But it's just a hard walk.

00:42:42.278 --> 00:42:43.320 align:middle line:90%
>> But it's hard to get--

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:44.320 align:middle line:84%
>> For one who's not
used to the climate.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:44.900 align:middle line:90%
>> --air.

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.350 align:middle line:84%
>> But I would like them
to enjoy the vista of this

00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:50.900 align:middle line:84%
wonderful-- and see the world
from this sort of sacred holy

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:51.200 align:middle line:90%
place.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.310 align:middle line:90%
That I would like.

00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:54.393 align:middle line:10%
And the other thing I would
like them to come away

00:42:54.393 --> 00:42:57.650 align:middle line:10%
with about Buddhism is
that Buddhism is not just

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:00.830 align:middle line:10%
some exotic, strange,
mysterious thing that is simply

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:03.918 align:middle line:10%
meditation, or simply some
sort of beads, or simply

00:43:03.918 --> 00:43:05.960 align:middle line:10%
some sort of magical
mantra, something like that,

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:07.310 align:middle line:10%
or some lama.

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism, basically,
is the turning away

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:15.200 align:middle line:84%
from self-obsession
and self-infatuation

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:19.850 align:middle line:84%
and self-preoccupation, and
turning towards altruism,

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:22.280 align:middle line:84%
and other sensitivity,
and lovingness

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.520 align:middle line:84%
and compassionateness to
others, and finding happiness

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.910 align:middle line:84%
through the happiness of others,
instead of being constantly

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:32.030 align:middle line:84%
satisfied by focusing
on how happy you are,

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.160 align:middle line:90%
which will never be good enough.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.792 align:middle line:84%
When you focus on
how happy you are,

00:43:35.792 --> 00:43:37.250 align:middle line:84%
even when you're
having fun, you're

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:38.875 align:middle line:84%
going to be dissatisfied
because you'll

00:43:38.875 --> 00:43:40.630 align:middle line:84%
remember you had more
fun another time,

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:43.700 align:middle line:84%
or it could be better this way
or something better that way.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.838 align:middle line:84%
So that is really
what Buddhism is.

00:43:45.838 --> 00:43:47.255 align:middle line:84%
You know, so many
people, I think,

00:43:47.255 --> 00:43:49.160 align:middle line:90%
think about it negatively.

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.410 align:middle line:84%
They think it's just some
running away from the world.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.090 align:middle line:84%
And when they think
they're positive,

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:54.548 align:middle line:84%
they think it's
some sort of escape

00:43:54.548 --> 00:43:57.720 align:middle line:84%
into some meditative state,
away from their problems.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.400 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, what Buddhism is
the same thing that humanism

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.470 align:middle line:84%
wants, the same thing
that Christianity wants,

00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:05.540 align:middle line:84%
that Judaism wants,
that Islam wants,

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Hinduism wants, which
is to help people

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:11.725 align:middle line:84%
find more happiness by being
less selfish basically.

00:44:11.725 --> 00:44:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And I give a
teaching there which

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:15.350 align:middle line:84%
I gave to the people
on the mountain, which

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.710 align:middle line:84%
comes from ninth
century Tibet and Bengal

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:21.450 align:middle line:84%
and so forth, some of the great
Indian masters of that time,

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:24.140 align:middle line:84%
in a period when India
was under invasion

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:26.730 align:middle line:84%
from various steppe, nomadic
people who were laying waste

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:27.530 align:middle line:90%
to India.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.200 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very,
very dangerous time

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.590 align:middle line:84%
for everybody, which is called
"The Blade Wheel of Mind

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:34.437 align:middle line:90%
Reform."

00:44:34.437 --> 00:44:35.270 align:middle line:90%
>> The Blade Wheel--

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> "The Blade Wheel of
Mind-- the blade wheel is one

00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:38.450 align:middle line:84%
of the things that the
ninjas throw, you know?

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:40.550 align:middle line:84%
It's a spinning knife with
the blades on all sides.

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:41.350 align:middle line:90%
>> I see, yes.

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Like a roto-rooter
or something.

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And "The Blade Wheel of Mind
Reform" is like a very fierce--

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.550 align:middle line:84%
it's a very fierce image
of using a wheel like that

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:52.820 align:middle line:84%
to conquer the inner
enemy of selfishness

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:56.810 align:middle line:84%
and to reform the mind from
being self-inverted and focused

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:59.660 align:middle line:84%
on itself to opening into
the world and realizing

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:01.395 align:middle line:84%
what a marvelous,
magical place it is.

00:45:01.395 --> 00:45:03.020 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I
would really like them

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.640 align:middle line:90%
to come away with in that book.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think I was inspired
to do that because being

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:10.670 align:middle line:84%
in that place of
that mountain, you

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:13.632 align:middle line:84%
didn't feel like a beating
around the bush, you know,

00:45:13.632 --> 00:45:15.590 align:middle line:84%
because you're in this
amazing place in nature.

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:19.640 align:middle line:84%
I swear I'm not that
good an environmentalist.

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:21.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm not psychic or anything.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.110 align:middle line:84%
But it was like when I
woke up the first morning

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:25.130 align:middle line:90%
in that place--

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and the surface of it,
the little town near it

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.058 align:middle line:84%
is terribly grubby,
Chinese garrison.

00:45:30.058 --> 00:45:32.600 align:middle line:84%
You know, the Tibetan pilgrims
are sort of suppressed and so.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.870 align:middle line:90%
On and it's broken glass.

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:39.050 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you know, underfed
dogs, it's not that cute.

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:41.060 align:middle line:84%
But somehow, the whole
land, and the earth,

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:43.715 align:middle line:84%
and the mountain, the ice,
was all alive and glowing.

00:45:43.715 --> 00:45:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And I've never seen
nature like that.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And I was totally surprised.

00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:49.490 align:middle line:90%
I was like--

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:50.960 align:middle line:84%
I was embarrassed when
I first got there.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.860 align:middle line:84%
I thought oh, what
a grubby place.

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.270 align:middle line:90%
I brought all these people here.

00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:55.520 align:middle line:84%
It's just another dumb place
that some pilgrims thinks

00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:57.780 align:middle line:84%
is great, but it's
just a bunch of rocks.

00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.630 align:middle line:84%
I woke up in the
morning, and the rocks

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:03.180 align:middle line:84%
were dancing and
singing and glowing.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.618 align:middle line:90%
And I couldn't believe it.

00:46:04.618 --> 00:46:06.660 align:middle line:84%
And then everybody who
was there the whole time--

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.000 align:middle line:90%
And another property of Mt.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Kailash-- anybody
who goes there,

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.520 align:middle line:84%
they should take pictures of
their ancestors, any departed

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.950 align:middle line:90%
loved one, lock of hair.

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:18.110 align:middle line:84%
Tibetans do that, these
different sort of-- they're

00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:20.240 align:middle line:84%
not really graveyards,
they're commemoration yards,

00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.370 align:middle line:84%
which look a little
bit like junk heaps.

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:25.400 align:middle line:84%
But people put
articles of clothing.

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Because when you
go there, you start

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:30.410 align:middle line:84%
to think of all of your roots
and the past generations.

00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:32.600 align:middle line:84%
And the Tibetans
believe that if you

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.090 align:middle line:84%
make prayers for even
people in the past,

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:38.350 align:middle line:84%
the power of the deities
of that place is so great,

00:46:38.350 --> 00:46:41.000 align:middle line:84%
they can sort of go and help
people in the past even,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.530 align:middle line:90%
change even a negative past.

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.700 align:middle line:84%
It's sort of a miraculous
thing, you know.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.010 align:middle line:90%
And it's very, very moving.

00:46:46.010 --> 00:46:47.870 align:middle line:90%
It really is a moving place.

00:46:47.870 --> 00:46:51.020 align:middle line:84%
So I hope everyone will enjoy
that when they read that book.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.990 align:middle line:84%
>> "Circling the Sacred
Mountain," I think they will.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:55.920 align:middle line:90%
I thank you for all your books.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:56.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.510 align:middle line:84%
>> I thank you for your
extraordinary words,

00:46:59.510 --> 00:47:01.660 align:middle line:90%
your compassion in the world.

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:03.930 align:middle line:84%
And mostly, I thank you
for being a noisy Buddhist.

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:06.330 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS] Thank you very much.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.370 align:middle line:90%
That's very nice.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:11.020 align:middle line:90%
