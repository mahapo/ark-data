00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning, first of all.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And thank you so much for
sitting down with me all three

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.450 align:middle line:90%
of you.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Good to be here.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.010 align:middle line:10%
>> It occurs to me as I sit
here looking at the three of you

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.750 align:middle line:10%
that one of the things that
you have in common, well,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.710 align:middle line:10%
check me out on this.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:10%
See if I'm right.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.175 align:middle line:10%
Do all of you come from
parents who meditate?

00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:49.975 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:50.775 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:53.610 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, I think we all
come from parents who have

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.930 align:middle line:10%
addictions to certain things,
and one of them is meditation.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.510 align:middle line:10%
>> That's such a
wonderful addiction.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:90%
Isn't it?

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>> What was the example that
was set for you, I'm wondering.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.400 align:middle line:84%
And how did it affect
you in your lives?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with you, Gotham.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Let me start by saying, I
started meditating when I was

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.650 align:middle line:90%
five years old.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.500 align:middle line:10%
And it was a simple technique.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.445 align:middle line:10%
And it was probably
nothing more than staying

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.070 align:middle line:10%
quiet for five minutes
at a time, which

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.350 align:middle line:10%
was quite an achievement
for a five-year-old.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:10%
And the reason I wanted to
start is because my parents

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.560 align:middle line:10%
were doing it.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.150 align:middle line:10%
My sister was doing it.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.720 align:middle line:84%
And they led by example because
I wanted to be part of the fun.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.280 align:middle line:84%
It seemed like I
was being left out.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.860 align:middle line:90%
So that's when I started.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:84%
And then I learned a more
traditional technique

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.880 align:middle line:90%
when I was about 12 years old.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.710 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I mean, I could
detect from a very young age

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:84%
in my parents and
then later in myself

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that there was some
sense of silence.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.820 align:middle line:84%
Even in the midst
of everything else,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.220 align:middle line:84%
as long as I was
meditating consistently,

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.700 align:middle line:84%
I felt some anchored in
some sense of silence.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.880 align:middle line:84%
So that was the greatest
example of meditation

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.520 align:middle line:90%
that my parents set for me.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Noah, what about you?

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.572 align:middle line:10%
>> The one example that
sticks out in my mind is,

00:02:08.572 --> 00:02:10.530 align:middle line:10%
although there was lots
of meditation practice,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.550 align:middle line:10%
spiritual practice
going on around,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.660 align:middle line:10%
was never really
imposed or offered.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.470 align:middle line:10%
My father didn't train me to
meditate as a young person.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.500 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, those seeds
were sown in my consciousness

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.110 align:middle line:90%
just from being around it.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
One example is I can remember
burning myself pretty

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:84%
bad on a heater when I was
about four or five years old,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.830 align:middle line:90%
about that same age.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.680 align:middle line:84%
And my instant reaction, I
think people's instant reaction

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.920 align:middle line:84%
is to tighten and maybe
get angry at the pain,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.180 align:middle line:90%
out of the fear.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And my father's
instruction was to really

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.250 align:middle line:84%
soften to it, to send
love to the pain,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.868 align:middle line:84%
to send softness
into the sensation,

00:02:46.868 --> 00:02:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and to watch the
sensation moment to moment

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.830 align:middle line:84%
as it passes, rather than
just screaming and sending

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.570 align:middle line:84%
the hatred into, damn you,
my body that hurt so badly.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And so then throughout my
life, I had that conditioning

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.770 align:middle line:84%
of when I stubbed my toe,
rather than my instant reaction

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.360 align:middle line:84%
might be to tighten and
to send anger to it,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:84%
but then to also remember
how softening dissipates

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:90%
the pain much more quickly.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.650 align:middle line:84%
So things like that that weren't
like, this is meditation,

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.370 align:middle line:84%
but certainly that came out
of the meditative tradition.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Ocean.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, my mom and dad
meditated many hours a day

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.840 align:middle line:10%
in my early years.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.710 align:middle line:10%
I was born on a little
island off the coast

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.590 align:middle line:10%
of British Columbia, Canada
in a one room log cabin

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.630 align:middle line:10%
three miles from the
nearest neighbor.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And I grew up poor
economically, but feeling rich

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.175 align:middle line:84%
because I had beautiful
forest to enjoy.

00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:43.600 align:middle line:90%
I had clean water and clean air.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.540 align:middle line:90%
I had time with my mom and dad.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.230 align:middle line:84%
And they were in a very
deep meditative space.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.280 align:middle line:84%
They grew almost
all their own food.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.700 align:middle line:84%
They lived on less
than $500 a year.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.440 align:middle line:84%
And their whole life revolved
around meditation and yoga

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and spiritual practice and
connection with the earth.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.780 align:middle line:84%
And as I was a little older, we
wound up moving to California.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.210 align:middle line:84%
And I came to see
that not everyone had

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
the kind of opportunities
that I had as a youngster.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And so then my
focus in life became

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.010 align:middle line:84%
working to see to it that
everyone could have things

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.380 align:middle line:84%
like time with their mom and
dad and a safe environment

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.740 align:middle line:84%
to live in and forests to enjoy
because I felt that everyone

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.570 align:middle line:90%
deserved those things.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.640 align:middle line:84%
And it didn't feel
right that I should

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.610 align:middle line:84%
have those kinds of privileges
where other people grew up

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.860 align:middle line:84%
with gangs and concrete
for their environment.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And so my whole life really
has revolved since then

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.460 align:middle line:84%
around service and working
to make this world a better

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.877 align:middle line:90%
place for everybody.

00:04:42.877 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
>> How different do you suppose
the world would be today

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.610 align:middle line:84%
environmentally, politically,
financially, I guess, too,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.830 align:middle line:84%
so many ways, if we all
meditated very early

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:90%
on in our lives?

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Look at the smile that
comes across Noah's face.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:90%
How different would it be?

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Very.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.900 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I can't say, you know?

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.847 align:middle line:90%
>> You can speculate.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:07.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't even feel
like I could speculate.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.010 align:middle line:84%
But I feel like it'd be
much different if we all

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:17.190 align:middle line:84%
learned to encourage kindness,
encourage compassion and love

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.820 align:middle line:84%
and self forgiveness and
forgiveness of others

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:84%
from a young age, rather
than what we really

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.870 align:middle line:84%
seem to be purging is
punishment and lots of judgment

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.150 align:middle line:84%
and lots of anger and fear is
what it seems to be constantly

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.780 align:middle line:90%
barraging us from all angles.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.990 align:middle line:84%
A lot of parenting is based on
those principles of punishment.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.860 align:middle line:84%
And so I think it would
probably be very different.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you look at other
cultures that have meditative,

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
if you look at Tibetans
or some of the people

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.340 align:middle line:84%
who have grown up with this
meditative environment,

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.360 align:middle line:84%
their culture is much
different than American society

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.520 align:middle line:90%
and culture, much more peaceful.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Another thing that
comes to my mind,

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.930 align:middle line:84%
as I look at the three of
you, are the words spiritual

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:84%
heritage, because you all come
from extraordinary spiritual

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:90%
heritage.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:10%
Do you feel a sense
of responsibility,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.470 align:middle line:10%
and I think in the very
best sense of the word,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.340 align:middle line:10%
but do you feel, are you
aware of a responsibility

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.430 align:middle line:10%
to carry it on?

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.740 align:middle line:90%
Start with you, Gotham.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I think in a certain respect.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
But I have to admit
something fairly selfish.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.960 align:middle line:84%
In terms of things that
I do, I do it mostly

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.680 align:middle line:90%
because I really enjoy it.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.220 align:middle line:84%
And I derive a great sense
of fulfillment for it.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's the best
example that I can send,

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.330 align:middle line:84%
the best example I can carry on
from the work my dad has done.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.300 align:middle line:84%
Because I can tell just from
hanging out with him still

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:84%
that everything he does, whether
it's a book or a music project

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.630 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, he's just
enjoying it so much.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:10%
And that's another lesson
I've learned from him.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.720 align:middle line:10%
And hopefully, I think
by bring that energy,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.810 align:middle line:10%
I might be able to
encourage other people

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.713 align:middle line:10%
and be a model for other people.

00:07:12.713 --> 00:07:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's some of the
work we're all involved in,

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.880 align:middle line:84%
which is setting
examples for young people

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.560 align:middle line:84%
to express themselves
in whichever way

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.370 align:middle line:84%
it is, not in any
specific way, but to help

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.550 align:middle line:84%
empower them to feel
like their voices matter

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.520 align:middle line:84%
and what they want
to do is important.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Noah.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:39.180 align:middle line:10%
>> I definitely feel a sense of
indebtedness to the wonderful

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.360 align:middle line:10%
tools that I've been given
that have transformed my life

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:47.100 align:middle line:10%
in so many really practical
ways that I really want to share

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.435 align:middle line:10%
that with others.

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:50.310 align:middle line:10%
And specifically, I
really want to share that

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:10%
with my generation
and the subculture

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.650 align:middle line:10%
that I've grown up in.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:84%
It's really easy
for me now, I spend

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.250 align:middle line:84%
a lot of my time in
meditation centers

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.700 align:middle line:84%
and all of these wonderful,
loving, spiritual circles,

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.670 align:middle line:84%
to forget about all of my
friends who have grown up

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:09.180 align:middle line:84%
on the streets and have grown up
in really difficult situations,

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.820 align:middle line:84%
where I spent a lot
of my early life.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But I really feel
an indebtedness

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:84%
to share the Dharma
practice with my peers.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:23.160 align:middle line:84%
Which, for me, are a lot
of underprivileged kids

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.470 align:middle line:84%
that have found
themselves into punk rock

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:29.190 align:middle line:84%
scenes and the tattoo scenes
and to hip hop culture

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:34.480 align:middle line:84%
into '90s subculture, and
where spirituality is greatly

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.280 align:middle line:90%
lacking.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.299 align:middle line:90%
You know, is greatly lacking.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:40.440 align:middle line:84%
And so rather than me
taking my life experience

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and going and
spending all my time

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.280 align:middle line:84%
with middle aged people, who
I do spend a lot of my time

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.520 align:middle line:84%
with at the meditation centers,
to really bring it back

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:55.350 align:middle line:84%
onto the streets and back
into the cabs and stuff where

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:57.010 align:middle line:90%
my generation is.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:57.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:02.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And so I definitely do, not
so much to pay anybody back

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.460 align:middle line:84%
or anything, but just that I
feel clearly that's the best

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.590 align:middle line:90%
use of my life's energy.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:07.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.290 align:middle line:84%
And it manifests all over,
by the way, all over,

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.093 align:middle line:84%
not just in the cities
that you're working in.

00:09:13.093 --> 00:09:14.010 align:middle line:90%
What about you, Ocean?

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.090 align:middle line:84%
What does your spiritual
heritage responsibility

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.410 align:middle line:90%
give you?

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel a profound sense
of gratitude for the example

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.080 align:middle line:90%
my parents have set.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.590 align:middle line:10%
And I look at what they
came from in their lives

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.330 align:middle line:10%
and the challenges
they grew up with

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.300 align:middle line:10%
and how hard they had to
struggle to try and have

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.910 align:middle line:10%
some sense of who they were in a
culture and an environment that

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.160 align:middle line:10%
was constantly telling them
to try to be someone else.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.990 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that so many of
us are surrounded by messages

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:50.010 align:middle line:84%
that don't affirm our souls and
our integrity and who we are,

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.770 align:middle line:84%
models that we don't
want to follow.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:56.040 align:middle line:84%
And I am so grateful that I have
their example to learn from.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Not that I'm the same person.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.060 align:middle line:84%
I'm a unique individual
with my own path

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.510 align:middle line:84%
and my own destiny, my own
dreams, and my own prayers.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:84%
But I pick up where they left
off, or where they leave off,

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:84%
or where they've gotten
to in their lives so far.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's a starting
place for me.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.690 align:middle line:84%
And it's such a boost
to start from a place

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.810 align:middle line:84%
where I have the benefit of a
whole lifetime of questioning

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.420 align:middle line:84%
and learning and growing
and seeking to build on.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:32.092 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.092 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Noah, you said something
interesting that I'd like

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.450 align:middle line:84%
to hear all three of
you guys talk about.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.730 align:middle line:84%
You used the term
just practical advice.

00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:44.710 align:middle line:10%
Because there is still a
huge part of our society

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:47.500 align:middle line:10%
who looks at me, the
person who grew up

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.440 align:middle line:10%
in the '60s, wanting
to change the world,

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.220 align:middle line:10%
looks at you growing up in the
'90s, almost out of the '90s,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:10%
wanting to change the world.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And they think we're just
those woo woo people.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:84%
They think we're just sort
of those do-gooder people.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.140 align:middle line:84%
I think it's time to talk
about practical advice.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And I love that
you have a concept

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.710 align:middle line:84%
of putting practical
advice out there

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.930 align:middle line:84%
in the world for
people your age.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:90%
So let's talk about that.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.620 align:middle line:90%
What is some of that advice?

00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, it's just really
so basically just comes down

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.720 align:middle line:90%
to like, what's life about?

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.740 align:middle line:90%
What's human?

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> But that's what I
want to hear about.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:25.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Like what's the point?

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:26.320 align:middle line:90%
Like why are we here?

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.140 align:middle line:90%
What's the point?

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.748 align:middle line:90%
I thought it's really clear.

00:11:28.748 --> 00:11:30.040 align:middle line:90%
It's like it's about happiness.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Right?

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.200 align:middle line:90%
And it's everybody.

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Universally, we all
want to be happy.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:34.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.028 align:middle line:10%
>> And so how do
we find happiness?

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:38.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, do we find
happiness in judgment,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:10%
or do we find happiness
in forgiveness?

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.250 align:middle line:84%
And do we find
happiness in anger,

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.670 align:middle line:90%
or do we find happiness in love?

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.470 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:90%
So I mean, it's practical.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:46.780 align:middle line:90%
It's really basic.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.010 align:middle line:90%
It's not woo woo.

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.020 align:middle line:90%
It's not anything.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:50.930 align:middle line:90%
It's just what is.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:51.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:52.530 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:56.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's just about utilizing
practices that encourage love,

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that encourage forgiveness,
that encourage awakening,

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.700 align:middle line:84%
whatever you want to
call it, consciousness,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.887 align:middle line:84%
awareness of who we are
and what we're doing here.

00:12:06.887 --> 00:12:08.470 align:middle line:84%
And that, yeah, we
all want happiness.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.012 align:middle line:84%
And some of us think
that we're going

00:12:10.012 --> 00:12:13.600 align:middle line:84%
to find happiness by beating
each other, by revenge,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.590 align:middle line:90%
by those things.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Just switching that
and seeing clearly

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:84%
that that never has brought
happiness to anybody

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.150 align:middle line:84%
and it never will, and that
will bring happiness to you

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.200 align:middle line:84%
is forgiving yourself
and forgiving that person

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.050 align:middle line:84%
and learning to love
better and learning

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:90%
to be more peaceful and happy.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.090 align:middle line:84%
And so yeah, it's
very practical.

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's almost silly
to even call it practical.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.580 align:middle line:84%
It's just it's
such common sense.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.590 align:middle line:84%
But for some reason, we've
gotten so far away from that,

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:49.420 align:middle line:84%
that now it seems woo woo or
seems like some hippie ideal

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.335 align:middle line:90%
to be happy, to be peaceful.

00:12:51.335 --> 00:12:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you see the importance
of talking about it, though?

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:84%
>> There are people, I
believe, who are hungry

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.600 align:middle line:90%
for the knowledge.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.790 align:middle line:84%
And though it is just
practical and basic,

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.830 align:middle line:84%
I think it's important to
still put it out there and say,

00:13:03.830 --> 00:13:05.350 align:middle line:90%
this is how you begin.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:09.760 align:middle line:84%
There's a huge wave of
spirituality crossing America

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.440 align:middle line:84%
in terms of health and
the environment, Ocean,

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.700 align:middle line:84%
what practical advice
do you put out there?

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, a lot of people
feel overwhelmed by the state

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:19.510 align:middle line:10%
of our world today.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.000 align:middle line:10%
And a lot of people feel
like their only options

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.770 align:middle line:10%
are to be lost in despair or
to go numb and push it away.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:10%
I think we have a third option,
which is far more appealing.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:32.390 align:middle line:84%
And that's to seek to
find a positive response.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:36.580 align:middle line:84%
I think that we can hear
the problems around us

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.920 align:middle line:84%
as a call to a place
inside us that says, hey,

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.280 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to just stand
by and let this go on.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.390 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
something about it.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.090 align:middle line:84%
The bigger the
problems are, the more

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.390 align:middle line:90%
needed we are in this world.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Example.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:51.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And for example, we can
eat lower on the food chain.

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.400 align:middle line:84%
It takes 16 pounds of grain
to produce one pound of beef

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.550 align:middle line:90%
in this country.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:84%
So if we eat one
less pound of beef,

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.250 align:middle line:84%
we are essentially
enabling 15 people

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.740 align:middle line:84%
to eat with the
food that's saved.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.250 align:middle line:90%
We can choose to recycle.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Recycling one aluminum can
saves enough energy to power

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.430 align:middle line:84%
a car on the freeway
for two miles.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Does it really?

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.265 align:middle line:84%
>> If the car gets 40
miles per gallon, yeah.

00:14:12.265 --> 00:14:13.065 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:14:13.065 --> 00:14:14.120 align:middle line:90%
That's astonishing.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.453 align:middle line:84%
>> There are huge numbers
of things we can do.

00:14:16.453 --> 00:14:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And we've just got to
start thinking about it.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.108 align:middle line:90%
Every dollar we spend is a vote.

00:14:20.108 --> 00:14:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And we're voting for the
company that made the product,

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and we're voting for
the way they made it.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:26.453 align:middle line:84%
So do we want to support
child labor in China?

00:14:26.453 --> 00:14:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to support pesticide
deaths on the grape fields

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.890 align:middle line:90%
of California?

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:90%
Do we want to go organic?

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to buy
from local companies?

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.110 align:middle line:84%
Do we want to choose
to make our dollars

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.480 align:middle line:84%
into a vote for the kind
of world we want to create?

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.370 align:middle line:90%
I personally do.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You have me very
enrolled, Ocean.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.273 align:middle line:84%
Mr. Chopra, your personal,
practical advice?

00:14:45.273 --> 00:14:47.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I think the
most practical application,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.950 align:middle line:84%
we talk about street
spirituality, I guess,

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:90%
our generation.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:10%
>> The most practical
application is, one,

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:58.030 align:middle line:10%
to start asking the
appropriate questions.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:01.930 align:middle line:10%
And for young people, those are
the most fundamental things.

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:02.780 align:middle line:90%
Why am I here?

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:90%
What do I believe in?

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
And two, things that we can do
is the willingness to listen,

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:14.570 align:middle line:84%
because that's the
biggest problem, I think,

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.510 align:middle line:84%
is that there's
not this space yet

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.190 align:middle line:84%
where young people feel secure
and safe to ask those questions

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:23.000 align:middle line:90%
and have people listen to them.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.230 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's some
of the work we're doing

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.390 align:middle line:84%
is trying to create
that space and trying

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.490 align:middle line:84%
to create that vocabulary,
one, where young people can

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:34.830 align:middle line:84%
start to talk about their
spirituality and articulate it.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
But also showing the willingness
to listen and not judge.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:41.450 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes, when
you ask those questions,

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.160 align:middle line:84%
you come up with
some wild responses,

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.240 align:middle line:90%
especially from young people.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.110 align:middle line:84%
But they don't
need to be judged.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.060 align:middle line:90%
They need to be heard.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, very well said.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.600 align:middle line:84%
The gift of listening
is vital in our world

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.690 align:middle line:84%
today, especially
to your generation.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.450 align:middle line:84%
Are you optimistic
about the future?

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:02.180 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you picked
the right group to ask that

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:90%
question.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.200 align:middle line:84%
Because, yeah, I think we
face tremendous challenges.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And those challenges
can be intimidating

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.510 align:middle line:84%
when you look at the scale
of some of the things

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.070 align:middle line:90%
that we have to resolve.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.990 align:middle line:10%
But at least amongst
this group, I've

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.050 align:middle line:10%
got the feeling that
there's a willingness

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:10%
to take small steps,
because, ultimately, that's

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.360 align:middle line:10%
where you have to start.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.370 align:middle line:10%
And I'm very optimistic.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.400 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I know, again,
I'm excited by everything

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.200 align:middle line:10%
I'm doing.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.200 align:middle line:10%
And I'm excited to go
and interact with people

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.030 align:middle line:10%
and to go to schools
and meet young people,

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.700 align:middle line:10%
because the assumption,
a lot of times,

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.880 align:middle line:10%
is that young people
don't care, that they're

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.840 align:middle line:10%
distracted by other things.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.340 align:middle line:10%
But we've found that's not
true, that if you engage

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:50.330 align:middle line:10%
young people at a very
honest and raw level,

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.820 align:middle line:10%
they'll give you the
most incredible responses

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:57.870 align:middle line:10%
and they'll show you new ways to
really create a better future.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:58.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.410 align:middle line:10%
>> What about your
optimism, Ocean?

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, my level of optimism
about what I see going on out

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:06.438 align:middle line:10%
there fluctuates every day.

00:17:06.438 --> 00:17:08.730 align:middle line:10%
Some days, I think, oh, yes,
things are turning around.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be great.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I think, oh, no,
this world is totally doomed.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that that's where

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:17.160 align:middle line:84%
we need to source in for our
strength and our courage.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:17.960 align:middle line:90%
>> No?

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.119 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we need to source
in the hopes and the dreams

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.780 align:middle line:84%
and the prayers
that live inside us.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.660 align:middle line:90%
They're eternal.

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.839 align:middle line:84%
>> They never go away
unless we snuff them out.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:29.480 align:middle line:84%
And as long as we are
breathing and we are praying

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and we are dreaming
of a better way,

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.980 align:middle line:84%
we can have optimism,
if we choose to.

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for that reminder.

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:36.725 align:middle line:90%
What about you, Noah?

00:17:36.725 --> 00:17:40.160 align:middle line:84%
What are your thoughts
for your children?

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't currently
have any children.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, your children
of the future.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:48.620 align:middle line:84%
>> As far of the future, I mean,
part of me really feels like

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.990 align:middle line:84%
what's really
important is right now.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:54.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not even so sure
that the future exists.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.020 align:middle line:84%
The present moment is really
what we have and is really

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.383 align:middle line:90%
where we can do our work.

00:17:58.383 --> 00:18:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, all of the work
that we're doing in the present

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:06.080 align:middle line:84%
will affect what will come,
if and when that comes.

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.840 align:middle line:84%
I have a great
amount of optimism

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and really deep understanding
that personal freedom is

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:16.820 align:middle line:84%
possible and is
happening for people.

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:20.030 align:middle line:84%
Out of my own experience,
the vast array of

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
experiences of suffering
and of happiness and joy

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
that I've had in this one
short incarnation thus far,

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.620 align:middle line:84%
that that will
probably continue.

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.120 align:middle line:84%
But I don't feel
real comfortable

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:84%
speculating on what the
future is going to be.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:40.970 align:middle line:84%
I have a real faith that no
matter what it is, it'll be OK.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:48.900 align:middle line:10%
>> What do the three of you say
to probably the largest group

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.610 align:middle line:10%
of people existing in
American society today,

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:10%
and that's the baby boomers,
those of us who were you

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.570 align:middle line:10%
in the 60s, those of
us who were activists,

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.940 align:middle line:10%
those of us who marched in
Berkeley and Washington?

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.140 align:middle line:90%
I was one of those people.

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.380 align:middle line:84%
What do you say to that
group of people today?

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.940 align:middle line:90%
What do you say to us?

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to say, thank you
for giving us the opportunity

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:19.248 align:middle line:84%
and giving us the upbringing to
feel empowered and comfortable

00:19:19.248 --> 00:19:21.040 align:middle line:84%
with the things that
we want to talk about.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.880 align:middle line:84%
We're very grateful,
not only to our parents,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.650 align:middle line:84%
but to their
generation at large.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:28.550 align:middle line:90%
So that's one thing.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.090 align:middle line:84%
And the other
thing is the dream,

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:34.380 align:middle line:84%
I guess, is still alive,
and that some people may

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.480 align:middle line:84%
have forgotten
that, may have got

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.090 align:middle line:84%
caught up in the drama that
is jobs and relationships

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.120 align:middle line:84%
and schools and
everything like that.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.690 align:middle line:84%
But there's still
a lot of hope left.

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:50.170 align:middle line:84%
And we welcome them back,
if that's what it takes.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:51.900 align:middle line:90%
But it's exciting.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.800 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's not just
that we can make a change,

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:58.290 align:middle line:84%
but that we are together
making a change.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.300 align:middle line:84%
And it's cool to
be a part of that.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:05.100 align:middle line:84%
And we're excited, whether it's
the baby boomers or Generation

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.020 align:middle line:84%
Y or whoever, to jump
on the bandwagon,

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:90%
because it's a fun ride.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:10.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.740 align:middle line:90%
Noah, know your message to us?

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:15.810 align:middle line:90%
>> I really like that.

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:10%
I think that gratitude
for having brought

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.240 align:middle line:10%
all of these wonderful
spiritual traditions to us,

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:10%
all of this wonderful
political activism,

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:31.120 align:middle line:10%
and the changes that
took place in the world

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.190 align:middle line:10%
due to the activism of
that generation, beautiful.

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:40.890 align:middle line:10%
And just I would like to ask
you to please continue, not

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:10%
to forget about it, not to
become jaded or feel like that

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.210 align:middle line:10%
was something you did
while you were in college,

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:52.050 align:middle line:10%
and now, you're stuck in your
household or raising a family

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:55.320 align:middle line:10%
and that there's
not much you can do.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.840 align:middle line:10%
Personally, I feel like
the most that we can all do

00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.540 align:middle line:10%
is really to focus
deeply on ourselves,

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.510 align:middle line:10%
to really focus deeply on
our own spiritual practice,

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:08.250 align:middle line:10%
on our own awakening, on our
own happiness, and just to ask,

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:10%
can we all just try
to wake up ourselves?

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.110 align:middle line:10%
The biggest, greatest
service we can

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:10%
do for all beings everywhere,
I think, is our own awakening,

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:10%
is our own greater sense
of peace and happiness

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:20.167 align:middle line:10%
in our lives.

00:21:20.167 --> 00:21:21.750 align:middle line:84%
So if people would
just continue that,

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.670 align:middle line:84%
continue that work
on themselves.

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.900 align:middle line:10%
And to that, I send out a plea.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.264 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:29.264 --> 00:21:30.190 align:middle line:90%
Ocean.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.470 align:middle line:84%
>> I think a lot of people in
your generation have gotten

00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:84%
so caught up on thinking, oh,
I've got to save myself before

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.500 align:middle line:90%
I can save the world.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And maybe in the '60s, there was
this breakthrough of activism.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And then there was a
shift towards self focus

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:49.175 align:middle line:84%
in terms of both spiritual
growth and also economic focus.

00:21:49.175 --> 00:21:50.550 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
what I would say

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:52.650 align:middle line:84%
is, you don't have to
save yourself first.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:55.260 align:middle line:84%
I think it needs to
be a joint process.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:56.250 align:middle line:90%
We work on ourselves.

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:57.333 align:middle line:90%
We work on the world.

00:21:57.333 --> 00:21:58.500 align:middle line:90%
We bring peace to ourselves.

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.070 align:middle line:90%
We bring peace to the world.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:05.070 align:middle line:84%
And I think that spirituality
that is focused internally

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:09.690 align:middle line:84%
and doesn't have a response
to the pain and the cries

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.200 align:middle line:84%
of the children dying and
the pain of our cities

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
and the pain of our
times is pretty empty.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
it will not truly

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:22.020 align:middle line:84%
have the depth or the meaning
that it can until we respond

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.760 align:middle line:90%
to what's going on around us.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:84%
I would also say, look at
the gap between the rich

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:90%
and the poor in this country.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.550 align:middle line:84%
This country is becoming
a virtual symbol

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:33.160 align:middle line:84%
around the world of greed
at the expense of the poor.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.920 align:middle line:84%
And I think that we can
do better than that.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.430 align:middle line:84%
And I think that those
in your generation that

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:84%
have achieved a certain
level of success,

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.380 align:middle line:84%
now need, for their
own well-being,

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.230 align:middle line:84%
to look, OK, before I die,
what is my contribution going

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.490 align:middle line:90%
to be to this world?

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:49.570 align:middle line:84%
When I pass over
to the other side,

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:84%
do I want to say, oh, I
did a great job making

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:53.300 align:middle line:84%
enough money to
have a nice house

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.500 align:middle line:90%
and I gave up on all my ideals?

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't think so.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:23:01.272 align:middle line:90%
>> I thank you for your passion.

00:23:01.272 --> 00:23:04.340 align:middle line:90%
I thank you for your commitment.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:08.050 align:middle line:84%
And I thank you for
reigniting the fire

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.000 align:middle line:84%
in a lot of people's
hearts, because that

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.690 align:middle line:84%
takes a powerful,
powerful group of people.

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:20.660 align:middle line:84%
And each one of you individually
are extraordinary human beings.

00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:21.680 align:middle line:90%
You humble me.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.480 align:middle line:90%
You really do.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:23.813 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for this conversation.

00:23:23.813 --> 00:23:24.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.
