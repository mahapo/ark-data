00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:03.472 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.472 --> 00:00:31.310 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:10%
>> In "Echoes of the Soul,"
you talk about something that I

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.810 align:middle line:10%
think so many people
are interested in today.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with the
most basic question.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.980 align:middle line:90%
What is a soul?

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:90%
>> A soul is--

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.080 align:middle line:84%
first of all, it's
made up of energy.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.185 align:middle line:84%
And it takes on many
different forms.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:57.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.440 align:middle line:10%
It's the part of
us that never dies.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.400 align:middle line:10%
It's the part of us that was
created a long, long time ago.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.470 align:middle line:84%
And we have the same soul in
every lifetime that we live.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.130 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose for
all of those lifetimes

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.170 align:middle line:84%
is to help the soul develop
to its highest potential.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Now that's interesting to me
that you say we have the same

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.430 align:middle line:84%
soul in every lifetime we live
because I would have thought--

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.470 align:middle line:90%
correct me if I'm wrong--

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.170 align:middle line:84%
when we die, our
soul leaves our body.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, it does.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So, if there
is reincarnation,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.660 align:middle line:84%
and we come back to
this Earth again,

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.140 align:middle line:90%
does that same soul come back?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, yes.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.740 align:middle line:90%
>> It does?

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it does.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.360 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that
it comes back to Earth

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.080 align:middle line:84%
is to, again, have another
life experiences so that it

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.280 align:middle line:90%
can develop itself even better.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.240 align:middle line:84%
So each soul-- each
one of us has a soul.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And the soul is
continually progressing,

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.010 align:middle line:90%
healing, changing, growing.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, it's always-- we
always have the same soul.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.770 align:middle line:84%
But, I mean, on the
one hand, I can say

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.318 align:middle line:90%
we always have the same soul.

00:02:08.318 --> 00:02:09.860 align:middle line:84%
But, on the other
hand, I have to say

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:90%
our soul is always changing.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:11.150 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's
growing, as we are.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, as the vessel
changes, then so does the soul.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but we are
the same soul, OK?

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.990 align:middle line:84%
I mean, we-- people
think that we

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.160 align:middle line:84%
have different souls with each
lifetime, but that isn't true.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.200 align:middle line:84%
>> The work that you do
having to do with souls--

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.890 align:middle line:84%
>> --an ability
to talk to them--

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.920 align:middle line:84%
>> --an ability to
recognize them--

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Uh huh.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.200 align:middle line:90%
>> --an ability to hear them--

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.283 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:40.283 --> 00:02:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> --when did you know
that you had this gift?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.730 align:middle line:90%
It's quite extraordinary.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> When I was 17, we had a very
unusual experience in my family

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.210 align:middle line:84%
where my brother saw
his guardian angel,

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:90%
but he appeared just as a man.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.820 align:middle line:90%
He was a white floating form.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.880 align:middle line:84%
And I'm not going to go
into that whole story, but--

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you should because
it's an interesting story.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.930 align:middle line:90%
Please go into it.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.860 align:middle line:84%
>> My brother went downstairs
to practice on his drum set.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.780 align:middle line:90%
He was 14 years old.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:90%
I was 17.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.540 align:middle line:84%
We were all around
the dinner table.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.130 align:middle line:90%
We had just finished dinner.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.227 align:middle line:84%
And he went downstairs
to practice on his drums.

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
And he was in the beginning
stages of playing his drums.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.800 align:middle line:84%
So he sounded pretty
rough, kind of clanky.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And so he was downstairs
clanking away.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.790 align:middle line:84%
And, all of a
sudden, from the den

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.120 align:middle line:84%
came this really, really
nice drumming music.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.968 align:middle line:84%
And we all looked at
my dad, and dad said--

00:03:28.968 --> 00:03:31.010 align:middle line:84%
>> As if he could answer
and explain what's that.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.590 align:middle line:90%
And dad said I don't know.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.660 align:middle line:84%
It must be the
record I bought him.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And so we all just sat there
listening to this music.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.290 align:middle line:90%
I bet you no one said a word.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.610 align:middle line:84%
It was just so
noticeably different

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.620 align:middle line:90%
than what we were used to.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And after about two
or three minutes,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.160 align:middle line:90%
my brother came upstairs.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:90%
He was hysterical.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.350 align:middle line:90%
He could hardly talk.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
And basically, what he kept
saying was did you hear it.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear it?

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.890 align:middle line:90%
Did you hear it?

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.240 align:middle line:90%
And we said, yeah, what was it?

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And he said a white thing
floated through the door,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.670 align:middle line:84%
floated over to me, put its
hands down on top of my hands,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.120 align:middle line:90%
and played that music.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.860 align:middle line:84%
And he said I tried
dropping my sticks.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:84%
I had my eyes closed, but
I could still see him.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.900 align:middle line:84%
He said-- and after
about two minutes,

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:84%
then it just backed
away from him

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.740 align:middle line:90%
and floated through the door.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.560 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
he came upstairs.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.450 align:middle line:90%
My mom-- and this was in 1965.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.418 align:middle line:84%
So nobody talked-- well, at
least we didn't in my family.

00:04:30.418 --> 00:04:32.460 align:middle line:84%
We grew up pretty mainstream
like everybody else.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, very few people
were talking about things

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.500 align:middle line:90%
we're talking about in 1965.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, and my mom was in
a prayer group at the time.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.417 align:middle line:84%
And one of the women
in her prayer group

00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
had mentioned that she
had been to a medium

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.440 align:middle line:84%
from England who was
living in St. Paul.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.040 align:middle line:84%
So mom called this
lady and said,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.873 align:middle line:84%
could you give me the
number of that medium?

00:04:48.873 --> 00:04:51.440 align:middle line:84%
We just had a weird thing
happen in our family.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.050 align:middle line:90%
Mom called the medium.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And she said this is May Bodine
and, and the medium said, yes,

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.350 align:middle line:84%
Mrs. Bodine, I've been
expecting your phone call.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.160 align:middle line:84%
Your son just met his guardian
angel, Dr. Fitzgerald.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:84%
And she said I need to
see you and your children

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.210 align:middle line:84%
for a psychic reading
because, she said,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:84%
you all have some
very unusual gifts.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.900 align:middle line:84%
And I need to tell
you about them.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.280 align:middle line:84%
And, about a week later, my mom
and I went to our first reading

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.240 align:middle line:90%
with this woman.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.657 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
she told me that I

00:05:21.657 --> 00:05:24.320 align:middle line:84%
was born with psychic abilities,
both with clairvoyance, which

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.670 align:middle line:84%
is the gift of
sight, clairaudience,

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:90%
which is the gift of hearing.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.530 align:middle line:84%
And she said I was born
with the gift of healing.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Did it scare you?

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh my god.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.870 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I said to her--
well, she said, excuse me,

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.263 align:middle line:84%
you've come into this lifetime
to develop your abilities,

00:05:42.263 --> 00:05:44.180 align:middle line:84%
and then you will turn
around and teach others

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.223 align:middle line:90%
how to develop theirs.

00:05:45.223 --> 00:05:46.640 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her
I don't have any

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.800 align:middle line:84%
of these weird
things I just want

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.217 align:middle line:90%
to have a nice, normal life.

00:05:50.217 --> 00:05:52.050 align:middle line:84%
I want to get married,
have a bunch of kids.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.815 align:middle line:90%
And she said--

00:05:53.815 --> 00:05:56.570 align:middle line:84%
I told her I wanted
to be a social worker.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Somebody has other
plans for you, Echo.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.293 align:middle line:84%
And she said you didn't
come in this lifetime

00:06:01.293 --> 00:06:02.210 align:middle line:90%
to have a normal life.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:84%
You can do that
in your next life.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.510 align:middle line:84%
She said you've come
into this lifetime

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.280 align:middle line:90%
to do some important things.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.220 align:middle line:84%
And she said your father is at
home with a migraine headache.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.400 align:middle line:90%
You go home and put your hands--

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.290 align:middle line:84%
actually, she said
take out some hankies,

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:90%
put them on your father's head.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And she said put your
hands on top of the hankies

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.150 align:middle line:84%
and then ask God to channel
healing through you.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.830 align:middle line:84%
And she said and you'll
see what I'm talking about.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.430 align:middle line:84%
She said there's two
things I need to tell you.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.380 align:middle line:90%
It's God that works through you.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And always use white
hankies under your hands.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you know at the time
that your father had a migraine.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.620 align:middle line:90%
Did you mention it?

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, what was so
amazing about that is that that

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:84%
day my dad had come home from
work with a migraine headache.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.950 align:middle line:84%
And, in my whole life
up until that day,

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
my dad had never had a
migraine headache before.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.230 align:middle line:90%
And my dad never got sick.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:51.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, interesting.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.294 align:middle line:84%
>> So isn't that interesting
he had had it that day?

00:06:53.294 --> 00:06:55.860 align:middle line:90%
So she went on.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.200 align:middle line:90%
She said I would write books.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.620 align:middle line:90%
I would be on TV.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.590 align:middle line:84%
I would be known
throughout the world.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.690 align:middle line:84%
And I was a very
shy 17-year-old.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm listening to this
woman thinking you're crazy,

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.490 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.550 align:middle line:90%
I don't have this stuff.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:08.930 align:middle line:90%
I don't want this stuff.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.770 align:middle line:90%
And she said that--

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.200 align:middle line:84%
she said you're so
sensitive, but you've learned

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:90%
to cope with your sensitivity.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
You've learned to cope with
your psychic abilities.

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.350 align:middle line:84%
She said you've had
them all of your life.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.870 align:middle line:84%
You've just never had
them labeled before.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:29.947 align:middle line:84%
And so, when I got
home that night,

00:07:29.947 --> 00:07:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I took out a couple of
hankies, and I asked my dad

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:32.930 align:middle line:90%
if I could try it.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And I put my hands
on top of his head.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.110 align:middle line:84%
And, after maybe five seconds,
they started to heat up,

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:90%
but it wasn't my body heat.

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.990 align:middle line:90%
It was very unusual.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.680 align:middle line:84%
It's like I could feel an
energy actually in my arms,

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.290 align:middle line:84%
and it was coming
out of my hands

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:51.110 align:middle line:90%
and just going into his head.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:55.310 align:middle line:84%
It lasted for about maybe
two or three minutes.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.200 align:middle line:84%
And then they cooled
off all by themselves.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.120 align:middle line:90%
And I took my hands off him.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.662 align:middle line:84%
And my dad said,
well, I'll be damned

00:07:59.662 --> 00:08:02.235 align:middle line:90%
if my headache isn't gone.

00:08:02.235 --> 00:08:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's kind of what
started the whole thing.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.540 align:middle line:84%
I ended up taking some
psychic development classes

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.790 align:middle line:84%
from a psychic here
in Minneapolis,

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:84%
a spiritualist minister,
and studied with her

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.840 align:middle line:84%
for a couple of years and
developed my abilities.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:90%
And you know what?

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:23.050 align:middle line:84%
The first time, Chantal,
that I saw a soul,

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.100 align:middle line:84%
I was doing a healing
on a young man.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.100 align:middle line:90%
He was in a coma.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.660 align:middle line:90%
He was in the hospital.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.180 align:middle line:90%
And I was in his room.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.610 align:middle line:84%
I was channeling
this healing to him.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:35.625 align:middle line:84%
And it was just he
and I in the room.

00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Now he was in a coma.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.300 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't talking.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:90%
His head was all bandaged.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.669 align:middle line:84%
And, from behind
me, I heard a voice

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:47.720 align:middle line:84%
saying would you please heal
the speech part of my brain.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So I just slowly
turned around to see

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.720 align:middle line:90%
who was standing behind me.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.110 align:middle line:90%
>> And you were--

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.443 align:middle line:90%
I want to get a picture of this.

00:08:52.443 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:84%
You were in the
hospital room, sitting.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:55.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Standing over his--

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Standing over--

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Standing over his bed.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>> And you heard the voice?

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Behind me.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.200 align:middle line:90%
And I thought OK.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Who's that?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Who is that?

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:90%
It's just he and I in here.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.370 align:middle line:90%
So I just slowly turned around.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.410 align:middle line:84%
And there, just standing
up against the wall,

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.650 align:middle line:84%
very matter of fact,
was a carbon copy

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.170 align:middle line:90%
of this kid lying in the bed.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Now how clear was this?

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.740 align:middle line:84%
>> As clear as a bell, as
clear as you are to me.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.563 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:20.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Except he had hair.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.540 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have
his head bandaged.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:27.027 align:middle line:84%
And he appeared in blue
jeans and a shirt, a t-shirt.

00:09:27.027 --> 00:09:27.860 align:middle line:90%
And I looked at him.

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.850 align:middle line:90%
And I said, who are you?

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.460 align:middle line:84%
And he said I'm the soul that
lives in that body just as

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.710 align:middle line:90%
matter of fact as you can get.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:34.670 align:middle line:90%
>> But you weren't afraid.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:35.240 align:middle line:90%
You weren't uncomfortable.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I was--

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.990 align:middle line:84%
yeah, I was like whoa,
am I making this up?

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:46.220 align:middle line:84%
I mean-- and I said, you're the
soul that lives in this body?

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:90%
And he said yeah.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, why
aren't you in your body?

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.900 align:middle line:84%
And he says, well,
when I leave my body,

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.580 align:middle line:90%
then it doesn't feel any pain.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.820 align:middle line:84%
So I like to stay out
as much as possible.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:84%
And then, again, he said I'd
really like to speak again.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.460 align:middle line:84%
So would you work on the
speech part of my brain?

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:06.200 align:middle line:90%
And I said sure.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.330 align:middle line:84%
I don't know where it
is, but I'll work on it.

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:11.000 align:middle line:90%
And he says OK.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.510 align:middle line:90%
And it was just amazing.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:15.930 align:middle line:90%
He went into his body.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:21.290 align:middle line:84%
I saw him go right--
just right into his body.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:24.620 align:middle line:84%
His arm lifted up
like this and then

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.870 align:middle line:84%
just dropped right
down on a certain part

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.023 align:middle line:90%
of his brain on his head.

00:10:29.023 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, when the nurse
came in, that was so funny.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:84%
The nurse came in,
and she said to me,

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.060 align:middle line:84%
why did you put
his hand up there?

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:90%
And I said I didn't.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.690 align:middle line:90%
And she says he's in a coma.

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:41.400 align:middle line:90%
He didn't do that himself.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.250 align:middle line:90%
And I said he did.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And I said to her, where's
the speech part of his brain?

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.340 align:middle line:84%
And she said right
where his hand is.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:84%
OK, so he actually went
back into his body,

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.220 align:middle line:90%
showed me where to work.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:59.160 align:middle line:10%
Then she left the room.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.320 align:middle line:10%
His soul came out of the body.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.120 align:middle line:10%
Again, I saw it.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:07.160 align:middle line:84%
It just comes right
out and left the room.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.850 align:middle line:84%
>> How often do souls
travel out of the body?

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.470 align:middle line:90%
And is there a particular time?

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:15.200 align:middle line:84%
Like, of course, I go to I
guess they travel at nighttime.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, they travel at night.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.562 align:middle line:84%
Usually, every
night they go out,

00:11:18.562 --> 00:11:21.020 align:middle line:84%
but there are times during the
day when they'll go out too.

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.312 align:middle line:84%
You know, when people-- when
you're talking to someone,

00:11:23.312 --> 00:11:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and they just look blank or
when somebody is daydreaming.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
Or, oh, like sometimes,
when we're driving,

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.130 align:middle line:90%
we're almost hypnotized.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.530 align:middle line:90%
The soul steps out frequently.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:38.217 align:middle line:84%
>> That would lead me to ask
you why does a soul travel.

00:11:38.217 --> 00:11:39.800 align:middle line:84%
What are their reasons
for leaving us?

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.530 align:middle line:90%
>> So many different reasons.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:45.530 align:middle line:84%
You could have a loved one in
another part of the country

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:46.790 align:middle line:90%
that you're concerned about.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And your soul will
go out from your body

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.890 align:middle line:84%
and just go and check on that
person to see if they're OK.

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you've got
somebody-- maybe

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.520 align:middle line:84%
you've got a relative that's
dying in a different part

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.380 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.190 align:middle line:84%
And you're not sure,
oh, should I go?

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.430 align:middle line:90%
Should I stay here?

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:00.230 align:middle line:90%
How close are they?

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.230 align:middle line:84%
And your soul might go out
of your body frequently

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.830 align:middle line:84%
throughout the day
just to check in.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.630 align:middle line:90%
Are they OK?

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Oh, wow, they're
not doing so good.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.815 align:middle line:90%
I better get to the hospital.

00:12:08.815 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:84%
And then, all of
a sudden, you'll

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:12.065 align:middle line:84%
just kind of come out
of this little daydream

00:12:12.065 --> 00:12:14.320 align:middle line:84%
and go, you know, I just
have a feeling I should--

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.120 align:middle line:90%
Oh,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:17.150 align:middle line:84%
>> --I should get
to the hospital.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:18.233 align:middle line:90%
>> I should call somebody.

00:12:18.233 --> 00:12:19.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly, yeah.

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.470 align:middle line:84%
So our soul goes
out quite a bit.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.926 align:middle line:84%
Although, you know, we're
not conscious of it.

00:12:25.926 --> 00:12:28.346 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:32.220 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Not too long ago, I was in
my local grocery store in Los

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.840 align:middle line:90%
Angeles.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.010 align:middle line:10%
And I was standing in line, and
a woman came in with a baby.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:45.660 align:middle line:10%
It was the most adorable child,
like 9 months, 10-- you know,

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:48.810 align:middle line:10%
they're not quite talking
and just wide-eyed.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And, as people are wont to
do, I looked at the baby.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.840 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
aren't you cute.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was so struck
by this child's eyes.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.560 align:middle line:90%


00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.430 align:middle line:90%
This child actually looked wise.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.980 align:middle line:84%
Was I looking at a baby
who was an old soul?

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, you were.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.616 align:middle line:90%
>> It was startling to me.

00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:12.416 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:14.220 align:middle line:90%
They can be really startling.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.050 align:middle line:84%
You can see the
wisdom in their eyes.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:16.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.610 align:middle line:10%
>> That's the eyes of their soul
that are looking back at you

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:10%
because believe me, I've
seen babies that, you know,

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.262 align:middle line:10%
when their soul has stepped
out for a little bit,

00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:26.885 align:middle line:10%
they're just like
this little blob.

00:13:26.885 --> 00:13:28.340 align:middle line:10%
And they just kind of sit there.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:10%
And then the soul goes in.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.150 align:middle line:10%
And, whoa, there's
all the wisdom.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.950 align:middle line:90%
And you can just--

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.158 align:middle line:90%
you can see it in their eyes.

00:13:34.158 --> 00:13:36.600 align:middle line:90%
You can sense it in their being.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.990 align:middle line:84%
So I would say you definitely
ran into a very old soul.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:46.490 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about an experience
in your book that is out

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:48.390 align:middle line:90%
of body.

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:49.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.898 align:middle line:84%
>> What was that
experience like for you?

00:13:50.898 --> 00:13:54.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, it was an amazing--

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.180 align:middle line:84%
oh boy, it was an
amazing experience.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:02.390 align:middle line:84%
And the word amazing
doesn't even come close.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.620 align:middle line:84%
What happened was that
my brother Michael who

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.170 align:middle line:90%
also has psychic abilities--

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:12.410 align:middle line:84%
he and I have been a
brother-sister ghost-busting

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
team for a long time
because we both see souls,

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.285 align:middle line:90%
and we communicate with them.

00:14:16.285 --> 00:14:17.660 align:middle line:84%
So we've gone into
a lot of homes

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
and cleared them
of unwanted ghosts.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And we had been on
a ghost-busting job

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:23.840 align:middle line:90%
on a Saturday night.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:26.120 align:middle line:84%
And, the next morning,
I was out in my garden.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:90%
It was Palm Sunday.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:30.140 align:middle line:90%
And this was back in 1993.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.450 align:middle line:90%
I was in my garden.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.530 align:middle line:84%
And I was just talking
to God, just talking,

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.340 align:middle line:90%
just having a conversation.

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.930 align:middle line:84%
And I said, you know,
God, I would really

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.510 align:middle line:84%
like to have more information
about the other side

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:84%
because we send all
these ghosts over there.

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:46.130 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they ask us
what it's like there.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.170 align:middle line:84%
And I said I've had little
bits and pieces when

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:49.940 align:middle line:84%
I'm done a reading
for someone, but I

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.880 align:middle line:84%
said I'd like to have a
whole bunch of information.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:90%
And I said, is that possible?

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And I said I'm not going
to bug you about this.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:01.460 align:middle line:84%
This is-- I'll just ask this one
time, and then I'll let it go.

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:05.660 align:middle line:84%
But I said, if I need to
do more to prepare myself

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.480 align:middle line:84%
to have this knowledge,
then please help me

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.730 align:middle line:90%
do whatever I need to do.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Chantal, never in my
imagination, never in my mind,

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:84%
never anywhere did I think
that I would actually

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.280 align:middle line:84%
have an astral projection
experience where I would

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.930 align:middle line:90%
get to go to the other side.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:21.950 align:middle line:90%
>> You went to heaven?

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:22.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:26.810 align:middle line:90%
And I thought that--

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought that, when I
said that prayer that day,

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.850 align:middle line:84%
what I mainly was
asking was could

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:34.100 align:middle line:84%
I just receive
psychic information

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.450 align:middle line:90%
about the other side.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, three days later,
I had this experience.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.320 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to go
into the whole thing

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:46.100 align:middle line:84%
because it's quite
involved, but bottom line

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:50.060 align:middle line:84%
is I didn't really understand
at first what was going on.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:56.463 align:middle line:84%
I kept seeing this blond
spirit in front of me.

00:15:56.463 --> 00:15:58.130 align:middle line:84%
I just kept seeing
the back of her head,

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.970 align:middle line:90%
and she kept saying come on.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.770 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:00.980 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.680 align:middle line:84%
And I'd think, who is
this in front of me?

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.880 align:middle line:90%
And go where?

00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:08.300 align:middle line:84%
And I'd just feel my
body kind of collapse.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.450 align:middle line:90%


00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.075 align:middle line:90%
And then a voice said--

00:16:14.075 --> 00:16:15.200 align:middle line:90%
a friend of mine was there.

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.075 align:middle line:84%
He said have Neil call
your brother right now

00:16:17.075 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:90%
and get him over here.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And so Neil called my brother.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.020 align:middle line:84%
And I just was sitting
on the couch like this.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:90%
And my eyes were closed.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.790 align:middle line:84%
And I could just see this
spirit right in front of me.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.510 align:middle line:84%
And my brother
walked in the door,

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.070 align:middle line:90%
and that freaked me out too.

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:90%
He walked in the door.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.840 align:middle line:84%
I hadn't said anything to
anyone about that prayer.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.173 align:middle line:84%
And my brother comes in, and
he looks at my friend Neil.

00:16:40.173 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:10%
He said, three days
ago, she asked God

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.420 align:middle line:10%
if she could have information
about the other side,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.010 align:middle line:10%
and they're going to
let her go over there.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:48.470 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to sit and hold
her hand and ground her body.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:50.012 align:middle line:84%
He said, Neil, don't
worry about her.

00:16:50.012 --> 00:16:51.452 align:middle line:90%
She's fine.

00:16:51.452 --> 00:16:52.410 align:middle line:90%
And I looked up at him.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:middle line:84%
And I said, how do
you know all this?

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:56.570 align:middle line:84%
And he said, what do
you mean how do I know?

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:58.340 align:middle line:90%
They told me on the way over.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.320 align:middle line:84%
He said so, sis,
you go ahead and go.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:03.500 align:middle line:84%
And I'll hold-- and
I'll ground your body.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And that fast, I realized--

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:84%
I mean, my whole body
just slumped down.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.550 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that that blonde
spirit in front of me was

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.730 align:middle line:84%
actually my own soul because she
turned around and looked right

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:18.800 align:middle line:90%
at me-- oh, it was weird--

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:22.339 align:middle line:84%
>> --looked right at me,
had these big brown eyes,

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:24.079 align:middle line:90%
and said come on.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:25.280 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.080 align:middle line:84%
Just like that, and we
went through the tunnel,

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.790 align:middle line:90%
went into the white light.

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.760 align:middle line:84%
My grandma was standing on the
other side of the white light.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.770 align:middle line:84%
And I hadn't seen her since
she passed away when I was 14.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.030 align:middle line:90%
She looked great.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:43.220 align:middle line:84%
She introduced me to
a girlfriend of hers.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.385 align:middle line:90%
And her girlfriend said--

00:17:45.385 --> 00:17:46.760 align:middle line:84%
she looked at my
grandma, and she

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:84%
said you didn't tell
me she was dying today.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And grandma said, well,
she's not dying dear.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:53.390 align:middle line:90%
She's just visiting.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And right then-- and
another angel came up to me,

00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:90%
and she said I'm your guide.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:00.947 align:middle line:90%
We don't have much time.

00:18:00.947 --> 00:18:02.030 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot to show you.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.460 align:middle line:90%
Let's go.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:06.140 align:middle line:84%
It just started, and she
just took me literally

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.220 align:middle line:84%
on a 35-minute tour
of the other side.

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.020 align:middle line:90%
And I just sat--

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And is it light?

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.900 align:middle line:90%
Is it dark?

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.700 align:middle line:90%
Is it--

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, no.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.700 align:middle line:90%
It was beautiful.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.340 align:middle line:84%
You know, it continually,
everywhere I went over there--

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:84%
and I went to a lot of
different communities.

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere I went, it
reminded me of the TV

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.180 align:middle line:84%
show the "Lifestyles of
the Rich and Famous."

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:27.360 align:middle line:90%
It was just gorgeous.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.270 align:middle line:84%
I mean there's ponds and
little brooks and rivers

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and just the most incredible
green grass you've ever seen.

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.350 align:middle line:90%
And the flowers are all so--

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.210 align:middle line:84%
everything is so
crisp and alive.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:44.050 align:middle line:90%
And everything was so fresh.

00:18:44.050 --> 00:18:47.000 align:middle line:84%
And there were all
kinds of souls.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.580 align:middle line:90%
I mean people everywhere.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was just
like being on Earth

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:55.180 align:middle line:84%
except without the stress,
without the pollution,

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.180 align:middle line:84%
without the garbage,
without the hassles.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.250 align:middle line:84%
It was-- I mean people
have homes there.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.660 align:middle line:90%
It's a whole life.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:06.150 align:middle line:84%
It's a whole other dimension
of what's going on here,

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:07.150 align:middle line:90%
but it's going on there.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's on a much
higher vibration.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:90%
>> So, in essence--

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>> It was amazing.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:84%
>> --you asked for insight,
and got an e-ticket.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:17.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, did I ever.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And then I had to
come back to my body

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.080 align:middle line:84%
because my body was
having a really tough time

00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:25.690 align:middle line:84%
without the energy of the
soul because the soul is

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:27.790 align:middle line:90%
like the battery for the body.

00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm interested in how your
body felt when you woke up,

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.030 align:middle line:84%
sitting on the chair,
holding your brother's hand.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>> It was terrible.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:39.220 align:middle line:84%
It was-- it took me
almost 20 minutes I think

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:40.720 align:middle line:90%
before I could move my mouth.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.030 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't--
everything, my mouth,

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.560 align:middle line:90%
my tongue was very thick.

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't move my legs,
and I couldn't open my eyes.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.830 align:middle line:90%
And my arms were really heavy.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, oh my god, I have
had a stroke while I was out.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.610 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.670 align:middle line:84%
And, my brother, he
was cool, though.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:20:01.852 align:middle line:10%
He could-- I couldn't talk,
but he could hear my thoughts.

00:20:01.852 --> 00:20:03.310 align:middle line:84%
And he kept saying,
sis, you're OK.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.110 align:middle line:90%
You're OK.

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:05.570 align:middle line:90%
You just need more time.

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And he was holding
my hand really tight.

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.085 align:middle line:90%
And I could feel--

00:20:09.085 --> 00:20:13.240 align:middle line:84%
it was like he was giving me an
energy, or I don't know what.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:17.380 align:middle line:84%
I can't describe that,
but I was so grateful

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.730 align:middle line:84%
that he was just
sitting there with me.

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And then, after a
while, I finally

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:23.628 align:middle line:90%
was able to get my eyes open.

00:20:23.628 --> 00:20:24.670 align:middle line:90%
And I just looked at him.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And I said, did
that really happen?

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.340 align:middle line:84%
And he said, yeah, you really
went to the other side.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And it took me I bet
you at least an hour

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.720 align:middle line:84%
just to, ah, there,
I'm back to normal now.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.890 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You've spoken to souls
of people who are ill

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:42.980 align:middle line:90%
or in a coma.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.770 align:middle line:84%
>> What about someone
like me sitting here?

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:48.922 align:middle line:90%
Could my soul speak to you?

00:20:48.922 --> 00:20:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Could my spirit
guide speak to you?

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.525 align:middle line:90%
>> If she wanted to.

00:20:51.525 --> 00:20:52.900 align:middle line:84%
That's what's so
interesting too.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.525 align:middle line:84%
People will come for
a psychic reading,

00:20:54.525 --> 00:20:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say I want you
to communicate with my soul.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.950 align:middle line:84%
But it's like saying I'd
like to win the lottery.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.110 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It depends on if the
soul wants to talk to you.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh yeah, and, lots of times,
souls don't want to talk.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.110 align:middle line:84%
They're like, hey, this
is her thing, you know?

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.420 align:middle line:90%
This isn't my thing.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
And yet, other times, I'll
have a client sitting across

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.840 align:middle line:90%
from me.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.008 align:middle line:84%
And my guides are
here, and they're

00:21:18.008 --> 00:21:19.300 align:middle line:90%
talking to the client's guides.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.883 align:middle line:84%
And, all the sudden,
the client's soul

00:21:20.883 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:84%
will just pop right out
and sit right next to them.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Nick Bunick, who wrote the
introduction to your book,

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:32.210 align:middle line:84%
can actually see spirit
guides of other people.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:36.760 align:middle line:84%
He can sit in a room and see
spirit guides standing there.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.310 align:middle line:84%
Do you have that
ability as well?

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I do because
they're just souls.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.960 align:middle line:84%
You know, again, ghosts
are simply souls.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.610 align:middle line:90%
Spirit guides are souls.

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:46.990 align:middle line:90%
We are souls.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, that's interesting.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.205 align:middle line:84%
I thought there was a
difference between a ghost, who

00:21:51.205 --> 00:21:54.802 align:middle line:84%
you had to go into a house
and clear, and a soul.

00:21:54.802 --> 00:21:55.760 align:middle line:90%
They're the same thing?

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:00.595 align:middle line:84%
>> They're just a trapped soul,
a stuck soul, earthbound soul.

00:22:00.595 --> 00:22:02.720 align:middle line:84%
See, and I didn't know that
either for a long time.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.520 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why I thought that.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what I
thought, but I just thought,

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.720 align:middle line:90%
OK, a ghost is a spirit.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And then there's souls.

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:12.222 align:middle line:84%
And then, just in communicating
with all these ghosts,

00:22:12.222 --> 00:22:13.930 align:middle line:84%
it's like the light
bulb went on one day.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:14.830 align:middle line:90%
And I went wait a minute.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:90%
You guys are souls too.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:16.930 align:middle line:90%
We're just all souls.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.340 align:middle line:90%
You guys are just stuck here.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:21.452 align:middle line:84%
And I realized that
we all have a choice.

00:22:21.452 --> 00:22:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And we can either stay
Earth-bound when we die,

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:25.390 align:middle line:84%
or we can go on
to the other side.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.510 align:middle line:10%
>> It's sort of comforting to
know there are a lot of souls

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.880 align:middle line:10%
time traveling around
us, isn't there?

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.848 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and people
can see their guides.

00:22:32.848 --> 00:22:34.640 align:middle line:84%
You know, people always
want to know, well,

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.223 align:middle line:84%
how can I get in
touch with my guides.

00:22:36.223 --> 00:22:37.540 align:middle line:90%
Can I see my guides?

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:10%
The thing that they have
to remember the most

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.182 align:middle line:10%
is it takes a lot of
patience because I

00:22:42.182 --> 00:22:44.140 align:middle line:10%
started taking psychic
development classes when

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:44.940 align:middle line:10%
I was 17.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.140 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't see my first
spirit guide I bet you

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:52.120 align:middle line:90%
until I was 25, maybe 26.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.530 align:middle line:84%
It takes time because it's very,
very, very light, very soft,

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:57.680 align:middle line:90%
gentle vibration.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:59.380 align:middle line:90%
So it takes time.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.422 align:middle line:90%
Well, I'll look for mine.

00:23:00.422 --> 00:23:01.222 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, great.

00:23:01.222 --> 00:23:02.170 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll look for mine.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:05.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, the other thing you
can do too is tell them I want

00:23:05.046 --> 00:23:06.106 align:middle line:90%
to know your name.

00:23:06.106 --> 00:23:08.640 align:middle line:84%
I want to be more
conscious of you.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:90%
Help me with this.

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:84%
And some names will
pop into your head

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.110 align:middle line:90%
over a day or two period.

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:15.090 align:middle line:84%
And you'll start
to sense them more.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:16.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Great advice.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you so much, Echo.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:18.090 align:middle line:90%
You're welcome.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.720 align:middle line:84%
>> What a wonderful
conversation.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:20.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:20.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:21.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.110 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.860 align:middle line:90%
