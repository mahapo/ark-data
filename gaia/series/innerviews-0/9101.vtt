00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.520 align:middle line:10%
>>CHANTAL WESTERMAN: It's such
a pleasure to talk to you,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.730 align:middle line:10%
and I've been looking forward to
it and I want to tell you why.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.540 align:middle line:10%
All your books and
all your lectures,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.040 align:middle line:10%
despite the dark times
that so many people

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.660 align:middle line:10%
say we live in now are
just headed for chaos,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.070 align:middle line:10%
you are so positive.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.042 align:middle line:84%
You have such an optimistic
view of the world.

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:50.000 align:middle line:90%
Where do you find that?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.060 align:middle line:84%
>>GREGG BRADEN: I'm asked
that question many times.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.500 align:middle line:10%
For me personally,
my sense is that this

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.950 align:middle line:10%
is this rare precious
moment in human history.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.320 align:middle line:10%
According to ancient texts,
it's unlike any moment

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.160 align:middle line:10%
that we've known in
our recorded past.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.710 align:middle line:84%
And I think much of
my optimism comes

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.970 align:middle line:84%
from the understanding of what
those who have come before us

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.090 align:middle line:84%
truly had to say about
this time in history.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Almost universally ancient
texts and traditions

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.362 align:middle line:84%
as diverse as they appear
and as old as they are,

00:01:22.362 --> 00:01:25.240 align:middle line:84%
they all converge-- they're all
pointing this time in history.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.990 align:middle line:84%
They say something big
is about to happen.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.790 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: That's true whether
it's Hindu or Sufi or Buddhism,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.060 align:middle line:90%
it's so fascinating.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.130 align:middle line:84%
They all lead in
the right direction.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.260 align:middle line:90%
What are those old texts?

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.190 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Precisely.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.930 align:middle line:90%
I'll be very specific.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.540 align:middle line:10%
The ancient Essenes, the
authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.600 align:middle line:10%
perhaps have some of
the clearest insights

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.460 align:middle line:10%
into this time in history.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.780 align:middle line:10%
And through their
traditions such as we

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.690 align:middle line:10%
find in the Dead Sea Scrolls
and Nag Hammadi Library

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.380 align:middle line:10%
and the Aramaic translations
coming from the Middle

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.340 align:middle line:10%
East, what we find
is that is diverse

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.990 align:middle line:10%
as our belief systems
appear to be today,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.170 align:middle line:10%
there is a time where
they all converge.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.495 align:middle line:84%
They appear to stem from
a common understanding.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:84%
It goes back
approximately 4,000 years

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.256 align:middle line:90%
before Christ, 6,000 years ago.

00:02:13.256 --> 00:02:14.056 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: Amazing.

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:17.050 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And this
tradition is actually--

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.490 align:middle line:84%
this lineage of wisdom
is actually traced back

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.105 align:middle line:90%
in the Sumerian texts.

00:02:21.105 --> 00:02:21.980 align:middle line:90%
That's how old it is.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.760 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: Have we seen it?

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.310 align:middle line:90%
Have we seen this text?

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.540 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: We have.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.460 align:middle line:10%
We've seen elements
of these texts,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:10%
and for me, this provides
a tremendous continuity

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.210 align:middle line:10%
between the people of that
time, what we're living now,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.950 align:middle line:10%
because they looked from their
world ahead into our world

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.950 align:middle line:10%
and offered us insights
into what we may expect

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.770 align:middle line:10%
at this time in history
and what I believe

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.170 align:middle line:10%
is an inner technology forgotten
science of inner wisdom

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.570 align:middle line:10%
that allows us to
gracefully transcend

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.910 align:middle line:10%
even the greatest challenges
at this time in history man

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.840 align:middle line:10%
may offer.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:54.995 align:middle line:90%
That's my optimism.

00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: It's wonderful
optimism because one

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.500 align:middle line:84%
of the things you say, which
I love to hear you talk more

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.500 align:middle line:84%
about, when you
talk about science,

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.740 align:middle line:84%
I think of-- what comes to my
mind and most people's minds I

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.930 align:middle line:84%
think are numbers and
books and classes and--

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.390 align:middle line:84%
compassion, you say,
is its own science.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.370 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: In our
world today, science

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.810 align:middle line:84%
is hypothesis and prediction
and testing time after time

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.610 align:middle line:90%
after time.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And if this is so each time,
then we say it is a science.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.200 align:middle line:10%
Without mathematics,
I believe we

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.150 align:middle line:10%
can do the same thing with
very ancient technologies

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.920 align:middle line:10%
such as prayer, such as
compassion, such as the lost

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:10%
wisdom of healing through
thought, feeling, and emotion.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.880 align:middle line:90%
No mathematics is required.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.925 align:middle line:84%
What we can say is
that as we become--

00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
difference between what

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
we do in the West today and
what the ancients were viewing--

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:84%
their view of the world was
that we become the elements

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.458 align:middle line:84%
that we most choose to
experience in our lives.

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:02.000 align:middle line:84%
In the West, we're
conditioned to do.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.080 align:middle line:90%
Just tell me what to do.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.030 align:middle line:90%
Do this, do that.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.770 align:middle line:84%
So as we become the quality of
thought, feeling, and emotion

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.090 align:middle line:84%
and that comprises
compassion, then we

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.640 align:middle line:84%
can say if this is true,
then this is the outcome

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.980 align:middle line:90%
and that is the science.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.350 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: For just a second,
I didn't understand you.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.370 align:middle line:84%
But what you're talking about
is if we do these things

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.887 align:middle line:84%
and then there is proof as a
result of the actions we take--

00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:29.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Certainly.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.140 align:middle line:84%
Let me share with
you an example.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:10%
One of the technologies that
was lost 1,700 years ago

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.987 align:middle line:10%
is a mode of prayer.

00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle line:84%
It's very, very
different from the way

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.890 align:middle line:90%
that we look at prayer today.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.890 align:middle line:84%
This mode of prayer has
no outward expression.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:90%
There are no words.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.040 align:middle line:90%
It's something that we become.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.570 align:middle line:84%
It's based on the
technology of feeling--

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.540 align:middle line:84%
and I'll just say
it very briefly--

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
feeling that the
prayer has already

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:84%
been answered rather than asking
that the prayer come to pass

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:57.765 align:middle line:84%
or rather than asking
for intervention.

00:04:57.765 --> 00:04:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: So then it's
a prayer of gratitude

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.822 align:middle line:90%
rather than supplication?

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:03.500 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And-- yes--
and it is a prayer based

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.120 align:middle line:90%
on feeling rather than thought.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
So rather than saying
dear God please let there

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.575 align:middle line:90%
be peace in our world--

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: Or thank you
for the peace in the world.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.740 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Well, using
this lost mode of prayer,

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.990 align:middle line:84%
we would have the
emotion and the feeling

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.340 align:middle line:84%
that the peace is already
there as well as the thought.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.215 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: Oh, I see.

00:05:18.215 --> 00:05:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Now having said that,
what the ancients said, what

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.090 align:middle line:84%
quantum science
now validates, is

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
that in every
moment of our lives,

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
we live many, many, many
simultaneous moments

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.430 align:middle line:90%
that we are not aware of.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:84%
This was first postulated
1957 by a gentleman

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.980 align:middle line:84%
named Hugh Everett the Third
at Princeton University.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.217 align:middle line:84%
He called them
parallel possibilities.

00:05:40.217 --> 00:05:42.300 align:middle line:84%
And to many people, it
sounds like science fiction

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.150 align:middle line:84%
and very irrelevant
in our world.

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.690 align:middle line:84%
What quantum science now
believes is that many times

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.400 align:middle line:84%
each day, we move
personally, individually,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.640 align:middle line:84%
and collectively in and out of
many, many possible outcomes

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.100 align:middle line:84%
for the events that we
experience in our lives.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.350 align:middle line:84%
We do it individually
in the way we

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:84%
respond to the
challenges of life,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and our individual responses
become the collective response.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:84%
What that means--
if this is true,

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.160 align:middle line:84%
it means that for
every disaster--

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.000 align:middle line:84%
catastrophic destruction is
being predicted right now.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.205 align:middle line:84%
There are very well
respected researchers

00:06:23.205 --> 00:06:26.760 align:middle line:84%
that are predicting a loss of
2/3 of the world's population

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.520 align:middle line:84%
within the next three years to
famine, disease, and weather

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.710 align:middle line:90%
patterns and warfare.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.020 align:middle line:84%
For every prediction
like that, it

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.690 align:middle line:84%
means that there is
another possibility--

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.850 align:middle line:84%
and the ancients are
very clear about this--

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:41.880 align:middle line:84%
where we've outgrown
the word war

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.350 align:middle line:84%
in our vocabulary
and the weather

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.917 align:middle line:84%
patterns are so gentle that
every mouth of every woman

00:06:46.917 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
and child and man is fed every
day because the crops grow that

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.430 align:middle line:90%
well.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.730 align:middle line:84%
Where our technology
serves us rather

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.830 align:middle line:84%
than taking our power away from
us-- and the question has been,

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.570 align:middle line:84%
how do we move back and forth
between those possibilities.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:04.140 align:middle line:84%
How do we bring a
possibility into focus

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:06.900 align:middle line:84%
where Y2K does not
disable our society?

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.440 align:middle line:84%
Where warfare does not take
that toll in human life?

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
Or weather patterns don't
wreak havoc upon our world?

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.540 align:middle line:10%
>>CHANTAL: I just
need an example

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.138 align:middle line:10%
of a parallel possibility.

00:07:17.138 --> 00:07:18.180 align:middle line:10%
What would be an example?

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.460 align:middle line:10%
Something where I
would be in a situation

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.530 align:middle line:10%
and I'd say I can do
this or this-- do this

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:10%
and then I do this one?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: When we
are experiencing

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:84%
the unfolding of an event,
I'm going to give you a case

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:90%
history here in just a moment.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:38.660 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that the outcome
for that event is inevitable.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.750 align:middle line:90%
It's already unfolding.

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.580 align:middle line:84%
The momentum is
already there, and all

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:44.670 align:middle line:84%
of a sudden for some unexplained
reason that event changes.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:46.980 align:middle line:84%
That is an example of
what we call moving

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.600 align:middle line:90%
into a parallel possibility.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.800 align:middle line:84%
November 13, 1998, the
world woke up that morning

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:84%
to newspaper headlines that
said it was inevitable.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:10%
It was a matter of time
only before US forces would

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.300 align:middle line:10%
lead an airborne strike
into Iraq in response

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.500 align:middle line:10%
to the breakdown of the
weapons inspections,

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.980 align:middle line:10%
Richard Butler and the whole
thing was happening there.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.980 align:middle line:10%
What history will
show is that there's

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.190 align:middle line:10%
a mystery that
unfolded that night,

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.510 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to share
this mystery as an example

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:10%
to explain how this works.

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:84%
Because that night President
Clinton did in fact order

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:22.250 align:middle line:90%
US war planes into Iraq.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Thirty minutes into
the mission, he

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:29.670 align:middle line:84%
announced an unprecedented order
for those planes to stand down,

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.419 align:middle line:84%
which is the military term for
make a U-turn and come home,

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:37.799 align:middle line:84%
and that night no
ordinance was dropped.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.490 align:middle line:84%
There were no bombs
dropped anywhere.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.020 align:middle line:90%
No lives were lost to US forces.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.410 align:middle line:84%
And historians are mystified as
to precisely why that happened.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.710 align:middle line:84%
What history may not show
is that on that same night

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.000 align:middle line:84%
during the same hours, a
mass prayer vigil coordinated

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.290 align:middle line:84%
on the worldwide web
involving at least 75 nations

00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and several hundred
thousand people

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.320 align:middle line:84%
were using this mode of prayer
that was lost 1,700 years ago.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.420 align:middle line:84%
And skeptics say
it's a coincidence

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.000 align:middle line:84%
that it was during that time
frame those war planes came

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.165 align:middle line:90%
home on the one hand.

00:09:11.165 --> 00:09:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And as a scientist, I would
tend to agree with them

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:17.573 align:middle line:84%
except that the
correlations are so high

00:09:17.573 --> 00:09:19.740 align:middle line:84%
and we've seen this so many
times-- the Israelis did

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.190 align:middle line:84%
studies with us back in the
1980s during the Lebanese war.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:29.130 align:middle line:84%
It's been very well documented
that when masses of humans have

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.400 align:middle line:84%
a common feeling-- this is
very different than thought--

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.190 align:middle line:84%
these people weren't praying
saying let the war stop,

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.400 align:middle line:84%
don't let people die, please
don't send the planes to Iraq.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:84%
They simply had a feeling of
peace that's already here.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.380 align:middle line:84%
And in the presence
of that peace,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.800 align:middle line:84%
I believe all that can go
forward that night was peace

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.870 align:middle line:84%
and no lives were
lost US warplanes.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:58.028 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.028 --> 00:10:00.570 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: Let me get back
to the power of prayer

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
for a moment because I'm
always interested in the power

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.710 align:middle line:90%
of prayer.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.370 align:middle line:10%
Mary Baker Eddy, who taught us
a great deal about the Christian

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.580 align:middle line:10%
Science faith, has
said that matter

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.190 align:middle line:10%
doesn't matter so that in
other words, it doesn't exist.

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.610 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't have an
intelligence of its own

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.810 align:middle line:10%
so that it can be influenced
by prayer, by thought.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:22.950 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:25.860 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: We're often told
that we create our reality.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: True.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.655 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And that our
thoughts, feelings,

00:10:28.655 --> 00:10:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and emotions are having an
impact on the world around us.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:36.410 align:middle line:10%
If what the ancients
say is correct

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.670 align:middle line:10%
and what quantum
science is now saying,

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:43.050 align:middle line:10%
we were close and not quite
accurate because what they say

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.222 align:middle line:10%
is that we don't
create anything.

00:10:45.222 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
They say we don't
create a reality.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.110 align:middle line:84%
All the realities
are already created

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.820 align:middle line:84%
and already playing
out at the same time.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:84%
And what we do is we very
skillfully and masterfully

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:84%
bring certain possibilities
in the focus, and we say,

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:90%
oh, this is my world.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And when we do that,
we release the one

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.350 align:middle line:84%
that we lived up
until that moment.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.020 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use illness
as an example of this.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Because this is recorded
on video very clearly,

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.600 align:middle line:84%
we have a video from a
medicineless hospital

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:17.575 align:middle line:84%
in Beijing, China, of a
woman with a bladder cancer.

00:11:17.575 --> 00:11:19.770 align:middle line:84%
So there's a more
inside of her bladder.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:22.320 align:middle line:84%
And through the magic of
ultrasound, the technology

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.910 align:middle line:84%
of ultrasound, we
can actually peer

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:29.080 align:middle line:84%
into her body in the
presence of a mode of prayer

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.330 align:middle line:90%
thought, feeling, and emotion.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.485 align:middle line:10%
What happens is
the practitioners

00:11:32.485 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:10%
working with her--
and they are trained

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:40.230 align:middle line:10%
in Qigong, which includes
thought, feeling, and emotion.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.750 align:middle line:10%
In the presence
of practitioners,

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:10%
what we see in less than
three minutes is that tumor

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:10%
disappears from her bladder
before our very eyes in real

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:52.970 align:middle line:10%
time programming--
it's not lapse--

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.200 align:middle line:10%
in very real time.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.240 align:middle line:84%
According to the
old traditions, we

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
would say our
thoughts, feelings,

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.450 align:middle line:90%
and emotions made that go away.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:01.500 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: Did they?

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Western
science has no--

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:84%
can't account for
what they're seeing.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.670 align:middle line:84%
Quantum science and
the ancient traditions

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.450 align:middle line:90%
say we didn't make that go away.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:13.290 align:middle line:84%
We didn't impose our
will upon that cancer.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.110 align:middle line:84%
What we did-- what
those practitioners did

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:84%
is they had a thought, feeling,
and an emotion of prayer that

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:23.280 align:middle line:90%
said this bladder has no cancer.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.370 align:middle line:90%
This bladder is healthy.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:24.960 align:middle line:90%
It's vital.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.760 align:middle line:90%
It's whole.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.100 align:middle line:90%
It's complete.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.420 align:middle line:84%
And in the presence of
that very, very clear mode

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.980 align:middle line:84%
of prayer, what they
did was they attracted

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.690 align:middle line:84%
the outcome of a healthy
bladder and that overlaid

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.460 align:middle line:84%
the possibility--
they didn't judge it

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.710 align:middle line:90%
as right, wrong, good, or bad.

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.120 align:middle line:84%
They didn't say bad
cancer, go away, and try

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.070 align:middle line:90%
to kill it or cut it out.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:84%
They allowed for
its possibility,

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.540 align:middle line:84%
and they said through
their feeling--

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.220 align:middle line:84%
they had the feeling
of what it feels

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:84%
like to be in the presence of
a woman with a healthy bladder.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And in that feeling
we see this real time.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.200 align:middle line:84%
We see it begin to quiver,
fade, and disappear.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden in three
minutes, two minutes and 40

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.810 align:middle line:84%
seconds, that bladder
is free of the cancer.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And that is the power of that
prayer for an individual.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.180 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: So is there a
difference between that

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:18.980 align:middle line:84%
and what Mary Baker Eddy and
the Christian Science faith

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:19.780 align:middle line:90%
believes?

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.295 align:middle line:90%
It does.

00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:22.472 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I believe that
it's probably very similar.

00:13:22.472 --> 00:13:23.430 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: Interesting.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.020 align:middle line:10%
>>BRADEN: And not
having spoken with Mary

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.520 align:middle line:10%
and not being a
Christian Scientist,

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:29.970 align:middle line:10%
I'm reluctant to
say specifically.

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.920 align:middle line:10%
What I would say is they may
be using a principle that they

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.470 align:middle line:10%
have not fully understood or
developed and that still works.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:39.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's the beauty of
this ancient technology

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
is we don't have
to be scientists.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:47.490 align:middle line:84%
As we choose to honor
life in all forms,

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.430 align:middle line:84%
in all worlds, the thought,
feeling, and emotion that

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.100 align:middle line:84%
comes from that,
those practitioners

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.988 align:middle line:90%
didn't hate the cancer.

00:13:54.988 --> 00:13:57.030 align:middle line:84%
They weren't angry, and
they weren't in judgment.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.590 align:middle line:84%
They allowed for
its possibility,

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:03.690 align:middle line:84%
and they had the feeling as if
that cancer had never existed.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And this is clearly what the
ancients have [? invited us. ?]

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.450 align:middle line:84%
If we want peace in our
world, have the feeling

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:13.020 align:middle line:84%
of peace in our hearts, and our
world mirrors that back to us.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.300 align:middle line:84%
In that way, we attract
the outcome of that peace.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: Now I
live in Los Angeles,

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.020 align:middle line:84%
and I can remember
a couple of years

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.190 align:middle line:84%
ago when that El Nina I
think they called it--

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:24.180 align:middle line:90%
the rainstorm swept across.

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:27.120 align:middle line:84%
And we in California
thought it'll never hit us.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.320 align:middle line:84%
It devastated California--
crops and roads

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.440 align:middle line:84%
and my roof caved in and
roofs all over California

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.910 align:middle line:84%
and swept all
across our country.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.756 align:middle line:84%
Could we have stopped that
with this kind of prayer?

00:14:39.756 --> 00:14:40.556 align:middle line:90%
Is it possible?

00:14:40.556 --> 00:14:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: From this perspective,
rather than stopping it--

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.946 align:middle line:90%
again this is the relationship.

00:14:45.946 --> 00:14:46.915 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: Oh, that's right.

00:14:46.915 --> 00:14:48.415 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Now we're
becoming-- we're

00:14:48.415 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:84%
getting concrete with these
very esoteric concepts.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.870 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: It's like saying bad
tumor, go away in the bladder.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:54.870 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to do that.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.495 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: What these
scenes-- the scene

00:14:56.495 --> 00:14:59.220 align:middle line:90%
said to us that we are earth.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.400 align:middle line:84%
Our bodies are the earth,
nothing more, nothing less.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And whatever
happens to the earth

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.920 align:middle line:84%
is mirrored in our bodies, and
whatever we do to our bodies

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.930 align:middle line:84%
is mirrored back to us
through the world around us.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:15.220 align:middle line:84%
As we affirm life in our
bodies, the world around us

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.820 align:middle line:84%
mirrors that back through
gentle weather patterns,

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.500 align:middle line:84%
graceful seismic activity,
crops that grow in their season,

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.875 align:middle line:84%
and furnish food
and healthy bodies.

00:15:24.875 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: Now I hear
you, but I don't think

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:28.150 align:middle line:90%
you're answering my question.

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:30.730 align:middle line:84%
And I take your point, and
I think it's fascinating.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:middle line:84%
I'm asking could we if we had
mirrored something differently

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.040 align:middle line:84%
in our bodies, if we had done
that sort of mode of prayer,

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.592 align:middle line:90%
could that have not happened?

00:15:39.592 --> 00:15:41.800 align:middle line:84%
I watch what's happening in
North Carolina right now.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.720 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: I'm seeing it as well.

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.860 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: It's devastating
the people in that flood area.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.785 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: From the
perspective of the ancients

00:15:46.785 --> 00:15:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and what they were saying
to us, those things

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:84%
are happening, showing
us something about what's

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:90%
happening in our bodies.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:58.440 align:middle line:84%
So-- because Earth mirrors
what we have become.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.845 align:middle line:84%
So if we have become
the unsettled patterns

00:16:01.845 --> 00:16:04.095 align:middle line:84%
of thought, feeling, and
emotion in our personal lives

00:16:04.095 --> 00:16:07.138 align:middle line:84%
and our individual
lives with our families

00:16:07.138 --> 00:16:09.180 align:middle line:84%
and friends and those that
we love and hold dear,

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.440 align:middle line:84%
that will be mirrored back to us
through the patterns of nature

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.830 align:middle line:90%
in weather in seismic activity.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: I understand.

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.247 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: To answer
your question,

00:16:17.247 --> 00:16:19.890 align:middle line:84%
if we're choosing to
move away from that kind

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:23.850 align:middle line:84%
of catastrophic weather pattern,
what they invited us to do

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:28.350 align:middle line:84%
was to find the way to
reconcile in our bodies

00:16:28.350 --> 00:16:30.960 align:middle line:90%
our individual relationships.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.790 align:middle line:84%
That's the science
of compassion.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Every relationship
that crosses our path

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.320 align:middle line:84%
in each moment and
each day offers us

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:40.570 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity of compassion,
forgiveness, understanding.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.290 align:middle line:90%
It's not about complacency.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not about rolling over and
letting everything just roll

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:90%
over us.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:51.060 align:middle line:84%
There is a knowable, accessible
science to these things.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:84%
So to-- in response
to your question,

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.840 align:middle line:84%
rather than saying
here comes a hurricane.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.550 align:middle line:90%
We got to pray and stop it.

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.100 align:middle line:84%
That may be a path
and it may work.

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And what they were
actually saying to us

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.400 align:middle line:84%
was that the world becomes
a barometer of what

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.218 align:middle line:90%
we've become in our lives.

00:17:08.218 --> 00:17:09.760 align:middle line:84%
And when we see
those kinds of things

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:14.319 align:middle line:84%
happen and we see the civil
wars and the religious wars

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.702 align:middle line:84%
and when we see the rogue
weather patterns if we have

00:17:17.702 --> 00:17:19.660 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom to recognize
what it's saying to us,

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.660 align:middle line:84%
it's saying that
collectively something in us

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.730 align:middle line:90%
is asking for healing.

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:26.530 align:middle line:84%
And this is the power
of the individual.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:29.380 align:middle line:84%
Our conditioning is we've
got to build big machines,

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:31.935 align:middle line:84%
use big science, go
out there and fix it.

00:17:31.935 --> 00:17:34.060 align:middle line:84%
And what the ancients say,
the Buddhist traditions,

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:84%
the Christian in their
purest traditions--

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.230 align:middle line:84%
in their pure sense--
the Christian traditions,

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.740 align:middle line:84%
the Muslim traditions,
Native American traditions

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.810 align:middle line:84%
are inviting us to
find the healing here

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
and to know that it's mirrored
in the world out there.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.998 align:middle line:84%
And our quantum physics
gives us the mechanism.

00:17:48.998 --> 00:17:50.290 align:middle line:90%
It says this is how that works.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.340 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: So they
go hand in hand.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Yes.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.822 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want to get
off a hook too easy.

00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:56.200 align:middle line:90%
Does that answer your question?

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.610 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't, it's important
to clarify it I think.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:02.560 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: Well, I think people
watching this broadcast would

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.660 align:middle line:84%
say, well, then
all we have to do

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.490 align:middle line:84%
is go into that particular
mode of prayer that we feel

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.847 align:middle line:84%
and we can prevent those
things from happening.

00:18:13.847 --> 00:18:15.930 align:middle line:84%
That's what I'm concerned
an audience would think.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.555 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And this
is what's so subtle,

00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:20.138 align:middle line:84%
and this is why I asked you the
question so we can clarify it.

00:18:20.138 --> 00:18:21.730 align:middle line:84%
It's so subtle and
it's so powerful.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:25.652 align:middle line:84%
We're conditioned to do in
this world to go into a prayer

00:18:25.652 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:90%
when something's wrong.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:27.395 align:middle line:90%
It needs to be fixed.

00:18:27.395 --> 00:18:27.930 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: We are.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:29.388 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And what
the ancient said

00:18:29.388 --> 00:18:31.570 align:middle line:84%
is that now this
time in history,

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:33.480 align:middle line:90%
we have outgrown the doing.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.980 align:middle line:90%
Now we are invited to become.

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.845 align:middle line:84%
We walk that prayer
day in and day out.

00:18:36.845 --> 00:18:38.220 align:middle line:84%
There's never time
that we're not

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.740 align:middle line:84%
in prayer because that
prayer is a feeling.

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:43.377 align:middle line:84%
It's the feeling of
peace in our bodies.

00:18:43.377 --> 00:18:45.210 align:middle line:84%
It's the feeling of
compassion, the honoring

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.350 align:middle line:90%
of all life and all levels.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And as we become the prayer
we walk and leave that prayer.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:84%
We may fully expect that the
world mirrors that back to us.

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: And what happens if
there's a certain group of us

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.610 align:middle line:90%
who does do precisely that?

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's make it a pretty
healthy sized group

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.082 align:middle line:84%
because I think a
tremendous number of people

00:19:06.082 --> 00:19:06.915 align:middle line:90%
all over the world--

00:19:06.915 --> 00:19:08.070 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: I know right
where this is going.

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:09.090 align:middle line:90%
It's a great question.

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Go ahead.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: Are trying to
fill the holes in our souls.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.190 align:middle line:10%
So what if a group
of us does that,

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:15.990 align:middle line:10%
lives this life
you're talking about,

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.900 align:middle line:10%
and then there's another
group out there that doesn't.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.270 align:middle line:84%
Because they don't, will
we suffer the consequences?

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.040 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Let's make
this very concrete

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:84%
and go back to one of
our previous examples.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:31.050 align:middle line:84%
November 13, 1998, a vast
majority of military thinking

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.435 align:middle line:84%
chose to go into an
armed conflict in Iraq.

00:19:34.435 --> 00:19:35.235 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: Yes.

00:19:35.235 --> 00:19:39.960 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: And a few 100,000
people in 75 countries--

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:41.580 align:middle line:84%
we don't know
precisely the number.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.170 align:middle line:84%
We know how many
web hits there were.

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:45.610 align:middle line:84%
We don't know how many
people were at each computer.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:84%
So we're several
100,000 web hits--

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:84%
were holding the thought,
feeling, and emotion--

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.270 align:middle line:84%
were coming from the place,
were holding this prayer,

00:19:55.270 --> 00:19:57.460 align:middle line:84%
they weren't saying
stop anything.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.195 align:middle line:84%
They were giving thanks for
the peace that already exists

00:20:00.195 --> 00:20:01.570 align:middle line:84%
in our world, and
in the presence

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:84%
of that peace from a few
people, that military action

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.360 align:middle line:90%
did not go forward.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Israelis in
1980s were actually

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.060 align:middle line:84%
quantifying this
kind of information

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.890 align:middle line:90%
during the Lebanese war.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:19.160 align:middle line:84%
They had individuals trained
in this mode of prayer.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.680 align:middle line:84%
They would station them
throughout their country,

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.300 align:middle line:84%
and when the prayers were
occurring simultaneously,

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:90%
terrorists stopped--

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:28.090 align:middle line:90%
the terrorism stopped.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
Traffic accidents
dropped dramatically.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.700 align:middle line:84%
Crimes-- violent crimes against
persons and the national stock

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.100 align:middle line:90%
market skyrocketed.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.160 align:middle line:84%
And when they stopped praying,
the terrorism began again.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.800 align:middle line:10%
The crimes against
persons began again.

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.740 align:middle line:10%
The hospital's emergency rooms
showed there was an effect.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.912 align:middle line:10%
They did this enough
times to demonstrate

00:20:47.912 --> 00:20:49.120 align:middle line:10%
that there was a correlation.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.560 align:middle line:84%
The US did the same thing with
24 cities between 1984 and '85,

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.550 align:middle line:84%
and what they found
was this, that there

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.287 align:middle line:90%
is a mathematical correlation.

00:20:59.287 --> 00:21:01.120 align:middle line:84%
So I'll give you the
numbers, and then we'll

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.490 align:middle line:90%
make it a little more concrete.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:08.550 align:middle line:84%
When the square root of 1/10
of 1% of a given population

00:21:08.550 --> 00:21:10.770 align:middle line:84%
becomes this mode
of prayer, that

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:13.020 align:middle line:84%
is when we begin
to feel the effect.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.470 align:middle line:84%
And we're not
mathematicians here,

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:84%
so what that means is for
a city of a million people

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.270 align:middle line:84%
when as few as 100 people
out of that million--

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:25.380 align:middle line:84%
of one million people, when
they become this mode of prayer,

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
that's when we begin
to feel the effects.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:84%
And in a world population--
a global population

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.110 align:middle line:84%
of approximately 8
billion or so people,

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:36.990 align:middle line:84%
it means that we begin
to feel the effects.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:41.310 align:middle line:84%
Obviously the more people are
doing it the [NO AUDIO] effects

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:45.680 align:middle line:84%
approximately 8,000 people
synchronized, coordinated

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:49.350 align:middle line:90%
in this mass mode of prayer.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And we now know the reason is
because our consciousness is

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.260 align:middle line:90%
connected.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.100 align:middle line:90%
We are all one.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.210 align:middle line:90%
That's the oneness.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.560 align:middle line:84%
There is a measurable
relationship that

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:90%
exists as human consciousness.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.100 align:middle line:84%
Although we have many
bodies walking the earth,

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.950 align:middle line:90%
there's only one of us here.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:11.060 align:middle line:84%
And when a certain
percentage of that one of us

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:16.580 align:middle line:84%
attains and chooses this
modality of thought, feeling,

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:84%
and emotion, the whole
benefits from it.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.080 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: Is it a question
in some cases of simply

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:24.740 align:middle line:84%
re-attuning our bodies
or retuning our bodies

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.540 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way?

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:26.480 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Tuning.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Well, some of the
concepts-- now I

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.100 align:middle line:84%
come from a world of
science and engineering,

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.100 align:middle line:84%
and if this sounds
complex, it's my inability

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.072 align:middle line:90%
to convey in very simple terms.

00:22:37.072 --> 00:22:38.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to know
any of the numbers.

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.730 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to
know any statistics.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Quantum science simply
has giving us a mechanism.

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:44.600 align:middle line:90%
We don't even have to know that.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:49.490 align:middle line:84%
We are simply invited to honor
all life in the presence of one

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:52.040 align:middle line:84%
another as we walk
this Earth in the time

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.580 align:middle line:84%
that we have together
honoring all life those formed

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:56.850 align:middle line:90%
and those yet to be formed.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And as we do that, that is what
I believe is the re-attuning.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.890 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: I see.

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:04.970 align:middle line:84%
>>BRADEN: Because the only
way to attune to the divine

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:07.083 align:middle line:84%
is to honor the
principle of life.

00:23:07.083 --> 00:23:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: Well, I certainly
love the way your mind works,

00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and I love your
optimism for our future.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Well, thank you.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.788 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for being
such a gracious host,

00:23:13.788 --> 00:23:15.650 align:middle line:84%
and you've been very,
very easy to speak to.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:16.450 align:middle line:90%
I appreciate that.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:18.290 align:middle line:84%
>>CHANTAL: You've brought his
great wisdom today I think.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:19.123 align:middle line:90%
>>BRADEN: Thank you.

00:23:19.123 --> 00:23:20.450 align:middle line:90%
>>CHANTAL: Thanks.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:50.123 align:middle line:90%
