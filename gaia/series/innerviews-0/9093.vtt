00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.116 align:middle line:84%
>> Andrew Harvey, I'm
very happy to meet you.

00:00:30.116 --> 00:00:31.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Me, to meet you.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:10%
>> You have a lot of people who
love you who are in my world

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:10%
and in my path.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.670 align:middle line:10%
>> You come highly recommended,
so I love meeting you.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:84%
I want to start with a quote
that is so interesting to me.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.080 align:middle line:84%
Larry Dossey who wrote
"Healing Words," one

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
of my favorite authors, wrote
of your book, "The Son of Man,"

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:84%
this book is a grenade
tossed into the complacencies

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.620 align:middle line:90%
of Christianity.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.000 align:middle line:84%
It is a radical challenge to
revision the nature of Jesus

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.500 align:middle line:90%
and the message he brought.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.860 align:middle line:84%
It requires courage
to read this book.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But great books
always involve risk.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.520 align:middle line:84%
What did he mean when he
said it requires courage

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.460 align:middle line:90%
to read this book?

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.310 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think, the vision of
Jesus that I'm trying to give

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:10%
in the book is a
vision, fundamentally,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:10%
and totally different from
that, that the majority

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.020 align:middle line:10%
of the Christian churches have
given people over the years.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.630 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to
do is to strip away

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.870 align:middle line:84%
what I consider the rubbish
in the portrayal of Jesus

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.650 align:middle line:84%
from the authentic historical
and mystical Jesus,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.740 align:middle line:84%
and to give the real path in its
real frightening, outrageous,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.960 align:middle line:90%
ecstatic splendor and challenge.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it takes
courage to face the real Jesus.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.902 align:middle line:84%
The real Jesus, in my
opinion, is not saying,

00:01:53.902 --> 00:01:56.360 align:middle line:84%
I am the son of god and you
are just these miserable worms,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.240 align:middle line:84%
who if you pray hard enough,
will one day experience

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.100 align:middle line:90%
just a taste of your divinity.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:84%
The real Jesus is saying, as
the Buddha said to humanity,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.400 align:middle line:84%
I have realized the
power of divine love,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.220 align:middle line:84%
so can you, because
I know that you can.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.820 align:middle line:90%
I am not unique.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.200 align:middle line:84%
You have this power within
you, and when you realize it,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle line:84%
you will become like me, imbued
with the force and passion

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.900 align:middle line:84%
and dynamism of the
spirit, and like me,

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.220 align:middle line:84%
extremely radical in the way
in which you see the world.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.553 align:middle line:84%
Because the real Jesus,
as modern scholarship

00:02:27.553 --> 00:02:29.720 align:middle line:84%
is making clear and as a
real reading of the gospels

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.140 align:middle line:84%
make clear, is someone who
was a mystic revolutionary.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.680 align:middle line:84%
And being a mystic revolutionary
was a revolutionary

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.570 align:middle line:84%
in every single
aspect of the world.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.910 align:middle line:84%
He was an emotional
revolutionary,

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
a sexual revolutionary,
an economic and political

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.310 align:middle line:90%
revolutionary.

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.000 align:middle line:84%
And his great challenge
to the whole human race

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.350 align:middle line:84%
was to bring together a vision
of divine beauty and divine

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.990 align:middle line:84%
love, and a vision
of how that could

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.280 align:middle line:84%
transfigure all the conditions
of real life on Earth.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.360 align:middle line:90%
And that's very scary.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Very scary.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it really
forces us to choose.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's go back to one
of the points of his being

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.080 align:middle line:84%
a revolutionary that
people will really resist.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.790 align:middle line:84%
Did I hear you say he was
a sexual revolutionary?

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:18.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.640 align:middle line:84%
I don't mean that Jesus indulged
in bizarre sexual practices.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.060 align:middle line:10%
I mean that Jesus, for example,
deeply venerated women.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.320 align:middle line:10%
If you think of all the
great teachers of humanity,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.820 align:middle line:10%
they all have, of course,
compassion towards men,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.570 align:middle line:10%
particularly the male
teachers, but none of them

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.300 align:middle line:10%
honored and venerated women
with the depth of tenderness

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.680 align:middle line:10%
that Jesus did.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:84%
Jesus-- perhaps Jesus's
deepest disciple

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:84%
we discovered from
the gnostic gospels

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.180 align:middle line:84%
was not the ones that have
been traditionally associated

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.620 align:middle line:90%
with him, but Mary Magdalene.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, indeed.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And perhaps the woman
that he appeared to after his

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Resurrection, the first person
to see him resurrected was

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.170 align:middle line:90%
a woman.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.800 align:middle line:84%
He gave some of his
deepest teachings

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.400 align:middle line:84%
to women, Phoenician
women in the gospel.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.250 align:middle line:84%
And he gave a very
profound teaching

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.560 align:middle line:84%
about adultery and
about sexuality

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.290 align:middle line:90%
to the woman taken in adultery.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.480 align:middle line:84%
So Jesus was saying in
all of these things,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.270 align:middle line:84%
I think, the
patriarchal denigration

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.820 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine, the patriarchal
humiliation of women,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and of all the associate
virtues associated with women

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.650 align:middle line:84%
is a disgrace and a tremendous
defeat of the spirit.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And that true divine love
embraces the masculine

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.310 align:middle line:90%
and feminine.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is a very
revolutionary remark,

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.350 align:middle line:84%
and a very
revolutionary position,

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.143 align:middle line:84%
which we still
haven't incarnated.

00:04:35.143 --> 00:04:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Look at the way
women are treated.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Look at way the feminine is
still derided and humiliated.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well look at the way so many
leaders of so many Christian

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:84%
churches would not think
in terms of Jesus as having

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.150 align:middle line:84%
a feminine energy as well
as a masculine energy.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.020 align:middle line:90%
>> This is madness.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Because if there is
anyone who has incarnated

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.840 align:middle line:84%
the aspect of the motherhood of
God more intensely than Jesus,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:90%
I do not know him or her.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.430 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Israel, I
had an amazing experience.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.840 align:middle line:84%
I went to the place, [? Taka, ?]
where Jesus actually gave,

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:84%
it said, the Sermon
on the Mount.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And I stood in that chapel
with the Latin Beatitudes

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.967 align:middle line:84%
all around me and I sang the
Beatitudes in Latin to myself

00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:23.960 align:middle line:84%
and I gazed out at the landscape
that he had spoken to and from.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And at that moment, it
really did strike me

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.210 align:middle line:84%
with a force of lightning, the
day before I had been in Sinai,

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:84%
and Sinai is striated
and violent and very,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.650 align:middle line:90%
very vertical.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.775 align:middle line:84%
It's very much the place
where you would experience

00:05:35.775 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:90%
God as total holiness.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:84%
The landscape that he
gave the Beatitudes in

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.250 align:middle line:84%
is a landscape of tremendous
maternal sweetness,

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.120 align:middle line:84%
of hills rolling down
to this blue sea.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And at that moment I
understood that the Beatitudes

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:84%
themselves are celebrating
the feminine virtues.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.040 align:middle line:90%
What did they say?

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.000 align:middle line:90%
Blessed are the meek.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.363 align:middle line:90%
Blessed are the tender.

00:05:54.363 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:90%
Blessed is the gentle.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.800 align:middle line:90%
Blessed are those who nourish.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you read them
in the Aramaic, which

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:84%
is what I've tried to
do and tried to explore,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.880 align:middle line:84%
then you realize just how
profoundly Jesus is celebrating

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.250 align:middle line:84%
the feminine side of God,
the maternal side of God,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.590 align:middle line:84%
the tender side of God,
the sensitive side of God,

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.180 align:middle line:90%
the nourishing side of God.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.270 align:middle line:84%
And the church has failed to
incarnate the Christ energy

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.630 align:middle line:84%
because it has simply ignored
or humiliated this side.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
It amounts to a crucifixion of
the real Christ consciousness.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And it is reason
why it has never

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.380 align:middle line:84%
been really taken over
history as it was meant to do.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.660 align:middle line:84%
>> You're speaking of the
Beatitudes reminds me that--

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.310 align:middle line:84%
let me see if I can
remember it correctly.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.020 align:middle line:84%
Your book begins with one of
the Beatitudes, I believe.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Only he who is pure
of heart will see God.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Isn't that a Beatitude
from Matthew?

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it is.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:44.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Why did you begin with that?

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because it's
been my experience,

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.780 align:middle line:84%
as it is of every mystic
of every tradition,

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.500 align:middle line:84%
that there is a seed of God
consciousness in each of us

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.310 align:middle line:84%
and if you purify the heart
by meditation and by prayer

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.730 align:middle line:84%
and by serving others, slowly
you come to realize that God is

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.610 align:middle line:84%
shining in the heart, the
divine is shining in the heart,

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.820 align:middle line:84%
and the whole world is
shining in the divine light

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:90%
of the heart.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can only do
that if you undergo

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.000 align:middle line:90%
the necessary purifications.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.050 align:middle line:84%
You have to come to understand
the darkness of your full self.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.600 align:middle line:84%
You have to really
aspire to be one

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.060 align:middle line:90%
with the beloved, the divine.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And you have to
really train yourself

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.730 align:middle line:84%
to concentrate on the truths
of divine relationship.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:29.430 align:middle line:84%
If you do, if you attain
that purity of heart,

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:31.170 align:middle line:90%
you will see God.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:90%
You won't just believe in God.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.010 align:middle line:84%
You won't just have
faith that God exists.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.605 align:middle line:90%
You will see God.

00:07:36.605 --> 00:07:38.730 align:middle line:84%
And for the last 10 years
through the grace of God,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:90%
I have been seeing God.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.410 align:middle line:84%
And I would wish every
single human being

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.530 align:middle line:84%

as the feast.

00:07:52.575 --> 00:07:53.880 align:middle line:90%
>> What a gift.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.460 align:middle line:84%
What a marvelous opportunity
for you to be able to see God.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Well I think everybody can.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:90%
That's what I know.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:00.570 align:middle line:90%
And that's what Jesus knew.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.350 align:middle line:90%
That's what the Buddha knew.

That's what Roman
Christian knew.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.380 align:middle line:84%
That's what everybody
who sees God knows

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
is that everyone could see
God if they loved enough,

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.030 align:middle line:84%
if they gave enough, if
they sacrificed enough,

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.850 align:middle line:84%
if they prayed enough, if
they believed enough, if they

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:90%
sacrificed their self enough.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.530 align:middle line:90%
It's not a unique gift.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.730 align:middle line:84%
There are many
people who see God--

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:18.870 align:middle line:90%
many.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.020 align:middle line:84%
And the more I see
of God, the more

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.990 align:middle line:84%
I realized that God is
blazing all around us.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.070 align:middle line:90%
We're just blind.

I can feel his presence.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.379 align:middle line:10%

>> --of God around me at
times, not all the time.

00:08:36.553 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
But I can't say that
I've ever seen him.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.200 align:middle line:90%
What is it like?

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it like an apparition or do
you see him in someone else?

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You see him in everything
and as everything.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle line:84%
The world becomes
a place where God

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.790 align:middle line:84%
is experienced as manifesting in
every flower, in every banana,

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.420 align:middle line:84%
in every child, in every
eye-- your eyes now.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.690 align:middle line:84%

is one of the divine

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:09.810 align:middle line:84%
it's impossible
to put into words.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.760 align:middle line:84%
The greatest mystical poets
have tried and failed.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.120 align:middle line:84%
But what Rumi said in one
of his late poems, I think,

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:90%
is really powerful.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.610 align:middle line:84%
He says, "I see the waters of
magnificent streaming always,

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.650 align:middle line:84%
and the whole of
heaven and earth

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:84%
reveals itself as
the Resurrection,

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:84%
as the place where the
divine is dancing."

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:32.130 align:middle line:10%
And that is not poetry actually,
that is a living experience.

00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.860 align:middle line:84%
And I'm convinced that many,
many more people could have it

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.480 align:middle line:90%
than think they could have it.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.140 align:middle line:84%
Because we've really
said, oh, there

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.640 align:middle line:84%
are these great mystics who
have this extraordinary spirits,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.880 align:middle line:84%
but we're just poor human beings
crawling around in our lives.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.383 align:middle line:84%
And they have the experience,
and we get support

00:09:47.383 --> 00:09:48.300 align:middle line:90%
from their experience.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.950 align:middle line:90%
This is nonsense.

00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:52.110 align:middle line:84%
Everybody can have
this experience.

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.560 align:middle line:84%
To have this experience
is why we are here.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.330 align:middle line:84%
We are the children
of the father mother.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:90%
We have the power within us.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
What we need are the simple
techniques of meditation,

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.580 align:middle line:84%
of concentration, the
right information,

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.580 align:middle line:84%
and the right encouragement
and inspiration.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.470 align:middle line:84%
With all of those
things together,

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:12.900 align:middle line:90%
it's amazing what you can see.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:16.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I wonder if you will take
a lot of heat, if you will,

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:19.650 align:middle line:90%
for the father mother?

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.870 align:middle line:84%
I like the sound
of it, personally.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:25.080 align:middle line:84%
But do you know some
people will resist that?

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I do not think
the words that you use are

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.090 align:middle line:90%
so important.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.590 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
extremely important

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:32.440 align:middle line:84%
to bring in the feminine
in every discussion

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.240 align:middle line:90%
about the divine.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.080 align:middle line:84%
The divine is both masculine
and feminine and beyond both.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:38.730 align:middle line:84%
The creation is
created by the play

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:40.110 align:middle line:84%
of the masculine and
feminine energies.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.027 align:middle line:84%
The greatest mystical
systems have known this.

00:10:42.027 --> 00:10:44.040 align:middle line:84%
We have in Taoism,
the yin and the yang,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.540 align:middle line:84%
which engender the
whole universe.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.092 align:middle line:84%
We have in Hinduism,
Shiva and Shakti.

00:10:49.092 --> 00:10:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And we have, I believe, at
the heart of Christianity,

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.640 align:middle line:84%
this tremendous love play
between the divine mother

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.945 align:middle line:84%
and her child and the
forces of the feminine

00:10:55.945 --> 00:10:56.820 align:middle line:90%
and of the masculine.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:84%
This is-- it's crazy not to
think of God as androgynous.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:05.010 align:middle line:84%
It is simply idiotic,
because it excludes

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:84%
a whole power of feminine love,
of feminine understanding.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.620 align:middle line:84%
A great Hindu mystic,
I think, put it best.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.750 align:middle line:84%
He said, [? Kabir, ?] my father
is the transcendent absolute,

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.920 align:middle line:84%
and my mother is the
embodied godhead.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And they are continually
making love to each other,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.297 align:middle line:84%
and they are continually
engendering the creation.

00:11:24.297 --> 00:11:25.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can't have
the full experience

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.840 align:middle line:84%
until you meet your father
the transcendent and you adore

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
and love your mother
the embodied creation.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.768 align:middle line:90%
That is the full experience.

mystical traditions.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:04.007 align:middle line:90%
I've written 30 books.

I've done a great deal of work
on Rumi and the Sufi tradition.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And what I have found
is that this experience

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:84%
of divine love that is
at the core of the Christ

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:84%
consciousness is at the core of
all authentic mystic awakening.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.480 align:middle line:84%
We call it the
Christ consciousness,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.840 align:middle line:84%
but Ramakrishnan, a great
Hindu experienced it.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Rumi, a great Sufi,
experienced it.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.450 align:middle line:90%
Let's get rid of the names.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.087 align:middle line:84%
Let's have people
have the experience.

So then they will understand.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:50.790 align:middle line:84%
For example, the mother
is cooking a white fish,

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.082 align:middle line:84%
and she has six
children, and she

00:12:53.082 --> 00:12:54.540 align:middle line:84%
knows that each of
the six children

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.700 align:middle line:84%
eat the fish in a different
way, so she cooks it

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:90%
in a different way.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:01.260 align:middle line:90%
Different cuisines, same fish--

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.550 align:middle line:84%
that is the whole nature of the
various religions of the world.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.180 align:middle line:84%
When they claim to be the only
truth, they're simply lying.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.377 align:middle line:90%
It's idiotic.

00:13:10.377 --> 00:13:12.210 align:middle line:84%
When they claim to have
a part of the truth,

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:90%
they're telling the truth.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.860 align:middle line:84%
But let's see--
let's eat the fish

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
and not worry too much
about the cuisine.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And let us know that
everybody eating the fish

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.390 align:middle line:90%
is eating a part of the fish.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.070 align:middle line:84%
And also, let's
know something else

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:84%
that we will never
eat the whole fish.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:90%
We will never understand it all.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Let's have the
experience and then

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.430 align:middle line:84%
other things will
become very clear.

>> What do you mean when you say
Jesus was a normal regular guy?

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:90%
He was a human being--

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.263 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I didn't mean that.

00:13:40.263 --> 00:13:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>> --who Christed himself?

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:42.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I don't--

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.610 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say that Jesus
was that normal or regular.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.870 align:middle line:90%
I think Jesus had--

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:84%
I suspect it may have
gone something like this.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.480 align:middle line:90%
And I don't know.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.640 align:middle line:90%
Nobody else will ever know.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:90%
But this is my belief.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, he was a man.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:53.512 align:middle line:90%
I should put it that way.

00:13:53.512 --> 00:13:57.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Jesus was a human being with
tremendous spiritual passion

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.600 align:middle line:84%
and incredible
sincerity and wild,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.950 align:middle line:84%
wild desire to get deeper and
deeper into the truth of his

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:05.902 align:middle line:90%
own nature.

00:14:05.902 --> 00:14:07.860 align:middle line:84%
And that incredible
sincerity and that wildness

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.725 align:middle line:84%
and that passion took him
on an extraordinary journey

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:13.240 align:middle line:90%
in which he really saw God.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.480 align:middle line:84%
And not only saw
God, but lived what

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:21.030 align:middle line:84%
he saw in the terms of
political, emotional, sexual

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.360 align:middle line:84%
engagement with the
world, and through that,

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Christed himself, became one
with the power of divine love

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.860 align:middle line:90%
in life.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:84%
And that is what's so
important about him.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.570 align:middle line:10%
If he just floated in from
some divine dimension,

00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.900 align:middle line:10%
lived this life, and then
left to that divine dimension,

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:39.170 align:middle line:10%
his life wouldn't
be such a challenge.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:42.300 align:middle line:10%
If he is just like us, someone
with a tremendous hunger

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.600 align:middle line:10%
to know who we really
are, then his life becomes

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.360 align:middle line:10%
an overwhelming challenge,
because what it says to us

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.110 align:middle line:10%
is that you can Christ yourself.

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:57.060 align:middle line:90%
But you must give everything.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.280 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the ways you say
that we Christ ourselves,

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:10%
which is a term I think
I like quite a bit.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well it's a term that all
the Christian mystics have used.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, very interesting.

00:15:05.542 --> 00:15:07.542 align:middle line:84%
>> You've had the official
Christianity and then

00:15:07.542 --> 00:15:08.917 align:middle line:84%
you've had mystical
Christianity,

00:15:08.917 --> 00:15:11.550 align:middle line:84%
which has often been very secret
and has nothing whatever to do

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.930 align:middle line:90%
with the official nonsense.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:90%
>> And very controversial.

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.140 align:middle line:90%
And resistant.

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because it's
Christ's direct experience

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.230 align:middle line:84%
and the direct
experience of Christ.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:21.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.770 align:middle line:84%
>> So in order for us to
Christ ourselves, and we can,

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:27.415 align:middle line:90%
and that's when we can see God.

00:15:27.415 --> 00:15:28.540 align:middle line:90%
Is that what you're saying?

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think we see
God, quite honestly,

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
a long time before we're
actually fully Christed.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:38.310 align:middle line:84%
You see the spiritual path
goes something like this.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.170 align:middle line:90%
You're called by the divine.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:43.270 align:middle line:84%
You respond to the call
by prayer and meditation

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:44.070 align:middle line:90%
and adoration.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.740 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, slowly you polish
the mirror of your heart,

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:84%
and a great light, which
is not of this world,

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.290 align:middle line:90%
starts to become visual to you.

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:90%
You see it.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.090 align:middle line:84%
You see the white light of the
divine shining from things.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But this is not enlightenment,
and it's not full Christing.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.490 align:middle line:84%
It's the beginning
of yet another stage

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.170 align:middle line:84%
in which all sorts
of powers are given,

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.087 align:middle line:84%
and all kinds of experiences
are given to you.

00:16:03.087 --> 00:16:04.575 align:middle line:84%
I'm explaining very
simply what all

00:16:04.575 --> 00:16:06.010 align:middle line:84%
the great mystical
traditions know

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.040 align:middle line:84%
and what has been
my own experience.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.630 align:middle line:84%
Then, through a
deepening of this,

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:84%
which takes many years
and tremendous sacrifice

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.220 align:middle line:84%
and passion and endless
opening, slowly, slowly you

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.680 align:middle line:90%
become one with the light.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Your heart, your
mind, your body all

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:27.600 align:middle line:84%
become slowly integrated in the
power of conscious divine love.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.440 align:middle line:84%
At that moment, the Christing
process starts to begin.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.910 align:middle line:84%
But that is a very high stage,
and it takes a great deal

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:35.710 align:middle line:90%
to get to it.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.880 align:middle line:84%
Not many people will probably
get that highest off stages,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:43.480 align:middle line:84%
but I think almost everyone
can get very far along the path

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.660 align:middle line:90%
if they really want to.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.740 align:middle line:90%
>> What stops us?

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.152 align:middle line:84%
What blocks us from
going in that direction?

00:16:49.152 --> 00:16:51.360 align:middle line:84%
That's what a lot of people
want is practical advice.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.450 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the most
important thing of all.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.350 align:middle line:84%
Look, we have been told by
the experts, usually men,

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.900 align:middle line:84%
by the patriarchal structures,
usually run by men,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.838 align:middle line:84%
by hierarchical elitist
structures all of our lives,

00:17:04.838 --> 00:17:06.630 align:middle line:84%
the following, we have
been given a message

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:84%
that unless we obey them,
and unless we listen to them,

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.579 align:middle line:84%
listen to the experts,
take their advice,

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:14.180 align:middle line:84%
obey them, worship them, and
keep them in health, wealth,

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and happiness for the
rest of their lives,

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:19.770 align:middle line:84%
we will have not a chance
in heaven of evolving.

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So we've given this vision
of ourselves as creepy crawly

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:26.970 align:middle line:84%
worms who cannot
grow unless we obey.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:29.700 align:middle line:84%
That is entirely the
wrong information.

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:84%
The real information
is dead simple,

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.140 align:middle line:84%
and it's the truth of all
of the mystical traditions.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.880 align:middle line:90%
The real information is this.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.950 align:middle line:90%
You are a child of God.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:40.440 align:middle line:84%
You have a seed of God
consciousness within you.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.280 align:middle line:84%
That seed can be watered
by prayer, by meditation,

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.250 align:middle line:84%
and by serving other human
beings and other sentient

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.560 align:middle line:90%
beings with great humility.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:53.140 align:middle line:84%
If you do that, if you really
pray, if you really meditate,

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:54.730 align:middle line:84%
if you really ask
God to help you,

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.280 align:middle line:84%
and if you really
serve others, you

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.010 align:middle line:84%
will wake up to your
own human divinity,

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:00.900 align:middle line:84%
and you will be given
all kinds of guidance

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.520 align:middle line:90%
directly from the spirit.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.565 align:middle line:90%
You won't need experts.

00:18:03.565 --> 00:18:04.440 align:middle line:90%
You won't need gurus.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.580 align:middle line:90%
You won't need priests.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.910 align:middle line:84%
What you will need
is to be yourself

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.910 align:middle line:84%
in the core of your life,
turning up to what you

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:12.240 align:middle line:90%
are finding out, and using it.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And that is the great discovery
that the mystic teachers

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:84%
have tried to give
humanity again and again.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.480 align:middle line:90%
They've come.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:84%
When the Buddha came, he gave a
version of that great message.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And you know when he was
dying, they asked him

00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.970 align:middle line:84%
how can we commemorate
your being here?

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.390 align:middle line:84%
And he said to
himself, my god, I've

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.130 align:middle line:84%
been talking about how
they are empowered,

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.710 align:middle line:84%
and now they want
to celebrate me.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So he took his palm and he put
his palm on top of his palm,

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.320 align:middle line:84%
like that, and he said to
commemorate one emptiness

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:84%
by another, is just to heap
one emptiness on another.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.850 align:middle line:84%
Why don't you
liberate yourselves,

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:46.290 align:middle line:90%
instead of worshipping me?

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.450 align:middle line:84%
And they took that shape
and they made out of that

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:51.813 align:middle line:84%
shape the stupa, which is
the sacred shape, which--

00:18:51.813 --> 00:18:54.480 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's happened to all
of the great mystic liberators.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.520 align:middle line:84%
They come with this
overwhelming message

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.250 align:middle line:90%
that we are all children of God.

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:00.660 align:middle line:84%
Then we worship them,
and create churches

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.630 align:middle line:84%
around them, which stops
the real radical glory

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:84%
of the message ever
getting out to people.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.240 align:middle line:90%
It's terrifying.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.440 align:middle line:90%
>> But we do need teachers.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you said, we won't need
gurus, but we need teachers.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.220 align:middle line:90%
Don't we?

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.570 align:middle line:90%
Aren't you a teacher?

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I hope I am.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
But what I hope I'm
teaching is how to learn.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:20.610 align:middle line:84%
I think we need teachers who
know that they are seekers, who

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:24.390 align:middle line:84%
know that they are learners,
who do not want power, who want

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:27.420 align:middle line:84%
the authority not of
power but of love,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:31.735 align:middle line:84%
and who are there to teach from
their own experience what they

00:19:31.735 --> 00:19:36.140 align:middle line:84%
are learning, who don't teach
from a omnipotent omniscient

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:39.720 align:middle line:84%
position, because no one,
no one, including Jesus

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.900 align:middle line:84%
and including Rumi and
including Ramakrishnan

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:45.930 align:middle line:84%
would ever, ever claim to
know everything if they'd seen

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:47.490 align:middle line:90%
a glimpse of the glory of God.

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:48.870 align:middle line:90%
It is outrageous.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Those gurus and priests who
claimed to know everything

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.630 align:middle line:84%
are simply indulging in a
form of monstrous manipulation

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:56.997 align:middle line:90%
that is absolutely impossible.

00:19:56.997 --> 00:19:59.580 align:middle line:84%
Let me tell you a lovely story
of Rumi at the end of his life.

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.578 align:middle line:84%
Rumi was the great
King of mystics

00:20:01.578 --> 00:20:03.870 align:middle line:84%
who was revered even in his
own time as a great mystic.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Brilliant.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The most wonderful mystic
perhaps the world has ever

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.010 align:middle line:90%
seen.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.100 align:middle line:84%
A young man had heard about
him and was terribly thrilled

00:20:11.100 --> 00:20:13.580 align:middle line:84%
and was projecting
endlessly onto Rumi

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.720 align:middle line:84%
how glorious he must
be, came all the way

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:90%
from Constantinople.

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:84%
He met Rumi walking
outside Konya.

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:20.820 align:middle line:90%
He bowed to Rumi.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:21.960 align:middle line:90%
Rumi bowed to him.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:90%
He bowed again to Rumi.

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Rumi bowed to him.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:27.635 align:middle line:84%
Rumi about 32 times to the
man until the man got it.

00:20:27.635 --> 00:20:29.010 align:middle line:84%
And the man cried
out, oh my god,

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:31.203 align:middle line:84%
why do you treat
me like this, you

00:20:31.203 --> 00:20:32.370 align:middle line:90%
who are the King of mystics?

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And Rumi said to
him, if I did not

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.260 align:middle line:84%
show you my misery
and my nothingness

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:39.960 align:middle line:90%
before God, what use would I be?

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So what Rumi is teaching
is the very humility

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:48.630 align:middle line:84%
through which Rumi has learned
everything that he is learning.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:49.930 align:middle line:90%
That is what we need.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.560 align:middle line:84%
We don't need teachers in
the conventional sense.

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.720 align:middle line:84%
We need mirrors of
divine love in which

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.270 align:middle line:90%
we can see our own real face.

00:20:57.270 --> 00:21:00.210 align:middle line:84%
We need people who can
teach us how to learn.

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:04.320 align:middle line:84%
We need people who have really
been humbled and radically

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.340 align:middle line:84%
humbled by direct divine
experience which would totally

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:84%
stop them being
teachers of any kind

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:15.840 align:middle line:84%
and make them lovers and sharers
and invite us to a great feast.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.480 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things you spoke
of a little bit earlier was

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.270 align:middle line:84%
the importance of
being of service.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.850 align:middle line:84%
How do people mobilize
to begin that?

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.670 align:middle line:84%
>> There are five forms of
service and it's very simple

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:27.990 align:middle line:90%
when you get it.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:84%
First, you serve the divine
by loving the divine.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you serve
the part of you

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.068 align:middle line:84%
that is always in
connection with the divine

00:21:35.068 --> 00:21:37.110 align:middle line:84%
and that is by praying
and meditating and keeping

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.970 align:middle line:90%
that connection alive.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.090 align:middle line:84%
Then you serve the people
in your life, your friends,

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.870 align:middle line:84%
your family, your sentient
beings, your pets.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:47.120 align:middle line:84%
And you serve them,
if you possibly can,

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.460 align:middle line:84%
as representatives
of the divine.

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, you serve
your community,

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.570 align:middle line:84%
because you serve your community
by really taking care of what

00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:58.290 align:middle line:90%
is going on in your community.

00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.050 align:middle line:84%
How are the poor
people being treated?

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.550 align:middle line:90%
What are the hospitals like?

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Are the bus shelters
really helpful?

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.160 align:middle line:90%
You look around.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.150 align:middle line:90%
You get informed.

00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, you serve
the whole global community

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:11.000 align:middle line:84%
by really staying
in touch, by really

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.990 align:middle line:84%
being aware of what is happening
in this environmental horror we

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
find ourselves in, in what's
happening in global poverty.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.110 align:middle line:84%
All of these forms of
service are different facets

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.550 align:middle line:90%
of one diamond of divine love.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And if you really love God and
the world and other people,

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.890 align:middle line:84%
it will breed in you
an overwhelming passion

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:35.510 align:middle line:84%
to do good, to do real good,
to make justice happen.

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And that will inevitably
express itself

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.320 align:middle line:84%
on all of these
different levels,

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.370 align:middle line:84%
in all of these
five different ways.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And when you fuse
them together, you

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
become someone who is
world-centered, god-centered,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:90%
and not self-centered.

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:50.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's a very
difficult process.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:52.050 align:middle line:90%
It's a slow process.

00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:53.540 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't come instantly.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:55.250 align:middle line:84%
But the rewards
are extraordinary,

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:58.370 align:middle line:84%
because then you really are
serving the transformation

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:00.050 align:middle line:84%
that love is trying
to bring about.

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.450 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, Mr.
Harvey, you are divine.

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:90%
>> So are you.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And so is everyone else
watching this program.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:10.330 align:middle line:84%
We are all divine
children of the divine.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:84%
And no one is more
special than anyone else.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.410 align:middle line:90%
Some have seen it.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.360 align:middle line:90%
Others will see it.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.680 align:middle line:90%
It is available.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:19.490 align:middle line:90%
Claim it.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:20.290 align:middle line:90%
Live it.

00:23:20.290 --> 00:23:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Serve it.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.910 align:middle line:84%
And all things will come
amazingly clear to you.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.610 align:middle line:90%
