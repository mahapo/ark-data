>> It's wonderful to
be back with you too.

How long has it been?

00:00:31.825 --> 00:00:34.520 align:middle line:84%
>> About, I guess five or
six years last time you and I

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.320 align:middle line:90%
spoke.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you still
hear a conversation?

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.350 align:middle line:10%
Because I remember the last
time you talked about the idea

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.280 align:middle line:10%
that your angels were in
conversation with you.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.660 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't so much a prayer.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.650 align:middle line:10%
Is that still true?

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.440 align:middle line:10%
I'm clairvoyant
and clairaudient.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.950 align:middle line:10%
What that means is I get my
messages from a little voice,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.472 align:middle line:10%
as if I have a microphone
in my right ear.

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:58.180 align:middle line:10%
And that's one other
way I know it's true

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.120 align:middle line:10%
divine guidance because
it's always in that ear.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.177 align:middle line:84%
I also can see people
who are around--

00:01:05.177 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I can see people who are on
the other side very clearly.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.378 align:middle line:84%
I've been a clairvoyant
since childhood.

00:01:09.378 --> 00:01:11.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's talk about
that for just a second.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.330 align:middle line:84%
I wonder how many
people really do

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.990 align:middle line:84%
know exactly what a
clairvoyant is, because we say

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.817 align:middle line:90%
the word a lot and we hear it.

00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:19.900 align:middle line:90%
And there is a stereotype.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes there is.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.410 align:middle line:84%
No, the woman with the big hoop
earrings and the crystal ball.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:90%
I see your future.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:84%
So what is a
clairvoyant exactly?

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there's four ways
that we get divine messages,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.130 align:middle line:84%
and the most common are
through our feelings--

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.220 align:middle line:84%
physical feelings or emotional
feelings, for instance,

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.650 align:middle line:84%
and the second way is
through our thoughts.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.780 align:middle line:84%
The other two ways we
get divine guidance

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.440 align:middle line:84%
are through things we hear,
as an inner or an outer voice,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.840 align:middle line:84%
or things we see,
either in our mind's eye

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.020 align:middle line:90%
or with our physical sight.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, clairvoyance
could be very common,

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
but most people are
afraid of ghosts,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.665 align:middle line:84%
and that's what keeps them
from seeing beyond the veil.

00:01:55.665 --> 00:01:57.040 align:middle line:84%
And as a psychologist,
I've spent

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.830 align:middle line:84%
years teaching and
studying how to help people

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.660 align:middle line:84%
to break through
those fears, because I

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.330 align:middle line:84%
find that most people
would love to see an angel

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
or would love to see an
apparition of a deceased loved

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.580 align:middle line:90%
one or Jesus or ascended master.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So I've found that
when I help people

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.950 align:middle line:84%
to break through the barrier
of the fear, it's naturally--

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.710 align:middle line:84%
the clairvoyance is naturally
just below the surface.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.900 align:middle line:84%
And I see-- because
I don't have fears--

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.460 align:middle line:84%
I see angels and departed loved
ones around a lot of people.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.458 align:middle line:90%
>> Mmm.

00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:26.500 align:middle line:84%
Do you think we're all
clairvoyant on some level?

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I do.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I've seen studies,
for instance, Dr. Daryl

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.380 align:middle line:90%
Bem of Cornell University.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.450 align:middle line:90%
He's a professor of engineering.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
He was initially a skeptic
about telepathic abilities

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.650 align:middle line:90%
and clairvoyance.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.678 align:middle line:84%
And he ran what was supposed
to be the ultimate test,

00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:43.720 align:middle line:84%
and the methodology was
as tight as it could get.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.150 align:middle line:84%
He ran this study
11 different times,

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:84%
and every time, the study came
up with the same conclusion.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.470 align:middle line:84%
That everyone, regardless of
age, gender, or background

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.510 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to be
accurate in clairvoyance.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And that study actually has
led to more scientists right

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.920 align:middle line:84%
now believing in clairvoyance
and telepathy than the average

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.237 align:middle line:90%
person on the street.

00:03:04.237 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting, isn't it,
and you'd be the perfect person

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.440 align:middle line:84%
to confirm this, that science
has become so much more

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.090 align:middle line:90%
interested in your kind of work.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Literally, when I first
met you and probably 10 years

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.130 align:middle line:84%
before that, people really
thought of you as a woo-woo

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.490 align:middle line:90%
girl.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.290 align:middle line:90%
>> They did.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
And the scientific
work that was done

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.580 align:middle line:84%
was very skewed by
scientists who had a bent

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.673 align:middle line:90%
to prove that they believed.

00:03:29.673 --> 00:03:31.090 align:middle line:10%
So now what we're
getting is we're

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.060 align:middle line:10%
getting skeptical scientists
doing the measuring,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.490 align:middle line:10%
and they're the ones who have
the most interesting studies

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:10%
because they're
the ones who have

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:10%
a vested interest in
disproving psychic abilities.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And so when they
come up with data

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.290 align:middle line:84%
that supports strong evidence
beyond statistical chance

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.880 align:middle line:84%
that there is psychic
abilities in everyone,

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.350 align:middle line:90%
we all stand up and take notice.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.410 align:middle line:84%
So then the possibility exists
that for disbelievers, we

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:90%
could find God through science.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.340 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.860 align:middle line:84%
And what's interesting to me
is that when I was a child

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
and I was raised in a
religion that basically said,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.360 align:middle line:84%
scientists are
non-spiritual beings.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.120 align:middle line:84%
They are the ones who
are almost atheistic,

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.220 align:middle line:84%
I grew up with a
suspicion of science.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.120 align:middle line:84%
And then later on, as I became a
psychologist with three degrees

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.089 align:middle line:84%
in psychology, I
adapted more of a trust

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:23.560 align:middle line:90%
to the scientific method.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.410 align:middle line:84%
And so I've come full circle,
now where some of my friends

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.440 align:middle line:84%
are medical doctors and
scientists, and as you said,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.880 align:middle line:90%
we're seeing eye to eye.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.820 align:middle line:84%
Those who are clairvoyant
mediums and spiritual healers

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.160 align:middle line:84%
are finding that they have
a partnership with quantum

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:84%
physicists and scientists in
the engineering departments

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.050 align:middle line:84%
of Princeton, Cornell,
Harvard, University of Nevada,

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.100 align:middle line:84%
University of Ohio, a
very conservative school.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And we have reams of data
that have no other explanation

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.880 align:middle line:84%
but that human beings are
naturally psychic, just

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.840 align:middle line:90%
like animals are.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:84%
Why would we not have
that ability to sense?

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
>> When you know who's going
to call you, for instance,

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.660 align:middle line:84%
you think about John and then he
calls you an hour later or you

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.770 align:middle line:90%
run into him at the store.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.090 align:middle line:84%
We know now that that's not
something that's woo-woo.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.720 align:middle line:90%
It's scientifically verifiable.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.320 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Dean Radin, formerly with
the University of Nevada,

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.995 align:middle line:84%
hooked up someone to a blood
pressure and heart monitor

00:05:18.995 --> 00:05:21.120 align:middle line:84%
machine and then had someone
else in the other room

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:90%
think about that person.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.510 align:middle line:90%
This is unbeknownst to him.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.640 align:middle line:84%
And the moment that a
thought was transmitted

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:84%
about the person
who was hooked up,

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.380 align:middle line:84%
the heart monitor machine
and blood pressure machine

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.290 align:middle line:84%
recorded strong
physiological differences.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So we can literally feel
the fingerprint of John

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.850 align:middle line:84%
when he thinks
about us, and that's

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.370 align:middle line:84%
why we know he's going to
call us or run into us.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.670 align:middle line:84%
>> I'd be interested to hear
more about the religion that

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.470 align:middle line:90%
you grew up with.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:46.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:90%
Well, it was Christian Science.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.100 align:middle line:84%
I believe that we choose
our childhoods, you see.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
I believe that
before we come here,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.260 align:middle line:84%
we set up our life according
to our life purpose.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.090 align:middle line:84%
And some people choose a
very challenging childhood

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.150 align:middle line:84%
because there is a growth
that's going to come about,

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.340 align:middle line:84%
especially if they can go
through that experience

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.220 align:middle line:84%
and forgive, they often
become the greatest healers

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.460 align:middle line:84%
and counselors that there
are around and authors.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And I chose a mystical
household with two parents

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:84%
that are metaphysicians,
who taught me

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.950 align:middle line:84%
how to manifest practically
before I could talk.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.127 align:middle line:84%
And I know it's because I came
here to do a lot of teaching,

00:06:21.127 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:84%
and I needed to have
a background that

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.780 align:middle line:90%
was very much a blank slate.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.280 align:middle line:84%
Many of my friends
are still trying

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.820 align:middle line:84%
to overcome some
guilt-based religions,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.360 align:middle line:84%
and it seems like it's, no pun
intended, please, but a cross

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.705 align:middle line:84%
that they bear trying to undo
that guilt. As a psychologist,

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:39.330 align:middle line:84%
I've been very
concerned with the guilt

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.560 align:middle line:84%
that I see people
struggling with.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.340 align:middle line:84%
And I was born and raised in
a religion that just didn't

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.270 align:middle line:90%
have guilt a part of it at all.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>> So it was a help to you.

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.490 align:middle line:84%
>> It was a very big help
because it taught me the power

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.690 align:middle line:90%
of our thought to manifest.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.450 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand,
Christian Science basically

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.930 align:middle line:84%
doesn't talk about
angels at all,

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and it never talks
about departed people.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.845 align:middle line:84%
So as a child, when I
would tell my mommy,

00:07:00.845 --> 00:07:02.220 align:middle line:84%
I see all these
people in my room

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.800 align:middle line:84%
and it's not Aunt
Betty or grandma,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.280 align:middle line:84%
this is not anyone I know,
who are these people, mom.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.280 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh, you're
just making this up.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:90%
>> So she said, it's a a lie.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:12.770 align:middle line:90%
It's an error.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>> It's an error.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:13.980 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.310 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.110 align:middle line:90%
It's an error.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.950 align:middle line:90%
She didn't understand.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:90%
Now she's a clairvoyant.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.708 align:middle line:10%
I've helped her to
open her clairvoyance,

00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:22.620 align:middle line:10%
and she feels bad, and I
don't want her to feel guilty.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.380 align:middle line:10%
I think a lot of parents squelch
their child's sixth sense

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.618 align:middle line:10%
unknowingly.

00:07:27.618 --> 00:07:29.160 align:middle line:10%
And that's another
part of my mission

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.470 align:middle line:10%
is to tell parents that this is
something that's very normal,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.380 align:middle line:10%
especially today, I'm
seeing that children

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:36.900 align:middle line:10%
are a lot more psychic
than any generation

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:10%
that we've had previously.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.020 align:middle line:84%
School teachers say that
kids are very different,

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.440 align:middle line:84%
and parents of
young children now

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.040 align:middle line:84%
notice that their children are
especially intuitive, which

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.880 align:middle line:90%
is exciting.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Very.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.230 align:middle line:90%
Very exciting.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.970 align:middle line:84%
So you were how old
when you first saw--

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't remember
not seeing them.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.510 align:middle line:90%
It was a part of my life.

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.110 align:middle line:84%
I had a lot of
contacts with beings

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.770 align:middle line:84%
on the other side where they
would tell me about my mission.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:06.582 align:middle line:84%
I was told basically
very clearly

00:08:06.582 --> 00:08:08.040 align:middle line:84%
when I was a child
that I came here

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.320 align:middle line:90%
to teach about mind and body.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.590 align:middle line:84%
And when I do anything but
that, the doors all slam.

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.220 align:middle line:90%
I can't even make a penny.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So I'm on a very strict,
narrow path with this contract

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:90%
that I obviously signed.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.710 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you tell people
to differentiate between

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:30.210 align:middle line:84%
their guide's voice, the
angel's voice, and their own?

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a
subtle distinction,

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.440 align:middle line:84%
but it's very much like when
you pick up the telephone.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.159 align:middle line:84%
You pretty quickly know if
it's someone familiar to you

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:40.980 align:middle line:84%
or whether it's a stranger
or a telephone solicitor.

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's the same kind
of getting used to

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.970 align:middle line:84%
and adapting to the
characteristics of true divine

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:46.770 align:middle line:90%
guidance.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:10%
Number one, true divine
guidance is repetitive.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:52.710 align:middle line:10%
It'll tell you the same thing
over and over and over again.

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:10%
Where false guidance,
or your imagination,

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:10%
will change its mind
pretty impetuously.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.410 align:middle line:84%
True guidance is
always very centered

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.940 align:middle line:90%
around selfless service.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:84%
It talks about how
everyone's going to win,

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.470 align:middle line:84%
how we can take our natural
passions and interests

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:90%
and use them to help the world.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:14.160 align:middle line:84%
Where false guidance
always is about separation.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.100 align:middle line:84%
It wants to make one person
better than the other.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.400 align:middle line:84%
In other words, you might
get an imagination that says,

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
this will elevate you above
others and make you the hero.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, true guidance
is going to give you

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.730 align:middle line:84%
guidance that will ultimately
help you to have abundance

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.880 align:middle line:84%
and maybe you will get fame
and fortune along with that,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:84%
but true guidance
would never ever

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:37.080 align:middle line:84%
talk about that as
its central topic.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.630 align:middle line:84%
False guidance
also puts us down.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:44.220 align:middle line:84%
It's abusive, it's critical,
and it makes us doubt ourself.

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.955 align:middle line:84%
Where true guidance
is like a motivator.

00:09:46.955 --> 00:09:49.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like the greatest
coach in the world and says,

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.880 align:middle line:90%
you can do it.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.275 align:middle line:84%
It pushes us beyond our
comfort zone very often.

00:09:52.275 --> 00:09:54.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's what
makes people nervous.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.220 align:middle line:84%
When I do an angel
reading on someone,

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.310 align:middle line:84%
the most common comment
I get is, I knew that.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I really felt that all along,
and they needed another person

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.590 align:middle line:90%
to validate it for them.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.850 align:middle line:84%
My hope is that we'll all
learn to give ourselves

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.490 align:middle line:84%
our own validation
and just follow

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.100 align:middle line:90%
our guidance without delay.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you aware of something
around me right now.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.215 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's a lady
with you that I remember

00:10:16.215 --> 00:10:17.850 align:middle line:84%
from the last time
that we talked,

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.730 align:middle line:84%
and she's an elderly woman
who stands behind you.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.490 align:middle line:84%
And she just has a
grandmotherly feel.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Now I remember you said that
you didn't know her very well

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.590 align:middle line:84%
and she stands right
behind you, almost

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:30.690 align:middle line:90%
like I'm here just in case.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:84%
She's not interfering
or getting in your face

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.360 align:middle line:84%
with a lot of advice, but
it's like she holds a net.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.415 align:middle line:84%
If you need this,
honey, I'm here,

00:10:38.415 --> 00:10:40.290 align:middle line:84%
which is a really great
spirit guide to have.

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:42.060 align:middle line:90%
You also have a lot of angels--

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:44.490 align:middle line:84%
angel-angels I call them--
which are not humans.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.790 align:middle line:84%
These are more of the biblical
type of angels with wings.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.280 align:middle line:84%
I notice you Gabriel with
you, which makes sense.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And I don't recall
if had Gabriel last.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.240 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think I did.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.880 align:middle line:90%
Why does that make sense?

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Gabriel is really an
angel who helps those whose

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.260 align:middle line:84%
life purpose involves
communication.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Gabriel's mission is to help
you to trust that you can follow

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.475 align:middle line:90%
your feelings and be safe.

00:11:07.475 --> 00:11:08.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Is there a
difference, Doreen,

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.780 align:middle line:84%
between guides and
angels, and what is it?

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:14.220 align:middle line:84%
The angels, as I call
them angel-angels

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.640 align:middle line:84%
to distinguish them, very
much look like the paintings

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.240 align:middle line:84%
that you see on Valentine's
cards and holiday cards.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.190 align:middle line:84%
They really do have
wings, although I've never

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:84%
seen them flap their wings
or use them for flying.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:84%
What my understanding is is
that the original Renaissance

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:32.760 align:middle line:84%
painters mistook the aura, the
glow, around an angel for wings

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:90%
and painted them that way.

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.060 align:middle line:84%
And now they appear
to us that way,

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.370 align:middle line:84%
almost shape shifting
for our benefit

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.140 align:middle line:84%
so that we can recognize
who the players are.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.080 align:middle line:84%
But they come in
all different sizes.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Archangel Michael, for instance,
is roughly 10 feet tall.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:47.530 align:middle line:90%
He's huge.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's Rafael, who's
a little bit shorter.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.310 align:middle line:84%
He's the archangel having
to do with healers.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:56.970 align:middle line:84%
And Gabriel, who's a female
archangel, by the way.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really?

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:58.740 --> 00:11:59.130 align:middle line:90%
Right.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.710 align:middle line:84%
And so that's kind of neat
because most of the archangels

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:02.790 align:middle line:90%
are male.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.160 align:middle line:84%
And Gabriel is--
how tall are you?

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:90%
5' 8", 5' 9"?

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:84%
Then there's the
little cherubs that

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.280 align:middle line:84%
can help out with things such
as manifesting a soul mate

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.920 align:middle line:90%
relationship.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:17.430 align:middle line:84%
There's specialist angels that
can help us with finances,

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.800 align:middle line:90%
with career, with creativity.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.680 align:middle line:84%
Basically there's like people,
there's angels for just

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.120 align:middle line:90%
about any life area.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Just now when you said how
tall are you, about 5' 8",

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:29.185 align:middle line:84%
was that the angel
answering you?

00:12:29.185 --> 00:12:29.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:29.985 --> 00:12:31.450 align:middle line:90%
We were having a conversation.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:32.610 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.250 align:middle line:84%
>> And is it ongoing
now, the conversation?

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I mean, they
would like it to be.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.460 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I have
to tune them out.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:41.313 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes they
just take charge

00:12:41.313 --> 00:12:42.480 align:middle line:90%
and just tell me what to do.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.780 align:middle line:84%
They've made tremendous shifts
in my lifestyle for the better,

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.495 align:middle line:90%
but I resisted it initially.

00:12:47.495 --> 00:12:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Just thinking
that, I was wondering,

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:90%
do you ever resist them?

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:50.932 align:middle line:90%
Do you ever say no?

00:12:50.932 --> 00:12:53.265 align:middle line:84%
>> There are times when I
say, can I just go out tonight

00:12:53.265 --> 00:12:54.065 align:middle line:90%
and party.

00:12:54.065 --> 00:12:55.200 align:middle line:90%
And no, I can't.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.570 align:middle line:84%
They say there's
no time to waste.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.820 align:middle line:84%
They've got me on a very
strict no caffeine, no alcohol,

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:04.140 align:middle line:84%
no animal products diet
to keep my clairvoyance

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:90%
as big as possible.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.715 align:middle line:84%
Now not anyone
should feel afraid

00:13:07.715 --> 00:13:09.090 align:middle line:84%
that they have to
do those things

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.840 align:middle line:84%
and be that radical
to be clairvoyant.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.670 align:middle line:90%
You don't.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.830 align:middle line:84%
They just want my clairvoyance
to be as maximized as possible.

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.400 align:middle line:84%
And to do that, you really
have to purify your body quite

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.510 align:middle line:90%
a bit.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.310 align:middle line:90%
And they're very concerned.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:22.290 align:middle line:84%
We're going through
some tremendous Earth

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.410 align:middle line:84%
changes right now, and archangel
Michael, who's a powerful--

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.930 align:middle line:84%
probably the most powerful
angel I've ever met--

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.900 align:middle line:84%
is constantly telling
me that this is it.

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.550 align:middle line:90%
We're at the 11th hour.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.940 align:middle line:84%
We've passed the fork in the
road in the Earth's time.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.030 align:middle line:84%
And unfortunately, not enough
people are going to wake up.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And here's what the
angels have been

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to do is get messages
to everybody that it's time

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.930 align:middle line:84%
to wake up and take
care of the Earth

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:90%
and take care of each other.

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.460 align:middle line:84%
But not enough
people are believing

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.660 align:middle line:90%
that their guidance is real.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.930 align:middle line:84%
They're not believing that
they can make a difference.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.910 align:middle line:84%
They've got an ego
issue that says, who me.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.290 align:middle line:90%
I can't help.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.270 align:middle line:90%
And so they're asleep.

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And now the angels have to
work with those who are awake,

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.081 align:middle line:84%
the people who are on
the spiritual path.

00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:11.436 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:11.436 --> 00:14:15.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:19.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Are there angels who
go to people in power?

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:84%
The president, for instance,
has two very large angels

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.730 align:middle line:84%
assigned to him that are
in charge of the country.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.380 align:middle line:84%
They're our angels, and they
work with him to protect us.

00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Now this is very
interesting to me.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.740 align:middle line:84%
>> He's got a lot of
things around him,

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:37.250 align:middle line:84%
and there's a group of us that
work to clear him constantly.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:43.340 align:middle line:10%
>> I wonder if people can hear
angels on a subliminal level.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:46.170 align:middle line:10%
You hear them on a very
clear level, and you say,

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:10%
OK, thanks, Michael.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:90%
I got that.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:51.020 align:middle line:84%
But do people-- and again,
I'm talking about government--

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:54.320 align:middle line:84%
have the ability to hear
and not exactly know

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.278 align:middle line:90%
where it comes from us?

00:14:55.278 --> 00:14:56.078 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:56.078 --> 00:14:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Very much so.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.590 align:middle line:10%
When people are sleeping,
the angels do a lot of work

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:00.390 align:middle line:10%
with them.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:02.310 align:middle line:10%
And so when they wake
up in the morning,

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.840 align:middle line:10%
they often have brilliant
ideas or a determination.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.430 align:middle line:10%
Today, I'm going to
be kind to people.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to do the right thing.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:84%
Unfortunately, that
fades over the hours.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.300 align:middle line:84%
And so the angels
and other guides

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:16.130 align:middle line:84%
are very concerned
that the planet Earth

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:19.790 align:middle line:84%
stay intact and take
very cautious steps

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.620 align:middle line:90%
at this time in our history.

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:25.160 align:middle line:84%
There's nature angels that
are as much God's creation

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.140 align:middle line:90%
as any other type of angel.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.343 align:middle line:84%
I know a lot of people have been
afraid to investigate or get

00:15:30.343 --> 00:15:31.760 align:middle line:84%
involved with these
nature angels.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.710 align:middle line:84%
We call them fairies
or elementals,

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.500 align:middle line:84%
because it's been believed
that that's Wiccan or pagan.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:38.992 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of people who are
working a different path

00:15:38.992 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
don't want to get
involved in that.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.740 align:middle line:84%
But they help the
plants and the flowers

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.020 align:middle line:84%
and the animals and
the Earth, ultimately,

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.330 align:middle line:90%
is their purpose to protect.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.860 align:middle line:84%
>> So what exactly does
an angel look like?

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.030 align:middle line:90%
A godly angel.

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.190 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I understand now
that there are types,

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and I love that you
mentioned the idea of fairies

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.500 align:middle line:84%
being angels because
I've always believed

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle line:90%
they are a type of angel.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:02.880 align:middle line:90%
>> They definitely are.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:04.910 align:middle line:84%
And like I said, there's just
been a prejudice against them.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And I had to cross over that
myself coming from a Christian

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.620 align:middle line:90%
background.

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.700 align:middle line:90%
I had to-- is this OK?

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And all I have to do
is go talk to them.

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:84%
It's one of the reasons why
when we go outside in nature,

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.210 align:middle line:84%
we feel wonderful is because
these little beings are

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.410 align:middle line:90%
covering us like--

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.940 align:middle line:84%
remember Gulliver's
travel when he'd

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:21.353 align:middle line:90%
have the Lilliputians over him?

00:16:21.353 --> 00:16:23.270 align:middle line:84%
It's like that with the
fairies, and they just

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.130 align:middle line:90%
clear us like chimney sweeps.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.350 align:middle line:90%
They're wonderful healers.

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:31.460 align:middle line:84%
But they have butterfly
wings or dragonfly wings.

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And the angels, to
answer your question,

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.450 align:middle line:90%
are opalescent in color.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.410 align:middle line:90%
They're transparent.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.840 align:middle line:84%
They don't have race
or flesh, so you

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.440 align:middle line:84%
don't see a Della Reese or Roma
Downey looking type of angel

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:45.710 align:middle line:84%
because they're
totally without flesh.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.010 align:middle line:84%
The guides are the ones who
have distinct hair color and eye

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:52.670 align:middle line:84%
color and flesh color, and
those are deceased people.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:55.160 align:middle line:90%
Now, angels can incarnate.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:58.160 align:middle line:84%
In Hebrews 13:2,
Paul said, be careful

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.610 align:middle line:84%
when entertaining strangers
because by so doing,

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.710 align:middle line:84%
many have entertained
angels unaware.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.390 align:middle line:84%
Making reference
to the angels can

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.720 align:middle line:84%
take a human form, either
temporarily during a crisis

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.780 align:middle line:84%
or even a life cycle,
as an incarnated angel.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.369 align:middle line:84%
But they're
technically not humans

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:15.480 align:middle line:84%
because they come from
a different realm.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:84%
They have a
different psychology.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.970 align:middle line:90%
I've worked with a few.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:22.880 align:middle line:84%
All these wonderful
angels, all they want to do

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.859 align:middle line:90%
is help us and help the Earth.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:27.950 align:middle line:84%
The trouble is that most of
us either won't believe it

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:31.920 align:middle line:84%
or we are reluctant or we
forget to ask for help.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Once you make a
choice to believe them,

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.050 align:middle line:90%
do you see more of them?

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:36.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:90%
>> And you physically feel--

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.010 align:middle line:90%
Well, there's a couple things.

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:43.370 align:middle line:84%
I think that even hardcore
skeptics wouldn't turn away

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:45.750 align:middle line:84%
help that's offered to
them free of charge.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I tell skeptics,
just mentally talk

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.028 align:middle line:90%
to angels and ask them for help.

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:51.320 align:middle line:90%
Look, God doesn't get offended.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:90%
There's no rules we're breaking.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.680 align:middle line:84%
The angels, we're not
wasting their time

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.013 align:middle line:84%
or pulling them off more
important duty when we ask them

00:17:57.013 --> 00:17:58.820 align:middle line:90%
for help with everyday things.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.417 align:middle line:84%
The angels say the reason
there's outbreaks of violence

00:18:01.417 --> 00:18:03.500 align:middle line:84%
in the world with shootings
in the workplace right

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:84%
now is because the stress
level of the human race

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.700 align:middle line:90%
is at a boiling point.

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And they say, if you'd let us
help you with the so-called

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:84%
trivial parts of your
life-- the commute home,

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.220 align:middle line:84%
the checkbook balancing, the
argument with your spouse--

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.620 align:middle line:84%
if you'd let us get
involved with those things,

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.690 align:middle line:90%
we can reduce the stress level.

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:25.340 align:middle line:84%
>> So you mean, it's not
trivial to say to an angel,

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.890 align:middle line:90%
please send me a parking space.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Parking spaces.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.560 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:32.180 align:middle line:84%
What the angels say-- and this
reminds me of Christian Science

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.830 align:middle line:84%
a little bit-- is
matter doesn't matter.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.980 align:middle line:84%
They say, a hangnail
is the equivalent

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.850 align:middle line:84%
of a seeming terminal illness
because in the balance,

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:90%
it's all an illusion.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:46.400 align:middle line:84%
And all they are here to do is
support us to stay at peace.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.980 align:middle line:84%
That's our purpose
is to be at peace.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:50.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's interesting.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.170 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's them working
out God's will to help us

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:58.100 align:middle line:84%
by getting a great parking space
and getting the green lights

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:02.885 align:middle line:84%
and helping you to get to the
babysitter on time to pick up

00:19:02.885 --> 00:19:04.760 align:middle line:84%
your child so you don't
get charged overtime.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.040 align:middle line:84%
All those things are
important in the angels' eyes.

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:08.960 align:middle line:84%
>> That's very well
defined, Doreen,

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.800 align:middle line:84%
to say that an
angel's job, actually,

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:14.155 align:middle line:90%
is to help us stay at peace.

00:19:14.155 --> 00:19:14.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.627 align:middle line:90%
That's why God created them.

00:19:15.627 --> 00:19:19.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, angel means
messenger of God.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:22.850 align:middle line:84%
They say, think of us as one
with God like God's arms.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.830 align:middle line:84%
And so when you're
talking to an angel,

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:26.510 align:middle line:84%
you're really talking
to the creator,

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.870 align:middle line:84%
an extension of the creator,
given to us as a gift.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:32.610 align:middle line:84%
And why would we
push away a gift?

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:90%
Why not accept good graciously?

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.780 align:middle line:84%
If it helps others when
we're happy and peaceful.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Do animals have angels?

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:41.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:43.670 align:middle line:84%
And they are,
again, the fairies.

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.650 align:middle line:84%
I was once asked by an
interview, do dogs' angels

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:48.180 align:middle line:84%
look like little
dogs with wings.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:48.980 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.990 align:middle line:90%
They look like Tinker Bell.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And the only exception is
that the water-based animals,

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:59.100 align:middle line:84%
like ducks and fish, have
angels that are called sylphs--

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.600 align:middle line:84%
S-Y-L-P-H. And the
sylphs don't have wings.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.420 align:middle line:90%
They're kind of like sprites.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:09.440 align:middle line:84%
They are these kind of
long, water-based angels.

00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:12.380 align:middle line:84%
So when you're working
with your animal,

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:14.990 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
help your animal

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.750 align:middle line:84%
to behave better or to
bond with you by mentally

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:90%
talking to their angels.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:19.760 align:middle line:90%
>> To their angels.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:21.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:23.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to be talking to
an angel when I get home.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.320 align:middle line:90%
Let me tell you.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.290 align:middle line:84%
>> My cat once was
out on the roof,

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:84%
and I couldn't get him
to come back to me.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:31.820 align:middle line:84%
And I talked to his angels
and instantly, he came to me.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.490 align:middle line:84%
The angels are wonderful
intermediaries.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:36.770 align:middle line:84%
I have found-- and this
is after three degrees

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.630 align:middle line:84%
in psychology and
taking a whole semester

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:41.690 align:middle line:84%
studying conflict resolution--
that the greatest method

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.930 align:middle line:84%
to get through any sort
of fight or irritation

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.660 align:middle line:84%
with another person is to
mentally talk to that person's

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.780 align:middle line:84%
guardian angels and ask them
to intervene and to create

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:53.010 align:middle line:90%
peace instead of pain.

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.860 align:middle line:84%
And we see arguments
resolve where

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.710 align:middle line:84%
it's to the point where people
develop a form of amnesia

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.050 align:middle line:84%
and they can't remember
what the argument was about.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.610 align:middle line:90%
>> It's great advice.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.780 align:middle line:90%
>> It works like magic.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And spiritually, if you're
irritated at someone or you

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.780 align:middle line:84%
want to murder
them, it's the same.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:90%
It's all about fear and attack.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:84%
And so the angels want to help
us to have love toward everyone

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and to see other people
through their eyes.

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:84%
The angels are the
president of our fan club.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.310 align:middle line:90%
They see past our surface.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.340 align:middle line:84%
They see past our gender,
our race, our religion,

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.590 align:middle line:84%
and all the mistakes
that we think we've made.

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And what they see within
us is the beating heart

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.720 align:middle line:84%
of the creator, that light,
that eternal goodness

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:90%
that can never be spoiled.

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And the angels want
us to see that.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.240 align:middle line:84%
They said, if we would
see that, it would

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.880 align:middle line:90%
transform the entire world.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what we haven't
talked about over the years

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:45.510 align:middle line:84%
that we've talked
is the playfulness.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:46.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The playful side of
angels, because I think

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.420 align:middle line:84%
there's an image that has angels
as [IMITATING STOIC VOICE]

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.220 align:middle line:90%
somber.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:53.960 align:middle line:90%
Very stoic, yes.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:84%
>> A friend of mine said
today, when you talk to Doreen,

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.480 align:middle line:90%
ask her if angels are playful.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.630 align:middle line:84%
>> They say frolic and
play is the angels' way.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So here's the
human part of this.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.680 align:middle line:10%
It's a little-- seems difficult,
but the angels say, hey,

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.660 align:middle line:10%
it's not a problem--

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.920 align:middle line:10%
is they want us to be on our
path and work our purpose

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.350 align:middle line:10%
and not waste our time.

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But on the other hand, they
want us to get plenty of rest,

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and they want us
to play regularly.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.010 align:middle line:84%
And if we talk to them, they're
like the greatest secretaries

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.960 align:middle line:90%
that will schedule our day.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.455 align:middle line:84%
What we can do is we can ask
the angels to hold our calls.

00:22:27.455 --> 00:22:29.330 align:middle line:84%
If you're getting too
many crazy phone calls,

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:31.940 align:middle line:84%
tell the angels that you want
your calls to be screened

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.773 align:middle line:84%
and only the important
ones to come through.

00:22:33.773 --> 00:22:36.440 align:middle line:84%
And people who would normally
call you at the drop of a hat

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.240 align:middle line:90%
won't call you.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.520 align:middle line:84%
They'll just feel,
well, it's not time.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.010 align:middle line:84%
Even the most insensitive
person will get it.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So you can have the angels
free up your schedule

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.690 align:middle line:84%
so you can have
more time to play.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:49.900 align:middle line:84%
As you know, many people, you
ask him what do you do for fun

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.730 align:middle line:84%
and they'll say, I
kind of remember.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.360 align:middle line:90%
>> That's so true.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.170 align:middle line:90%
So often.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:57.760 align:middle line:84%
>> They don't know
what to do for fun.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.410 align:middle line:90%
They don't have an answer.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.960 align:middle line:84%
And so they delay
fun for the future

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.995 align:middle line:84%
when they lose weight or pay
off their bills or graduate.

00:23:05.995 --> 00:23:08.060 align:middle line:84%
The fun is something
they're going to do someday.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:84%
And the angels say that fun
is a necessity, not a luxury.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.480 align:middle line:84%
You are always just
a joy to talk to you.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:15.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:16.080 align:middle line:90%
So are you.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And here we are,
visions in blue today.

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:20.815 align:middle line:84%
Thank you, Doreen, for
your divine guidance.

00:23:20.815 --> 00:23:21.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Appreciate it very much.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.340 align:middle line:90%
God bless.
