of nature.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
And we're connecting
to the elements that

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:90%
are within us, our own nature.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.030 align:middle line:84%
When that happens, you
push out what you're not.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.970 align:middle line:84%
So all the illusions, all
the rubbish, all the toxins,

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.910 align:middle line:84%
all the emotions that get
in the way, the confusion,

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:90%
is what we release.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we connect to the pure
core of what we really are.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.010 align:middle line:84%
This is how it
improves our health.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we're going to do
Five Element Qigong, which

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.910 align:middle line:84%
is connecting to the five
elements-- fire, water, air,

matter, and consciousness.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.050 align:middle line:84%
It will bring you out of
your head and into your body.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's really about feeling
and just going with the motion.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.370 align:middle line:90%
So copy what I'm doing.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.225 align:middle line:84%
I'll just say things
like-- like this.

00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:84%
And if you need
adjustments, I'll

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.130 align:middle line:84%
come round and give
you adjustments.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.670 align:middle line:84%
But just flow with
me, all right?

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.250 align:middle line:84%
And then from that
point onwards,

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.940 align:middle line:84%
we can enjoy the sunset, enjoy
the elements that are around us.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.793 align:middle line:84%
It was in the warmup and
yeah, where we're tapping

00:04:11.793 --> 00:04:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and we were just waking up
the meridians of the body

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.000 align:middle line:90%
and getting the energy flowing--

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Smile.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.079 align:middle line:90%


00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.004 align:middle line:90%
To the right side and the left.

00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:28.100 align:middle line:84%
--and Nick walked off,
which was I found actually--

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.125 align:middle line:90%
I found that quite rude.

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:32.930 align:middle line:10%
>> It's not for me.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.110 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not here to prove myself
or to get people to jump through

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.910 align:middle line:84%
hoops or to do anything that
they don't particularly want

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.710 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.625 align:middle line:84%
But at least give it a go and
then speak from your experience.

00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:42.750 align:middle line:90%
And he didn't even do that.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.550 align:middle line:90%

a healthy lifestyle back home.

But this being the

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.820 align:middle line:90%
always a surprise in store.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you thinking of
transitioning a little bit

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.330 align:middle line:84%
to a healthier diet
when you go back home?

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.990 align:middle line:84%
>> So we talked about that
a little bit last week,

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.530 align:middle line:84%
about the transition
for the gut flora.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.330 align:middle line:84%
it's important because you're
going from a meat diet to a more

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.660 align:middle line:84%
plant-based diet so
you want that to work.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.250 align:middle line:84%
And you might go to
the bathroom often.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes you might have more
like diarrhea-- not diarrhea,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:90%
but more soft stools.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.870 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.420 align:middle line:84%
You can have constipation
because your gut

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.860 align:middle line:90%
floras are not--

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.180 align:middle line:90%
being selected by your body.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle line:90%
So it's normal.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:84%
You need to go through
that when you transition.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.680 align:middle line:84%
But to help yourself, you
can take the probiotics.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:84%

to three cigarettes
a day, also, Yeah.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.760 align:middle line:84%
I almost had a
nervous breakdown.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.120 align:middle line:84%

My gut instinct is
telling me to go home.

I'm never going to be a
full-on vegan, I don't think.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.110 align:middle line:84%
But I'm definitely
going to change my--

mine and my family's
diet at home.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.430 align:middle line:84%
Still, I can still go

So you had a blood
pressure of 150 over 91.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:24.516 align:middle line:90%
Now you are 121 on 64.

00:08:24.516 --> 00:08:25.316 align:middle line:90%

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of the problems
were from your kidneys.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.510 align:middle line:90%
So you had your--

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.470 align:middle line:84%
your BUN, that's your blood,
urea, nitrogen. So that

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:84%
comes from the breakdown
of protein, basically.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.030 align:middle line:84%
When you're on a high
animal protein diet,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.550 align:middle line:84%
then you break down
a lot of nitrogen. So

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.790 align:middle line:90%
that's in your blood.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.210 align:middle line:84%
So you were-- and your
kidneys filter that.

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, I was telling you that you
had a lot of that in your blood.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.790 align:middle line:84%
So maybe your kidneys
were not working properly,

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.050 align:middle line:90%
so you were high.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.530 align:middle line:90%
And now you're normal.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:18.330 align:middle line:90%

00:14:10.112 --> 00:14:11.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Come on, come on, come on.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Right kick, yup,
right kick, yup.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Hup, hup.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:25.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm dead.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.997 align:middle line:90%
I'm very tired.

00:14:28.997 --> 00:14:29.955 align:middle line:90%
>> That was energizing.

00:14:29.955 --> 00:14:31.830 align:middle line:84%
I haven't lift my leg
that high for ages.

00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:32.340 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.540 align:middle line:84%
It's just getting-- just
remembering the movements

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.630 align:middle line:90%
like the left, right.

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:84%
He's got the bags
under the knee.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:38.580 align:middle line:90%
>> And the language barrier.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:39.550 align:middle line:90%
>> And the language barrier.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:39.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.190 align:middle line:90%
I was like, what?

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:40.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:43.258 align:middle line:84%
But you kind of get the
grasp of what he's saying.

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:44.550 align:middle line:90%
And you just get into the mood.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.950 align:middle line:90%
But it's good.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.270 align:middle line:84%
I really, really
enjoyed it, really good.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.910 align:middle line:84%
>> In the lineup,
they started with us.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:49.110 align:middle line:90%
And we were like, what?

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.500 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, I know.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:50.440 align:middle line:90%
>> What are we doing?

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:50.920 align:middle line:90%
What are we doing?

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.878 align:middle line:90%
Never been here before.

00:14:51.878 --> 00:14:52.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I think the yoga--

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:54.510 align:middle line:84%
the yoga breathing
technique really

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.930 align:middle line:84%
helps you as I'm trying to get
around the ring, knackered.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:84%
Breathing in through my nose,
getting it into my core,

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.080 align:middle line:90%
feel it-- yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:02.880 align:middle line:90%
I tried that one.

00:15:02.880 --> 00:15:04.690 align:middle line:84%
But he looked at me as if it
was going to knock me out.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:05.760 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.410 align:middle line:90%
>> How strong were they, though?

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.260 align:middle line:90%
>> They're powerful.

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.060 align:middle line:90%
They're powerful.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.760 align:middle line:84%
>> After a quick pit stop
to collect the others,

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.260 align:middle line:84%
the gang are being taken out
for some well-earned relaxation

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:90%
and reflection.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.488 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:45.930 align:middle line:90%


00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.310 align:middle line:84%
On one of the highest
points in the island,

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:51.000 align:middle line:84%
the gang are treated to
a view of Koh Phangan

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.805 align:middle line:90%
from a spectacular angle.

00:15:52.805 --> 00:15:55.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Ooh, a jungle.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.580 align:middle line:90%
>> That's amazing, isn't it?

00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.020 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, that's one of
the islands out there?

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:00.820 align:middle line:90%
>> It could be.

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:06.935 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.935 --> 00:16:09.310 align:middle line:84%
>> There's program on recently
where people gave up sugar

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:90%
for two weeks.

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:16.070 align:middle line:84%
We've given up sugar, caffeine,
alcohol, meat dairy, wheat.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:16.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Cigarettes.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, cigarettes,
everything, for a month.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought it was going to be
about getting myself physically

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:24.350 align:middle line:90%
back in shape.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.350 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to lose weight.

00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:28.760 align:middle line:84%
And I wanted to get healthy
and with the food and things.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.400 align:middle line:84%
But in actual fact, it became
secondary and less important

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.020 align:middle line:84%
than actually
slowing my mind down

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.750 align:middle line:90%
and actually refinding myself.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.700 align:middle line:84%
And it sounds like such
a hippy thing to say.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.765 align:middle line:90%
But it's like-- but it's--

00:16:41.765 --> 00:16:44.390 align:middle line:84%
the simplest way of saying it,
it's like I've got my mojo back.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.410 align:middle line:84%
I'm suddenly really excited
about going back, going back

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.810 align:middle line:84%
to work, going out and
going back into the world

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.413 align:middle line:90%
and going back--

00:16:51.413 --> 00:16:52.330 align:middle line:90%
and being a full tilt.

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:53.450 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like a little reboot.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:53.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Refresh--

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.480 align:middle line:84%
>> I wish I'd done
it 10 years ago--

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.930 align:middle line:90%
or 5 years ago, certainly.

00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:57.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.380 align:middle line:84%
>> But it shows that
the mental aspect,

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:01.450 align:middle line:84%
which you weren't
expecting and the fact--

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.040 align:middle line:90%
and being-- finding yourself.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.160 align:middle line:84%
But it also shows us, I
think, that everything is--

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.430 align:middle line:90%
kind of works together.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:13.099 align:middle line:84%
So the food helps with that
aspect as well and the yoga

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.569 align:middle line:84%
and that and the
self-control, that helps.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:19.779 align:middle line:84%
And so it's all these things
that help to better you.

00:17:19.779 --> 00:17:20.579 align:middle line:90%
It's brilliant.

00:17:20.579 --> 00:17:21.579 align:middle line:90%
>> See what you've done?

00:17:21.579 --> 00:17:23.000 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.170 align:middle line:90%


00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:27.285 align:middle line:84%
>> I think yoga and meditation
have some negative connotations.

00:17:27.285 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> See, I never wanted to do
meditation because I thought

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.830 align:middle line:84%
the moment anybody
said meditation,

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.890 align:middle line:90%
it sounded ridiculous.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.600 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's about taking
the first step, though.

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:35.100 align:middle line:84%
Some of those people
you don't think

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:37.765 align:middle line:84%
would come, once they get here
and have a little taste of it,

00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:84%
they enjoy it
because it's almost--

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.400 align:middle line:84%
>> So as you say, then,
when you're back at--

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.940 align:middle line:84%
you're back working
on the cars--

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:45.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> --and you're in a line of
cars waiting for people to come

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.720 align:middle line:84%
out and they go, oh, he's built.
I saw him go to that retreat,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:54.170 align:middle line:84%
doing all that yoga and
all that reiki and stuff,

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.670 align:middle line:90%
a load of old codswallop, in it?

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.443 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, but I tell them--

00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:58.860 align:middle line:84%
I tell them what
it'd done for me.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.860 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.970 align:middle line:84%
That chilled me out, got
me a bit more lively.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
it's done for me.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.550 align:middle line:84%
It makes you-- it does
make you stronger.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:06.830 align:middle line:90%
You feel stronger inside.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.820 align:middle line:90%
Your posture is better.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.960 align:middle line:90%
You're not slouching out.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.580 align:middle line:90%
You kind of-- look at him.

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.790 align:middle line:84%
I've never seen him slouch
any day I've been here.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.270 align:middle line:84%
>> To be fair, you could iron
a shirt on him, couldn't you?

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:90%
He's that upright, is it?

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:23.423 align:middle line:90%


00:18:23.423 --> 00:18:25.090 align:middle line:84%
The other day when
we met the monk and I

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.132 align:middle line:84%
wasn't particularly
impressed by the whole thing,

00:18:27.132 --> 00:18:29.270 align:middle line:84%
did that offend
you as a Buddhist?

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You were talking about
him at a very personal level.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:34.300 align:middle line:84%
And it felt like you'd
missed the point of what

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:35.360 align:middle line:90%
he was trying to say.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.260 align:middle line:84%
His life might not
be a hundred percent

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.450 align:middle line:84%
without problems
or difficulties.

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:42.378 align:middle line:84%
But he was carrying
a message and I

00:18:42.378 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:90%
thought you shot the messenger.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, I did feel a
bit offended by that.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's a
possibility that I did--

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.400 align:middle line:84%
to a certain extent, that
I actually did do that.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.490 align:middle line:84%
It kind of irritated me, the
suggestion that somehow he's

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:55.390 align:middle line:90%
got all the answers.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And we, in the West,
have got it all wrong.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't think
he's got the answers.

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:01.240 align:middle line:84%
But what he's saying is there
is a teaching that's 2,500 years

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.755 align:middle line:84%
old that could be
really helpful.

00:19:02.755 --> 00:19:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but that's
every religion says that.

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.220 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't consider it
an organized religion.

00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.387 align:middle line:90%
And most Buddhists wouldn't.

00:19:07.387 --> 00:19:09.403 align:middle line:84%
But it is considered an
organized religion by--

00:19:09.403 --> 00:19:12.070 align:middle line:84%
>> But what bothered me about it
was the suggestion that somehow

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.290 align:middle line:90%
in the West, because we don't--

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.900 align:middle line:84%
we don't care for each other
and we don't care for ourselves.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.790 align:middle line:84%
And we don't-- we've
kind of lost our way.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think he
was saying that, Nick.

00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:22.120 align:middle line:90%
I think you heard that.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.120 align:middle line:84%
But I don't-- that's
not what I heard.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.462 align:middle line:90%
You came here burnt out.

00:19:25.462 --> 00:19:26.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:26.262 --> 00:19:28.050 align:middle line:90%
>> And you help a lot of people.

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.050 align:middle line:84%
So he was speaking
to you and about you.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:34.310 align:middle line:84%
He wasn't-- I didn't hear him
saying anything that wasn't true

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.720 align:middle line:90%
for you or for me.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah I suppose.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Again, it was very
easy for somebody who--

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.435 align:middle line:90%
again, it's a bit personal.

00:19:41.435 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
But it's the person
rather than the message.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.760 align:middle line:90%
You're quite right.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.962 align:middle line:84%
I was more bothered by the
person than the message.

00:19:45.962 --> 00:19:47.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Organized religion
is one thing,

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.520 align:middle line:84%
and I absolutely agree
with you about that.

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.848 align:middle line:84%
But spirituality
is something else.
