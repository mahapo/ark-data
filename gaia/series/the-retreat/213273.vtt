I spent my birthday on a plane.

I have been to the doctors.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.850 align:middle line:10%
And he gave me a percentage

how much percentage I
will have a heart attack.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.730 align:middle line:84%
And his answer was 18%, which
I thought was brilliant,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.030 align:middle line:90%

So I think all of
that combined, I

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.790 align:middle line:90%
feel as though I'd lost my way.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.950 align:middle line:84%
I think it's-- I found it
difficult to find another job.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.280 align:middle line:90%
So again, I was blaming--

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.180 align:middle line:90%
I feel that I'm blaming myself.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.040 align:middle line:84%
I feel that I'm not
of any significance.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
I think this time, when
I was made redundant,

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I did and I know I shouldn't
have done, I took it personally.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.650 align:middle line:84%
>> I've just turned 47 in
the last couple of weeks.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.620 align:middle line:10%
Hearing about this and
being able to do this is--

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.890 align:middle line:10%
I want to start my new
mission before I hit that 50.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.140 align:middle line:84%
Instead of going, right, I'm
50, it's time to get fit,

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.360 align:middle line:84%
it's time to do this now,
it's time to stop now,

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.940 align:middle line:90%
it's time to stop smoking.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
This is a good time for
me to start doing it now.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.350 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I need to change
some of my lifestyle.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.440 align:middle line:84%
I think I need to change
my perspective on me, being

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.040 align:middle line:84%
a mother and a wife
and holding down a job.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.380 align:middle line:90%
Eventually, something gives.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think this is
part of the reason why

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.910 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to come over
here, I think, probably

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.155 align:middle line:90%
to find Maggie again.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Four.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:14.190 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>> See it?

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.370 align:middle line:90%
It's cool.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.450 align:middle line:90%
Must have a shower in it.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.770 align:middle line:90%
It's definitely chill in there.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.620 align:middle line:84%
I like the bamboo stuff
that's going on, yeah.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.766 align:middle line:10%
>> To their surprise, the vegan
precleanse starts immediately.

00:06:25.766 --> 00:06:27.742 align:middle line:90%
>> Milton, stop eating.

00:06:27.742 --> 00:06:29.860 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's yours.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Is that right?

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
So I look at that and I sort
of think, take more energy

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:90%
eating it than what it's worth.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.570 align:middle line:90%
Really?

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Tastes nice.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Does it taste nice?

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.720 align:middle line:84%
It's all beginning to
dawn on me a little bit.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.520 align:middle line:90%
>> You worried?

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.365 align:middle line:90%
>> You worried?

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:48.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm quite, yeah.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.602 align:middle line:90%
>> No breakfast in the morning?

00:06:49.602 --> 00:06:50.800 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And then when we get back,
we've got a fruit salad.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.908 align:middle line:90%
A bit worried about that, mate.

00:06:54.908 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't worry about it, Jules.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.023 align:middle line:90%
It'll be fine.

00:06:57.023 --> 00:06:57.940 align:middle line:90%
It'll be good for you.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:90%
It'll be character forming.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Never not eaten in my life.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.430 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:05.410 align:middle line:84%
And you get a bit emotional
when you don't, don't you?

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:05.650 align:middle line:90%
>> I do.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I get a bit grumpy.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:07.630 align:middle line:90%
I get a bit emotional.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.850 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you laughing at?

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.770 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, serve you, sausage.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.074 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:07:15.074 --> 00:07:19.810 align:middle line:90%


00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.910 align:middle line:84%
>> As dawn breaks
over Koh Phangan,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.030 align:middle line:84%
some of the gang are already
wondering what they've taken on.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, so here we
are, in Thailand.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Doing a detox.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:36.140 align:middle line:84%
Something I would have never
have gone for off me own back.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.708 align:middle line:84%
But Nick heard about it
and was interested in it

00:07:39.708 --> 00:07:41.000 align:middle line:90%
and said he was going to do it.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.660 align:middle line:84%
And he invited me and Billy to
come along and go through it

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle line:90%
with him.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:47.840 align:middle line:84%
>> What's wrong
with that, is it?

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.345 align:middle line:90%
Wake up to that each morning.

00:07:50.345 --> 00:07:52.220 align:middle line:84%
Although this is actually
the noisiest place.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:90%
It looks like paradise.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:54.140 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it's
the noisiest place

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.460 align:middle line:90%
I've ever stayed on holiday.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Yesterday when we came in, we
got given a program of what we

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.290 align:middle line:90%
got to do.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:90%
And it's quite intense.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:84%
It's quite full on, which I
didn't think it was going to be.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Cats, dogs, mopeds, cars
in the middle of the night.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.240 align:middle line:84%
Boats coming in with
the noisiest engines

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.740 align:middle line:84%
that you've ever
heard in your life.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.782 align:middle line:90%
>> It's quite regimented.

00:08:13.782 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:90%
We got a schedule to go to.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:19.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Animals that are two inches
long producing noises like they

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.360 align:middle line:84%
should be from 13
foot long dragon.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not convinced yet whether
I should have or yet or not.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:29.510 align:middle line:90%
But we'll see.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.122 align:middle line:90%
Only time will tell.

00:08:31.122 --> 00:08:32.066 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:08:32.066 --> 00:08:37.730 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Overnight, the rest
of the gang has arrived.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.090 align:middle line:84%
And they get to know each other
on their way to the hospital.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I stopped working about
two years ago with burnout.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:10%
I got up in the morning one day,
and I was just going, oh God, I

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:55.520 align:middle line:10%
really need some help.

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.270 align:middle line:84%
I'd come here and I
wanted to get healthy.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.770 align:middle line:84%
But I was still
finding myself drawn

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
to eating the unhealthy stuff
and still gaining weight.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I haven't opened it yet.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I know nothing.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.950 align:middle line:90%
>> I am a police officer.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.650 align:middle line:10%
I went to the doctor I
was telling him everything

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.030 align:middle line:10%
that I had on at the moment.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:18.230 align:middle line:10%
And he said that your
bucket of life is full up,

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.460 align:middle line:10%
and we need to
take something out.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.310 align:middle line:84%
And that he thought
I was suffering

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.460 align:middle line:90%
from anxiety and depression.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.940 align:middle line:90%
I was really shocked.

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.350 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't expecting--

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.900 align:middle line:90%
--to be signed off work.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.430 align:middle line:84%
I was there one day
and not the next.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.087 align:middle line:84%
So I think people
wondered why I went

00:09:37.087 --> 00:09:39.170 align:middle line:84%
and what was wrong with
me, because no one at work

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.310 align:middle line:90%
had any idea.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.550 align:middle line:90%
So.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:42.350 align:middle line:90%
I know.

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.640 align:middle line:90%
It's the production work.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.600 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.703 align:middle line:90%
>> It's my video diary.

00:09:45.703 --> 00:09:47.870 align:middle line:10%
>> I feel like I need to
do something drastic that I

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:10%
haven't done before.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.150 align:middle line:10%
I need to be brave and
take a leap of faith

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.430 align:middle line:10%
and just hope that
the experience

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.250 align:middle line:10%
makes me feel a lot better.

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Before being allowed to
undertake the extreme nature

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.300 align:middle line:10%
of the 28-day program, the
gang will be overseen using

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:10%
conventional medicine and
have to pass a full physical.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And any ongoing
medical conditions

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.380 align:middle line:84%
are checked as an
extra precaution.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Eight years ago, I went in
for what's considered a very

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:84%
standard eye surgery
that went horribly wrong.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.780 align:middle line:84%
And I developed a
chronic eye disease

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:84%
from it that has caused me
eight years of severe pain, very

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:38.750 align:middle line:84%
little sleep, and can eventually
lead to me being legally blind.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:44.820 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I'm pretty much there
already with the right eye.

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.460 align:middle line:84%
So I've spent the last eight
years looking for a cure.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:53.670 align:middle line:84%
And I've been to various healers
in various parts of the world

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and worked with different
modalities and different diets.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.300 align:middle line:84%
But I've never had
the good fortune

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.500 align:middle line:84%
to relax into 25 days
of completely being held

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:10.260 align:middle line:84%
by a beautiful team of healers,
fabulous food, wonderful people

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:90%
that are on the same path.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:17.130 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very hopeful
that I'll find healing

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:18.660 align:middle line:90%
through this program.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:22.888 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.888 --> 00:11:24.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Take a seat, please.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:26.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:28.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you tell me this?

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm hoping to find just
some guidance and a purpose.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Your blood pleasure is good.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:36.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Normal.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:10%
>> I actually thought Ron said,
do you want to come on a passion

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.370 align:middle line:10%
retreat?

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:43.040 align:middle line:10%
I didn't hear the
compassion bit before.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.750 align:middle line:90%
I signed up immediately.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.403 align:middle line:90%
OK, thank you.

00:11:46.403 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>> You're welcome.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I am shy.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:90%
It's a challenge for me.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.990 align:middle line:84%
But I thought, if
I'm going to do this,

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:90%
I might as well be all in.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>> The good news is after
this, you can have water.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.250 align:middle line:90%
>> After this?

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.030 align:middle line:90%
I'm so excited.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.150 align:middle line:84%
There are cameras
watching and they--

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.950 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to
worry about that.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.386 align:middle line:90%
And I can have my water.

00:12:05.386 --> 00:12:06.186 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:12:06.186 --> 00:12:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the results of these
tests that will be used to judge

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.860 align:middle line:84%
whether the program
has been a success.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:17.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Better weight.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.902 align:middle line:84%
Better blood pressure
and that height.

00:12:21.902 --> 00:12:23.610 align:middle line:84%
And now they're going
to take some blood.

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:28.048 align:middle line:84%
And then I believe a
chest X-ray afterwards.

00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:29.465 align:middle line:84%
It's all getting
it very exciting.

00:12:29.465 --> 00:12:38.472 align:middle line:90%


00:12:38.472 --> 00:12:40.680 align:middle line:84%
>> It's possible that my
blood pressure might be high

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.472 align:middle line:84%
because I've been
sitting talking to Billy.

00:12:42.472 --> 00:12:45.000 align:middle line:84%
He makes my blood
pressure very high.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.685 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, let me have a check
of your lungs and your heart.

00:12:47.685 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.678 align:middle line:90%
>> It's because I'm fat.

00:12:51.678 --> 00:12:53.590 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.359 align:middle line:90%
>> Keep your pee-pees--

00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:56.276 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, there's not--

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.270 align:middle line:90%
>> --when you're done.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:12:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure that I'm going
to be able to produce any.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Try first.

00:13:03.143 --> 00:13:04.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but I
haven't drunk for--

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:90%


00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.260 align:middle line:90%
--six, seven hours.

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.310 align:middle line:84%
You're not coming to
the toilet with me?

00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.810 align:middle line:90%
Where do you think you're going?

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:14.050 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to go in here, and
I'll see you in a minute.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:19.680 align:middle line:90%


00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.120 align:middle line:90%
Amazingly successful.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.153 align:middle line:90%


00:13:24.153 --> 00:13:25.570 align:middle line:84%
Because you sit
here in a hospital

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.050 align:middle line:84%
so close to all
these health resorts.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a lot of
the stuff that-- it

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.570 align:middle line:84%
seems to me that a
lot of this stuff's

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:31.820 align:middle line:90%
fairly straightforward anyway.

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.210 align:middle line:84%
If you eat less
fat and less meat

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:36.040 align:middle line:84%
and you eat a healthier diet,
you'll be a healthier person.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:36.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.070 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.740 align:middle line:84%
But the other extreme
is we have people

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.860 align:middle line:84%
who believe in taking garlic
instead of antibiotics.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.560 align:middle line:84%
And they come in with a garlic
clove stuck in their ear

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
that they can't
get out, you know.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.268 align:middle line:90%
We've had quite a few of them.

00:13:51.268 --> 00:13:53.152 align:middle line:84%
And it's my
understanding really what

00:13:53.152 --> 00:13:55.110 align:middle line:84%
they're doing wrong is
they're suppose to crush

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.860 align:middle line:84%
the garlic before they
put it in their ear

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.980 align:middle line:90%
before it can be effective.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.020 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.160 align:middle line:84%
That's not my
field of expertise.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:03.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.760 align:middle line:90%
OK, right.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.120 align:middle line:90%
Thanks.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The tests all done, they
head back to the retreat to wait

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.542 align:middle line:90%
for the results.

00:14:13.542 --> 00:14:14.640 align:middle line:90%
[HONKS]

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.320 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they
return, they are

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.290 align:middle line:84%
rushed straight into a meeting
with the camp's mentors.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome to the retreat, guys.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:23.620 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.450 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The inspiration came from
me meeting this guy out here.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.720 align:middle line:10%
And we want you to
experience hopefully

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.130 align:middle line:10%
what we've experienced.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.400 align:middle line:84%
We both came here with different
issues and different problems.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.160 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be here as
mentors and supporters.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you've ever got any
questions, just come and ask us.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.520 align:middle line:90%
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.780 align:middle line:90%
>> So my name's Dominique.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.850 align:middle line:90%
I am the detox manager at Orion.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.010 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're going to
talk about the detox.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:54.170 align:middle line:10%
OK, so what you're going to do,
today you are on precleanse.

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:57.790 align:middle line:84%
So you are eating raw
food to prepare your body,

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:00.130 align:middle line:84%
to alkalize your body,
alkalize your cells.

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:02.500 align:middle line:90%
To have a little bit less pain.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.480 align:middle line:84%
To have less
withdrawal symptoms.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
don't prepare, you

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.990 align:middle line:84%
can have a big
headache and nausea

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:10.387 align:middle line:90%
and all sorts of symptoms.

00:15:10.387 --> 00:15:12.220 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to
prepare you a little bit.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.160 align:middle line:90%
Here, we do yoga.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.270 align:middle line:90%
We go to the sauna.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.880 align:middle line:90%
So we sweat the toxins out.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.600 align:middle line:90%
You do two colema per day.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.260 align:middle line:84%
So you're going to clean your
colon two times per day, which

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.520 align:middle line:84%
is going to make the process
of detoxification go faster.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.630 align:middle line:90%
OK, so don't worry.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:84%
You're going to feel
good at some point.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.512 align:middle line:90%
This is going too far.

00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.090 align:middle line:84%
I want to start with
a little present.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.890 align:middle line:90%
A little liver flush drink.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:38.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.828 align:middle line:90%


00:15:40.828 --> 00:15:43.370 align:middle line:84%
>> We are still giving you the
coconut in the morning to give

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.220 align:middle line:84%
you some sugar, to give you
some electrolytes, minerals.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.080 align:middle line:84%
And we give you a broth
and a tea at night.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.200 align:middle line:84%
And you have all this food,
all these supplements.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.000 align:middle line:84%
The supplements are
the green pills.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.715 align:middle line:84%
This is spirulina, chlorella,
alfalfa, moringa, wheatgrass.

00:15:56.715 --> 00:15:58.340 align:middle line:84%
All the supergreens
you need to nourish

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.390 align:middle line:90%
your cells and your tissues.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:02.270 align:middle line:90%
So this is like your food, OK.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.820 align:middle line:84%
Then the chomper are
the yellow pills.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Those are made with a bunch of
herbs like triphala, turmeric.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.372 align:middle line:90%
You can smell the difference.

00:16:09.372 --> 00:16:11.330 align:middle line:84%
Those are intestinal
cleaners, so they're going

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.710 align:middle line:90%
to clean your intestinal tract.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And before you go to bed,
you take one probiotic,

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.550 align:middle line:84%
which is the white capsule in
the bag with the supplements,

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:18.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.530 align:middle line:84%
The bentonite clay is very good
to get all the bad stuff out,

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.870 align:middle line:84%
but it also takes
your good stuff out,

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.370 align:middle line:90%
like your healthy bacteria.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.085 align:middle line:90%
So we want to replace those.

00:16:27.085 --> 00:16:28.460 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of
the week, we're

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.090 align:middle line:84%
going to do a probiotic
implant the other way around.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:33.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, but I will show
you when it's time.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.520 align:middle line:84%
OK, we do one day
at a time here.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:36.320 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:90%
Exciting, huh?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:90%
But today, we are chilling.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:90%
We're still on precleanse.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have another
nice meal, another liver

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:44.240 align:middle line:90%
flush tonight.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.890 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy the food while you can.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:47.930 align:middle line:84%
And then tomorrow,
the party starts.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.920 align:middle line:84%
>> I have to say, it's the one
part of this whole process that

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.170 align:middle line:84%
I've actually been
really dreading.

00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The starving myself I
can actually deal with.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:01.668 align:middle line:84%
It's doing the colema,
or colonics, or whatever

00:17:01.668 --> 00:17:02.710 align:middle line:90%
you call it back in the--

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not looking
forward to it at all.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:04.855 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:04.855 --> 00:17:06.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Actually, I think I'll panic.

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.750 align:middle line:84%
I've even gone to
the clinic, and we

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.970 align:middle line:84%
could have had it done there
by a professional where--

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:10.940 align:middle line:90%
>> You could do it twice a day.

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:12.550 align:middle line:84%
So you can't go to the
hospital twice a day, can you?

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:84%
>> After the first time, you
might be all right with it.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.650 align:middle line:84%
It might not be the
much panic, because you

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:20.410 align:middle line:84%
think, oh, that weren't as
bad as you thought it was.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.859 align:middle line:84%
But it's knowing that much
water, once you get the cramps

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:27.369 align:middle line:84%
and you've got to stop
and you've got to do this.

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a worry.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.847 align:middle line:84%
>> I just don't fancy having
a tube stuck on me [BLEEPS]..

00:17:33.847 --> 00:17:36.370 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's as simple
as that, really.

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that some of the
participants didn't really know

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:40.960 align:middle line:90%
what they were getting into.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.930 align:middle line:84%
They knew they were coming
for transformation and detox.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.590 align:middle line:84%
But I see the faces when
I explain certain things,

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.230 align:middle line:84%
like the shakes and
the colema, especially.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.300 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of them
are scared right now.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.530 align:middle line:90%


00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:58.710 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.510 align:middle line:90%


00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Similar building techniques.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.340 align:middle line:84%
I've had quite a lot of
indigestion problems at home.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Having cameras down
and off to the doctors

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.930 align:middle line:90%
and off to hospitals.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:10.430 align:middle line:90%
And it's all a dietary thing.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:13.490 align:middle line:84%
So I knew I had
to change my diet.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, I'm Gypsy.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, hello.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:18.143 align:middle line:90%
>> Nice to meet you.

00:18:18.143 --> 00:18:19.880 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's our little
crowd over there.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.338 align:middle line:84%
Interesting from
our point of view,

00:18:21.338 --> 00:18:23.450 align:middle line:84%
because we meet a lot
of people for whom

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.610 align:middle line:90%
this is a natural environment.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.460 align:middle line:90%
That's not us.

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.900 align:middle line:90%
You met Billy, yeah?

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
We think he's in a
constant meditative state.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.590 align:middle line:84%
Because I was asking
someone to explain to me

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.400 align:middle line:90%
what meditation is.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.260 align:middle line:84%
And they were saying that
basically-- because I can't

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:90%
imagine not having thoughts.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:84%
And they said, well, it's not
that you don't have thoughts,

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.770 align:middle line:90%
but you don't hang on to them.

00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:41.150 align:middle line:84%
They come in, and then
you let them flow out.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's
exactly how he works.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.872 align:middle line:84%
The thoughts come in and flow
straight out of his mouth

00:18:45.872 --> 00:18:49.440 align:middle line:84%
without any kind of thought
attachment or filter at all.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.280 align:middle line:84%

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
I associate the idea of
meditation and things

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.188 align:middle line:90%
with that sort of--

00:19:00.188 --> 00:19:01.980 align:middle line:84%
for want of a better
expression, hippiedom,

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.880 align:middle line:84%
which is like dropping
out of society.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So I can't associate actually
using it in everyday--

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.545 align:middle line:90%
That's the key.

00:19:09.545 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
You can use it in everyday
life, because everything

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.470 align:middle line:90%
is a meditation.

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.860 align:middle line:90%
And everything that you do.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.240 align:middle line:90%
You've got Qigong and Tai Chi.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:90%
They're like moving meditations.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:17.820 align:middle line:90%
It's focusing your mind.

00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And you train your mind to
do what you want it to do.

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.810 align:middle line:84%

a lot to learn.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm using zucchini as my pasta.

And I'm using this machine
here to make my pasta.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.775 align:middle line:90%

We have our spaghetti.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.710 align:middle line:84%
And then I can add
some colors in it.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:51.090 align:middle line:90%
A little bit of squash.

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:52.880 align:middle line:90%
A little bit of carrot.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:54.810 align:middle line:84%
A little bit of sprouts
and flower sprout.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:90%
Really good, really yummy.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.720 align:middle line:90%

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:90%
And then some green onions.

>> Even though the first week
of the retreat is all about not

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.810 align:middle line:84%

all about providing your body

solely plant-based menu.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.100 align:middle line:90%

revitalize the body's cells.
