00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.130 align:middle line:90%

take the hand onto the shin,

My first-ever yoga lesson.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%

My shoulders, it all aches.

>> Also, I got a banging
headache at the moment,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.810 align:middle line:90%
which I've had for the last--

well, since last night.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.613 align:middle line:84%
So I had to pull out
some of the poses

00:06:14.613 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:84%
when my head was down because
just the headache gets

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.580 align:middle line:90%
worse and worse and worse.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:90%
But really fascinating.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.740 align:middle line:84%
And also, it was so good
that Billy and Milton

I struggle-- I kept on
forgetting to breathe properly.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.480 align:middle line:90%
And then-- but it's--

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:44.175 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say I've
instantly clicked with it,

00:06:44.175 --> 00:06:45.050 align:middle line:90%
you know what I mean?

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.240 align:middle line:84%

00:06:51.873 --> 00:06:52.790 align:middle line:90%
Thoroughly enjoyed it.

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:53.260 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

In my life?

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:18:55.990 align:middle line:90%
>> My life is--

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>> What is it you'd like to
work through or work with?

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.310 align:middle line:90%
What's been--

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm very, very
lucky in my life.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:84%
I've worked for television
for 35 years, BBC.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.910 align:middle line:10%
Well, I've traveled the world.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.630 align:middle line:90%
I have four daughters.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.600 align:middle line:84%
I've got six grandchildren,
three of each,

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.170 align:middle line:90%
three boys and three girls.

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:84%
So and my life is very,
very happy and very content.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.530 align:middle line:84%
Well, I feel it is, but the
biggest problem I've got

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:34.520 align:middle line:84%
is my daughter, Emma, she
passed away when she was 20.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's 20 years ago.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:44.260 align:middle line:84%
The hardest thing to accept,
that she passed away as

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.970 align:middle line:90%
long as she lived.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:84%
Now, I can talk about Emma,
but I get so like this,

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:58.750 align:middle line:84%
but even more so because 20,
20 keeps playing on my mind.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:04.000 align:middle line:84%
I can never, never
not fill up with tears

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.320 align:middle line:90%
when I talk about Emma.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Shakti is starting to draw
out some of the gang's deeper

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.300 align:middle line:90%
emotional issues.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And the next day's
morning meeting

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.440 align:middle line:90%
is an unusually subdued one.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it a good
day or a bad day?

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:17.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Fine.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:17.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:19.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, I'm still
feeling a bit cloudy.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I heard that there were
some interesting reikis, yeah?

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:23.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.940 align:middle line:90%
Is it a good thing?

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.030 align:middle line:84%
For the rest of us that haven't,
do you recommend it or not?

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>> It's amazing.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.070 align:middle line:90%
You think You're ready?

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:33.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It's something special.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:36.910 align:middle line:84%
For me, it felt very special
what we talked about.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:39.490 align:middle line:84%
I've never been able
to speak about Emma

00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:42.890 align:middle line:84%
to anyone without actually
really breaking down

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.870 align:middle line:90%
in lots and lots of tears.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:49.610 align:middle line:84%
>> When we think of Emma, where
in your body do you feel it?

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Just there in my heart.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:52.580 align:middle line:90%
>> In your heart.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.550 align:middle line:90%
Do you see Emma?

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.350 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, I want you to
look her in the eyes,

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:07.100 align:middle line:84%
and I want you to ask
her what she needs.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.440 align:middle line:90%
Tell me what she says.

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.890 align:middle line:90%
>> She says let go.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I can't let go.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.110 align:middle line:90%
She's my baby.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.480 align:middle line:90%
She's my eldest daughter.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.990 align:middle line:84%
Shakti asked me to lose
Emma and let her go.

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.870 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't.

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.540 align:middle line:90%
And then she said, trust me.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Trust me and trust
Emma, so I did.

00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.290 align:middle line:90%
I put my trust in them.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Emma was telling me,
dad, I'm all right.

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.150 align:middle line:90%
Be happy.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:34.990 align:middle line:90%
I'm all right.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.230 align:middle line:90%
Come on.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.720 align:middle line:90%
Go to the next step.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.660 align:middle line:84%
And I thought, I can't let it
go, but it went through me.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:90%
And she did.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.390 align:middle line:84%
She walked through the
sun and the door shut.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:48.730 align:middle line:84%
But she looked back
and was smiling.

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Feels good?

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.370 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel much better.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:90%
I woke up this morning.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.210 align:middle line:84%
I thought about it,
and I felt happy.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:58.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:02.460 align:middle line:84%
If you've got anything that's
depressing you or getting you

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:04.860 align:middle line:84%
down, just spill it
out and spill it out

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.820 align:middle line:84%
because she's brilliant at
talking to you and the way she

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.050 align:middle line:90%
talks to you.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.290 align:middle line:84%
And you will just go

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.450 align:middle line:90%
with everything in there.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:17.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I found the same experience.

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:20.640 align:middle line:84%
She helps you feel better,
and she's very kind to you

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:24.120 align:middle line:84%
and says some special
things and shows you

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.350 align:middle line:84%
a way of thinking about things
differently and, yeah, in a more

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.900 align:middle line:84%
positive light and
imagine better things.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.700 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.617 align:middle line:90%
>> That's quite right.

00:22:33.617 --> 00:22:36.270 align:middle line:84%
Then so three out of three

00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.107 align:middle line:90%
for people who went to it.

00:22:38.107 --> 00:22:39.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been through
that with Shakti.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:43.320 align:middle line:84%
She made let go of
things, and I see this.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.330 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can't
even imagine what's

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:47.040 align:middle line:90%
going to happen this month.

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.950 align:middle line:90%
Holy, it's amazing.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Next time on "The Retreat."

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.198 align:middle line:90%
>> The detox is over.

>> When he was doing
manipulations or said he was

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.448 align:middle line:84%
doing manipulations, there
appeared to be no movement

00:22:59.448 --> 00:23:00.980 align:middle line:90%
or manipulation going on at all.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.330 align:middle line:84%
It did feel better
after than before.

00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:07.240 align:middle line:84%
>> When I go to bed at night,
within about 30 minutes,

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.878 align:middle line:90%
my eyeballs are glued shut.

00:23:08.878 --> 00:23:10.420 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought at one
stage, literally,

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:14.680 align:middle line:84%
she was massaging
my kidney and liver.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:15.597 align:middle line:90%

Look, you know I'm the least
hippie person in the world,

00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:20.470 align:middle line:84%

I feel kind of stupid

that yoga was that powerful.

>> The last couple of days,
I've actually been feeling like

I'm not doing that
well with yoga.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:31.570 align:middle line:10%

a little bit now.
