The Dome offers the gang the

but you're not allowed to talk.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.750 align:middle line:84%
And I can't see
anything, so I don't even

There's like a-- as
soon as you start

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.000 align:middle line:84%
humming, everyone's getting
into the whole thing.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.705 align:middle line:90%
It's quite a nice vibe in there.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:33.880 align:middle line:90%

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.586 align:middle line:90%

>> Trust me.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.910 align:middle line:90%
Would it be really cold?

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:53.865 align:middle line:90%


00:04:53.865 --> 00:04:55.240 align:middle line:90%

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.780 align:middle line:84%
Very funny as well because
it's like an acoustic inside.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.210 align:middle line:84%
So everybody starts
humming, ohming--

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:08.960 align:middle line:84%
I mean, really, if you
get the right tone,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.640 align:middle line:90%
it really reverberates.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.670 align:middle line:84%
Kind of freaky, but
very refreshing.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.588 align:middle line:84%

I'm not sure how I feel

00:06:33.015 --> 00:06:34.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.270 align:middle line:90%
Nice office.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, it's all
right, isn't it?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.070 align:middle line:84%
>> The honest truth is,
since I've been here,

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.262 align:middle line:84%
I kind of feel like I've refound
my mojo, which I lost a bit.

00:06:42.262 --> 00:06:43.970 align:middle line:84%
I can't describe it
any better than that.

I'm like, I feel

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.860 align:middle line:90%
I'm enjoying fitness work.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.240 align:middle line:84%
I'm enjoying the eating,
which I never thought I would.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm enjoying the yoga.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.552 align:middle line:84%
There's another pain that
I'm working on at the moment.

00:06:53.552 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:84%
There's a muscle right
in on the joint here,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.025 align:middle line:90%
which is unbelievably painful.

00:06:59.025 --> 00:07:02.545 align:middle line:84%
>> I would stay away
from the gym for now.

00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:05.668 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm trying to get that low,
that upper back strength again

00:07:05.668 --> 00:07:07.460 align:middle line:84%
because I've been so
sort of lax like this.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Just from the yoga, just
from opening up your shoulders

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:13.995 align:middle line:84%
and the different postures,
Downward Dog, et cetera,

00:07:13.995 --> 00:07:15.870 align:middle line:84%
I think it's just going
to do that naturally.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Your posture has
definitely changed.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.903 align:middle line:90%
>> It is changing, yes.

00:07:18.903 --> 00:07:21.320 align:middle line:84%
But I also-- like I've lost
the definition of my shoulders

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.280 align:middle line:90%
and things, and--

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.440 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't think so.

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
I think you've probably
done enough weights for now.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.940 align:middle line:84%
I'd consider, anyway, just
trying to open up stretch

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.740 align:middle line:90%
rather than--

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.615 align:middle line:84%

cross trainer and stuff.

00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:33.925 align:middle line:90%

I had sudden hearing loss.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.750 align:middle line:84%
Two days later, we
went away on holiday.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:50.145 align:middle line:90%
It got progressively worse.

00:07:50.145 --> 00:07:52.020 align:middle line:84%
And even by doing that,
I could not clear it.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And then from then, I had
no hearing on that side.

he puts his hand in your mouth

and then all of a sudden
something else is less painful

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:03.960 align:middle line:84%
and certainly up
around this area.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.610 align:middle line:84%
>> And if he can do anything,
even if he can restore just

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.130 align:middle line:90%
a small amount.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.975 align:middle line:90%
But we'll see.

00:08:11.975 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The rest of the gang
are equally confused

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:90%
by Oren's unusual methods.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.010 align:middle line:84%
>> He's a chap that I don't
think one could really describe.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I asked if he could
levitate, and he said yes.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.927 align:middle line:84%
And he also said he
could walk on water.

00:08:23.927 --> 00:08:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So he was very much
enthralled about my vertebra

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.880 align:middle line:84%
that he fixed by inserting
a finger in my ear.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.299 align:middle line:84%
So I mean, I'm not sure
I'm feeling better.

00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:90%
It seems to have worked.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:36.289 align:middle line:84%
Whatever he touched and
moved, the pain moved and then

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:37.110 align:middle line:90%
it disappeared.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:90%
He's great.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.659 align:middle line:90%
>> Breathe in.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:41.074 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:41.074 --> 00:08:42.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:42.980 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, very strange.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.280 align:middle line:84%
Like I say, especially
like-- when you go to a point

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.827 align:middle line:84%
and you would dig his finger in,
it would really hurt, especially

00:08:49.827 --> 00:08:51.410 align:middle line:84%
when he dealt with
that one on my knee

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.210 align:middle line:84%
because I almost
jumped off a table.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.480 align:middle line:84%
But then he goes back to it
after he's done his thing

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.695 align:middle line:90%
and it's just gone.

00:08:57.695 --> 00:09:00.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, at first of all,
I was very apprehensive

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.330 align:middle line:84%
because I've heard what other
people have been through.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
It sometimes really,
really hurts.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:84%
That's where I felt
a bit tense sometimes

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.870 align:middle line:90%
when Oren was trying things.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But when I learned to relax
with him and trust him,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.295 align:middle line:90%
I found it really, really good.

00:09:18.295 --> 00:09:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That was an experience, man.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.700 align:middle line:84%
I thought maybe it was
pressing on pressure points

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.670 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:28.550 align:middle line:84%
But actual pain and tension
at this time is gone.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.570 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:90%
What can I say?

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.537 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you've got to
give everything a try once.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:34.540 align:middle line:90%
Meh, who knows.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.215 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:09:37.215 --> 00:09:44.370 align:middle line:90%


00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:48.273 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm still not sure I'm
feeling anything at all, really.

00:09:48.273 --> 00:09:49.440 align:middle line:90%
It's very difficult to tell.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.090 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Over the next few days,
Luke's yoga therapy starts

00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.020 align:middle line:84%
in earnest with tailored
one-on-one sessions

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.880 align:middle line:90%
for their specific problems.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.307 align:middle line:84%
>> My belief is if you go
back into that night shift,

00:10:05.307 --> 00:10:06.890 align:middle line:84%
I think it's going
to be hard for you.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the program, what
I've been at here has been quite

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:84%
hectic, but I've gone
straight into it,

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.720 align:middle line:90%
and I'm really enjoying it.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.080 align:middle line:84%
What I came here to do was
get, I don't think it's

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.830 align:middle line:84%
a cliche, but the mind, body
and soul kind of balance.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:23.710 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, I'm feeling
it every day, mate.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.510 align:middle line:90%
Every day.

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:25.310 align:middle line:90%
And look at this.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.040 align:middle line:90%


00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.920 align:middle line:90%
What a place to do it in.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.720 align:middle line:90%
So, yeah.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:37.220 align:middle line:90%


00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>> After their previous
session, Maggie meets with Oren

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.215 align:middle line:84%
for a catch up and has
some incredible news.

00:10:44.215 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Maggie.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you felt
after the last treatment?

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:49.120 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.695 align:middle line:90%
How did you feel?

00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:54.790 align:middle line:84%
>> The following day, quite sore
in places because I know you had

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.550 align:middle line:84%
to do quite a lot of
movement, et cetera.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:02.740 align:middle line:84%
I didn't notice it at first,
but I think over the last week

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:07.450 align:middle line:84%
or so, the perception is--
the hearing on this side,

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:09.620 align:middle line:90%
it's not monumentally better.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:14.840 align:middle line:84%
But I think I seem to be
able to hear a little better.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:90%
But it's one of those things.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:22.840 align:middle line:84%
It sounds a lot clearer both
with my hearing aid in and also

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.420 align:middle line:90%
without.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:27.260 align:middle line:90%
>> I will check it also.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:28.540 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, good.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.505 align:middle line:90%
>> So let's start.

00:11:29.505 --> 00:11:32.360 align:middle line:90%
>> OK

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Meanwhile, on the
other side of the camp,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:40.285 align:middle line:84%
Kathy is on her way to
Shakti to try out some Reiki.

00:11:40.285 --> 00:11:41.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:42.382 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:11:42.382 --> 00:11:44.050 align:middle line:90%
>> So how are you doing?

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, I'm fine.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.635 align:middle line:84%
On and off, emotional in
the evenings and stuff.

00:11:49.635 --> 00:11:52.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:55.470 align:middle line:84%
But I worry that I'm
going to leave here

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
still with all the
negative things inside me

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.760 align:middle line:84%
and then I don't know
what to do when I'm back.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.760 align:middle line:84%
>> To start off with, there was
a lot of things that didn't make

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.320 align:middle line:90%
sense for her.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:84%
But now, there's a synchronicity
that's starting to develop.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.750 align:middle line:84%
>> So as you inhaling
light into this area,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:18.410 align:middle line:84%
you're also inhaling
love into this area.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:20.440 align:middle line:84%
>> She's bringing all
her energy back to her.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're clearing out the system
of all the stuff that she didn't

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle line:84%
need that wasn't supporting her
of really old, putrid energy,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.166 align:middle line:90%
feelings, emotions.

00:12:31.166 --> 00:12:35.122 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.122 --> 00:12:40.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Reiki originated in Japan
and is said to improve the flow

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:90%
of the body's life energy.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.510 align:middle line:84%
This natural healing may help to
alleviate anxiety, depression,

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:49.105 align:middle line:90%
stress, and fatigue.

00:12:49.105 --> 00:12:51.840 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Good one.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.100 align:middle line:90%
>> That was a weird one.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.225 align:middle line:84%
It was an easy one,
though, wasn't it?

00:12:58.225 --> 00:12:59.583 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:59.583 --> 00:13:03.034 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:03.034 --> 00:13:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you feel?

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.535 align:middle line:90%
Weird, strange, I think.

00:13:07.535 --> 00:13:11.031 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.031 --> 00:13:11.960 align:middle line:90%
Strange.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:15.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes this kind of stuff
takes a little while to sink in.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the processing
time that people need,

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.300 align:middle line:84%
which is the space
between the sessions

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.520 align:middle line:84%
to just get on with
your life a little bit.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:23.940 align:middle line:90%
Then you can come back to it.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:29.320 align:middle line:10%
>> I see a lot of people being
quite emotional here, also,

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.120 align:middle line:10%
the girls.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.880 align:middle line:10%
And I'm worried that I'm
not being as emotional

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.050 align:middle line:10%
or crying all the
time or lots of time.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.562 align:middle line:10%
I suppose, hopefully,
my journey is maybe

00:13:41.562 --> 00:13:43.645 align:middle line:10%
a bit different to theirs
and I don't need to cry.

00:13:43.645 --> 00:13:46.938 align:middle line:90%


00:13:46.938 --> 00:13:50.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Kathy, feeling frustrated
by her own journey,

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.960 align:middle line:90%
takes solace in Milton's.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.325 align:middle line:84%
And a nice sunset will
always lift your spirits.

00:13:56.325 --> 00:14:05.400 align:middle line:90%


00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Despite Luke's request that
Nick slows down and lets

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.670 align:middle line:84%
the retreats course,
develop his fitness,

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.870 align:middle line:90%
Nick continues to hit the gym.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Other members of the gang
are also really starting

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.875 align:middle line:84%
to push themselves physically
as their energy levels increase.

00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:25.048 align:middle line:90%


00:14:25.048 --> 00:14:25.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:28.190 align:middle line:84%
One of the interesting things
about being on this trip

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:32.440 align:middle line:84%
is that it's kind of reawoken my
interest in keeping fit, which

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.820 align:middle line:84%
had disappeared for the
last three or four years.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.230 align:middle line:84%
So on top of the
yoga and the canoeing

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.170 align:middle line:84%
and all the various other
activities and the mountain

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.880 align:middle line:84%
treks we're doing, I decided
to get into the gym once a day

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.880 align:middle line:84%
and see if I can do an
hour on the cross trainer

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and a few weights and
get myself back in shape.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.720 align:middle line:84%
And it's working at
an amazing speed.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So it's kind of cool although
hard work in this heat.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:00.460 align:middle line:84%
>> At a point when the healers
were like the gang to be slowing

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:84%
down, changing their behaviors
and developing new strategies,

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.960 align:middle line:84%
Shakti and Luke are concerned
that they are falling back

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.530 align:middle line:90%
into old patterns.

00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:12.385 align:middle line:84%
They call the gang together
to discuss their worries.

00:15:12.385 --> 00:15:13.807 align:middle line:90%
>> So hi, guys.

00:15:13.807 --> 00:15:15.640 align:middle line:84%
Shakti and I thought
it would be nice for us

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:17.440 align:middle line:84%
all to have a bit
of a get together,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.085 align:middle line:84%
catch up and review
some things so far.

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:22.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Now's a really good time for
you to talk about how are you

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.510 align:middle line:84%
feeling about what
we're delivering?

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.430 align:middle line:84%
And is there anything
that you'd like

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.430 align:middle line:84%
to see changed in
a productive way?

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And is there anything
that you'd like

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.195 align:middle line:84%
to see added or just anything
that you'd like to share?

00:15:37.195 --> 00:15:40.770 align:middle line:84%
>> I think people are
identifying what sort of suits

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:41.570 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to spend
potentially a bit more time

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:49.885 align:middle line:90%
on the Reiki side and qigong.

00:15:49.885 --> 00:15:50.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Qigong, yeah.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> A bit more in the qigong.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.570 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit more time
to be able to do that

00:15:55.570 --> 00:16:00.310 align:middle line:84%
would be good because that's
what seems to be suiting me.

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:04.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel that it might be
me just in the program sense,

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.050 align:middle line:84%
but it feels like it's slowed
down for me in the last few

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:90%
days.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Just like one thing and
that's it for the whole day.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.070 align:middle line:90%
Or I don't know.

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:14.695 align:middle line:84%
It felt like it was a bit more
full on before and now it's just

00:16:14.695 --> 00:16:17.150 align:middle line:84%
like there's-- it's just gone
and just stopped suddenly.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm amazed at what
people have been doing--

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:84%
excuse me-- physically
in terms of exercise

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%
because I've just not had
that kind of energy at all.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.242 align:middle line:84%
And no incentive, no
motivation for that.

00:16:30.242 --> 00:16:31.700 align:middle line:84%
I really enjoyed
the yoga because I

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:36.610 align:middle line:84%
think that's been the
exercise part for me.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.720 align:middle line:84%
The Sun Salutations and
getting the body moving.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.630 align:middle line:84%
But other than
that, I'm exhausted.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.430 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Still, I'm sleeping brilliantly,
better than I have in years,

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:48.750 align:middle line:90%
actually.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.262 align:middle line:90%
But I still feel very tired.

00:16:51.262 --> 00:16:53.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, with
regards to the yoga,

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:55.880 align:middle line:84%
we could make it a little
bit more intense physically

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.630 align:middle line:84%
in the morning, if that's what
you guys are feeling because--

00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.430 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:00.930 align:middle line:84%
I think we need
something different.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:04.380 align:middle line:84%
>> So long as you're not going
back into your old patterns.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.260 align:middle line:90%
And I know there's a lot of--

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.750 align:middle line:84%
we exercise because we feel
good, because we've done it

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.672 align:middle line:90%
and that's what we do.

00:17:09.672 --> 00:17:11.839 align:middle line:84%
And we always go back to
it, and we get stressed out

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:12.639 align:middle line:90%
and we exercise.

00:17:12.639 --> 00:17:14.056 align:middle line:84%
And we have lots
of energy, and we

00:17:14.056 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
don't know what to do with
it so we exercise some more.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.869 align:middle line:90%
And really, does it really help?

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.488 align:middle line:84%
Does it stop you
from being stressed?

00:17:19.488 --> 00:17:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Does it stop your life--
has it changed your life

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:22.980 align:middle line:90%
in any way, shape, or form?

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:26.210 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe it's just changed
your size and the way

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:28.610 align:middle line:90%
that you feel about your body?

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:30.950 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the day, if
you try something different,

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.900 align:middle line:84%
this is what we're
trying to get across.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:36.933 align:middle line:84%
It's great to have all of
those things in your life

00:17:36.933 --> 00:17:39.350 align:middle line:84%
and exercise and do all the
things that you would normally

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.810 align:middle line:84%
do so that you can have
an experience of how

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.610 align:middle line:84%
your life might be if you
tried something different.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:46.758 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
change can happen

00:17:46.758 --> 00:17:48.800 align:middle line:84%
because if you continue
to do the same stuff over

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.260 align:middle line:84%
and over again and
nothing's really changed,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:90%
something's not working.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.640 align:middle line:10%
So try something new,
try something different.

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.560 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello.

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.510 align:middle line:10%
It's me again, obviously,
because I've got this camera,

00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:07.120 align:middle line:10%
so it is only going to be me.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:11.440 align:middle line:10%
But let's just have
a quick rundown.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:10%
I cried last night.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.500 align:middle line:10%
Woke up crying a couple
of times last night

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:24.040 align:middle line:10%
and woke up this morning with
tears in my eyes and cried

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.650 align:middle line:10%
a bit more, which is
quite weird for me

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:30.765 align:middle line:10%
because I'm not really
an emotional person.

00:18:30.765 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:84%
>> When Kathy came
into the first session,

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:38.530 align:middle line:84%
there was a lot of stuff that
she hadn't got even started

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.110 align:middle line:90%
to get close to within herself.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.100 align:middle line:84%
So we started to
work through that.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:45.364 align:middle line:90%
And I think it was--

00:18:45.364 --> 00:18:49.765 align:middle line:84%
that was probably the bombshell
of the session, the first one.

00:18:49.765 --> 00:18:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I've seen psychologists and
different kind of people back

00:18:53.380 --> 00:19:02.020 align:middle line:84%
at home, and I haven't got to
that emotional state before with

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.895 align:middle line:90%
any of them that Reiki really--

00:19:03.895 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if it was the
Reiki or the teacher that

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:08.930 align:middle line:90%
made it happen.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.260 align:middle line:84%
But it was brilliant
and I'm starting

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:17.200 align:middle line:84%
to feel a bit lighter and just
like I can now focus and deal

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.860 align:middle line:90%
with what needs to happen

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Next in line for some Reiki
with Shakti is an even tougher

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.440 align:middle line:90%
nut to crack.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you today?

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:29.926 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm all right.

00:19:29.926 --> 00:19:31.800 align:middle line:90%
>> My feet towards the door.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, please.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.935 align:middle line:90%
>> Bad energy out the door.

00:19:33.935 --> 00:19:35.075 align:middle line:90%
>> Bad energy out the door.

00:19:35.075 --> 00:19:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>> See, I remembered.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, you need to
just move over a little bit.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:38.670 align:middle line:90%
You can sit up.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.350 align:middle line:90%
Sit up a little bit if you want.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:44.995 align:middle line:90%
Just tell me, how are you doing.

00:19:44.995 --> 00:19:45.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:19:45.795 --> 00:19:48.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.496 align:middle line:84%
I just had a very, very
strange experience.

00:19:52.496 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:90%


00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:57.240 align:middle line:90%
Not a spiritual person.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.160 align:middle line:90%
I didn't think I was.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.520 align:middle line:84%
I just had my third
session of Reiki.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.660 align:middle line:90%


00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:07.460 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.960 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to explain it.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.160 align:middle line:90%
It was-- something happened.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.650 align:middle line:84%
And I've been repressing
a few things, mainly

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.230 align:middle line:84%
from my daughter's
illness and stuff.

00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:23.530 align:middle line:84%
But I just had this
moment where I--

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:32.680 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I just felt a
light, a repressed light

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.890 align:middle line:90%
literally come up through me.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.786 align:middle line:84%
And it was-- it's
as bizarre as--

00:20:39.786 --> 00:20:43.600 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:49.030 align:middle line:84%
The lady that done
the Reiki, I started--

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.470 align:middle line:84%
she said, just let
it-- how do you feel?

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:52.937 align:middle line:90%
I said, I feel like laughing.

00:20:52.937 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:90%
And she said, we'll laugh.

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:55.360 align:middle line:90%
So I laughed.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:90%
She started laughing.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.970 align:middle line:84%
I had tears running down my
face and we were both laughing

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.460 align:middle line:90%
for like 10 minutes solid.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.293 align:middle line:90%
It was such a bizarre thing.

00:21:06.293 --> 00:21:08.335 align:middle line:84%
I never thought something
like that could happen.

00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:16.817 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:25.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Even Julian is having a hard
time denying his experiences

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:10%
while the rest of the gang are
getting more and more out of it

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.790 align:middle line:10%
and their relationships are
deepening in surprising ways.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.726 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.726 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I had this almost horrible
realization because I kind of--

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.790 align:middle line:84%
had found it funny that you had
like come over with your boat

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.410 align:middle line:84%
and then you did the yoga and
then straight off to the gym,

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:49.538 align:middle line:90%
like lunch, gym.

00:21:49.538 --> 00:21:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And at one point I was
kind of giggling because I

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.550 align:middle line:90%
was like, that's funny.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.530 align:middle line:84%
But then I just
had this epiphany.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:21:58.960 align:middle line:84%
I kind of just
felt like I'd let--

00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.303 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, I'd let you
down because I wasn't--

00:22:02.303 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:84%
well, yeah, maybe I wasn't
strong enough to be like, look,

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.690 align:middle line:90%
I'm worried about you.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:06.405 align:middle line:90%
Please, just--

00:22:06.405 --> 00:22:07.205 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:22:07.205 --> 00:22:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But look, it's very nice
of you, but the two things.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:10.660 align:middle line:84%
One, you can lead
a horse to water,

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.570 align:middle line:90%
but you can't make it drink.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:13.850 align:middle line:84%
So you can show me all the
techniques in the world.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.550 align:middle line:84%
If I don't take it
on myself, that's

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.030 align:middle line:90%
my responsibility, not yours.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.988 align:middle line:84%
And for the last two
years, my physical fitness

00:22:18.988 --> 00:22:20.680 align:middle line:90%
hasn't been in a good place.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And that has made
me mentally unhappy.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And it's made me not
so good at my job.

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.432 align:middle line:84%
Now that I'm mentally
in a good place,

00:22:28.432 --> 00:22:29.890 align:middle line:84%
I'm working on the
physical fitness

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.403 align:middle line:84%
and I'm feeling more energized
with both sides of things.

00:22:32.403 --> 00:22:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think I'll
be able to handle

00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.480 align:middle line:84%
my job and any difficulties
that come my way a lot better.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.397 align:middle line:84%
And with the extra tools
that you're giving me

00:22:38.397 --> 00:22:43.580 align:middle line:84%
in terms of heart breathing,
yogic breathing in the morning,

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.710 align:middle line:84%
and the sun salutations,
which I think

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll continue in all
weathers back home.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.895 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:22:50.895 --> 00:22:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Next time on The Retreat.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:56.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Suddenly found myself
going outside and going down

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.880 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the
bottom of my feet.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.900 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, what
the hell's going on?

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.470 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the bottom
of my feet and freaked out.
