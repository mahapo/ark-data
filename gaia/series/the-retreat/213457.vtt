>> What I want to do today is I
want to show you things that you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.380 align:middle line:84%
have been eating or drinking
while you've been here for now

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.950 align:middle line:90%
three weeks, almost a month.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.150 align:middle line:84%
It's things that you can
make at home to be healthier.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:84%
Basically, you want
to alkalize your body

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.770 align:middle line:84%
so that you create a
good environment so

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.200 align:middle line:84%
that the bacteria,
viruses, don't thrive

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.570 align:middle line:90%
and don't party inside of you.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:05.930 align:middle line:90%
So here I have almonds.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.542 align:middle line:84%
I use raw almonds and I
have soaked them overnight.

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:11.000 align:middle line:84%
You have probably heard many
times, don't eat too many nuts

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.610 align:middle line:90%
because it's bad for digestion.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.290 align:middle line:84%
It's because we eat unsoaked
nuts and grains and seeds

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.310 align:middle line:90%
since we are children.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So if you soak them, it's
better for digestion.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.550 align:middle line:84%
When you buy a
Vitamix or a blender,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.330 align:middle line:84%
usually it will
come with a nut bag.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have that,
you can buy something

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.860 align:middle line:90%
with a small thread of cotton.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.065 align:middle line:84%
You can use a
shirt, clean shirt.

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:31.930 align:middle line:90%
That will do.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.140 align:middle line:90%
You just want a small thread.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.985 align:middle line:84%
You put it like
this in your bowl.

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:37.050 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what the
nut bag was for.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.497 align:middle line:90%
How embarrassed am I.

00:03:38.497 --> 00:03:39.855 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:39.855 --> 00:03:41.335 align:middle line:90%
>> What'd you do with it?

00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:42.795 align:middle line:90%
>> I was like--

00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:45.180 align:middle line:90%
>> You have rich humor.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.200 align:middle line:90%
That is rich.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.880 align:middle line:90%
And then you pour.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.000 align:middle line:90%
OK, very simple.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.740 align:middle line:90%
Be careful.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.875 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing that's from one.

00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:55.095 align:middle line:90%
>> Voila.

00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Freaking nut.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you bring the
corners slowly so you don't drop

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.950 align:middle line:90%
anything.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.170 align:middle line:90%
And then you milk your cow.

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.495 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you know why milking
stalls only got three legs?

00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:08.295 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:04:08.295 --> 00:04:11.325 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the
cows got the udder.

00:04:11.325 --> 00:04:14.045 align:middle line:84%
>> That was not
rich, but it was OK.

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>> But he's back.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.460 align:middle line:90%
>> He's back.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Bill is back.

00:04:19.535 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%
>> So with some
of the milk bags,

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.300 align:middle line:90%
they have a little tie string.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.350 align:middle line:84%
What I do, because it's my
chore and I don't really

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.690 align:middle line:84%
like doing it, is I just
tie it on to the cupboard

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and let it drip into the bowl.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.300 align:middle line:84%
So then you don't
have to squeeze it.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.960 align:middle line:90%
You can go and do other chores.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Other chores?

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Other chores.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:90%
>> What do you do?

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.830 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.730 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to make
cashew cheese spread.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.530 align:middle line:90%
Salt.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> So, of course,
it's not cheese.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.250 align:middle line:90%
It's cashew cheese.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Better.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.710 align:middle line:84%
>> This mixture, I use
it as a mayonnaise.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:90%
>> No, thanks.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:90%
>> That's pretty good.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Like a cheese roll
kind of thing going on.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Dried fruit, but
dates are really good.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.328 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, we did something.

00:05:04.328 --> 00:05:07.782 align:middle line:90%


00:05:07.782 --> 00:05:08.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that looks good.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>> And this is
raspberry and chia.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So I just soak my chia in
the blended raspberry puree,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.480 align:middle line:90%
and that's it.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
This one is pecan and
cinnamon ice cream.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And this one is
chocolate ice cream.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And they are both made
from coconut milk.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Very nice.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Very nice.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.170 align:middle line:84%
>> That's the first time
in this entire trip that--

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.150 align:middle line:84%
going to a Michelin
star restaurant

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.588 align:middle line:90%
to have a chocolate cheesecake.

00:05:36.588 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I'd rather have that and
the chocolate cheesecake

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.712 align:middle line:90%
and that with the fruit in it.

00:05:40.712 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle line:84%
I would rather have than a
pudding in a Michelin star

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:90%
restaurant as well.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.000 align:middle line:84%
That's the first time I've
been properly blown away.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of you guys have eaten
the Caesar salad, I heard.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.170 align:middle line:90%
And you liked the dressing.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.920 align:middle line:84%
>> So I made this sauce
with, again, cashews.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.720 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's always better
to soak your nuts.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.230 align:middle line:90%
I explained to you.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.492 align:middle line:90%
>> Sorry.

00:06:01.492 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, my god.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.455 align:middle line:90%
>> You should say the cashews.

00:06:06.455 --> 00:06:10.378 align:middle line:84%
>> Never thought veganism
could be so much fun.

00:06:10.378 --> 00:06:12.838 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:16.780 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The goal of the retreat is
to change the individual through

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.240 align:middle line:84%
nutritional, physical, and
mental training to become calm

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.160 align:middle line:84%
and in control of the
mind, body, and spirit.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And finally, it seems to
be working, even for Nick.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Physically, I'm
a lot healthier.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.828 align:middle line:90%
Mentally, I'm calmer.

00:06:41.828 --> 00:06:44.370 align:middle line:84%
And in terms of priorities, I
think I've kind of learnt where

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:47.600 align:middle line:84%
my priorities are rather
than thinking that work is

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.400 align:middle line:90%
everything.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:57.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:01.116 align:middle line:84%
>> The gang have arrived to
take up Olarn on his walking

00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:01.916 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:07:01.916 --> 00:07:04.980 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:84%
One of the ancient world's
oldest meditation techniques,

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.030 align:middle line:84%
the walking practice is
an observation-based,

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.560 align:middle line:84%
self-exploratory journey, trying
to achieve a balanced mind.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.130 align:middle line:10%
>> In life, normally, we
think now we carry our age,

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.740 align:middle line:10%
but we don't have any age.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.425 align:middle line:10%
But the mind from
people keeping memory

00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:29.890 align:middle line:10%
for long, long time since
you're a baby until now.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:35.500 align:middle line:10%
And this is very important to
understand that time is no time.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.580 align:middle line:10%
Today, we're going to
listen to ourselves.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:44.820 align:middle line:10%
Listen, listen,
and just be aware.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.000 align:middle line:10%
Very, very simple for everyone.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.620 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:10%
Just relax.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:54.540 align:middle line:10%
Keep your mind by your
breathing and by your body.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.800 align:middle line:10%
Keep your feel.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.880 align:middle line:10%
You feel your mind and
you feel your body.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.600 align:middle line:10%
You feel your
breathing and relax.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:10%
Very, very relaxing.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.070 align:middle line:10%
This time is a time of relaxing.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:10%
Walk as comfortably as
you can, not too fast.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.130 align:middle line:90%
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.000 align:middle line:90%
Go not too fast.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.250 align:middle line:90%
You can breathe in easy.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Because too fast, you feel
not comfortable to breathe.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.050 align:middle line:10%
Enjoy.

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.850 align:middle line:10%
You are a temple.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:19.725 align:middle line:10%
You make your temple.

00:08:19.725 --> 00:08:25.350 align:middle line:90%


00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I developed a lot of
different types of walk

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.070 align:middle line:84%
throughout my
three-hour journey.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.830 align:middle line:90%
I found it quite hard, actually.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.049 align:middle line:84%
>> That's hard, especially
walking on this concrete.

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.480 align:middle line:84%
And we've been out already
this morning as well.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of taken its toll.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:44.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I found it really difficult
to keep bringing my--

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.600 align:middle line:84%
because a noise and your
mind would start going.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.600 align:middle line:84%
>> And using the
zone all the time.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Then I was conscious.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.980 align:middle line:90%
I could see people's feet.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:55.563 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so weird
because this is slow.

00:08:55.563 --> 00:08:56.363 align:middle line:90%
>> Slow.

00:08:56.363 --> 00:08:57.620 align:middle line:90%
That's the hardest thing.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:08:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, kind of controlled.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:59.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.640 align:middle line:84%
>> And you don't think
that's going to be tiring.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.273 align:middle line:90%
>> But it really is.

00:09:03.273 --> 00:09:04.073 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:04.073 --> 00:09:05.450 align:middle line:90%
I could walk for miles now.

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.760 align:middle line:84%
I can walk for five
hours at my own pace.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:84%
But to walk this slow
in this confined space--

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.580 align:middle line:84%
this control, it does
things to your mind.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:13.455 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:09:13.455 --> 00:09:18.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I got into a walking zone
where I thought I was walking

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.550 align:middle line:84%
quite quickly, but I was
obviously walking slower

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.670 align:middle line:84%
because people
were overtaking me.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.530 align:middle line:90%
Even you were overtaking me.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.790 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't believe it.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>> He actually came up to me
and said, slow down, go slowly,

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:90%
and just think of your steps.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.390 align:middle line:84%
And when I did do that, it
felt like I was floating.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.480 align:middle line:90%
And time just kind of just went.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.595 align:middle line:84%
And then bang,
three hours, done.

00:09:44.595 --> 00:09:49.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The gang arrived back
to find Nick packing.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I've had a phone call
from home and with an illness

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.520 align:middle line:84%
in the family, which is
obviously a bit of a worry.

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:07.630 align:middle line:84%
The net result is that the
person in the family is OK.

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:12.302 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.302 --> 00:10:14.000 align:middle line:90%
But I feel I ought to be there.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.333 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting because
the point of me coming here

00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:17.712 align:middle line:90%
was to try and work out.

00:10:17.712 --> 00:10:18.920 align:middle line:90%
Well, to get well, obviously.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.810 align:middle line:84%
But also in my head,
to slow my head down,

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.430 align:middle line:84%
to be able to slow my head
down at the end of the day

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:23.160 align:middle line:90%
and the beginning of the day.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.993 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing is,
well, to try and get

00:10:24.993 --> 00:10:30.420 align:middle line:84%
that work-life balance right
and I know I need to be there.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.313 align:middle line:84%
And perhaps before I came on
this trip, I would have said,

00:10:33.313 --> 00:10:34.980 align:middle line:84%
no, I'm at work, I
need to stay at work.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:84%
This is my job and
this is what I do.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.300 align:middle line:84%
But the truth of
the matter is, I

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.660 align:middle line:84%
know I need to be home
with that family member

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.170 align:middle line:90%
and adding support.

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.940 align:middle line:84%
So I think I've learnt the
lessons that I need to learn

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.740 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.965 align:middle line:84%
I think my life has
changed, so I don't

00:10:48.965 --> 00:10:50.090 align:middle line:90%
need to be here any longer.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And it's the right for
me to be there, I think.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Before Nick heads
for the airport,

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.693 align:middle line:84%
there's just one last
piece of business left.

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:01.110 align:middle line:84%
>> You did your
test this morning.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:90%
This is great.

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Went to the hospital.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Went to the hospital.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.257 align:middle line:84%
I see here that
you lost 10 kilos.

00:11:05.257 --> 00:11:06.057 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah?

00:11:06.057 --> 00:11:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Good for you.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:08.150 align:middle line:90%
That's amazing.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
>> It was all in your
face and your double chin.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.657 align:middle line:90%
>> You mean I had a double chin?

00:11:13.657 --> 00:11:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Yeah I think that's
to be honest true.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.210 align:middle line:90%
>> No, you're looking good.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Blood pressure went down.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.720 align:middle line:84%
You didn't have very high
blood pressure, but--

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Blood pressure
has always been good.

00:11:20.345 --> 00:11:22.730 align:middle line:84%
But it has come down to that
of a 25-year-old athlete.

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.620 align:middle line:90%


00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.185 align:middle line:90%
>> All the canoeing paid off.

00:11:27.185 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:90%
You went to the nude beach.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.810 align:middle line:90%
Tell me.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.563 align:middle line:84%
That was the motivation
every morning,

00:11:30.563 --> 00:11:32.860 align:middle line:84%
to get as far as the nude
beach and come back again.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.660 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:34.460 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.750 align:middle line:84%
So the good news is
cholesterol went down.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:37.680 align:middle line:90%
Total cholesterol.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.400 align:middle line:90%
You were at 227.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And I should
really be around--

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, conventional
medicine say under 200,

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:50.830 align:middle line:84%
but cardiologists say under
150 to be at bulletproof risk,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:51.630 align:middle line:90%
you know?

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:90%
>> And I am at?

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.870 align:middle line:90%
>> And you are now at 156.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.980 align:middle line:84%
So basically,
you're pretty good.

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, I am now healthy
and I have the physique

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:03.983 align:middle line:84%
and metabolic rate of
a 25-year-old athlete.

00:12:03.983 --> 00:12:05.650 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of almost
like a magic bullet.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.842 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:06.842 --> 00:12:09.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And I have to say, I was
skeptical about how much effect

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.490 align:middle line:90%
it would have when I came here.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.150 align:middle line:90%
And you've won me over with it.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:15.930 align:middle line:84%
I think this isn't
just for people

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.720 align:middle line:84%
who want to wear baggy
pants and braid their hair.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Like me.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it should
be for everybody.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:21.630 align:middle line:90%
And that's--

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And I hope that people
will look past the--

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:26.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Setting.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The setting and
the accouterments.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.260 align:middle line:90%
>> You can do it at home.

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, yeah, that's the thing.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.078 align:middle line:84%
>> It's true that
when you arrived,

00:12:32.078 --> 00:12:35.265 align:middle line:84%
you were skeptical and you
were scaring me a little.

00:12:35.265 --> 00:12:36.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, why is that?

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you were scaring
me a little because you were

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.450 align:middle line:90%
so skeptical.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.080 align:middle line:90%
But I saw the change.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.690 align:middle line:90%
>> I was positive.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.290 align:middle line:84%
I was confident that at the
end, you would see the results.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Sadly, April is not seeing
the benefit she had hoped

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.000 align:middle line:10%
for with her ongoing
eye condition.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Last night was very,
very challenging for me.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.320 align:middle line:10%


00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:10%
I've had so many rips in
my eyes and my corneas

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:09.470 align:middle line:10%
during this time here and
these last couple of days.

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:13.360 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if
you'll see much of me.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:17.710 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't, I
hope you'll understand.

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:20.530 align:middle line:10%
And I love you guys.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Bye.

>> With April holed
up in her room,

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.920 align:middle line:84%
Luke visits with a machine that
measures how her heart rate

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.570 align:middle line:84%
variability affects
her nervous system.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.870 align:middle line:84%
>> If you have a high
heart rate variability,

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.730 align:middle line:84%
that means your heart
constantly adapts.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's a sign of good
health, good homeostasis.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:84%
>> The HRV monitor is commonly
used by athletes to measure

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.730 align:middle line:90%
their autonomic nervous systems.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:49.400 align:middle line:84%
>> With you, your heart
rate variability is 60% low.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.670 align:middle line:84%
And that just is
showing for me that we

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:54.620 align:middle line:84%
need to work with your nervous
system a little bit more.

00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.420 align:middle line:84%
My concern is that
you are looking

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.720 align:middle line:84%
to Reiki, to Oren,
to all these healing

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:90%
modalities outside yourself.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:08.080 align:middle line:84%
And for me, I would
like you to try and do

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
things that empower you
more, if that makes sense.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
So when you have a
good night's sleep,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:84%
I know it's very
easy to be like, yes,

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.010 align:middle line:90%
and then have such a high.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:21.290 align:middle line:84%
And then the next night, if you
don't, it's then such a low.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:23.830 align:middle line:84%
I know it must be
very difficult.

00:14:23.830 --> 00:14:26.530 align:middle line:84%
But when I hear
that you are still

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:84%
smoking sometimes
or drinking coffee,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:33.910 align:middle line:84%
then I do ask the question,
what is it that's blocking you

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.510 align:middle line:90%
from this self-healing?

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:40.647 align:middle line:84%
And I do just want to
empower you to take this on.

00:14:40.647 --> 00:14:41.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, honey.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:90%

00:14:53.367 --> 00:14:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> It's beautiful to feel
that trust and that surrender.

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:57.992 align:middle line:10%
And that's really, to me,
the essence of this practice,

00:14:57.992 --> 00:15:02.280 align:middle line:10%
to cultivate these key aspects
in the art of relating.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:19.120 align:middle line:90%

We looked at the
results from when you

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:35.190 align:middle line:90%
arrived, which were alarming.

00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.780 align:middle line:90%
We knew that you lost 10 kilos.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:38.730 align:middle line:90%
>> Which is amazing.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Which will drop
your cholesterol.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.060 align:middle line:90%
And we will have the proof now.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:41.990 align:middle line:90%
>> I lost my wallet.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.790 align:middle line:90%

>> Yes.

00:17:15.363 --> 00:17:16.609 align:middle line:90%
150 would be bulletproof.

And--

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.280 align:middle line:90%
>> And row with me.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:90%
>> And row with you.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.300 align:middle line:90%

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.800 align:middle line:90%
More results.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:48.060 align:middle line:90%
>> We want more.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's go straight to the
diabetes, the blood sugar.

>> Diabetic.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.030 align:middle line:90%
You went down to 101.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:57.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:58.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Very good.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Yep.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.100 align:middle line:90%

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.140 align:middle line:84%
A trip back to the hospital for
an evaluation of the results

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:14.150 align:middle line:90%
is also astounding.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Quite honestly, I'm amazed.

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:21.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm gobsmacked as a
person of science.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.280 align:middle line:84%
Really, I did not
expect to see this.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.580 align:middle line:84%
I believe in antibiotics

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:30.570 align:middle line:90%
this kind of thing--

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.460 align:middle line:90%
and diet to a certain extent.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:39.420 align:middle line:84%
But for a diet to have
reversed this patient who

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:47.940 align:middle line:84%
had type 2 diabetes, I'm
just completely amazed.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.710 align:middle line:84%
The improvements
are unbelievable.

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, for someone
who is diabetic,

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.240 align:middle line:84%
type 2, just purely
by changing his diet

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:02.820 align:middle line:84%
to go into normal ranges and
everything across the board.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.020 align:middle line:84%
If he came in here, I would
say he is a healthy person.

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:09.240 align:middle line:84%
He didn't need any
treatment for anything.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.565 align:middle line:90%

Billy.

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.400 align:middle line:90%
>> It's all right.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Mind your fingers.

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:31.780 align:middle line:84%
>> You know when it's
changed, it goes red.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.180 align:middle line:84%
>> I've got a bald head, so
I know when it's coming from

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:34.980 align:middle line:90%
the roof.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.425 align:middle line:90%
>> The umbrella.

00:20:36.425 --> 00:20:37.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Coming through the roof.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Is it?

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:38.991 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:20:38.991 --> 00:20:41.450 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Just put them right in.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.140 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Tasting time.

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.810 align:middle line:90%
>> It's going to be hot.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:53.468 align:middle line:90%
What's it need?

00:20:53.468 --> 00:20:54.914 align:middle line:90%
>> It's perfect.

00:20:54.914 --> 00:21:02.150 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:06.170 align:middle line:84%
>> As the storm shows no signs
of relenting by the evening,

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:09.890 align:middle line:84%
the gang have had to move from
the beach to higher ground

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.350 align:middle line:90%
for the farewell party.

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.710 align:middle line:84%
But it still hasn't
dampened their spirits.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:18.030 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.380 align:middle line:84%
And Oren gets the party
going with a Persian santur.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:25.270 align:middle line:90%


00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.825 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been a good ride.

00:21:26.825 --> 00:21:29.120 align:middle line:10%
I've enjoyed most of it.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.570 align:middle line:10%
Some parts have been
a little bit tricky,

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.610 align:middle line:10%
but it's been a great ride.

00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:37.090 align:middle line:10%
>> I came out here because
I needed some time for me.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:42.850 align:middle line:10%
I think I refound
my inner confidence

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.500 align:middle line:10%
that I think I'd lost.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Me and Kathy, great friends.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't know who you're
going to pick or bond with,

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.190 align:middle line:84%
but we just kind of
clicked from day one.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:54.440 align:middle line:84%
I'd say to Kathy, let's come
for a run in the morning.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, what time?

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.230 align:middle line:90%
5:00.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.900 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know she wanted to come
for the whole process of doing

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.550 align:middle line:90%
it.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Just before I
came, I was quite ill.

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.488 align:middle line:84%
So I was taking antidepressants,
antibiotics, steroids.

00:22:08.488 --> 00:22:10.780 align:middle line:10%
>> The mental-- and just the
growth thing that I really

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.120 align:middle line:10%
wanted to come here and
experience and do the self

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.010 align:middle line:10%
confidence, the anxiety, and
just gain the tools to manage

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.810 align:middle line:10%
that.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:22.547 align:middle line:84%
I think Luke and Jackie and
the others have given me that.

00:22:22.547 --> 00:22:25.130 align:middle line:10%
>> There's been a lot happening,
and it's been quite difficult

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.720 align:middle line:10%
to digest.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Learning to work
with my breath,

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:34.100 align:middle line:84%
learning to work with some
different forms of meditation.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I know that whatever I decide
that I'm going to do going

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.640 align:middle line:90%
on from here, I will succeed.

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.625 align:middle line:84%
>> I think I'm going back
a different person to how I

00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:44.425 align:middle line:90%
arrived.

00:22:44.425 --> 00:22:47.570 align:middle line:90%


00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Gradually, over the
course of the program,

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:90%
I'm not taking anything now.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.990 align:middle line:90%
>> My head feels brilliant.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:55.910 align:middle line:90%
My heart feels open.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.950 align:middle line:84%
>> I think there's a lot more
processing to happen post

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.990 align:middle line:90%
the retreat.

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:01.435 align:middle line:84%
I'm quite looking
forward to that.

00:23:01.435 --> 00:23:03.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Because I've seen it
happen, now I've come here,

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.720 align:middle line:84%
got into your process
and done it all,

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.580 align:middle line:90%
and seen the results of it all.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.790 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going back there.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:12.241 align:middle line:90%
