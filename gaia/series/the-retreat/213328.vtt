Leo DiCapraudio.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.898 align:middle line:90%
Found the Beach, hasn't he?

00:07:01.898 --> 00:07:03.190 align:middle line:90%
He knows he's going for a swim.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.758 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:10.190 align:middle line:90%
>> So nice.

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:13.220 align:middle line:84%
>> While the boys refresh
themselves with a swim,

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:84%
it's the 11th early morning
walk for Milton and Cathy.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.780 align:middle line:84%
Despite still being
on his fast, Milton

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.930 align:middle line:84%
is determined to keep
increasing their distance.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So Dominique has
a quick catch-up

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.770 align:middle line:84%
to check he's not going too hard
for a man with type 2 diabetes.

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, you were
losing weight last week.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Eating.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.530 align:middle line:90%
>> But now on the fast--

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.920 align:middle line:90%
>> --it goes fast.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.670 align:middle line:90%
But how do you feel inside?

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.375 align:middle line:84%
I mean, now that
the end is coming.

00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:44.250 align:middle line:90%
>> The end is coming.

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:45.650 align:middle line:10%
Yesterday felt a little rough.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Why?

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.210 align:middle line:10%
>> Just felt just drained and--

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:54.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it because I heard you're
going on hikes on the mountain.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, I didn't go on a hike.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.910 align:middle line:84%
But this morning we were
meant to do our normal walk.

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.500 align:middle line:90%
What takes an hour.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
We got lost, and
it took two hours.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> How did you get lost?

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.300 align:middle line:90%
There's one road.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, no, we
got lost somehow.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.690 align:middle line:84%
But, yeah, I still-- it's still
nice to get out in the morning,

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.220 align:middle line:84%
because it sets
me up for the day.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.560 align:middle line:84%
>> You are aware of last
week of eating healthy.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.777 align:middle line:84%
>> Your blood sugar went down,
your cholesterol went down.

00:08:17.777 --> 00:08:19.110 align:middle line:90%
Everything went down, basically.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:20.345 align:middle line:90%
Almost like a normal person.

00:08:20.345 --> 00:08:21.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:21.145 --> 00:08:22.900 align:middle line:84%
>> And so this week,
you were fasting.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.377 align:middle line:84%
Do you expect-- what
do you expect now?

00:08:25.377 --> 00:08:27.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Keep on the same
kind of program, really.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.870 align:middle line:84%
Because I still want
it to stay down.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.509 align:middle line:84%
It's not like, hallelujah,
let's get back up there again.

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:32.309 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:37.099 align:middle line:84%
>> So no, no, I'm ready to keep
it on that level, because I--

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:39.130 align:middle line:84%
it was nice to see
everyone so happy.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.284 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, as well as
me being happy about this--

00:08:42.284 --> 00:08:43.659 align:middle line:84%
you know, everything
coming down.

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.780 align:middle line:84%
So that was a good feeling,
a really good feeling.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm just so fed up with my
eyes ripping every night since

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.930 align:middle line:90%
I've been here.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.740 align:middle line:90%
I don't know why they're so bad.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.940 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering if
it's because there's not

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:90%
much humidity here.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, just feeling
really fed up.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.980 align:middle line:84%
But I'm excited, because I'm
going to the osteopath in about

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.390 align:middle line:90%
half an hour.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:90%
And I hear he's brilliant.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.660 align:middle line:84%
And I'm really hoping
he can pinpoint

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.785 align:middle line:84%
why my body isn't healing
itself the way it should.

00:09:18.785 --> 00:09:21.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:24.470 align:middle line:84%
>> The gang are going to be
subjected to more invasive

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:84%
physical therapies
for about a week.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.510 align:middle line:84%
First up is Oren, the
retreat's osteopath.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:33.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I deal with anatomy and
physiology and mechanics.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Already, Nick looks
less than impressed.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So what I'm going to do,
I'm going to check your body.

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.020 align:middle line:84%
Because all of you
know that you have

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:84%
pain in all kinds
of area of the body.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Lower back, neck, shoulder.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.710 align:middle line:84%
I'm very interested in
the source of your pain.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:51.680 align:middle line:84%
And through the knowledge
of anatomy and physiology,

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.750 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to, like,
an exploration

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:57.077 align:middle line:84%
to try to understand where
your pain is originating.

00:09:57.077 --> 00:09:59.660 align:middle line:84%
>> There has been a lot wrong
with me for a long time in terms

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.618 align:middle line:90%
of physical well-being.

00:10:00.618 --> 00:10:02.450 align:middle line:84%
And so I use
physios quite a lot.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:04.280 align:middle line:84%
And I've always found
that sports physios

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
are the best, because they
just get everything working in.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.653 align:middle line:84%
But they don't-- they never
say they're going to cure me

00:10:09.653 --> 00:10:12.320 align:middle line:84%
of the problem, because it's an
ongoing problem that I have from

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.120 align:middle line:90%
injuries.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.368 align:middle line:84%
Whereas here, more
interestingly,

00:10:15.368 --> 00:10:16.910 align:middle line:84%
he's saying he can
get on top of this

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:18.897 align:middle line:84%
by actually finding
the root cause.

00:10:18.897 --> 00:10:19.980 align:middle line:90%
>> This is sensitive here?

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.260 align:middle line:90%
And here?

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Not so much.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:23.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.350 align:middle line:84%
>> If I can walk
away from, you know,

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.163 align:middle line:84%
this experience without actually
having to see a physio every

00:10:28.163 --> 00:10:30.330 align:middle line:84%
week because of the damage
that I've got done to me,

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.050 align:middle line:84%
then that will be
absolutely fabulous.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.270 align:middle line:84%
When he was doing
manipulations or said

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.645 align:middle line:84%
he was doing
manipulations, there

00:10:34.645 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:84%
appeared to be no movement or
manipulation going on at all.

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:84%
By the same token, it did
feel better after than before.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Stretch the lower leg.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:45.330 align:middle line:90%
It's painful?

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.380 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It's not painful.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not sure to exemplify--
if I was to press you

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.060 align:middle line:84%
on your shoulder blade now and
say, does that feel better?

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:52.910 align:middle line:90%
Then you'd say yes.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.285 align:middle line:84%
I can't honestly
say whether he's

00:10:54.285 --> 00:10:56.610 align:middle line:84%
pressing me as hard the
second time in those

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:90%
places the first time.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.730 align:middle line:84%
So the only way of knowing
whether that's actually worked

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.170 align:middle line:84%
or not is over
the next few days,

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.910 align:middle line:84%
in the next couple of days,
whether I feel better.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You feel it?

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:05.760 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, yeah.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:06.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Interesting.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:10.425 align:middle line:90%
He's unpredictable.

00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:11.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly the middle here.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:14.720 align:middle line:84%
>> He doesn't respond in the
way that you would expect.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.827 align:middle line:84%
I still feel the tension and
the pain in the low back.

00:11:17.827 --> 00:11:19.410 align:middle line:84%
It's been a long-term
problem, and I'd

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:22.260 align:middle line:84%
be very surprised if that
got solved in one session.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.900 align:middle line:84%
>> With Nick and Laura still
unsure of Oren's effectiveness,

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.250 align:middle line:84%
April sees him with her
chronic eye condition.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:33.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The top of my eye is
no longer properly adhered

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.310 align:middle line:90%
to the rest of the eye.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:40.290 align:middle line:84%
I have severe dry eye, and I
have recurrent corneal erosion.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:44.640 align:middle line:84%
What happens to me is when I go
to bed at night, within about

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.050 align:middle line:84%
30 minutes, my eyeballs
are glued shut.

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes both eyes,
sometimes one eye.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:53.160 align:middle line:84%
Is that when I open my eyes,
pieces of the epithelial layer

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:90%
are pulled off.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.690 align:middle line:90%
And I'm in absolute agony

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.621 align:middle line:84%
>> You see, because I
want to release your--

00:12:00.621 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:90%
all the orbit area.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:08.190 align:middle line:84%
>> It was absolutely incredible,
because the response in my body

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.600 align:middle line:90%
was so profound.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.840 align:middle line:84%
And I could feel, like,
energy moving through areas

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.390 align:middle line:84%
that I think had been
blocked previously.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.190 align:middle line:90%
I feel much more in alignment.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:23.070 align:middle line:84%
I feel much more balanced
on my left and right sides.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.995 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be really
interesting to do yoga,

00:12:25.995 --> 00:12:29.730 align:middle line:84%
because my right hip is
always really, really jammed.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.960 align:middle line:84%
But he's just
loosened that all up.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:90%
I'm excited.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, time will tell, right?

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>> With everyone hitting
their own rhythms,

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.665 align:middle line:90%
the gang are on different paths.

00:12:38.665 --> 00:12:41.300 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.190 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm glad that I extended my
detox from the seven days to 13

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle line:90%
with the juices.

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:51.150 align:middle line:84%
I feel my body needed to
clear a lot more things out,

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:53.520 align:middle line:90%
which apparently, this helps.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's not easy watching
everybody eat their food.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you just-- you're
craving to have something.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.390 align:middle line:84%
But I think you've got
your end date in mind

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.230 align:middle line:90%
and you're doing it for you.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And everybody is doing their own
little journey on this thing.

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:08.330 align:middle line:90%
And so you just--

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.090 align:middle line:84%
as long as you know where you
going, it's tough, but it's OK.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:14.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Melody does this vegetarian
sushi that is pretty

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.240 align:middle line:90%
spectacular.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So I didn't want to kind
of have a big blowout.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:22.220 align:middle line:84%
I just would have really liked
a plate of her vegetarian sushi.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.060 align:middle line:90%
It would have just hit the mark.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.360 align:middle line:90%
I want to chew something.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.375 align:middle line:84%
I want some flavor, and
I want some texture.

00:13:28.375 --> 00:13:32.000 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.670 align:middle line:84%
>> As Milton and Cathy's
walks get ever longer,

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
the morning finds them
trekking as far as Thong Sala,

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.150 align:middle line:90%
the island's capital.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Overripe.

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Not a great place for
two people on a fast.

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.650 align:middle line:84%
But they're not
the only ones who

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.720 align:middle line:84%
have slipped the monk-like
confines of the retreat.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Laura has taken
Claire into town.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And is keen to show her the more
spiritual side of Ko Pha-ngan.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.900 align:middle line:10%
>> I've been studying the dharma
as part of a group over the last

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:03.890 align:middle line:10%
few years.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:07.550 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really
important part of my life.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:08.960 align:middle line:90%
I started to meditate.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.540 align:middle line:84%
And then I asked to be a mitra,
which is-- just means friend.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:17.060 align:middle line:84%
But it means you've committed
to the path of Buddhism.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.836 align:middle line:84%
And then a few years after
that, I requested ordination.

00:14:19.836 --> 00:14:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:28.010 align:middle line:84%
>> The dharmic monks here
take the retreat's meditation

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:32.240 align:middle line:84%
practices to some
extreme levels.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:36.320 align:middle line:84%
This monk is practicing being
in a state of nothingness

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
and can sit like this
for hours on end.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.280 align:middle line:84%
It's quite emotional times
here, because you're here

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.250 align:middle line:90%
to face your problems.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Some days, I don't really
want to talk about them.

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.123 align:middle line:84%
I cried the other
day because I didn't

00:14:49.123 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:84%
want to go to reiki, because
it was quite hard going.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And it takes a lot out of you
and just talking about it again.

00:14:57.370 --> 00:14:59.972 align:middle line:90%


00:14:59.972 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
But you have to give yourself
a pep talk and be like,

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.370 align:middle line:84%
this is why I'm here, and
I've got to get over this.

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.110 align:middle line:84%
And I've got to try
something different.

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:10.100 align:middle line:84%
And it's everything's
there to help you

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:14.120 align:middle line:84%
and to help me feel
better when I go home,

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.775 align:middle line:90%
which I really need to do.

00:15:15.775 --> 00:15:18.830 align:middle line:90%


00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to talk to Maggie to
check what happened yesterday

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.070 align:middle line:90%
with you.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Ever vigilant, Dominique
checks in with the gang over

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:84%
a coconut to discuss another
new level of the program.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.980 align:middle line:84%
So I had that very
deep tummy massage.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Chi nei tsang?

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:38.723 align:middle line:10%
>> Which was painful in places
and incredibly, incredibly deep.

00:15:38.723 --> 00:15:40.140 align:middle line:84%
I thought at one
stage, literally,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.800 align:middle line:84%
she was massaging
my kidney and liver.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.910 align:middle line:84%
She said that there was a
bit of a build-up of clay

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:49.745 align:middle line:84%
and that there was
definitely a blockage.

00:15:49.745 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:84%
Not the clay, but
there was a blockage.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.970 align:middle line:84%
She didn't necessarily manage
to get rid of the blockage,

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.410 align:middle line:84%
but at least we sort of
moved things around a bit.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:57.990 align:middle line:90%
So I feel a lot--

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.160 align:middle line:90%
a lot better.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Great.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Chi nei tsang is a deep
tissue abdomen massage designed

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.370 align:middle line:84%
to specifically move toxic
blockages and release negative

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:90%
emotions from individual organs.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Only some of the gang
opt to try it out,

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.090 align:middle line:84%
as it can be extremely
uncomfortable.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:18.690 align:middle line:90%


00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.760 align:middle line:84%
(SINGING) But I
still have my car

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.740 align:middle line:90%
Now we over

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.710 align:middle line:84%
I've been stopped,
mixed up for years

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's only my pride
that keeps me alive

00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:35.140 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it is

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:37.122 align:middle line:84%
>> So that note
there, that's good.

00:16:37.122 --> 00:16:38.330 align:middle line:90%
No, that's good, that's good.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> We'll get there.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:39.530 align:middle line:90%
We're getting this.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.920 align:middle line:90%
Getting this.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.720 align:middle line:90%
Getting there.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.947 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, we'll get that--
we'll get that on point.

00:16:42.947 --> 00:16:44.030 align:middle line:90%
>> How are you finding it?

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:45.322 align:middle line:90%
Let's look at the shape of you.

00:16:45.322 --> 00:16:47.942 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well, as I keep
saying, if I came on this--

00:16:47.942 --> 00:16:49.400 align:middle line:84%
on a mission, you
know what I mean?

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.320 align:middle line:90%
And I was going to--

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.420 align:middle line:84%
you know, I was going to
stick to what I was told

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.270 align:middle line:84%
and do what I was-- you know,
do whatever, like the experts

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.520 align:middle line:84%
and that was telling me to
do kind of thing, you know?

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.230 align:middle line:90%
And been enjoying the yoga.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Just been kind of
enjoying it all, really.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.395 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you
make of the reiki?

00:17:03.395 --> 00:17:04.609 align:middle line:90%
>> Reiki didn't work for me.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:04.900 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Didn't work for me.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.320 align:middle line:90%
Didn't do anything.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.170 align:middle line:84%
I felt a bit odd
through that experience,

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.329 align:middle line:84%
but I didn't really come away
with a hallelujah moment.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, not me.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.390 align:middle line:90%
>> I saw it in some other guys.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.060 align:middle line:84%
>> I had a good kip
a couple of times.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.050 align:middle line:90%
>> I had a good kip.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.270 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.609 align:middle line:90%
I could hear myself snoring.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:22.089 align:middle line:90%
That's what woke me up

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:24.579 align:middle line:84%
>> At 1:30, I've got
to go to the hub.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:26.839 align:middle line:90%
I've got a-- what do I have?

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:33.370 align:middle line:84%
I've got a chi nei
tsang with Satyama.

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:36.500 align:middle line:90%
And that's a tummy massage.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.190 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you've met Satyama.

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:42.200 align:middle line:84%
She's one of our
yoga instructors.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:48.950 align:middle line:84%
And she seems to like pain, kind
of, or inflicting pain, which is

00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:52.280 align:middle line:90%
making me a little bit worried.

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.630 align:middle line:90%
She seems to smile at it.

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.290 align:middle line:84%
And I believe this
can be quite sore.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm worried about
the pain infliction.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.710 align:middle line:84%
Also, you know, hopefully
I don't react and slap

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:05.660 align:middle line:90%
her on camera by mistake.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:10.490 align:middle line:10%
>> So today, we will do a
session called chi nei tsang.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.100 align:middle line:84%
A very deep abdominal
massage that

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:17.280 align:middle line:84%
is working towards the
support of your cleanse.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>> You say deep, getting
emotional and deep tissue.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is this going to be
quite emotional again or--

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.260 align:middle line:90%
it could--

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:25.640 align:middle line:90%
>> It can be.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Or--

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.170 align:middle line:90%
>> You can be prepared for that.

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.190 align:middle line:84%
For example, the liver
is associated with anger.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.440 align:middle line:84%
So a lot of times when I'm
touching on someone's liver

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
on the right side of
the body, it's like,

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.650 align:middle line:90%
this will trigger something.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.660 align:middle line:84%
But also, like lungs, heart,
associated with grief,

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.530 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Or kidneys associated
with jealousy.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.470 align:middle line:84%
So depending on what your
physiological makeup is

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.300 align:middle line:84%
and what's going
on in your life,

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.070 align:middle line:84%
then these things
can be activated,

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:54.260 align:middle line:84%
or it could be
totally pleasurable.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Or you could totally
feel like you've

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.430 align:middle line:84%
got so much energy at the
end, or you could totally

00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:59.280 align:middle line:90%
feel drained.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.080 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Ready to go.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:04.130 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:84%
>> While Cathy tries to
relax and get the most out

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:11.570 align:middle line:84%
of the session, the others are
encouraged to let themselves go

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:14.030 align:middle line:90%
with some deeper yoga.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:10%
>> Today's class, we're working
with opening up your hips.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And we're working with a muscle
today called the psoas muscle.

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.070 align:middle line:90%
So this muscle attaches in T12.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.880 align:middle line:90%
There's no need--

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The psoas is a particular
muscle used in the fight

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:90%
or flight instinct.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.220 align:middle line:84%
And a tight one increases
feelings of stress and anxiety.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:38.370 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:41.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Inhaling, the right
leg goes behind the body.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.630 align:middle line:84%
Looking up, keeping
an arch in your back.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.692 align:middle line:90%


00:19:47.692 --> 00:19:49.700 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.500 align:middle line:90%


00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Man down.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm not a big fan
of pushing myself.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.400 align:middle line:84%
I've never been a big fan of
pushing myself physically.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Hence, not being
particularly toned.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:03.820 align:middle line:90%
But the overall benefits of--

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.890 align:middle line:84%
I feel like my
body is opening up.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.620 align:middle line:84%
The stiffness in my
back, neck, and shoulders

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:10.220 align:middle line:90%
has virtually gone.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:15.670 align:middle line:84%
So I'm getting into the postures
and feeling like I can do them.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.830 align:middle line:84%
Really enjoying the breathing
and meditation side.

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it feels like we're
getting the full package.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:23.920 align:middle line:84%
>> That was kind of--
that was kind of cool.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.510 align:middle line:84%
Because actually
for the first time

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:84%
today, I've heard it
said for eight days now,

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:90%
lose the outline of your body.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.700 align:middle line:90%
When you like relaxing.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.160 align:middle line:90%
And I did.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.500 align:middle line:84%
Actually couldn't feel
where my skin was.

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:40.060 align:middle line:84%
It's like I was twice the size
or I was, like, expanding.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.510 align:middle line:84%
But not feeling
where my skin was.

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.410 align:middle line:90%
That was really weird, actually.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.688 align:middle line:90%
That was kind of odd.

00:20:45.688 --> 00:20:48.230 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you're aware where you
are, aren't you, at all times?

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.880 align:middle line:90%
You know where your skin is.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.460 align:middle line:84%
You know where your
arms are and legs.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I still know
where they were.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:52.490 align:middle line:90%
It's just that--

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:53.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Hope so.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.000 align:middle line:84%
>> The blur-- no, the outline,
I understood what they meant

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.703 align:middle line:90%
for the first time today.

00:20:57.703 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:84%
I like-- look, you know,
I'm the least hippie person

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:00.670 align:middle line:90%
in the world.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.780 align:middle line:84%
But I actually-- seriously,
I feel kind of stupid

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:03.690 align:middle line:90%
even saying it.

00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:05.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:90%
I really do.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.117 align:middle line:84%
I felt like a complete
Muppet saying it.

00:21:08.117 --> 00:21:10.440 align:middle line:90%
But actually-- actually, I did.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.723 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:11.723 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:84%
I don't care what
you think of it.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.890 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:15.147 align:middle line:90%


00:21:15.147 --> 00:21:17.730 align:middle line:10%
>> So the last couple of days,
I've actually been feeling like

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.350 align:middle line:10%
I'm not doing that
well with yoga.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:84%
And I don't know if it's to
do with hunger and maybe in

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.338 align:middle line:84%
and out of depression
and being happy,

00:21:24.338 --> 00:21:25.880 align:middle line:84%
if it's all just
part of the process.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.360 align:middle line:90%


00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.910 align:middle line:84%
I'm battling at it
a little bit now.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:35.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We close the left, we
exhale through the right.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.380 align:middle line:84%
Making sure your exhalation is
longer than your inhalation.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.470 align:middle line:84%
>> His constant coming back to
the breath and then lengthening

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.565 align:middle line:84%
the breath when you're feeling
stressed has been brilliant.

00:21:46.565 --> 00:21:52.310 align:middle line:84%
Oh, that meditation at
the end is just beautiful.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>> I am finding the meditation
part at the end when

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.680 align:middle line:84%
you're visualizing people,
I find that really hard.

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:00.920 align:middle line:90%
I get really upset.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.500 align:middle line:84%
I've never really been
asked to wish people health

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.450 align:middle line:84%
and happiness who you
don't like, you know,

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:90%
and have caused you pain.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:12.163 align:middle line:84%
I just never realized that
yoga was that powerful.

00:22:12.163 --> 00:22:15.590 align:middle line:90%


00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Staying with your breath.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.020 align:middle line:90%
Your left side.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.340 align:middle line:90%
And then holding this.

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:90%


00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.190 align:middle line:90%
Gently releasing the posture.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Keeping your eyes closed.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:34.010 align:middle line:84%
Coming into a comfortable
sitting position.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Into a comfortable
standing position.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:90%
Exhaling and relaxing.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:50.130 align:middle line:90%


00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Next time on The Retreat.

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.055 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm about to go into
this igloo shaped thing.

00:22:55.055 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.090 align:middle line:90%


00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.378 align:middle line:84%
I'm a bit scared, because
they said they hum in there,

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:00.670 align:middle line:90%
but you're not allowed to talk.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:03.170 align:middle line:84%
>> If I'm completely honest,
this place I'm not-- you know--

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:84%
I'd sooner go to hell,
I think, than go here.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I would stay
away from the gym.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.668 align:middle line:84%
>> He's a chap that I don't
think one could really describe.

00:23:10.668 --> 00:23:12.210 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I asked if
he could levitate.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:14.585 align:middle line:84%
And he said yes, and he also
said he could walk on water.

00:23:14.585 --> 00:23:16.798 align:middle line:84%
>> What I came here
to do was get--

00:23:16.798 --> 00:23:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it's a
cliche, but, you know,

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:21.240 align:middle line:84%
the mind, body, and
soul kind of balance.

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.020 align:middle line:10%
>> I cried last night.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:24.930 align:middle line:10%
Woke up crying.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.460 align:middle line:90%
>> I just had this epiphany.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I kind of just felt
like I'd let you down.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I just had a very,
very strange experience.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.720 align:middle line:10%
