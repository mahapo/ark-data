like an out of body
experience today.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:84%
And from a yogic
point of view, they

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:84%
talk about astral projection
and kind of leaving your body

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.280 align:middle line:90%
and going somewhere else.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.070 align:middle line:84%
And I haven't
mentioned it because I

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.100 align:middle line:90%
haven't experienced it.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.650 align:middle line:84%

talking about that.

or whatever their whole life.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's just madness, really.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:90%
>> An orangey golden color.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:23.355 align:middle line:84%
And mine is more not
rolling in the center of it.

00:03:23.355 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Rolling into the center.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:90%
>> This orange thing you saw.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.210 align:middle line:84%
>> You think you've
just done the same.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.212 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to say I
did because I was like--

00:03:36.212 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:84%
I was probably just a bit
dizzy from all that walking

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.950 align:middle line:90%
this morning

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it was weird because
when we have this over our eyes,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:84%
when I took this off,
I had a vivid golden--

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.580 align:middle line:90%
behind my eyes.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.385 align:middle line:84%
>> Which you would think is
just the light coming in.

00:03:51.385 --> 00:03:51.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
>> Except it wasn't
because when it stopped,

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.250 align:middle line:84%
the light was actually just how
it would be through your eyes.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I had exactly the same thing.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle line:84%
And is that what you
had the other day?

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Same color, but
not the same thing.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.015 align:middle line:84%
When I had that the other
day, it came up, up through.

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:12.560 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.607 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:14.607 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>> I think this is really weird.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.730 align:middle line:84%
It's the other week
where he goes--

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:90%
>> I am in shock with all this.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.640 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.973 align:middle line:90%
This is too freaky because I'm--

00:04:21.973 --> 00:04:23.432 align:middle line:84%
it might've passed
me because I was

00:04:23.432 --> 00:04:26.242 align:middle line:84%
slightly dizzy, because I did
that flipping great long walk--

00:04:26.242 --> 00:04:27.409 align:middle line:90%
that long walk this morning.

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.610 align:middle line:84%
So OK, when I was doing that, I
was seeing, like, gold colors.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.070 align:middle line:84%
But you know when
you used to go,

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.140 align:middle line:84%
put your mind in your left foot
or at the end of your left leg.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And then start to
move up through there.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.863 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the past, I've
been putting my mind there

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.540 align:middle line:84%
and imagining little electric
things or anything going up

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.160 align:middle line:90%
my leg to make this come down.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Today when I did it,
I put my mind there.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.860 align:middle line:90%
And it was dark green.

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.200 align:middle line:90%
It was like it was shrouded.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:84%
My foot was suddenly shrouded,
like at the top of a mountain

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:90%
in the dark, smoky color.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And there was a light
gold came onto my toes,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.880 align:middle line:90%
and then went again.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And I was trying to get
it back into my toe.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.490 align:middle line:90%
And it goes fighting it.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And it wouldn't burst
through the dark green.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.200 align:middle line:90%
And eventually, it did.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And I got so fed up with it, I
actually suddenly found myself

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.040 align:middle line:84%
going outside and
going down and looking

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.790 align:middle line:90%
at the bottom of my feet.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And then I thought, what
the hell's going on?

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.810 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.165 align:middle line:84%
I'm looking at the bottom
of my feet, and freaked out.

00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:21.190 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.790 align:middle line:84%
>> And then couldn't
relax after that?

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.740 align:middle line:90%
>> And it went again.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, I was back inside
and thinking about trying

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.590 align:middle line:90%
to put my mind in my feet.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.390 align:middle line:84%
But there was a moment
where I went, I saw this.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.090 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to have a look.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:31.780 align:middle line:84%
And I actually went around and
looked at the bottom of my feet,

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.120 align:middle line:84%
and then could see
the bottom of my feet.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
>> From a yogic point of
view, they talk about astral

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.763 align:middle line:90%
projection.

00:05:37.763 --> 00:05:39.430 align:middle line:84%
But it's funny because
you two were just

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
talking about colors of chakras,
just lying there casually,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:84%
just like, oh,
yeah, I saw golds.

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.460 align:middle line:90%
And I was just like--

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.020 align:middle line:84%
>> That was why I was trying
to keep it quiet because I felt

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.648 align:middle line:90%
such a pillock talking about it.

00:05:48.648 --> 00:05:51.190 align:middle line:84%
I was asking him what he saw
because there was a moment where

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.820 align:middle line:84%
I was getting this super gold,
but not gold like a gold-gold,

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.450 align:middle line:90%
like a sunset gold.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Like an orangey--

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Like an orangey gold, yeah.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.750 align:middle line:90%
>> That's just ridiculous.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.098 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:06:02.098 --> 00:06:03.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it is, isn't it?

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:90%
It's just--

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.660 align:middle line:90%
>> It's you on the turn.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:06.710 align:middle line:90%
That's all it is.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.470 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I'm just dizzy because
I've been in a long walk this

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.780 align:middle line:90%
morning.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.290 align:middle line:90%
That's what it is.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.357 align:middle line:84%
That's what you've
put it down to.

00:06:11.357 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:84%
But really, you're on
the turn because you've

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.864 align:middle line:84%
been seeing your chakra colors,
and your spirit took your own.

00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:23.570 align:middle line:84%
You need to go and have
Reiki this afternoon.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.880 align:middle line:90%
It's festering.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.063 align:middle line:90%
It's at the point--

00:06:26.063 --> 00:06:27.230 align:middle line:90%
>> My chakras are festering?

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:90%

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.395 align:middle line:84%
And then that pulled
them all up tonight.

00:06:42.395 --> 00:06:43.520 align:middle line:90%
I think you're fighting it.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.975 align:middle line:90%
You just need to go with it.

00:06:44.975 --> 00:06:47.350 align:middle line:84%
>> The funny thing is, I
haven't mentioned anything about

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:49.430 align:middle line:84%
the chakras once in
any of my classes.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.040 align:middle line:84%
I've tried to keep
it therapeutic.

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But you guys have raised
it more than I have.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.300 align:middle line:90%
Jules is just radiant now.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.030 align:middle line:84%
He's just like all
this beaming smile.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.570 align:middle line:90%
And he looks lighter.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.660 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how to explain
that, but he looks lighter.

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.680 align:middle line:84%
His energy is lighter, and
his posture has changed,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.730 align:middle line:90%
and it's incredible.

early as per usual.

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:19.220 align:middle line:84%
But this time, it's
not the walking

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.520 align:middle line:90%
that motivates his excursion.

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Proud owner of
my first juice.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.127 align:middle line:84%
And I'm just going to
look at it for a bit.

00:07:31.127 --> 00:07:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to look
at you looking at it.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.235 align:middle line:90%
Now that's a good look.

00:07:34.235 --> 00:07:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Own it, Milts.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.440 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's it.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.270 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been tough.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.090 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think
it'd be that tough.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I've been all right, but
then certain times, you

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:42.680 align:middle line:84%
get a little bit
of a mood swing.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.370 align:middle line:84%
So I was just wondering
what that was.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.370 align:middle line:84%
Speaking to other people,
they were just saying,

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.710 align:middle line:90%
oh, because you're ain't eating.

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.960 align:middle line:90%
It makes me weak at the knees.

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.225 align:middle line:84%
>> But now I'm
going to taste it.

00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:52.705 align:middle line:84%
>> It's even there
for that stuff.

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:55.600 align:middle line:90%
Oh, look at that.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:90%
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:58.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Feel better.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:07:59.910 align:middle line:90%
More energy.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:00.810 align:middle line:90%
You know what I mean?

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:04.653 align:middle line:84%
And just get back on
the plant-based diet.

00:08:04.653 --> 00:08:06.320 align:middle line:84%
I think that's going
to be a good thing.

It's an island

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.200 align:middle line:10%
appear to have
dropped out of society

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.070 align:middle line:10%
and are living what you call
an alternative lifestyle

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:02.330 align:middle line:10%
or what they would call
an alternative lifestyle.

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.040 align:middle line:84%
Although the alternative
appears to have

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:08.323 align:middle line:84%
a bit of a uniform and people
look the same, and it's a gang.

00:11:08.323 --> 00:11:09.740 align:middle line:84%
Not a gang, that's
the wrong word.

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.100 align:middle line:90%

sitting at home in London,

look at this tribe and think,

00:11:18.355 --> 00:11:19.710 align:middle line:90%
I want to be part of that tribe.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:22.680 align:middle line:84%

things in here that would help

everybody, not just hippies.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.330 align:middle line:90%
Do you know what I mean?

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, hippies have
quite an easy access to this,

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.680 align:middle line:90%
even when they are back home.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:84%

that aren't hippies

that are working
very long hours, that

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.850 align:middle line:84%
have three kids, that are
supporting a family, that really

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:41.712 align:middle line:84%
actually need the

00:11:41.712 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%

at it.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Because I think a lot of
them, and I'm including myself

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:48.850 align:middle line:84%
in this, are slightly
put off as well

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:53.110 align:middle line:84%
by the whole spiritual sense
of there's all this other stuff

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.145 align:middle line:90%

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:47.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, everyone.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:52.075 align:middle line:10%
>> [CHUCKLES] I'm Orlon.

00:19:52.075 --> 00:19:54.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm Orlan, Phra Olan.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.540 align:middle line:10%
Phra it's mean a monk.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:00.060 align:middle line:10%
Monk, yeah, little monk.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] I'm little monk.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.020 align:middle line:10%
Not normal monk.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.760 align:middle line:10%
Let's no matter.

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.070 align:middle line:10%
So nice to meet you, everybody.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.210 align:middle line:10%
First welcome to the temple.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:16.940 align:middle line:10%
My story is that a family
man with 3 children.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:10%
I lived here for a long time.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.770 align:middle line:84%
I've been married to
a Swiss woman before,

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:24.410 align:middle line:84%
and I lived in
Switzerland for 13 years.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:10%
Yourself, you don't
want to be bad people.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:28.470 align:middle line:10%
You know what is bad
and what is good.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:32.370 align:middle line:10%
But sometime the ego takes
you to make something bad.

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.500 align:middle line:10%
When you hear
something, just let it.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.500 align:middle line:10%
It's not your problem.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.570 align:middle line:10%
You know, you just hear, you
hear, be at peace with them.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:40.440 align:middle line:10%
Be peace.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.440 align:middle line:10%
Not stressed.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:44.000 align:middle line:10%
You should live relaxed.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.520 align:middle line:84%
>> If I watch all my thoughts
go by, I will end up sitting

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.140 align:middle line:84%
on an island here and not
looking after anybody.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
It's my job and responsibility
to look after people.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.370 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:57.480 align:middle line:10%
You have to first
look after yourself.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.210 align:middle line:10%
You are just thinking
about taking care everyone,

00:21:00.210 --> 00:21:02.690 align:middle line:10%
but you are in trouble.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:05.550 align:middle line:10%
So come back and take
care of yourself first.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.552 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a nice idea to
go through life smiling,

00:21:07.552 --> 00:21:09.510 align:middle line:84%
but it's very difficult
sometimes when there is

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.790 align:middle line:90%
something burning inside you.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Meditation is not going
to get to it, is it?

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.220 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You can smile, but you are
pretending to smile if something

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:17.890 align:middle line:90%
inside is hurting.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.890 align:middle line:10%
>> I understand this the same.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle line:10%
Me also have many
stone inside me before.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.210 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] Very heavy.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.300 align:middle line:10%
Smile, but only mouth,
it's not from heart.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:33.400 align:middle line:10%
But now how to empty them and
to be free to smile from heart.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.660 align:middle line:90%
>> But how?

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.600 align:middle line:84%
>> Walk for three
hours in meditation.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.720 align:middle line:10%
When you go to meditation,
you know you are free.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:48.840 align:middle line:10%
Aware, but after 10 minutes, I
am living in the whole world.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.560 align:middle line:10%
You know, you start to be peace.

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:54.630 align:middle line:10%
But when we start to walk
and you be aware, every time,

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:10%
every moment you feel your
body, you stay by your body,

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:10%
you take this and you can see
the thinking and everything,

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.630 align:middle line:10%
it passes through.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.367 align:middle line:10%
Real benefit when
you can walk first.

00:22:06.367 --> 00:22:08.700 align:middle line:84%
>> All I got from that was
somebody being really selfish

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.867 align:middle line:84%
about themselves, following
their own waste because.

00:22:10.867 --> 00:22:12.660 align:middle line:84%
He owns a bloody
great hotel, he's

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:84%
able to step aside and leave
his family for two years

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.997 align:middle line:84%
and go and follow his
own selfish interests.

00:22:16.997 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:10%
I don't see how he gets
to lecture me on what part

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.790 align:middle line:10%
of my life I'm missing out on.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.520 align:middle line:10%
>> This is why we have
to learn together.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.120 align:middle line:10%
I would like to invite
everybody to come and enjoy

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.670 align:middle line:10%
walking meditation,
about 3.5 hours to walk,

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.420 align:middle line:10%
and then you will
understand about this.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Perceiving Nick's skepticism,
Orlon has invited them all back

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:44.430 align:middle line:84%
in the next few days for
a rare opportunity to get

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:48.886 align:middle line:84%
into the world of a Buddhist
monk in a 3.5 hour walking

00:22:48.886 --> 00:22:49.686 align:middle line:90%
meditation.

00:22:49.686 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:90%


00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:90%
Next time on the retreat.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.230 align:middle line:90%
>> It was in the warm-up.

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:01.400 align:middle line:84%
And yeah, where we
tapping, and we were just

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.870 align:middle line:84%
waking up the
meridians of the body

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.250 align:middle line:90%
and getting the energy flowing.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.610 align:middle line:90%
And Nick walked off.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.790 align:middle line:90%
I find that quite rude.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:12.450 align:middle line:84%
>> We've given up sugar,
caffeine, alcohol, meat, dairy,

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.250 align:middle line:90%
wheat.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:14.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:14.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Cigarettes.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:15.430 align:middle line:90%
>> The ciggies.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, cigarettes,
everything for a month.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:20.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Just can't relax.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.200 align:middle line:90%
I can't get--

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.270 align:middle line:84%
I'm not enjoying
what we're doing.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:25.262 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no, no.

00:23:25.262 --> 00:23:26.708 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.680 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm dead.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.576 align:middle line:90%
I'm all done.
