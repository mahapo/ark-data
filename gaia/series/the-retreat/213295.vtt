we got given a program of what

wheatgrass.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:90%

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.628 align:middle line:90%
>> So this is like your food.

00:02:19.628 --> 00:02:22.468 align:middle line:84%
>> For long, which I didn't
think it was going to be.

00:02:22.468 --> 00:02:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And they're going to take
some blood, and then, I believe,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.030 align:middle line:90%
a chest X-ray afterwards.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.240 align:middle line:90%

the cheap stuff in my [BLEEP]..

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.960 align:middle line:84%

to kind of record for
anything that we want

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.190 align:middle line:90%

It's 6:30, the 5th.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.840 align:middle line:90%
We're going in now.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.590 align:middle line:84%
We're going to now spend the
rest of the week on a new diet,

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:90%
I suppose.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.390 align:middle line:90%
It's to clean our bodies out.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Every day includes
a detox regime,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.640 align:middle line:84%

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:90%

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.880 align:middle line:90%

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi, Maggie.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.480 align:middle line:90%
Good morning.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.592 align:middle line:90%
How are you feeling?

00:03:39.592 --> 00:03:41.550 align:middle line:10%
>> I had a really good
night's sleep, actually,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.170 align:middle line:10%
so I'm feeling way better.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Good morning, Kathy.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.440 align:middle line:90%
How are you, princess?

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Fine, and you?

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.770 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.490 align:middle line:84%

you, sweetheart?

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.290 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm great.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.470 align:middle line:90%
Had loads of sleep.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.270 align:middle line:90%
Feel much better.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.550 align:middle line:84%
Walked into town about
4 o'clock this morning.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Partied.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Partied, had a little
few beers, a bit of pool,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.600 align:middle line:90%
of snooker.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:10%
>> The team seems like--

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.460 align:middle line:10%
the first day, they were
all doing their own thing.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And now, they're starting
to share with each other,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.130 align:middle line:84%
and I think Billy is really
helping out with that.

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.337 align:middle line:90%
>> Morning, Nick.

00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:13.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Morning, morning.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Come to join the party?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.740 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.779 align:middle line:90%
>> The detox party.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.899 align:middle line:90%
>> Colonical detox party.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.310 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a pumping
headache since yesterday.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you want to have a
look at the nice ingredients?

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.350 align:middle line:10%
There's a detox drink there.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.500 align:middle line:10%
That's the hass, and
there's the measurements.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.368 align:middle line:10%
And obviously, that is
the glass we fill it in.

00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:38.910 align:middle line:10%
>> And we don't want to talk
about what that little thing is.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.707 align:middle line:10%
>> No, the little thing would
be put up somewhere like that.

00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you put the
water in the fridge?

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:90%
>> --loads of drops in the box.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> As well as the regime of
supplements to speed the detox,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.390 align:middle line:84%
it includes a psyllium drink to
aid digestion while not eating.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.330 align:middle line:84%
There's a man, used
to drink in pints.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.600 align:middle line:84%
>> That's us clear now until
8:30 when you have to take two

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.012 align:middle line:90%
supplements and two chompers.

00:05:04.012 --> 00:05:05.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I didn't get all that bit.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.940 align:middle line:90%
>> These ones here are my mesua.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.773 align:middle line:90%
>> That's all right.

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:07.980 align:middle line:90%
>> They're doing fine.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.380 align:middle line:84%
I thought they were going
to be more grumpy than that.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.133 align:middle line:90%
The only grumpy one is Nick.

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you do your
homework, by the way?

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.350 align:middle line:90%
Did you read about your colema?

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:18.910 align:middle line:90%
>> I've only got the little bit.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.530 align:middle line:84%
You've got an hour and
a half to read it now.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.525 align:middle line:84%
>> You can have a
cappuccino, a latte.

00:05:24.525 --> 00:05:25.920 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.880 align:middle line:90%
>> Day one.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.770 align:middle line:84%
I just want to let
you know that Milton's

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.360 align:middle line:84%
going to be on a different
program than you.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:84%
He's not going to
be fasting today.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
We're going to make him do
a longer pre-cleanse just

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.210 align:middle line:90%
to be safe.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.050 align:middle line:84%
He has all the chances
to control and reverse

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.780 align:middle line:84%
his diabetes, so we're going
to do it the proper way.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.480 align:middle line:84%
We're treating
Milton in a way that

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.580 align:middle line:84%
is different from
Western practice.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.800 align:middle line:90%
Yes, this is true.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.790 align:middle line:84%
And the Western world,
the Western medicine, they

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:54.910 align:middle line:90%
don't know about this.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.170 align:middle line:90%
They're not trained for this.

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.690 align:middle line:84%
They're trained
to treat patients

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.950 align:middle line:84%
with invasive surgery, which
we need a lot of the time.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.210 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying we don't
need conventional medicine.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.010 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.370 align:middle line:90%
A lot of people are sick.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.170 align:middle line:90%
They have pain.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.210 align:middle line:90%
They need painkillers.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.990 align:middle line:90%
But here, that's not what we do.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.830 align:middle line:84%
So how do you feel this morning
waking up on this first day

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.710 align:middle line:90%
where there will be no meal?

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.510 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm fine.

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Fine.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I was quite
bothered about that.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.460 align:middle line:84%
I was very headachy last
night and through the night

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.300 align:middle line:90%
and this morning.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, withdrawn symptoms.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of you smoke,
I think, yeah?

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.970 align:middle line:90%
>> You quit?

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:27.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Who else smokes?

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.902 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is the
most difficult part.

00:06:31.902 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't tell my folks.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a top secret.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.550 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The nicotine will be in
your system for about two,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:38.760 align:middle line:90%
three days.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.230 align:middle line:90%
It's the first day of the fast.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:41.580 align:middle line:90%
You're grumpy.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.740 align:middle line:90%
You regret doing this.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.040 align:middle line:84%
You're waiting for that
meal that will not come,

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.500 align:middle line:84%
so it's difficult. The
first day is difficult.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.530 align:middle line:84%
Here, there's a restaurant, so
they can see and smell the food.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.140 align:middle line:90%
That's also very difficult.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.350 align:middle line:90%
Expect some headaches.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.810 align:middle line:84%
People that drink a
lot of coffee also,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.857 align:middle line:84%
expect to be a little bit
tired, but mostly hungry.

00:07:00.857 --> 00:07:02.940 align:middle line:84%
The body is going to burn
the sugar inside of you.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.090 align:middle line:84%
You still have
reserves, but that's not

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.090 align:middle line:90%
going to be for so long.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.360 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be just today.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.450 align:middle line:84%
And then the body goes
into another mode.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.670 align:middle line:84%
The liver is going to
produce ketones to nourish

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.240 align:middle line:90%
the brain and other tissues.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:90%
So today, don't expect too much.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.150 align:middle line:84%
You might be a
little bit grumpy.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.392 align:middle line:90%
>> No, we're not.

00:07:19.392 --> 00:07:21.120 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.800 align:middle line:90%
>> But it's perfectly normal.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.020 align:middle line:90%
Just embrace it.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Usually, the thinnest people
have the most difficulties

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.650 align:middle line:90%
when it comes to being tired.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:34.497 align:middle line:84%
Because you have less fat, you
have less food for your body,

00:07:34.497 --> 00:07:36.330 align:middle line:84%
so usually, you get a
little bit more tired.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:40.260 align:middle line:84%
But the more fat you got,
the more energy you have.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.478 align:middle line:84%
>> Why'd you look
at me for that?

00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:44.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you're just
looking at the sky, are you?

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Happened to be looking in
that direction, that's all.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, you guys are
going to come to me.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's go for a run.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.070 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going
to do some colema.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Exciting.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.730 align:middle line:84%
>> You're possibly the only
person who does get excited when

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.960 align:middle line:90%
you do it.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But first, before
they can do the colema,

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.282 align:middle line:84%
Dominique gives
them a masterclass.

00:08:04.282 --> 00:08:05.740 align:middle line:84%
>> In your room,
you have a kettle.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.790 align:middle line:84%
You fill it up with water,
and you boil it, OK?

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And then you prepare
for the colema.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's go.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.410 align:middle line:90%
This is the colema tip.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.160 align:middle line:84%
The part that has holes is the
part that goes inside of you.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.590 align:middle line:84%
There's a side with no
holes, side with holes.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.930 align:middle line:84%
And then you will connect,
with this connector here,

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.530 align:middle line:90%
this tube to this tube.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.410 align:middle line:90%
So you need to plug it in, OK?

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:31.137 align:middle line:84%
It's going to be
hard, and it's good

00:08:31.137 --> 00:08:32.679 align:middle line:84%
that it's hard
because you don't want

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.890 align:middle line:84%
it to fall during the
colema, so this is good, OK?

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.230 align:middle line:84%
This will go inside
the colema board

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:40.809 align:middle line:84%
and then the tube will go
outside of the colema board.

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:42.280 align:middle line:90%
So there is a hole.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.940 align:middle line:84%
You plug it in and plug
your tube, and that's it.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.810 align:middle line:90%
All done, OK?

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.650 align:middle line:84%
A little trick, I like
to have my butt cleaner

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:90%
here close to me.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:90%
>> This is ridiculous.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.330 align:middle line:84%
>> And by massaging, you're
going to move that solidified

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.210 align:middle line:84%
food that is inside of
you that you want out, OK?

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be released
with the water after, OK?

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.420 align:middle line:84%
If you feel like you have a bump
somewhere, like a little ball,

00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.980 align:middle line:90%
that might be a blockage.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it takes
days for it to come out.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I've seen balls coming out
after eight days of fasts.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Sounds special if your
balls are going to come out.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Big surprise.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Are you scared?

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:22.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, frightened.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I was frightened
the first time.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.930 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:30.620 align:middle line:84%
>> I expected something to suck
it out, but it's all gravity,

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.420 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.530 align:middle line:90%
>> All gravity, yes.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:90%
But it's more gentle for you.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.640 align:middle line:84%
It's more gentle for you
than having the machine

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:90%
with the pressure.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.593 align:middle line:90%
Definitely.

00:09:39.593 --> 00:09:40.510 align:middle line:90%
And then you're alone.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.885 align:middle line:84%
You don't have
somebody with you.

00:09:41.885 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:90%
It's more private.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:84%
>> I feel real rough,
so maybe Jules?

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.090 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm out.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>> If you want to--

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.225 align:middle line:90%
>> Why does he keep--

00:09:48.225 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>> He's been asking
me to help him.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:90%
>> In the room?

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.645 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you live
next door, don't you?

00:09:52.645 --> 00:09:55.697 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you have a
door in between your room.

00:09:55.697 --> 00:09:58.030 align:middle line:84%
>> You're not seriously
expecting him to help you during

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.830 align:middle line:90%
this.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, he could talk to me.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.990 align:middle line:90%
It'd make me feel relaxed.

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.710 align:middle line:90%
>> I wouldn't want to--

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I don't even want to
be on the same campus

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.950 align:middle line:84%
whilst you're doing it, let
alone in the same building.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:06.750 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:07.350 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:09.642 align:middle line:84%
But if I do panic, you'd be
there for me, wouldn't you?

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Not really, not
during this, no.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:13.757 align:middle line:90%
>> Not when you're in mid-flow.

00:10:13.757 --> 00:10:15.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if I'm in mid-flow,
I won't be panicking.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.480 align:middle line:90%
I'll be happy, wouldn't I?

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.450 align:middle line:10%
>> I'll be there on the
other side of the door.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:28.530 align:middle line:84%
>> All right, note to self,
going into a detox after

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.070 align:middle line:84%
Christmas and New Year's,
maybe not a good idea.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.140 align:middle line:84%
I definitely think
it would have been

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:44.140 align:middle line:84%
good to do a week of healthy
raw food and no partying

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:90%
This is one kick ass detox.

not talk to each other about it

00:10:53.208 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:84%

lads on the site that we've done

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.550 align:middle line:90%
this, either.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's all right
to talk about this.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.101 align:middle line:84%
If we help each other out,
we won't tell anybody.

Not all of them went.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.750 align:middle line:90%
We're missing some people.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.830 align:middle line:90%
Nick disappeared.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.810 align:middle line:84%
Some of them are tired,
so I think that we're

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:21.290 align:middle line:90%
going to rethink the schedule.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.090 align:middle line:90%
It's OK.

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.040 align:middle line:90%

later during the month.

And I'm a bit like Kathy.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.680 align:middle line:84%
I haven't examined
what's in there,

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.410 align:middle line:84%
but it seems to be mostly
fluid, as opposed to anything--

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:12.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Solid.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:12.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Solid.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So it would only be the first
day you would have had solids.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:17.550 align:middle line:90%
You might have blockages there.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:18.522 align:middle line:90%
It's totally normal.

00:18:18.522 --> 00:18:20.980 align:middle line:84%

awful lot of blockages there.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:32.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Colema, they've
been quite daunting.

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.840 align:middle line:84%
Day one and two
were a bit tricky.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:84%
And I'm quite proud
to say this on camera,

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.170 align:middle line:84%
I've never actually ever stuck
anything up my bottom before,

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:47.080 align:middle line:84%
so this was a first, and I think
I'm actually quite enjoying them

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:47.880 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
But then Billy's not

>> One person, in particular,
who obviously will remain

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:09.570 align:middle line:84%
anonymous, but otherwise, he
goes by the name of Billy,

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.330 align:middle line:90%
he seems to love it.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.130 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't like it.

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.380 align:middle line:90%
I don't like talking about it.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I don't like the
conversations we've

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.070 align:middle line:90%
had around the table about it.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.910 align:middle line:90%
None of that.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:20.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know if it's a
Northern Southern hemisphere

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:22.020 align:middle line:90%
thing that's--

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:25.320 align:middle line:84%
but yeah, he's really taking
to it, and he's enjoying it.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:31.057 align:middle line:84%
I believe he let the film
crew in to sample it.

00:19:31.057 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:84%
I haven't seen much of the
crew around lately, actually,

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:34.190 align:middle line:90%

week.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:39.280 align:middle line:90%
>> It's been great.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.290 align:middle line:84%
It's been ups and
downs, but I think

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.675 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling the best I've
kind of felt in a while.

00:19:45.675 --> 00:19:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:49.820 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>> What are you up to, Jules?

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Popping my last--

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:53.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Chomper.

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Chomper, whatever that is.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Chomper, yellow one.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And now we're
going to have the--

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.778 align:middle line:84%
>> I did mine run the other
way, but it doesn't matter.

00:20:02.778 --> 00:20:04.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So I think I'm the
complete opposite to Billy.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm not enjoying
one second of it.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:08.240 align:middle line:90%
I'm disliking the tablets.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:90%
I'm disliking the drinks.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.020 align:middle line:84%
I just-- pretty much
everything about it,

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:14.630 align:middle line:90%
I just don't like it at all.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:17.870 align:middle line:84%

little bit of trouble with--

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.720 align:middle line:84%
a lot of trouble with
the whole process.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.050 align:middle line:84%
I think that he reminds me of
many people that come here.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.280 align:middle line:90%
They come to join their friends.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.240 align:middle line:84%
They come because they want
to experience something.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:84%
I think he just wanted to
go on an adventure with Nick

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.020 align:middle line:90%
and Billy.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And he wanted to
try something new,

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:38.828 align:middle line:84%
but he never expected this
process to be so hard.

00:20:38.828 --> 00:20:41.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Probably feeling a bit
grumpy because I got sunburnt

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:41.920 align:middle line:90%
yesterday.

>> Yeah, we got sunburnt.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.270 align:middle line:90%
No, it was just the two of us.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:46.187 align:middle line:84%
To be honest, we got
badly sunburnt yesterday.

00:20:46.187 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's hurting immensely.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And even lying on the
board is hurting immensely.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Morning.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.653 align:middle line:84%

of lobsters in the group.

00:20:54.653 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:90%

little aloe vera garden here.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.310 align:middle line:84%
Just blasted that all
over the red spot.

Claire, she's opening up.

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.780 align:middle line:90%
It was very nice.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.198 align:middle line:84%
I cried quite a
lot, but it was--

00:21:53.198 --> 00:21:54.740 align:middle line:84%
I suppose the best
way I can describe

00:21:54.740 --> 00:22:00.060 align:middle line:84%
it is it's like asking for
help from the universe.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:00.860 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.190 align:middle line:90%
>> And she is a channel.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.060 align:middle line:84%
>> And she is a channel
to you, to the universe.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:07.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's all, again,
very positive,

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:11.580 align:middle line:84%
clearing out the negative
thoughts and feelings

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and basically telling you
that you can turn the page

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:21.690 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have to be
the actor in your old movie.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:26.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And you can start afresh.

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:90%
So that was really nice.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.880 align:middle line:90%
And I think she uses a stone.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Same thing with Kathy.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.340 align:middle line:90%
She feels unblocked.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.260 align:middle line:90%
They have more energy.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.260 align:middle line:90%
They want to go to yoga.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:35.680 align:middle line:90%
They want to go for a walk.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.140 align:middle line:84%
They want to talk
about the detox.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:39.180 align:middle line:90%
So the bad days are gone now.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:40.110 align:middle line:90%
So this is very good.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:45.967 align:middle line:84%

another 15 minutes' walk.
