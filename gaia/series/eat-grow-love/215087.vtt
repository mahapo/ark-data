00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:10%
When we look at
the issue of food

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.400 align:middle line:10%
and we see all these
statistics that we're

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:10%
going to have to double food
production to feed the world's

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.960 align:middle line:10%
population in so many
decades, but if we

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.670 align:middle line:10%
look at actually the food
situation right now, as it is,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:10%
40% of it is wasted.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.850 align:middle line:84%
So that's why
permaculture is also

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.570 align:middle line:84%
concerned about what we call
the invisible structures

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.510 align:middle line:84%
and the structures of
business and recycling

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
and the relationships
between things,

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.850 align:middle line:84%
and not just only the
production of food.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Here's our 2 and 1/2
hectare property.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And the whole property
has been designed

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:90%
according to permaculture.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.710 align:middle line:10%
So one of the first
things in the design

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.330 align:middle line:10%
is looking at your
sun and wind factors

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.560 align:middle line:10%
so that you can
identify opportunities

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:10%
for creating microclimates.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.200 align:middle line:84%
So we call this a sector
analysis, our summer and winter

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.520 align:middle line:84%
sun pathways and the different
winds that come in and influence

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:90%
the properties.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.880 align:middle line:84%
So up the back here
is it rises up,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.580 align:middle line:84%
we've got our
subtropical food forest,

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.540 align:middle line:84%
which is created as a
frost-free microclimate.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.450 align:middle line:84%
And here we used a
form of biomimicry.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.080 align:middle line:84%
So you can see here
this is the plan

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.013 align:middle line:84%
of how this was implemented over
the first seven to eight years.

00:05:54.013 --> 00:06:01.010 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Now we're going to head
up to the food forest

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.410 align:middle line:84%
where I've created my
frost-free microclimate.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.470 align:middle line:84%
So here in the
subtropics, while we

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.650 align:middle line:84%
have these very tropical
summers, in winter,

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:18.810 align:middle line:84%
we can have beautiful warm days
of around 20 degrees Celsius.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:84%
But at night, it can
get down to 0 and even

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.250 align:middle line:84%
minus 4 degrees down in the
lowest part of the property.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.350 align:middle line:84%
So here we're just
a little bit higher,

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:90%
so it doesn't get quite as cold.

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.290 align:middle line:84%
But by creating this
beautiful canopy here,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.220 align:middle line:84%
we've created a
frost-free microclimate

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.293 align:middle line:84%
for growing our frost-sensitive
tropical and subtropical fruits.

00:06:44.293 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.540 align:middle line:84%
One of the great things
about permaculture

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.320 align:middle line:84%
is you can apply it
anywhere because it's

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:03.540 align:middle line:84%
based on principles like
how, in this situation,

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:90%
do we conserve energy?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.860 align:middle line:90%
How do we store energy?

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:90%
How do we link the systems?

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.500 align:middle line:84%
How can we create cycles for
nutrients and water and energy?

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.250 align:middle line:84%
And how can we maximize the
productivity of the system?

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:28.110 align:middle line:84%
How can we ensure that
we're building in mechanisms

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.060 align:middle line:90%
to adjust and accept feedback?

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.910 align:middle line:84%
And so it's really
directives on how we think

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and how we design
systems, rather than

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.950 align:middle line:84%
just a particular technique for
how you grow a particular crop.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:84%
And those techniques are very
specific to different climates

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.900 align:middle line:84%
and to different
scales of operation.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.203 align:middle line:84%
So we can apply
permaculture in any climate.

00:07:58.203 --> 00:08:00.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:01.760 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So here we are at the temperate
food forest or orchard actually.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.030 align:middle line:84%
And so here we
don't have a canopy.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.120 align:middle line:84%
The tropical food forest
is very different.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.810 align:middle line:84%
Here we want the
cold air to come in

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.090 align:middle line:84%
because the citrus are
one of the main crops

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:21.890 align:middle line:90%
that we have here.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
We've got 18 different
varieties and they really

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
enjoy a little
chill in the winter.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.195 align:middle line:84%
And it brings the sugars
out in the fruits.

00:08:30.195 --> 00:08:41.049 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:44.750 align:middle line:90%
So here you can see our workers.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:90%
Our workforce for the orchard.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.010 align:middle line:84%
They're our orchard
managers over there,

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:51.300 align:middle line:90%
our little flock of ducks.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And they fertilize
the trees for us

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and they keep the bugs
down and eat the weeds.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:04.465 align:middle line:84%
And they have a wonderful time
working hard all day long.

00:09:04.465 --> 00:09:09.710 align:middle line:90%


00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.570 align:middle line:84%
We've just got these
little ponds here for them.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.520 align:middle line:90%
And they love to go for a swim.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.940 align:middle line:84%
But when they swim, they also
like to go to the toilet.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So after a week, this
is nice and juicy

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:27.530 align:middle line:84%
and so then we can just tip
this up to irrigate a tree.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:32.430 align:middle line:84%
And so all that beautiful water
and nutrients feeds this tree.

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll move it
along to another spot

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.070 align:middle line:84%
and we'll fill it up
with some fresh water.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And next week, we'll do
the whole thing again.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So it keeps the ducks happy,
it keeps the trees happy.

00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.185 align:middle line:84%
And of course, the
produce keeps us happy.

00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:50.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you can smell
something, can't you?

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:90%
You smell something good?

00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:01.060 align:middle line:84%
Meet Poly, Poly Culture,
the permaculture pig.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.630 align:middle line:84%
She is our champion
poo producer.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.980 align:middle line:84%
So she provides the
nutrients and the manure

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.910 align:middle line:84%
for our compost to keep
the garden growing.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.570 align:middle line:90%
And we've trained her.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.550 align:middle line:90%
She sits for treats.

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:19.480 align:middle line:84%
And so the training means that
we can take her for little

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:84%
walks down into the orchard
when there's any fallen fruit.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.830 align:middle line:84%
And she'll clean that
up off the ground.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And we also take her
for little walks up.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:84%
We've got a special area where
she goes to work tractoring.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.055 align:middle line:84%
And she is just the most
amazing biological plow.

00:10:38.055 --> 00:10:53.270 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:55.050 align:middle line:90%
So this is our highest point.

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:57.440 align:middle line:84%
So we've got this
small pond here

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.420 align:middle line:84%
that gravity feeds
the water down

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.150 align:middle line:84%
for the gardens and
all the animal systems.

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.400 align:middle line:84%
And so the water movement
through the entire property

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.070 align:middle line:84%
is managed and directed
from this point.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And of course, just
below this dam,

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.950 align:middle line:90%
we have our food forest system.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.500 align:middle line:84%
Just been harvesting
some beautiful bunches

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.100 align:middle line:90%
of bananas from here.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And there's some macadamia
nuts ripening up through there.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And of course, it's so important
to have flowers in the system

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
so we keep our pollinators
around and something

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.973 align:middle line:84%
for the honeybees
and for the insects.

00:11:40.973 --> 00:11:47.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really
ancient form of citrus.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.590 align:middle line:84%
We call it the finger
lime because it's sort

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:90%
of about as big as your finger.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:12:00.460 align:middle line:84%
This plant is actually native
to our local rainforests.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.810 align:middle line:84%
And the chefs
absolutely love this one

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.760 align:middle line:84%
because you look
at what's inside.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:09.180 align:middle line:90%
It's a lime caviar.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.350 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:12.605 align:middle line:90%
That is just so good.

00:12:12.605 --> 00:12:24.270 align:middle line:90%


00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:29.440 align:middle line:84%
Taro's one of the key staple
foods throughout the tropics.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And actually,
what's interesting,

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
this is another example
of permaculture at work,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.880 align:middle line:90%
turning problems into solutions.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.580 align:middle line:84%
So we had big problems
with drainage here.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.700 align:middle line:90%
We dug a drain here.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.260 align:middle line:84%
I used the soil from that
to build up our garden beds,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
and now we're growing
the taro in the drain.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:84%
So the drain is
a production area

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.590 align:middle line:90%
for this crop that likes it wet.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:13:06.400 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.860 align:middle line:84%
The orientation of the
buildings, of course,

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.810 align:middle line:90%
for passive solar design.

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:13.640 align:middle line:10%
So here in the
southern hemisphere,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:10%
our sun's coming
in from the north.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.090 align:middle line:84%
And the buildings
are clustered so it's

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:24.350 align:middle line:84%
convenient for services like
energy and water and so forth.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:28.190 align:middle line:84%
And then the production
systems are surrounding that.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:32.710 align:middle line:84%
So we've got our main
vegetable-producing areas here,

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.870 align:middle line:84%
created special
microclimates in there.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.580 align:middle line:84%
The water systems, of course,
are managed all the way

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.970 align:middle line:84%
through from the top of the
property, this little high dam

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:46.610 align:middle line:84%
down to this one here, which
supports that microclimate, then

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.430 align:middle line:84%
through a series
of swales and then

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:53.720 align:middle line:84%
drains and ponds down to
the bottom of the property.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.350 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we're
closing the loop with things

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.560 align:middle line:84%
like our composting toilets
are providing nutrients

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.770 align:middle line:84%
for the garden that feed us
that go back to the composting

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.380 align:middle line:84%
toilet, so looking
at ways that we can

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.460 align:middle line:90%
close the loop through here.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:15.380 align:middle line:84%
And so on so many levels, we
are applying permaculture design

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:19.850 align:middle line:84%
from the big property
concept right down

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.340 align:middle line:90%
to the little details.

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.800 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.920 align:middle line:90%
There you go.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.260 align:middle line:84%
Here we've got our
waste treatment system.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:29.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not waste.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
There's no waste
in permaculture.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.640 align:middle line:90%
It's all resource.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So here we have a
reed bed that treats

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:39.170 align:middle line:84%
the greywater from the
shower and the kitchen

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.990 align:middle line:90%
in our accommodation facility.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Here, we've got our
composting toilets.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:84%
So we welcome people to
come and make a deposit

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:50.740 align:middle line:90%
to help the garden grow.

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.600 align:middle line:84%
And so we've got our
main toilets up there,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.473 align:middle line:84%
and this is the
composting chamber.

00:14:56.473 --> 00:15:08.940 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.680 align:middle line:84%
This bamboo, this
sequesters several tons

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.580 align:middle line:90%
of carbon every year.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.940 align:middle line:84%
So all the bamboo on
this place, that's

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:21.600 align:middle line:84%
my carbon sequestration
for my overseas teaching

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.530 align:middle line:90%
work, for my flights.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.200 align:middle line:84%
And this one is
absolutely delicious.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:31.650 align:middle line:84%
This shoot came up two weeks
ago, and in the next two months

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
it's going to grow
40 meters high.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.560 align:middle line:90%
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.145 align:middle line:84%
The fastest growing plant
on the planet is bamboo.

00:15:41.145 --> 00:15:53.500 align:middle line:90%


00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.290 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, it's important
to aim for sustainability,

00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:03.070 align:middle line:84%
but in permaculture, we try to
actually do better than that.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.280 align:middle line:10%
For example, when
I got this land,

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:11.810 align:middle line:10%
this 2 and 1/2 hectares of
an empty barren cow pasture,

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:17.830 align:middle line:10%
I could have sustained this very
sustainably as a cow pasture

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:23.590 align:middle line:10%
in perpetuity and
produced one cow a year.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:90%
But we can do better than that.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.590 align:middle line:90%
So that's sustainable.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.730 align:middle line:84%
But I had the capacity
here to actually

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:36.490 align:middle line:84%
regenerate this property, to
produce so much more than just

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.060 align:middle line:90%
one cow a year.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And so here we are, 22
years down the track

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:44.760 align:middle line:84%
and there's thousands
of plant species.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
I've got over 100 bird species
that live here permanently

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:51.210 align:middle line:90%
or come here seasonally.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
We have an abundance
of wildlife.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:58.530 align:middle line:84%
We produce a large
percentage of our food.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And we feed the courses
and the cafe clients

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.214 align:middle line:84%
and the people that
come through here.

00:17:05.214 --> 00:17:10.849 align:middle line:90%


00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:14.579 align:middle line:10%
Some of the most inspiring
systems I've seen develop

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.339 align:middle line:10%
have been in deserts
and arid zones,

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:20.730 align:middle line:10%
some of the harshest
environments in the world.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.329 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
cities, which is really

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:25.490 align:middle line:90%
another form of desert.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:29.630 align:middle line:10%
But yeah, permaculture
systems can

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:34.160 align:middle line:10%
do a lot to make our cities
and urban environments

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.665 align:middle line:10%
more resilient, more
people-friendly,

00:17:36.665 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:10%
and produce a lot
more of our needs.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.960 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.010 align:middle line:90%
