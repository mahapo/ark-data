Welcome to Solitude Farm.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Everything in Solitude
Farm starts with the soil.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.080 align:middle line:84%
So, in these fields, we have
beds and trenches and a bed

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.300 align:middle line:84%
and a trench and a bed and a
trench all over the gardens.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.190 align:middle line:84%
In these trenches, we have
placed all this organic matter,

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.720 align:middle line:90%
this bioresource--

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.210 align:middle line:84%

all sorts of organic matter

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
that's our profit, not
financial but nutritional.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.460 align:middle line:84%

The main problem that we
face in the world today

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.240 align:middle line:84%
is industrialized agriculture
has defined the nutritional

profile of our society.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:12.080 align:middle line:84%
It's conned us into believing
that this big fat eggplant is

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.880 align:middle line:90%
good food.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.519 align:middle line:84%
But in India, absolutely
sure, some farmers

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.230 align:middle line:84%
are injecting chemicals
into the eggplants.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a known fact
that people have

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
lost a relationship with
where their food comes from.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.260 align:middle line:84%
The society that doesn't know
where its food comes from

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:90%
is a society without culture.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And humanity without
culture will perish.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.320 align:middle line:90%
So there's our key point--

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that we lost something
essential to our humanity

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.300 align:middle line:84%
because we lost a relationship
with where our food comes from,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.480 align:middle line:84%
as a symptom of us losing
a relationship with nature,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.050 align:middle line:84%
which thus means a
relationship with ourselves.

So designs and ideas that we

have a value, but nature
knows so much more than us.

And the more you
live with fields

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:28.270 align:middle line:84%
and the more you try and negate
this idea that you can do better

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:34.000 align:middle line:84%

surprises and the more depth

We use them in smoothies.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.800 align:middle line:90%
We can cook a curry with them.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:59.680 align:middle line:84%
Later on, it'll give a flower,
which you can make a syrup with.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.360 align:middle line:84%
After the flour,
there's the fruit,

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.650 align:middle line:84%
that you can make a
different type of juice with.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.470 align:middle line:90%
And you can make a jam with it.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can dry it so you can
use it throughout the year.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's such a wonderful plant.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.990 align:middle line:84%
It grows like a weed,
literally, everywhere.

It's not that these

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.630 align:middle line:10%
It's just that-- ignored means
that you would know about them.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:22.030 align:middle line:10%
It's just that they're not--

relationship with the land.
