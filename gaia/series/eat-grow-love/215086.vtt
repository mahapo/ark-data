And when other eco-villages
in the world are lecturing,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:10%
they always mention
Solheimar, the first, 1930s,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.200 align:middle line:10%
then came others.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.250 align:middle line:84%
We are about 100 people
living in Solheimar today.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:90%
40 are people with disabilities.

We have our small
permaculture garden.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.730 align:middle line:84%
That was a project
that started 2012.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.470 align:middle line:10%
And because I have a little
bit of green fingers,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.639 align:middle line:10%
the manager decided
to send me to England.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:16.090 align:middle line:84%
It was a course of two weeks
and really just all in, all in.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.570 align:middle line:84%
I got so inspired by
all the knowledge they

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.430 align:middle line:90%
have there and how and what.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.670 align:middle line:84%
And think about the sun and the
water, think about the soil,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.550 align:middle line:84%
think about the person next
to you, the social way just

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.940 align:middle line:90%
to grow.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.650 align:middle line:90%
And I came back full of ideas.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is the troll
of the troll garden.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.350 align:middle line:90%
And the name we got from--

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
everybody in
Solheimar helped out

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:90%
choosing a name for this garden.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.130 align:middle line:84%
And the garden is the troll
garden because of this troll,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.960 align:middle line:90%
which is standing here.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is our
permaculture garden.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.540 align:middle line:84%
We didn't want to go too
close to the road, of course.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.500 align:middle line:90%
And then everything stops.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the gate.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.190 align:middle line:90%
This is the gate.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.990 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.090 align:middle line:90%
Come on into our troll garden.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.530 align:middle line:84%
So, as you can see, some of the
beds here are well raised up.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:29.120 align:middle line:84%
That was because some residents
said they can't bend over a lot.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.140 align:middle line:90%
So we took that away.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Now everybody can
enjoy the garden.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.010 align:middle line:84%
Even a wheelchair can
come and help out.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.870 align:middle line:90%
And you don't have to do a lot.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:84%
I mean, just be a
part of the garden.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.530 align:middle line:84%
Here, we fill this up with
the tree stumps like this.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
And so they are rotting
slowly and giving heat.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have a longer period
of time for growing.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.250 align:middle line:84%
After I went to the course in
England, I just designed it.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.180 align:middle line:90%
I drew it.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.010 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't want anything to
be like this so I did paths.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.630 align:middle line:10%
And I tried to think about
people with special needs,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.530 align:middle line:10%
wheelchairs.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.700 align:middle line:84%
That everybody can
go around the garden

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.070 align:middle line:84%
and enjoy it, and
without too much effort.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just a perfect
way, I think.

what you're doing.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.980 align:middle line:84%

doing, how they are working.

The garden is not just
about growing this and that.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.950 align:middle line:84%
It's also about
making people smile.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.750 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.970 align:middle line:90%
Is that a troll over there?

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.180 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It's a picture of a tree or
a bird bath or a small pond.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.140 align:middle line:84%
These things are so nice
because people go in the garden.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:28.740 align:middle line:84%
And they always go out smiling
and eating if everything's OK.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.040 align:middle line:84%

about Solheimar-- trying out

does this not work?

We have spiral.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And the spiral is, of course,
really an important thing

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.730 align:middle line:90%
in growing.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.460 align:middle line:84%
Because at the highest
point there's a lot of sun

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.300 align:middle line:90%
and the soil is dry.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.650 align:middle line:84%

more down and at the bottom

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.890 align:middle line:90%

Before we started
this garden here,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:08.520 align:middle line:84%
maybe 15 years before,
this was a potato garden.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And it was a heated-up
potato garden.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.810 align:middle line:90%
There were pipes underneath.

until I was digging here

like these pipes.

when they come.

00:11:04.045 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Everything we do here belongs
to the people in Solheimar.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:16.300 align:middle line:90%
We don't sell anything.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just for the
community to use.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.640 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of stuff
in the greenhouses,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.900 align:middle line:84%
like cucumbers and
paprika and tomatoes.

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.580 align:middle line:90%
Mostly tomatoes.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.891 align:middle line:90%
Many kinds of tomatoes also.

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:43.770 align:middle line:84%
Our hopes in Solheimar are to
expand the permaculture way.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.750 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot of
areas in Solheimar.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:50.430 align:middle line:90%
We still have to put trees down.

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:53.370 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, there's so
many possibilities.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:84%
And in Solheimar,
all the villages

00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
are so willing to take part
because they see the result.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes when you go
down in the garden later

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.390 align:middle line:84%
in the evening, there
are maybe three people

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.680 align:middle line:90%
taking salads for the dinner.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So everybody who
lives in Solheimar

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:14.270 align:middle line:90%
have a free use of the garden.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.560 align:middle line:90%
They can weed.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.520 align:middle line:84%
They can take salads
whenever they want.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.310 align:middle line:84%
It's open for everybody
who lives in Solheimar

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.000 align:middle line:90%
to use the garden as they want.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.630 align:middle line:84%
If you're doing the
permaculture way,

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:32.080 align:middle line:84%
you have to realize that
things don't happen tomorrow.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.650 align:middle line:90%
You have to take your time.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.436 align:middle line:90%
It takes a while.

00:12:36.436 --> 00:12:40.010 align:middle line:84%
First year, maybe you
look at your site.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.190 align:middle line:84%
Where is the sun and
how is the water going?

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And how is the soil, and
are there trees there?

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:50.920 align:middle line:84%
How can you use these
trees to make growth?

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.090 align:middle line:84%
And then the next year, you have
a little bit idea about what

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.360 align:middle line:90%
happened the year before.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:84%
Then you can start
slowly but surely.

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:00.970 align:middle line:90%
And things take time.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:06.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a path through
a garden, make sure

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:09.910 align:middle line:84%
that you're not putting the
path at the best place where

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.902 align:middle line:90%
you can grow things.

00:13:11.902 --> 00:13:20.000 align:middle line:10%
Make it crooked or
whatever, but make it--

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.674 align:middle line:10%
do it alive.

00:13:22.674 --> 00:13:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy it.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you're doing, enjoy it.

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:34.850 align:middle line:84%
For me, if someone is growing
something in the garden

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
and he's looking around and
seeing what tree over there,

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.040 align:middle line:84%
or it's too much water to
put anything down here,

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.470 align:middle line:84%
or this is a sunny
area here, I'm

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.600 align:middle line:84%
going to put this, that's
the permaculture way.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
educated to understand

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.850 align:middle line:84%
that the flower needs the
sun and she needs the water.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:59.440 align:middle line:84%
And if the wind is too much,
you move the tree a little bit.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.200 align:middle line:84%
Or you put a tree where the
wind is too much so the salad

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.700 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you're growing will
have shelter in the future.

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:12.320 align:middle line:84%
Now, I think you can call
it whatever you like.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.840 align:middle line:90%
For me, it's making food.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.110 align:middle line:84%
I am not a professional gardener
or a professional architect

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.060 align:middle line:84%
or whatever, but I
like creating things.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.860 align:middle line:84%
And if I feel that it
helps in our Solheimar

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.310 align:middle line:84%
community, this small
garden we have started here

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.340 align:middle line:84%
and I feel that
it's helping a lot.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.200 align:middle line:84%
But we are small and we
are in a cold climate.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.520 align:middle line:90%
But we can do it.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.950 align:middle line:84%
We can because we have the
energy and people are strong.

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:90%
And if they see that--

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.140 align:middle line:90%
I mean, just think about it.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:49.400 align:middle line:84%
We are in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.490 align:middle line:84%
If the routes between
other countries would stop,

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.370 align:middle line:90%
what do we do?

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:56.750 align:middle line:90%
We fish.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.990 align:middle line:90%
Is that enough?

00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:59.870 align:middle line:90%
And how are we going to fish?

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.460 align:middle line:84%
We don't have the oil,
but we can always grow.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:90%
We have this soil.

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.150 align:middle line:84%
We have the sun at
least for these times.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.400 align:middle line:84%
We have the sheep and
horses and all that.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.590 align:middle line:90%
So we can survive if we want.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:15.150 align:middle line:90%
If we really need to, we can.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:18.500 align:middle line:90%
