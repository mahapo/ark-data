00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
>> We're at Smiling
Hogshead Ranch.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.210 align:middle line:10%
It's smack dab in the
middle of New York City.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.410 align:middle line:90%
We started as a guerilla garden.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
That means we did not ask
permission to be here.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.050 align:middle line:84%
We knew that we
were trespassing,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:90%
and we did it anyway.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.310 align:middle line:84%
This is how we obtained
the right to use this land.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:84%
The property owner
saw what we were doing

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.165 align:middle line:84%
and decided it was a good thing,
and let us continue to do it.

00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:51.550 align:middle line:90%


00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.260 align:middle line:84%
It's been really good to create
this space from a formerly

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.790 align:middle line:84%
dumping site, with lots of
illicit types of activity

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:84%
happening here, and turn it into
a really productive green space

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.475 align:middle line:84%
for the city for people to
come, meet with one another,

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:07.350 align:middle line:84%
talk about the issues
that affect their lives

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.058 align:middle line:84%
and get their hands,
really, in the dirt.

00:02:09.058 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.640 align:middle line:84%
In terms of community
gardens in New York City,

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.350 align:middle line:90%
this is a relatively large one.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And if you look
around the edges here,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.760 align:middle line:84%
you'll notice that
there is no fence.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle line:84%
We're really happy with the fact
that we started this project

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.770 align:middle line:84%
with no fence, and that
even when we went official,

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.570 align:middle line:84%
and the property owners
wanted us to get a fence,

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.720 align:middle line:84%
the people who were
providing us insurance

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
wanted us to get a fence,
we fought against that idea.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.020 align:middle line:84%
We thought it was a
ridiculous that a place that

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.460 align:middle line:84%
had been opened for decades, for
people to dump their trash on,

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.640 align:middle line:84%
to come and do illicit
illegal activity,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.730 align:middle line:84%
we thought it was ridiculous
to bar people, now that we've

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:84%
cleaned it up and
put picnic tables

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.865 align:middle line:90%
and made it a nice place to be.

00:03:01.865 --> 00:03:09.012 align:middle line:90%


00:03:09.012 --> 00:03:12.740 align:middle line:84%
One of the drawbacks is
there is some vandalism,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and sometimes, there's a
little bit of theft, both--

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.160 align:middle line:84%
we had some plants laying out
earlier, and a couple of them

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.430 align:middle line:84%
got taken home by someone
who didn't ask for them.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle line:84%
And of course, when we
have beautiful plants,

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.290 align:middle line:84%
like when those
tomatoes come in,

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.740 align:middle line:84%
they're just
irresistible to people.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.390 align:middle line:84%
And they come, and they
take them sometimes,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.520 align:middle line:90%
so we try to discourage that.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.500 align:middle line:84%
One thing that we've actually
instituted this year,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.920 align:middle line:84%
we've created what we
call a compassion patch.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.090 align:middle line:84%
This was actually
a crate that we

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.520 align:middle line:84%
got from the dumpster of
a nearby metal fabrication

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.370 align:middle line:90%
company.

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:90%
And we just put it here.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.670 align:middle line:84%
We lined it, and we filled it
with some nice rich compost

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.750 align:middle line:84%
mixed in a little
bit of sand and loam,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.080 align:middle line:84%
and we planted some
chives and basil.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.850 align:middle line:84%
There's some bell pepper, a
couple marigolds, some jalapenos

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.326 align:middle line:90%
and some cucumbers.

00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.850 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we'll
paint on the side,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.450 align:middle line:84%
that this is for people to
pick and for the general public

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.680 align:middle line:90%
to enjoy.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.100 align:middle line:84%
We just ask that people don't
pick from our main garden.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.630 align:middle line:84%
And it really is more
of a social experiment

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.425 align:middle line:90%
than a by-the-book rules garden.

00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:37.010 align:middle line:90%


00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.550 align:middle line:90%
We're on a railroad site.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.280 align:middle line:84%
We're on an old
post-industrial site.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.670 align:middle line:84%
These railroad tracks were
owned by industry leaders,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.120 align:middle line:84%
industry captains here
in New York City that

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.930 align:middle line:90%
ran businesses around here.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.040 align:middle line:84%
So all this that we're
standing on was not here.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
This actually used
to be sacred hunting

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.530 align:middle line:84%
ground for the Indigenous
American peoples

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.620 align:middle line:84%
who would come here
and fish and hunt

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.360 align:middle line:84%
and capture animals so
they could bring it back.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.980 align:middle line:84%
There were certain times of
the year where certain plants

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
and animals were very abundant,
and they would come and meet

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.740 align:middle line:84%
their neighbors in these
places and trade rituals

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.060 align:middle line:84%
and find mates, even, to
share their lives with.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Hey.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.605 align:middle line:90%
[STREET NOISE]

00:05:23.605 --> 00:05:38.590 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.540 align:middle line:84%
There is no way
that we are saying

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that we're trying to bring it
back to what it used to be,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
because we have no pretense of
turning this into a wetland.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.540 align:middle line:84%
But what we try and do is create
a more biodiverse urban ecology

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.410 align:middle line:84%
for everyone to live in, to have
an interspecies dynamic going

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:56.210 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.220 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Fungus-- mushrooms are just
like any other microbes that are

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.090 align:middle line:90%
in the ground.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:84%
So when we're preparing mycelium
to grow mushrooms or what

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.860 align:middle line:84%
this is a mother
patch, and we're

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:19.480 align:middle line:84%
going to be using
this for community use

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.410 align:middle line:90%
and for our own use.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.550 align:middle line:84%
So this will just be a bed of
mycelium, and we'll take from it

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:middle line:90%
and expand from there.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
And the mycelium will be in
competition with other microbes.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So what we do, these barrels
are an anaerobic sterilization

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:90%
process.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:84%
They sit here for two
weeks, soaked in water.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And what I did is I took
woodchips from the barrels,

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.920 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to
fill the bag up.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:54.350 align:middle line:84%
After I take the mycelium, which
is a warm blue oyster mushroom,

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.420 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to mix it
in with the wood chips.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.720 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'm going
to fill the bags.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.010 align:middle line:84%
And after that is
done, I'm just going

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:12.260 align:middle line:84%
to set the bags aside and
let them do their course

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.520 align:middle line:90%
or what we call a spawn run.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, that will
either be fully inoculated,

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.550 align:middle line:84%
or it will actually
produce mushrooms.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.143 align:middle line:84%
So all you do is you
break up the mycelium.

00:07:26.143 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.350 align:middle line:84%
And mycelium is, basically,
the true body of a mushroom.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Mushroom is only the fruiting
body of the whole fungus.

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
And the only time that mushrooms
come out of the mycelium

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
is when the mycelium
has eaten all that it--

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.310 align:middle line:84%
not needs, but all that
is available to eat

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.175 align:middle line:84%
or the environment
changes for some reason.

00:07:50.175 --> 00:07:59.590 align:middle line:90%


00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I love compost.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.410 align:middle line:10%
Compost is the building block.

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.300 align:middle line:84%
It builds the humus
layer of the soil,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.770 align:middle line:84%
and the soil is the building
block of civilization.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.660 align:middle line:84%
If we don't respect
our soil, then we're

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:90%
disrespecting ourselves.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:16.650 align:middle line:90%
We need to build our soil.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:23.350 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.970 align:middle line:84%
We have seven different
types of composting.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.340 align:middle line:90%
We have three-bin systems.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:90%
We have windrows.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:90%
We have mushroom compost.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.370 align:middle line:90%
We have vermicompost with worms.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
We have bokashi-style compost,
which is with microorganisms.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:45.300 align:middle line:84%
We have leaf mold,
and we have humanure.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.000 align:middle line:84%
This is stropharia, a
species of mushroom,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
which we inoculated during
a workshop last year.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.220 align:middle line:10%
Underneath the
fruiting bodies, we

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:10%
have some really nice
mycelial network forming,

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.470 align:middle line:10%
and you can see some
of these hyphae,

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.810 align:middle line:10%
growing and holding the
mulch and soil together.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.000 align:middle line:90%
They're also bio remediators.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So right here, we have a
railroad tie and railroad

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:13.900 align:middle line:90%
tracks.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.920 align:middle line:84%
These guys were put here
by the human species,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.270 align:middle line:84%
and they've been off gassing
creosote for decades.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.420 align:middle line:84%
We're using these mushroom
as bio remediators

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.420 align:middle line:84%
to take out the
toxins in that wood

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:84%
and break it down
into more elemental

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.990 align:middle line:84%
components, and in some cases,
bioaccumulate in the actual

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.200 align:middle line:90%
fruiting body of the mushroom.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:42.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:45.890 align:middle line:84%
Our bokashi-- and what we
do is we collect food scraps

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.690 align:middle line:84%
from local businesses
and some residences.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.330 align:middle line:10%
And they pay us on
a monthly basis.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.545 align:middle line:84%
We pick up every week
or every other week,

00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:55.003 align:middle line:84%
depending on how
much they produce.

00:09:55.003 --> 00:10:00.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.523 align:middle line:84%
We usually do pick up with our
work trike or our bike trailer.

00:10:05.523 --> 00:10:14.540 align:middle line:90%


00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.580 align:middle line:84%
When we pick up those
buckets, we bring them back.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.140 align:middle line:84%
We can store them on site
for up to a few months,

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.933 align:middle line:84%
but we usually dig a trench
and put them in the ground

00:10:23.933 --> 00:10:24.733 align:middle line:90%
fairly quickly.

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:31.700 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.820 align:middle line:84%
Bokashi is a Japanese-style
of fermenting food scraps.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:38.040 align:middle line:84%
It uses effective
microorganisms.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's three different
types of microorganisms

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that don't normally
live together in nature.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
But when they're
put together, they

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:84%
can decompose food scraps
really quickly and effectively,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.340 align:middle line:90%
the whole urban diet.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:84%
So everything else-- we don't
take bones, dairy, greasy,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.130 align:middle line:90%
fatty foods.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.085 align:middle line:90%
But with the bokashi, we can.

00:11:00.085 --> 00:11:17.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Every Tuesday, during
the growing season,

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.780 align:middle line:90%
we have Terrific Tuesday.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.278 align:middle line:84%
So we get together after
work, around 5 o'clock.

00:11:24.278 --> 00:11:25.820 align:middle line:84%
Some people don't
get off to a later,

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:28.640 align:middle line:84%
so it starts to build over
the course of the evening.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And then just before
sunset, we'll take a break,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.300 align:middle line:90%
and we'll have a meal.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:36.410 align:middle line:84%
It's a potluck
meal, but the garden

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:39.320 align:middle line:90%
do provide a good bit of food.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:90%
So we do this every Tuesday.

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:84%
And what we have been
accomplishing by doing this

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:84%
is bringing together a
more cohesive community

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:52.600 align:middle line:84%
here in New York City, around
the idea of growing food

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.410 align:middle line:84%
together and eating
together, caring

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:59.750 align:middle line:84%
for each other's children, and
just caring for one another.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is definitely
like a social permaculture

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.600 align:middle line:90%
type of thing, but it's just--

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.130 align:middle line:84%
living in such a big
city, moving so quickly,

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.580 align:middle line:84%
doing so many things, you become
disconnected with the other.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And when you can slow down and
just pull some weeds or water

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
some plants and
plant some things

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.630 align:middle line:84%
and move some soil around with
some people on a regular basis

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:84%
and get to know them as
individuals while you're

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.520 align:middle line:90%
doing that, it's really great.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.280 align:middle line:84%
This whole area right
here has all been bokashi.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.230 align:middle line:84%
We've buried food
scraps in here,

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.060 align:middle line:90%
so we're enriching the soil.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And now it's acting as a nice
planting area for this apple

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.440 align:middle line:84%
tree-- this is
actually a pear tree

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:90%
and some nice annual flowers.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.100 align:middle line:84%
There's a stray parsley
plant over there.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
this looking really nice.

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:06.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
We're in the middle of
construction of a stormwater

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.390 align:middle line:90%
catchment system.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.730 align:middle line:84%
So this will be a system
that will capture stormwater

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:19.540 align:middle line:84%
into these 500-gallon
pods over here.

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.100 align:middle line:84%
And we can use that to wash
our hands, to clean buckets,

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.260 align:middle line:90%
and to water the garden.

00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:28.200 align:middle line:84%
But it also serves as
a covered area for us

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.457 align:middle line:84%
to have events
whenever it's raining.

00:13:30.457 --> 00:13:32.790 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that we
really need here at the garden

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:35.570 align:middle line:84%
is a shelter so that when it's
raining, we don't have to,

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.415 align:middle line:84%
all just run home
or leave the garden.

00:13:38.415 --> 00:13:40.290 align:middle line:84%
We can actually come
here, wait out the rain,

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:41.810 align:middle line:84%
and then continue
on our Workday,

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.030 align:middle line:84%
or continue the workshop,
whatever we're teaching

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.990 align:middle line:90%
or learning or playing.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.282 align:middle line:84%
Or whatever we're doing, we
can just continue doing it.

00:13:47.282 --> 00:13:57.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So permaculture, it's not a
strict set of steps to follow.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:05.330 align:middle line:84%
You have to actually
learn about the place

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:08.760 align:middle line:84%
that you're designing for before
you can actually design for it.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So it actually slows
people down enough

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.000 align:middle line:84%
to look at what is
around them, what's

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.770 align:middle line:84%
growing around them,
what kind of soil

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.400 align:middle line:84%
is under their feet,
what the average rainfall

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.110 align:middle line:84%
and temperature is
in their eco region,

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:27.650 align:middle line:84%
and starting to really
understand the biome that you're

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.680 align:middle line:84%
in and the microclimates
that surround you.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:32.360 align:middle line:84%
I think that's really
important, and I

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.170 align:middle line:84%
think that's one thing that
permaculture can really bring.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:39.820 align:middle line:90%
