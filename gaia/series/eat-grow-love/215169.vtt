00:00:03.984 --> 00:00:07.470 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.470 --> 00:01:25.690 align:middle line:90%


00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We're not just wanting
to make people aware of some

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.920 align:middle line:84%
of the challenges which we
face in the 21st century,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.870 align:middle line:84%
but also that there are ways
in which people can be part

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.020 align:middle line:90%
of the solution.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And for me, permaculture is
a good way of doing that.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
I think it's
important to realize

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.700 align:middle line:84%
that it builds on
lots of wisdom,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.550 align:middle line:84%
particularly Indigenous
people's wisdom from the past.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And it's just kind of putting
a modern slant on that

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.860 align:middle line:84%
because we can learn from
what people have done.

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.926 align:middle line:10%
We can learn from their
mistakes and their successes.

00:01:57.926 --> 00:02:04.840 align:middle line:90%


00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.113 align:middle line:90%
Why a rooftop?

00:02:07.113 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have
anywhere else where

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.919 align:middle line:90%
we could have put a garden.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Flat roof is an
obvious wasted space.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And so if you look at it
from permaculture terms,

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
it's something
that's going begging.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.180 align:middle line:84%
It's way of maximizing the use
of whatever resources we have.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.765 align:middle line:84%
It ticks all the permaculture
boxes, if you like.

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:32.050 align:middle line:90%


00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.870 align:middle line:84%
This was just a couple of years
after the garden was planted.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:84%
And it just kind of
shows how compared

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.590 align:middle line:84%
with what you have now, which is
a very densely planted forest,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:84%
that it actually started
off as a sort of thing

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.820 align:middle line:84%
which you would do in your own
backyard with immature plants

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.930 align:middle line:84%
that you would get
from the nursery.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And just how we've allowed
it to slowly evolve.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.730 align:middle line:84%
So this is that very, very much
reinforcing that whole kind

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.715 align:middle line:90%
of thing about slow and steady.

00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.820 align:middle line:84%
What people find most
amazing about our garden

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.230 align:middle line:84%
is that we've got huge
6, 7 meter high trees,

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.226 align:middle line:84%
and it's all growing on 30
centimeters of substrate.

00:03:16.226 --> 00:03:21.270 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.990 align:middle line:84%
The garden is 200 square meters
altogether, so it's not huge.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.600 align:middle line:84%
But we've really
planted it intensively.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.010 align:middle line:84%
So we've got about
190 different species

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.990 align:middle line:90%
and varieties of useful plants.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So a whole range of edibles,
medicinals, stuff for dyeing,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:90%
stuff for fiber.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's a whole range of plants
which show how important plants

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.826 align:middle line:90%
are to human existence.

00:03:48.826 --> 00:03:52.140 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.240 align:middle line:84%
Most of the plants
are perennials,

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.630 align:middle line:84%
but also come from other
temperate regions of the world.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
the labels, you'll

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.580 align:middle line:84%
see that there's a lot of
stuff from China, Japan,

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.320 align:middle line:84%
as well as North
America and Europe.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.700 align:middle line:84%
And then in that sort of belt
going across through Central

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.200 align:middle line:90%
Asia, Turkey as well.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.510 align:middle line:84%
So that explains the kind
of diversity that we have.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And so it's quite interesting
that there's a tendency

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.480 align:middle line:84%
to think that in
a lot of planting

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.520 align:middle line:90%
has got to be sort of natives.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.648 align:middle line:84%
And we'd make the argument
that actually with climate

00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:32.940 align:middle line:84%
change, with the kind of
challenges with climate change

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.610 align:middle line:84%
that we do need to be
looking at all kinds

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.530 align:middle line:84%
of other climatic
zones for plants,

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.885 align:middle line:84%
which are going to be adaptable
to our conditions here.

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:47.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.890 align:middle line:84%
There's very much a sort of
South American flavor here.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.300 align:middle line:90%
We call it the three sisters.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.440 align:middle line:84%
So Native Americans had a
really interesting polyculture.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.500 align:middle line:84%
So they combined
different plants.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.930 align:middle line:84%
And the sum was
greater than the parts.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So the various sisters
collaborated with each other.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.540 align:middle line:84%
So one sister would
be the sweet corn,

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and that provided a stem for
another sister, the climbing

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:90%
bean, to climb up.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.640 align:middle line:84%
The bean fixed
nitrogen in its roots,

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.100 align:middle line:84%
and so that helped to
feed the other sisters.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And the third sister, which we
don't have here at the moment,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.900 align:middle line:90%
is the pumpkin or the squash.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:90%
So that crawls all over the bed.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:90%
It helps big leaves.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.800 align:middle line:84%
It helps to reduce the
amount of water required.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.950 align:middle line:84%
It conserves moisture and also
it helps to suppress weeds.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:84%
So that's just one system
that's demonstration

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.980 align:middle line:84%
of how people can use
polycultures to increase

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.710 align:middle line:84%
the productivity and to
reduce the maintenance

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.660 align:middle line:90%
in their gardens.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.630 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.880 align:middle line:84%
The Incas were amazing
agriculturalists.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.880 align:middle line:84%
They had really, really
sophisticated systems

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.840 align:middle line:84%
where they used canals
as a way to store water,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.270 align:middle line:84%
so that their gardens wouldn't
get affected by the frost.

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
And they're also--
they develop lots.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
They domesticated lots
and lots of plants.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.490 align:middle line:90%
So things like quinoa.

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So with more and more people
going on gluten-free diets,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.770 align:middle line:84%
people are looking at growing
quinoa commercially here

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:21.950 align:middle line:90%
in the UK.

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.540 align:middle line:84%
And also it's great
ornamental value.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's one of
the lessons of designing

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.890 align:middle line:84%
using permaculture principles
is that aesthetics can be part

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.580 align:middle line:90%
of your design considerations.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:37.780 align:middle line:84%
And so obviously, bringing
different sort of color

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.820 align:middle line:84%
in with the kind of
productivity, the edibility.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.590 align:middle line:90%
This is blue sausage tree.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.530 align:middle line:84%
So it comes from China and
quite an interesting form.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.840 align:middle line:84%
So just from a normal
ornamental point of view,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.010 align:middle line:84%
it's something that's great
to plant on your estate.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.590 align:middle line:90%
And then these are the fruit.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.090 align:middle line:84%
So early in the spring, you get
a really, really pretty sort

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.070 align:middle line:84%
of bell-shaped flower
which hangs down,

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.390 align:middle line:84%
and then it forms three
tiny little pods which

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.840 align:middle line:90%
are joined top and bottom.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.040 align:middle line:90%
And then as they grow, they--

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:90%
see that's your three pods.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.520 align:middle line:84%
And then this time of
year when they're ripe,

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:24.160 align:middle line:84%
you open up the seeds,
you get these black seeds

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.070 align:middle line:90%
with that white flesh.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:35.925 align:middle line:84%
So you just-- quite
a delicate flavor.

00:07:35.925 --> 00:07:38.330 align:middle line:90%


00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not in polite
company, you just spit them out.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:46.000 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.160 align:middle line:84%
There's definitely a sort of
a Chinese flavor around here.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.340 align:middle line:90%
So this is a loquat.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.890 align:middle line:90%
Great ornamental value.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.280 align:middle line:84%
These little candelabra of
the new shoots coming out.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.240 align:middle line:90%
It's evergreen.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:08.880 align:middle line:84%
And with climate change, this is
a possibility as a fruiting tree

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.330 align:middle line:84%
because it likes
long, hot summers.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:17.170 align:middle line:84%
And so what's interesting is
how more and more farmers,

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:22.890 align:middle line:84%
more and more growers are
looking to new varieties of nuts

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.440 align:middle line:84%
and fruit trees, which are going
to thrive with climate change.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:31.310 align:middle line:84%
And so climate change provides
opportunities, as well as

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.110 align:middle line:90%
challenges.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.260 align:middle line:84%
So from a permaculture
point of view

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:38.340 align:middle line:84%
and particularly the whole kind
of forest garden community,

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.520 align:middle line:84%
we're looking at
new varieties which

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.305 align:middle line:84%
are going to be at our
disposal as climate changes.

00:08:45.305 --> 00:08:54.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:90%
So this is another Inca plant.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:00.740 align:middle line:84%
And if you went to a
marketplace in South America,

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.720 align:middle line:84%
you'd see lots and lots
of different varieties,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.540 align:middle line:84%
along with lots of different
varieties of potato.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And there's some interesting
open source research

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:84%
going on now, trying to develop
new varieties of oca which

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.900 align:middle line:84%
cope with our climate,
because one of the problems

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.930 align:middle line:84%
is that the oca, the
tubers put on their size,

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.840 align:middle line:90%
their weight when days shorten.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.870 align:middle line:84%
The trouble is, in
this climate, that also

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.320 align:middle line:90%
corresponds with the frosts.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And so they never
get really big.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And so we're looking at giving
lots of different varieties

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.230 align:middle line:84%
to lots of volunteers
who are growing them

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.040 align:middle line:84%
and then selecting out
those varieties of oca that

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.473 align:middle line:90%
do well in our climate.

00:09:41.473 --> 00:09:50.780 align:middle line:90%


00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.340 align:middle line:84%
Nature plants are the world's
best Nobel Prize winning

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.580 align:middle line:90%
biochemist.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:01.670 align:middle line:84%
That all the compounds which
we could ever want in medicine

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.270 align:middle line:90%
is actually already out there.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:06.750 align:middle line:84%
The challenge is for us to
find out what's going to work.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:09.440 align:middle line:84%
We've got examples like
aspirin or whatever

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.670 align:middle line:84%
already of these plants
which have contributed

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:15.770 align:middle line:90%
to our pharmacopeia.

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:20.010 align:middle line:84%
But the challenge is to
find out the new ones.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
we're destroying it.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:25.320 align:middle line:84%
And so again, just
looking at our garden,

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:29.850 align:middle line:84%
introducing people to some
of the medicinal plants here,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:84%
just then switches
people on to we really

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.660 align:middle line:84%
do need to preserve the
kind of biodiversity

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:84%
because it's in our
self-interest, if nothing else.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So that's another way in
which we use the garden.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.130 align:middle line:90%
This is Artemisia annua.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:53.480 align:middle line:84%
And last year, the
Nobel Prize for medicine

00:10:53.480 --> 00:11:02.380 align:middle line:84%
was won jointly by a Chinese
lady, who for over 30 years,

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:06.160 align:middle line:84%
had done research
into cures for malaria

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.760 align:middle line:84%
and found in old manuscripts,
found descriptions

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:11.750 align:middle line:84%
of traditional
cures for malaria,

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.350 align:middle line:84%
and worked out that they were
talking about this plant.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So she did 30 years of
research into its value

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:27.650 align:middle line:84%
as a cure for malaria, and then
last year won the Nobel Prize.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is now,
particularly as malaria

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.870 align:middle line:84%
is becoming resistant to a lot
of the traditional medicines,

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:38.440 align:middle line:84%
quinine, that kind of
thing, chloroquine,

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:43.660 align:middle line:84%
then this is now an extract from
this is being used medicinally

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.700 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.400 align:middle line:84%
This is the one
that has the skull

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.920 align:middle line:84%
and crossbones because
this plant here is toxic.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:54.860 align:middle line:90%
You see the berries.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.410 align:middle line:90%
This is American pokeweed.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:59.860 align:middle line:90%
So it comes from the US.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:04.500 align:middle line:84%
And this absolutely
gorgeous bunch of fruit

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.780 align:middle line:90%
looks a bit like an elderberry.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.720 align:middle line:84%
But all parts of the plant
are poisonous because they

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.380 align:middle line:90%
undermine your immune system.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:15.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you treat it right, and
this is true of so many plants

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.590 align:middle line:90%
that actually are poisonous.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.720 align:middle line:84%
But if you treat it right,
then they're edible.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.440 align:middle line:84%
If you boil up the leaves, it
then neutralizes the toxins

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.265 align:middle line:90%
and it can be used like spinach.

00:12:27.265 --> 00:12:28.890 align:middle line:84%
The other great thing
about this garden

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.570 align:middle line:84%
is that you learn from
the people who visit it.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.930 align:middle line:84%
So we had an Australian
woman who came here

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.270 align:middle line:84%
and she said that
in Australia, they

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:39.240 align:middle line:84%
use the berries to
make an extract, which

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.500 align:middle line:90%
is an antidote to snake bites.

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.900 align:middle line:84%
So it undermines
your immune system.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:84%
But if you use it
in the right way,

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:50.375 align:middle line:84%
it also then strengthens
your immune system as a cure.

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Right from the
beginning, we want

00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.190 align:middle line:84%
to make the garden as
sustainable as possible.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.360 align:middle line:84%
So say, in the hard
landscaping, we

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:05.250 align:middle line:90%
use a lot of renewable material.

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:90%
And then also renewable energy.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So we inherited a small wind
turbine and some solar array.

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:19.860 align:middle line:84%
So, I mean, Britain sort of is
lagging behind other countries

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.310 align:middle line:90%
in terms of renewables.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.480 align:middle line:84%
But hopefully,
what we've got here

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.300 align:middle line:84%
is just a useful
indicator to visitors

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.450 align:middle line:84%
about how they can
integrate renewable energy

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:35.790 align:middle line:84%
into the whole kind of plan,
the whole sustainability

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.180 align:middle line:84%
of the building, because
the garden is very much

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.130 align:middle line:90%
the part of the whole complex.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.370 align:middle line:84%
We take waste from the cafe
downstairs and vegetable waste,

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.360 align:middle line:90%
it's composted here.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So it's trying to close those
circles within the envelope

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
of the building,
harvesting the rainwater

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:57.800 align:middle line:84%
so that it doesn't go into the
stormwater drainage system.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:84%
The roof garden also helps
to insulate the building.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:07.370 align:middle line:84%
It provides sound attenuation
because we have quite a lot

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:09.900 align:middle line:90%
of gigs in the main hall.

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And so it reduces
the sound level.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And also on a bigger
front, it contributes

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to addressing some
of the big issues

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.920 align:middle line:84%
with climate change
of increasing

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.310 align:middle line:90%
temperatures in urban areas.

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:27.370 align:middle line:84%
And so having green space
helps to cool urban areas.

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.650 align:middle line:90%


00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.370 align:middle line:90%
Permaculture is nothing new.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.670 align:middle line:84%
I've worked a lot in
developing countries,

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:36.420 align:middle line:84%
particularly in the
Philippines and Nepal.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.702 align:middle line:84%
And there when you see,
it's just what farmers do.

00:14:39.702 --> 00:14:44.220 align:middle line:84%
People have been
innovating continually.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:10%
What we have today is a product
of that whole kind of process

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:52.680 align:middle line:10%
of human creativity, addressing
challenges, facing problems,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.180 align:middle line:10%
coming up with solutions.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:58.200 align:middle line:84%
It may have appeared in the
'70s, but actually its roots,

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
its heart is in the
whole of human existence.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.770 align:middle line:90%
