00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:30.730 align:middle line:84%
>> The Mnemonic Induction of
Lucid Dreams, or MILD, M-I-L-D,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:84%
is a technique developed
by Stephen LaBerge,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.640 align:middle line:84%
and it is designed to help you
achieve lucidity by exercising

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.410 align:middle line:84%
your subconscious memory through
intentions and affirmations.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Before venturing into
the MILD technique,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.070 align:middle line:84%
make sure you have a
journal next to your bed

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.870 align:middle line:84%
so that you can make it a
habit to capture your dreams

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.395 align:middle line:84%
and increase your
dream recall over time.

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.540 align:middle line:84%
Writing your dreams
down will help

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.100 align:middle line:84%
you to discover recurring
elements or characters

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.260 align:middle line:84%
within your dreams
called dream signs.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.410 align:middle line:90%


00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.510 align:middle line:84%
You will be using imagery that
already appears in your dreams

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.420 align:middle line:84%
quite often, and you
will be transforming them

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.175 align:middle line:90%
into reality checks.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:55.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:84%
Whenever you see
that dream sign,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.610 align:middle line:84%
you will perform
a reality check,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.450 align:middle line:84%
and this will serve as
a trigger for lucidity.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.389 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:15.420 align:middle line:84%
The MILD technique helps you
notice that you're dreaming

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:90%
through a series of steps.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.960 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, you will have
rehearsed becoming lucid

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.940 align:middle line:84%
and picked the recurring
elements or dream signs that

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.630 align:middle line:84%
are there to indicate to
your subconscious mind

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.640 align:middle line:90%
that you are dreaming.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.040 align:middle line:84%
You can practice this guided
journey in the evening.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And if you also want to
practice the Wake Back

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.320 align:middle line:84%
to Bed method, which
involves waking up

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.700 align:middle line:84%
after about five hours
of sleep and listening

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.600 align:middle line:84%
to the affirmations
section of this recording

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:84%
once again for a short
while as you fall back

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.150 align:middle line:84%
into your last dream cycle,
REM, you may do so as well.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.740 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.020 align:middle line:84%
Set your alarm at this moment
if that's what you wish to do.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:30.960 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.520 align:middle line:84%
You can also just
use this recording

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:40.340 align:middle line:84%
to fall asleep during
the affirmations knowing

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that your subconscious
mind will be

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.110 align:middle line:84%
absorbing the wonderful
suggestions for lucidity.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:90%


00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But before we dive into
the guided journey,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
let's settle our bodies into
a nice relaxing position

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.110 align:middle line:90%
with your eyes closed.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.960 align:middle line:84%
Find a comfortable
position on your bed.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.030 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.090 align:middle line:84%
Make sure you will
not be disturbed

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.810 align:middle line:84%
for the remainder
of this recording

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and begin focusing
on your breath.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.380 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
in through your nose,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
letting the air fill your tummy,
and exhale through your mouth.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.130 align:middle line:90%
Let it all come out slowly.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.530 align:middle line:84%
Take another deep breath
through your nose,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.395 align:middle line:84%
and slowly exhale
through your mouth.

00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:03.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Now allow your breathing to
settle into its natural rhythm

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.240 align:middle line:84%
as you prepare yourself for
a deep, relaxing meditation.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:22.800 align:middle line:90%


00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.400 align:middle line:84%
No matter what sort
of day you've had,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:84%
this is a moment that
you have all to yourself,

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.435 align:middle line:84%
and you give yourself
permission to let go and unwind.

00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.270 align:middle line:84%
A moment to think
about things you

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.775 align:middle line:84%
love such as dreaming
and becoming lucid.

00:05:46.775 --> 00:05:54.550 align:middle line:90%


00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.500 align:middle line:84%
Know that you can at any time
wake up in case you need to

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.330 align:middle line:90%
and you're always in control.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.850 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.955 align:middle line:84%
Now bring your focus
back into your breath.

00:06:08.955 --> 00:06:12.240 align:middle line:90%


00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.485 align:middle line:84%
Visualize yourself inhaling
light and exhaling tension.

00:06:19.485 --> 00:06:29.870 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.720 align:middle line:84%
You slowly begin to feel a
nice and soothing warm energy

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:42.790 align:middle line:84%
around your feet
relaxing all the muscles

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.950 align:middle line:90%
around your toes and heel.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:54.820 align:middle line:84%
The warm relaxing feeling moves
up to your ankles and calves

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.116 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the big
and small muscles.

00:06:59.116 --> 00:07:02.740 align:middle line:84%
You feel peaceful
and relaxed as you

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
feel the warm,
relaxing energy enter

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:14.730 align:middle line:84%
your legs through your
knees and upper thighs,

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.750 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the
muscles in your legs.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.610 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Your legs are beginning
to feel heavy and relaxed.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:32.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.890 align:middle line:84%
The warm and soothing
feeling enters your buttocks,

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:45.510 align:middle line:84%
pelvic area, and lower
abdomen releasing all tension

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.760 align:middle line:90%
and just relaxing.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:55.280 align:middle line:84%
The warm, relaxing feeling
moves up into your chest,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.290 align:middle line:84%
and moving up through
your spine enveloping

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:05.120 align:middle line:84%
your whole upper body
as the warm energy

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:17.270 align:middle line:84%
moves up over your shoulders and
into your arms, elbows, wrists,

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.405 align:middle line:90%
hands, and fingers.

00:08:20.405 --> 00:08:23.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.380 align:middle line:84%
The energy moves
up into your neck,

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:84%
traveling up to your
chin, jaw, nose, and eyes,

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the
muscles of your face.

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:50.470 align:middle line:90%


00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:54.220 align:middle line:84%
The wave of relaxation
now travels up

00:08:54.220 --> 00:09:00.660 align:middle line:84%
to your forehead and scalp
relaxing your head completely.

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:84%
You feel good, and calm,
and completely relaxed

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:19.310 align:middle line:84%
enjoying having nothing
to do but relax,

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.625 align:middle line:84%
basking in the warm
and relaxing feeling.

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:41.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:84%
And from this relaxed
state of being,

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.580 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to
set your intention

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:51.910 align:middle line:90%
to have a lucid dream tonight.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:29.280 align:middle line:84%
And since we haven't yet
picked our dream sign,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.750 align:middle line:84%
I would like to
ask you, is there

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:39.020 align:middle line:84%
a recurring object, setting,
or element in your dreams?

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:44.600 align:middle line:84%
Something that you
dream about often.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:48.050 align:middle line:84%
It can be any dream symbol
that is familiar to you.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:11:07.410 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:12.270 align:middle line:84%
Now set an intention
that the next time you

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:20.285 align:middle line:84%
see this recurring dream
sign, you will become lucid.

00:11:20.285 --> 00:11:34.860 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, I would like you to
recall the last dream you had

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.680 align:middle line:84%
with that recurring
dream symbol.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.720 align:middle line:84%
Really go back into that dream
and imagine all the details

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.760 align:middle line:84%
that you can, except
this time, imagine

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.890 align:middle line:84%
that you did notice
the dream sign,

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:07.310 align:middle line:84%
and ask yourself the
question, "Am I dreaming?"

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And imagine yourself
coming to the realization

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:16.925 align:middle line:84%
that, yes, indeed,
you are dreaming.

00:12:16.925 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.800 align:middle line:84%
Imagine becoming lucid
within that dream

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.010 align:middle line:90%
as a result of the realization.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:90%


00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.970 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, we
are rehearsing this

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:84%
so that your mind
exercises this ability.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:47.010 align:middle line:84%
This is where we are
experiencing and building

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.330 align:middle line:84%
the dream world in
the most vivid way

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:53.925 align:middle line:90%
involving all of our senses.

00:12:53.925 --> 00:12:57.390 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.635 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:12:58.635 --> 00:13:05.920 align:middle line:90%


00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.240 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:17.640 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.380 align:middle line:90%
What would you like to see?

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:37.560 align:middle line:90%


00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.160 align:middle line:84%
What would you like to
explore in your dream world?

00:13:41.160 --> 00:14:02.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:03.680 align:middle line:90%
What would you like to eat?

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:18.100 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.645 align:middle line:90%
Who would you like to see?

00:14:19.645 --> 00:14:27.280 align:middle line:90%


00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Really engage all
of your senses.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:47.410 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.235 align:middle line:84%
Have fun creating the dream
experience of your choice.

00:14:51.235 --> 00:15:23.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:29.910 align:middle line:84%
Imagine all the smells,
tastes, sights, and touch.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:16:44.440 align:middle line:90%


00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:50.440 align:middle line:84%
Really become aware of yourself
and of your surroundings.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:17:42.970 align:middle line:90%


00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.685 align:middle line:90%
The possibilities are endless.

00:17:45.685 --> 00:18:01.750 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:05.400 align:middle line:84%
You can fly if
you like, call out

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:12.660 align:middle line:84%
to your higher self or a
loved one who has passed away.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:17.590 align:middle line:84%
You can eat your favorite foods
or travel through the stars.

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:42.010 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:46.660 align:middle line:84%
Really take your
time in recreating

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:56.540 align:middle line:84%
your ideal lucid dream, because
the next time you become lucid,

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.810 align:middle line:84%
you will have a
plan and you will

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:04.220 align:middle line:84%
be able to experiment
in real lucidity.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:42.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:46.290 align:middle line:84%
One of the most common reality
checks that a lot of people

00:19:46.290 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:84%
use and have been
successful with is looking

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:55.960 align:middle line:84%
at the palms of your
hands during the day

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and asking yourself,
"Am I dreaming?"

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.640 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:84%
And if everything looks normal,
then you're not dreaming.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.500 align:middle line:84%
But at some point,
you're going to notice

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:15.420 align:middle line:84%
your hands in the dream,
and you will ask yourself,

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.390 align:middle line:90%
"Am I dreaming?"

00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:20.465 align:middle line:84%
And your hands might
begin to do funny things.

00:20:20.465 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:84%
Some people use the method
of pushing your finger

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:84%
through the palm of
your hand and ask

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.660 align:middle line:90%
themselves, "Am I dreaming?"

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.540 align:middle line:84%
And if they are
dreaming, the finger

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.055 align:middle line:90%
will go right through the hand.

00:20:39.055 --> 00:20:46.670 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:49.055 align:middle line:84%
You can get as
creative as you like.

00:20:49.055 --> 00:20:52.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.220 align:middle line:84%
But the most important thing is
to practice this reality check

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:02.240 align:middle line:84%
in your waking reality
because the more you practice,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:05.995 align:middle line:84%
the more the probability of
it showing up in your dream.

00:21:05.995 --> 00:21:22.580 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:26.240 align:middle line:84%
While in the lucid
dream, you can also

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.855 align:middle line:84%
practice speaking out
loud some commands.

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:42.450 align:middle line:90%


00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.870 align:middle line:84%
You can rub your
hands together and you

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.630 align:middle line:90%
can say, "Stability now."

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:51.960 align:middle line:90%
Or "I am grounded.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.440 align:middle line:84%
I feel stable,
balanced, and grounded."

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.620 align:middle line:90%


00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.610 align:middle line:84%
You can get creative with what
you say out loud in the dream.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:21.670 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:28.270 align:middle line:84%
You can also find
different ways to fly.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.600 align:middle line:84%
Some people jump
up into the sky,

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.740 align:middle line:84%
others use a swimming
motion, while others just

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.290 align:middle line:90%
levitate by command--

00:22:38.290 --> 00:22:39.310 align:middle line:90%
"fly now."

00:22:39.310 --> 00:23:33.480 align:middle line:90%


00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this is your
playground and your experience,

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.400 align:middle line:90%
and there is no wrong or right.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:84%
You will discover your unique
technique as the time goes by.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:24:06.300 align:middle line:90%


00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:13.410 align:middle line:84%
Remembering your dreams is the
first step toward lucidity,

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.440 align:middle line:84%
because the more
dreams you remember,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.640 align:middle line:84%
the higher the probability of
recognizing your dream signs.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:90%


00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.910 align:middle line:90%
Everyone can lucid-dream.

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:57.420 align:middle line:90%
It is all about practice.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:02.750 align:middle line:90%


00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:07.720 align:middle line:84%
And so don't give up if it
doesn't happen the first time.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.930 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's immediate,
but other times it

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:14.890 align:middle line:90%
takes days, weeks, or months.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:18.100 align:middle line:84%
Either way, it is
worth the practice

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.340 align:middle line:84%
because you get to
have fun in your dreams

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and you can have significant
experiences that will help you

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.400 align:middle line:90%
in your waking reality.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:26:26.280 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:30.930 align:middle line:84%
Becoming awake in your
dreams is possible,

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:34.380 align:middle line:84%
and you are here right
now to experience this.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:27:32.320 align:middle line:90%


00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.570 align:middle line:84%
And now, I am going to
say some affirmations--

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:42.170 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:48.110 align:middle line:84%
so that your subconscious mind
can absorb this information

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.920 align:middle line:90%
as its own.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:28:25.410 align:middle line:90%


00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.540 align:middle line:90%
I am a lucid dreamer.

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:35.990 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:38.250 align:middle line:90%
I now remember my dreams.

00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:47.920 align:middle line:90%


00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:51.325 align:middle line:84%
I have crystal-clear
dream recall.

00:28:51.325 --> 00:29:01.990 align:middle line:90%


00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.225 align:middle line:90%
I notice my dream signs.

00:29:04.225 --> 00:29:15.390 align:middle line:90%


00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:18.650 align:middle line:84%
I am fully aware of
when I am dreaming.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:30.240 align:middle line:90%


00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.355 align:middle line:90%
I wake up within my dream.

00:29:32.355 --> 00:29:43.700 align:middle line:90%


00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.960 align:middle line:90%
My dream memory is perfect.

00:29:45.960 --> 00:30:00.070 align:middle line:90%


00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.710 align:middle line:90%
I love journaling.

00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:14.830 align:middle line:90%


00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.400 align:middle line:84%
Writing down my dreams
comes easily to me.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:29.590 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:32.500 align:middle line:84%
My dream consciousness
is strong.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:48.030 align:middle line:90%


00:30:48.030 --> 00:30:51.330 align:middle line:84%
I successfully perform
my reality checks.

00:30:51.330 --> 00:31:11.040 align:middle line:90%


00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.360 align:middle line:84%
I notice my dream signs
and I become lucid.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:34.730 align:middle line:90%


00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:36.965 align:middle line:90%
I am always lucid when dreaming.

00:31:36.965 --> 00:31:54.230 align:middle line:90%


00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:57.260 align:middle line:90%
I am awake inside my dreams.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:19.150 align:middle line:90%


00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.565 align:middle line:90%
I remember my dreams clearly.

00:32:21.565 --> 00:32:43.420 align:middle line:90%


00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.420 align:middle line:90%
I realize that I am dreaming.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:33:06.510 align:middle line:90%


00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.310 align:middle line:90%
I will lucid-dream tonight.

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:28.590 align:middle line:90%

I remember my dreams every day.

00:34:11.325 --> 00:34:27.400 align:middle line:90%


00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:29.725 align:middle line:90%
I lucid-dream every night.

00:34:29.725 --> 00:34:47.540 align:middle line:90%


00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.750 align:middle line:90%
I love flying in my dreams.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:35:11.860 align:middle line:90%


00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.765 align:middle line:90%
I can control my dreams.

00:35:13.765 --> 00:35:38.170 align:middle line:90%


00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.820 align:middle line:84%
I will recognize
when I am dreaming,

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.515 align:middle line:90%
and I will become lucid.

00:35:43.515 --> 00:36:05.520 align:middle line:90%

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:27.595 align:middle line:90%
I am a natural lucid dreamer.

00:37:27.595 --> 00:38:01.980 align:middle line:90%


00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:07.140 align:middle line:84%
My reality checks have been

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:33.110 align:middle line:90%

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Am I dreaming?

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.270 align:middle line:90%
Yes, I am.

00:39:10.270 --> 00:39:33.630 align:middle line:90%


00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.940 align:middle line:84%
I am a natural-born
lucid dreamer.

00:39:35.940 --> 00:40:03.540 align:middle line:90%


00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:05.820 align:middle line:90%
My dream memory is amazing.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:36.530 align:middle line:90%


00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.580 align:middle line:84%
I love writing down my
dreams in my journal.

00:40:39.580 --> 00:41:14.290 align:middle line:90%


00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.100 align:middle line:84%
I am fulfilled by my

I feel light and
ecstatic within my dream.

00:42:41.125 --> 00:43:16.580 align:middle line:90%


00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.700 align:middle line:84%
I am having fun
inside my lucid dream.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:48.110 align:middle line:90%


00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:52.385 align:middle line:84%
I'm connected to my highest
self within my lucid dreams.

00:43:52.385 --> 00:44:27.730 align:middle line:90%


00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:32.035 align:middle line:84%
The possibilities are
endless, and I am here for it.

00:44:32.035 --> 00:45:03.430 align:middle line:90%


00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:06.165 align:middle line:90%
I am a creator in my dreams.

00:45:06.165 --> 00:46:05.160 align:middle line:90%


00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:07.130 align:middle line:90%
I am a lucid dreamer.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:15.620 align:middle line:90%


00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.035 align:middle line:90%
I now remember my dreams.

00:46:18.035 --> 00:46:27.580 align:middle line:90%


00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.970 align:middle line:84%

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.295 align:middle line:84%
I am fully aware of
when I am dreaming.

00:46:58.295 --> 00:47:09.880 align:middle line:90%


00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.965 align:middle line:90%
I wake up within my dream.

00:47:11.965 --> 00:47:23.370 align:middle line:90%


00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.740 align:middle line:90%
My dream memory is perfect.
