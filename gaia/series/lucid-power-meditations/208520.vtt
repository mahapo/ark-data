00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to this guided
meditation where you will

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.060 align:middle line:84%
attain lucidity using
the SUB technique.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.040 align:middle line:84%
For this technique, preferably
on your back, arms to the side,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.460 align:middle line:90%
palms facing down.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:01:01.870 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.240 align:middle line:84%
Keeping your head still,
just using your eyes,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.810 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to take a look
around at your surroundings.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.430 align:middle line:90%


00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.245 align:middle line:84%
It is a familiar
room, a safe space.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:32.856 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.856 --> 00:01:34.780 align:middle line:90%
Now close your eyes.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.940 align:middle line:90%


00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.515 align:middle line:90%
Focus on the breath.

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:44.530 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.800 align:middle line:84%
Now gently open your
eyes once again.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Focus on any element
within the room.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.912 align:middle line:90%
Observe it for a few seconds.

00:01:56.912 --> 00:02:02.460 align:middle line:90%


00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.902 align:middle line:90%
Now close your eyes once again.

00:02:04.902 --> 00:02:09.009 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.305 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes are beginning
to feel nice and heavy.

00:02:12.305 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.835 align:middle line:84%
Now bring your attention
back to the breath.

00:02:17.835 --> 00:02:22.220 align:middle line:90%


00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Slowly open your
eyes and gaze over

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.470 align:middle line:84%
the familiarity of
your room or anything

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.360 align:middle line:90%
that might catch your attention.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.940 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.780 align:middle line:84%
We will close our
eyes once again

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.950 align:middle line:84%
and keep them closed for the
remainder of the meditation.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.610 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
in through your nose

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and exhale through
your mouth any tension

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.970 align:middle line:90%
stored in your body.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:90%


00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Take another healing
deep breath in

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.895 align:middle line:84%
and exhale any
stress accumulated

00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:13.380 align:middle line:90%
throughout your day.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.350 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.380 align:middle line:84%
This moment is for
you and you alone.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:90%
You deserve to be relaxed.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.980 align:middle line:90%
Let your body and mind rest.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.900 align:middle line:90%


00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.320 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing you
have to do but listen

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.600 align:middle line:84%
to the sound of my voice as I
guide you into this lucid dream

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.400 align:middle line:90%
journey.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.290 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:84%
A wave of relaxation
is now entering

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:08.005 align:middle line:84%
through your feet, ankles,
calves, knees, and thighs.

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:10.880 align:middle line:90%


00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Your legs are now feeling
heavier and heavier

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.910 align:middle line:84%
as the feeling continues
moving toward your upper body,

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:42.170 align:middle line:84%
pelvic area, hips,
buttocks, abdomen, chest,

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.700 align:middle line:84%
all the way to your shoulders
and down into your upper

00:04:48.700 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:84%
arms, elbows, wrists,
hands, and fingers,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.875 align:middle line:84%
making them feel even
heavier than before.

00:05:06.875 --> 00:05:11.230 align:middle line:90%


00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.510 align:middle line:84%
This wave of relaxation
is now moving up

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:30.630 align:middle line:84%
toward your neck, jaw,
chin, nose, and eyes,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:43.245 align:middle line:84%
letting go of any tension stored
in the muscles of your face,

00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:47.690 align:middle line:84%
moving up toward your
forehead and scalp.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.580 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.120 align:middle line:84%
Your head is now feeling heavier
and heavier on your pillow

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.865 align:middle line:84%
and sinking deeper
into the mattress.

00:05:58.865 --> 00:06:02.510 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:84%
It feels good to just let go
and allow the body to rest.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:15.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.710 align:middle line:84%
As you lay on your bed,
let your imagination flow.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:27.685 align:middle line:84%
Visualize a trapdoor beneath
your bed on the floor.

00:06:27.685 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:90%


00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.320 align:middle line:84%
This door leads into
a whole new world

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:42.010 align:middle line:84%
filled with the beauty
of nature, a paradise

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.730 align:middle line:90%
of tall, green grass and trees.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.285 align:middle line:84%
Take a moment to imagine what
sort of world might be there.

00:06:54.285 --> 00:07:02.870 align:middle line:90%


00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:14.684 align:middle line:84%
Imagine the sounds of the
birds, the wonderful smell,

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:20.570 align:middle line:84%
the perfect temperature,
and the breeze.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.700 align:middle line:84%
Really dive into your
senses and in the knowing

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:41.930 align:middle line:84%
that this world
really, truly exists

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:48.452 align:middle line:84%
and that there really is a
doorway into this paradise

00:07:48.452 --> 00:07:50.220 align:middle line:90%
beneath your bed.

00:07:50.220 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:90%


00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:23.355 align:middle line:84%
Make it clearer and
clearer in your mind.

00:08:23.355 --> 00:08:27.890 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:36.280 align:middle line:84%
Make it as real as
possible, as real as

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.894 align:middle line:84%
when you were looking around
your room with open eyes.

00:08:39.894 --> 00:08:45.650 align:middle line:90%


00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.760 align:middle line:90%
The door is there.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.570 align:middle line:90%


00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.860 align:middle line:84%
Feel the magical energy
seeping through the trapdoor

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.880 align:middle line:90%
beneath your bed.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:02.950 align:middle line:90%


00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.890 align:middle line:84%
Imagine yourself
feeling even heavier.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:90%


00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:19.190 align:middle line:84%
As you lay on your back, I am
going to count from 10 to 1.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:24.018 align:middle line:84%
And when I reach one, you
will feel ten times heavier

00:09:24.018 --> 00:09:31.860 align:middle line:84%
than before, and you will
begin to sink through the bed

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:34.215 align:middle line:90%
and eventually reach the floor.

00:09:34.215 --> 00:09:39.021 align:middle line:90%


00:09:39.021 --> 00:09:44.000 align:middle line:90%
10, so deeply relaxed.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Nine, feeling
heavier and heavier.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.670 align:middle line:84%
Eight, starting to
sink through the bed.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:15.990 align:middle line:90%
Seven, feeling relaxed and calm.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:84%
Six, so heavy and
sinking more and more.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:35.496 align:middle line:90%
Five, trusting the process.

00:10:35.496 --> 00:10:38.575 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.575 --> 00:10:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Four, excited for
the lucid dream

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.498 align:middle line:90%
adventure that lies ahead.

00:10:47.498 --> 00:10:50.956 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.956 --> 00:11:01.470 align:middle line:84%
Three, sinking more and
more deeply through the bed.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:07.560 align:middle line:84%
Two, knowing you
are as safe as you

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:09.525 align:middle line:90%
begin to reach the other side.

00:11:09.525 --> 00:11:12.606 align:middle line:90%


00:11:12.606 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:84%
One, you are now
beneath your bed,

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.950 align:middle line:84%
and you turn around
so that you are

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:22.995 align:middle line:90%
facing the door on the ground.

00:11:22.995 --> 00:11:34.700 align:middle line:90%


00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.680 align:middle line:84%
As you open the door, a
warm and cold and light

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.975 align:middle line:90%
begins to illuminate your face.

00:11:41.975 --> 00:11:50.234 align:middle line:90%


00:11:50.234 --> 00:11:55.190 align:middle line:84%
You dive in as someone
would dive into water.

00:11:55.190 --> 00:12:06.740 align:middle line:84%
You are now flying within the
scene, flying over tall trees

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.765 align:middle line:90%
and over beautiful lakes.

00:12:08.765 --> 00:12:23.680 align:middle line:90%


00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.032 align:middle line:90%
It truly is a paradise.

00:12:26.032 --> 00:13:22.500 align:middle line:90%


00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.005 align:middle line:84%
You may land somewhere
if you desire.

00:13:25.005 --> 00:13:32.092 align:middle line:90%


00:13:32.092 --> 00:13:35.434 align:middle line:84%
Now look around and
take in the environment.

00:13:35.434 --> 00:13:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.010 align:middle line:84%
It may be a little bit
hazy in the beginning,

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:56.420 align:middle line:84%
but you can declare clarity now
and see how your surroundings

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.340 align:middle line:90%
and focus shift.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:22.090 align:middle line:90%


00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:84%
Now turn around and
examine the panoramic view.

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:55.050 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.350 align:middle line:84%
You can do a reality
check right now

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%
as you stand in place so as
to make the environment more

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.330 align:middle line:90%
and more solid.

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:24.050 align:middle line:90%


00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
Continue to observe, and
it will become more clear.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.960 align:middle line:84%
Physically holding
on to something

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.455 align:middle line:90%
will also solidify things.

00:15:37.455 --> 00:15:40.920 align:middle line:90%
You may pick up a rock.

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.255 align:middle line:84%
Grab some dirt or hold
a stick from the ground.

00:15:44.255 --> 00:15:48.600 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.490 align:middle line:90%
Feel the texture.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:54.210 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.390 align:middle line:84%
Listen to the leaves
rustling in the wind.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:03.160 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.730 align:middle line:84%
Feel the sticks cracking
underneath your footsteps.

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:12.720 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.483 align:middle line:84%
Make it as real as
you possibly can.

00:16:15.483 --> 00:16:20.670 align:middle line:90%


00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:24.390 align:middle line:84%
This is your world
to explore, and you

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.160 align:middle line:90%
can make of it what you want.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:17:29.560 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:34.600 align:middle line:84%
And as you begin to sink
deeper into your journey,

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:41.430 align:middle line:84%
I will begin to say
affirmations for lucidity

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:48.010 align:middle line:84%
so that it may sink into
your subconscious mind

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.055 align:middle line:84%
and make your experiences
flow more smoothly.

00:17:51.055 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:00.200 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is still awake,
and yet you are dreaming.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:16.300 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.355 align:middle line:90%
You are a lucid dreamer.

00:19:18.355 --> 00:19:35.780 align:middle line:90%


00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.035 align:middle line:84%
You are fully aware of
when you are dreaming.

00:19:39.035 --> 00:19:56.970 align:middle line:90%


00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.450 align:middle line:84%
You always wake up
within your dreams.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:16.570 align:middle line:90%
