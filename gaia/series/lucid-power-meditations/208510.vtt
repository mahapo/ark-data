00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Welcome to this guided
lucid dreaming WILD meditation.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.920 align:middle line:90%


00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.410 align:middle line:84%
WILD stands for
wake-initiated lucid dreams,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.650 align:middle line:84%
initially developed by
Dr. Stephen LaBerge.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.010 align:middle line:84%
It is the practice of
keeping your mind awake

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.560 align:middle line:90%
while your body falls asleep.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.010 align:middle line:84%
You can use this
recording during a nap,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.125 align:middle line:84%
at your regular bedtime, or five
hours into your sleep cycle.

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:00.160 align:middle line:90%


00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.130 align:middle line:84%
In order to keep
your mind alert,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.360 align:middle line:84%
we will be playing around
in the hypnagogic state

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.260 align:middle line:84%
and creating a dream scene
so that your focus stays

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.805 align:middle line:84%
with you as your body
falls into a deep sleep.

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:21.720 align:middle line:90%


00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.010 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin by relaxing.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.740 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Lie down or prop yourself
into a reclined position

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.600 align:middle line:84%
and make yourself
nice and comfortable.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:52.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
through your nose,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.515 align:middle line:90%
and exhale through your mouth.

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:01.790 align:middle line:90%


00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.060 align:middle line:84%
Take another deep breath
through your nose,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.000 align:middle line:84%
and exhale once again
through your mouth.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.480 align:middle line:90%
Nice and easy.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.950 align:middle line:84%
Keep inhaling and exhaling
everything you no longer need.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
You can visualize inhaling
light and allowing

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.345 align:middle line:84%
it to fill your body and then
exhaling all the tension.

00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:43.320 align:middle line:90%


00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.760 align:middle line:84%
Find the natural
rhythm of your breath.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.840 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.180 align:middle line:84%
Slowly begin to feel a nice
warm energy around your feet.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.980 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine the
energy as a golden light

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.290 align:middle line:84%
removing all tension
from your feet,

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.920 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the
muscles around each toe,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.925 align:middle line:84%
and making its way down through
the arc and into your heel.

00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:22.700 align:middle line:90%


00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.230 align:middle line:84%
The golden light moves
up to your ankles

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.970 align:middle line:84%
releasing and renewing
all the muscles

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:44.820 align:middle line:84%
as it moves up calves, knees,
all the tendons and muscles

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.640 align:middle line:84%
in and around your
knees, as it continues

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.580 align:middle line:84%
to travel up to your thighs
relaxing all the muscle

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.855 align:middle line:90%
groups in your legs.

00:03:57.855 --> 00:04:03.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.920 align:middle line:84%
The energy is
soothing as it enters

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:19.380 align:middle line:84%
your buttocks, pelvic
area, and lower abdomen,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.580 align:middle line:84%
releasing all tension
and just relaxing.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:84%
Your whole lower
body is now relaxed.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.300 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Keep breathing nice and
steady releasing tension

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.140 align:middle line:84%
through your breath as
the warm golden energy

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:51.700 align:middle line:84%
moves up into your upper body
entering your chest area,

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and it feels so
good and peaceful.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.190 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:05.210 align:middle line:84%
The golden energy moves up
your back and spinal column

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.620 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the big
and small muscles

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
all the way up to your shoulders
and down to your arms, elbows,

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:29.010 align:middle line:90%
wrists, hands, and fingers.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.410 align:middle line:90%


00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:84%
The golden energy now travels
up into your neck reaching

00:05:41.360 --> 00:06:01.710 align:middle line:84%
your chin, jaw, cheeks,
nose, and eyes, relaxing

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.630 align:middle line:90%
all the muscles of your face.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.780 align:middle line:90%


00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.525 align:middle line:84%
It feels so good to
just let go and relax.

00:06:12.525 --> 00:06:15.350 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.000 align:middle line:84%
The warm golden
light now travels up

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.140 align:middle line:90%
to your forehead and scalp.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.560 align:middle line:84%
You might feel a
tingling sensation

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:33.730 align:middle line:84%
as the light flows
inside your head relaxing

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.750 align:middle line:84%
your whole entire
head completely.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:52.200 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:57.740 align:middle line:84%
Now that your body is
completely relaxed,

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.060 align:middle line:84%
it is time to take
a visual journey

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.120 align:middle line:84%
through the
hypnagogic landscape.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.860 align:middle line:84%
These are the images that
can come spontaneously as you

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.020 align:middle line:90%
begin to drift into dreamland.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.820 align:middle line:84%
It is what we begin to see
in the space between sleep

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.140 align:middle line:90%
and wakefulness.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:32.400 align:middle line:84%
Look into the distance, into
the darkness of your eyes.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.180 align:middle line:84%
You might see a dot
or a tunnel of sorts.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.615 align:middle line:84%
Try traveling through this
space with your vision.

00:07:41.615 --> 00:07:53.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:57.690 align:middle line:84%
The imagery can begin
to transform and morph

00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:84%
into different
shapes and colors.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:08.030 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Allow your mind to
let go and co-create.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:32.700 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:39.730 align:middle line:84%
I will now count from 10
to 1, and when I reach 1,

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.308 align:middle line:84%
your hypnagogic visions
will have increased.

00:08:43.308 --> 00:08:47.530 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.950 align:middle line:90%
10.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:56.420 align:middle line:84%
Feeling light and relaxed,
enjoying the journey.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.490 align:middle line:90%
9.

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Feeling peaceful and calm.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.620 align:middle line:90%
8.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:10.110 align:middle line:84%
Your vision becomes
more and more focused.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.320 align:middle line:90%
7.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:18.030 align:middle line:84%
Allowing your mind
to trust and relax.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:90%
6.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.560 align:middle line:84%
Letting go and enjoying
the play with imagery.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.090 align:middle line:90%
5.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Feeling free and creative.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.840 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.520 align:middle line:90%
4.

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.430 align:middle line:90%
Feeling joy and relaxation.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:40.270 align:middle line:90%
3.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:44.005 align:middle line:84%
You are ready to relax and
enjoy this visual journey.

00:09:44.005 --> 00:09:47.070 align:middle line:90%


00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:48.840 align:middle line:90%
2.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.200 align:middle line:90%
Feeling good and relaxed.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:53.270 align:middle line:90%


00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:90%
And 1.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Your dream vision is
now clearer than before.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.160 align:middle line:84%
This is the time to
begin visualizing

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.780 align:middle line:90%
the dream you want to have.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:22.940 align:middle line:90%


00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Allow the imagery
to unfold, but also

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:35.380 align:middle line:84%
begin to guide it a
little bit as well.

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:39.970 align:middle line:90%


00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:47.920 align:middle line:84%
You may see
structures, landscapes,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.645 align:middle line:90%
or just colorful shapes.

00:10:49.645 --> 00:11:03.360 align:middle line:90%


00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:10.060 align:middle line:84%
It can look like a kaleidoscope
or a journey through a tunnel.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:15.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:84%
Begin to use your imagination
in order to further guide

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and influence your mind,
and keep it active so

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.360 align:middle line:90%
that you don't fall into sleep.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.990 align:middle line:84%
What sort of lucid dreams
would you like to experience?

00:12:25.990 --> 00:13:02.570 align:middle line:90%


00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
Imagine all the
smells, tastes, touch.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:17.740 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:23.170 align:middle line:84%
Feel into the emotions as if
it was happening right now.

00:13:23.170 --> 00:14:14.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.130 align:middle line:84%
Take your time
forming an experience

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:18.195 align:middle line:90%
you would like to have.

00:14:18.195 --> 00:14:24.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:31.070 align:middle line:84%
Really focus on the visuals, and
your emotions, and the reason

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
why you want to have
this type of lucid dream

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.840 align:middle line:90%
in the first place.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:15:21.880 align:middle line:90%


00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Imagine your dream body
being able to experience

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:26.845 align:middle line:90%
anything you want.

00:15:26.845 --> 00:15:32.450 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:33.470 align:middle line:90%
Do you want to fly?

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:37.940 align:middle line:90%


00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
Would you like to
meet your guides?

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.788 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.788 --> 00:15:44.370 align:middle line:90%
Or would you like to explore?

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:48.710 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.105 align:middle line:90%
And what do you want to create?

00:15:50.105 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:90%


00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Keep your mind awake
with these thoughts

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:90%
as your body falls asleep.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:06.370 align:middle line:90%


00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
Stay busy creating scenarios
that you might find enjoyable,

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:21.820 align:middle line:84%
and keep your mind going further
and further into the dream

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.280 align:middle line:90%
until you enter the dream.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:18:22.660 align:middle line:90%


00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, you begin to notice
the dream's scene envelop

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:29.890 align:middle line:90%
your awareness completely.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.990 align:middle line:90%


00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:35.225 align:middle line:90%
You are now in the dream.

00:18:35.225 --> 00:18:42.340 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.680 align:middle line:84%
You are moving
through the dream.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:50.190 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:53.745 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is still awake,
and yet you are dreaming.

00:18:53.745 --> 00:18:59.210 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:10.260 align:middle line:84%
Your body has fallen
asleep, while your awareness

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.325 align:middle line:90%
stays awake.

00:19:11.325 --> 00:19:26.120 align:middle line:90%


00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:84%
And now, I will leave you with
a few affirmations that will

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.655 align:middle line:90%
