00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.920 align:middle line:90%
>> Welcome.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.700 align:middle line:84%
In this astral
projection journey,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.900 align:middle line:84%
I will guide you through
a relaxation meditation,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.780 align:middle line:84%
leading into a
visualization to help

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.080 align:middle line:84%
you rise into the astral realm
by keeping your mind awake,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.765 align:middle line:90%
while your body falls asleep.

00:00:42.765 --> 00:00:47.500 align:middle line:90%


00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.520 align:middle line:84%
Remember, as you come close
to the edge between sleep

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:84%
and awake, you may
fall in further

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:84%
into the sleeping zone
from time to time,

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.600 align:middle line:84%
but you must learn to
occupy your thoughts

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.340 align:middle line:84%
and focus on the visuals so that
you are able to pull yourself

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.430 align:middle line:84%
out of the sleeping
zone when it happens

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.190 align:middle line:84%
and stay in that
in-between state

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.815 align:middle line:84%
until you successfully
exit your body.

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:23.630 align:middle line:90%


00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.870 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready to astral project?

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.840 align:middle line:90%


00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Good.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.820 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin by relaxing.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle line:90%
Find a comfortable position.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.010 align:middle line:84%
You can be laying down on your
bed, preferably on your back,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.495 align:middle line:90%
with your arms to the sides.

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.770 align:middle line:84%
Keeping your head still
and just using your eyes,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.240 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to take a
look at your surroundings.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.575 align:middle line:84%
It is a familiar
space, a safe space.

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:09.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.750 align:middle line:90%
Now close your eyes.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.145 align:middle line:90%
Focus on your breath.

00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:20.000 align:middle line:90%


00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.740 align:middle line:84%
Now gently open you
rise once again,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:84%
and focus on any
element within the room.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And just observe it
for a few seconds.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.980 align:middle line:90%


00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.010 align:middle line:90%
Now close your eyes.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Your eyelids are
feeling nice and heavy.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.840 align:middle line:84%
And focus on your breath,
inhaling and exhaling.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.970 align:middle line:90%


00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.150 align:middle line:84%
Slowly open your
eyes and gaze over

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.510 align:middle line:84%
the familiarity of
your room or anything

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.310 align:middle line:90%
that may catch your attention.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.670 align:middle line:84%
And when you're ready,
close you rise once again.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.820 align:middle line:84%
And this time, keep them
closed for the remainder

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.710 align:middle line:90%
of the meditation.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.110 align:middle line:90%


00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
Take a deep breath
in through your nose,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.540 align:middle line:84%
and exhale through your
mouth all the tension

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.800 align:middle line:90%
stored in your body.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.750 align:middle line:84%
Take another healing
deep breath in,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.720 align:middle line:84%
and exhale any
stress accumulated

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:90%
throughout your day.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.790 align:middle line:84%
This moment is for you, and
you can let your body and mind

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.040 align:middle line:90%
rest.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing you
have to do except

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.170 align:middle line:84%
listen to the sound of my
voice, as I guide you gently

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.895 align:middle line:90%
into this astral journey.

00:03:58.895 --> 00:04:03.910 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Visualize a violet-blue wave
of relaxing energy entering

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:22.246 align:middle line:84%
through your feet, moving into
your ankles, calves, knees,

00:04:22.246 --> 00:04:23.046 align:middle line:90%
and thighs.

00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.570 align:middle line:84%
Your legs are now feeling
heavier and heavier.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.700 align:middle line:84%
As the feeling continues moving
up toward your upper body,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.850 align:middle line:84%
you feel your pelvic
area relaxing.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.530 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:49.180 align:middle line:84%
And the energy moves into
your hips, abdomen, chest

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.800 align:middle line:84%
and continues all the
way to your shoulders

00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:03.440 align:middle line:84%
and then swirls down into your
upper arms, elbows, wrists,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:14.070 align:middle line:84%
hands, and fingers, making
them feel heavier and heavier.

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.940 align:middle line:84%
This wave of relaxation
is now moving up

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:31.560 align:middle line:84%
toward your neck, jaw,
chin, nose, and eyes,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.700 align:middle line:84%
letting go of any tension stored
in the muscles of your face,

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:45.000 align:middle line:84%
moving up toward your forehead,
and enveloping your whole head.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:90%


00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.570 align:middle line:84%
You might begin to feel a
tingling sensation or a very

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.710 align:middle line:90%
heavy sensation.

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.515 align:middle line:84%
This is just your
body falling asleep.

00:05:59.515 --> 00:06:05.360 align:middle line:90%


00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:84%
Keep listening to the
sound of my voice.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.120 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to count from 10 to 1.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.520 align:middle line:84%
And when I reach
1, your body will

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.100 align:middle line:90%
become heavier and heavier.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle line:84%
Your mind will become
more and more focused,

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.550 align:middle line:90%
as you enter this liminal state.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.930 align:middle line:90%


00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:39.440 align:middle line:90%
10-- so deeply relaxed--

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:42.260 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:48.370 align:middle line:84%
9-- feeling heavier
and heavier--

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:90%


00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.780 align:middle line:84%
8-- you no longer
feel your body--

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.790 align:middle line:84%
7-- you are just
pure awareness--

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.480 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:15.810 align:middle line:84%
6-- so heavy, and
yet so peaceful--

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:20.800 align:middle line:90%
5-- trusting the process--

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.540 align:middle line:90%


00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:31.105 align:middle line:84%
4-- excited for the
adventure that lies ahead--

00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:33.700 align:middle line:90%


00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:43.960 align:middle line:84%
3-- sinking more and more
deeply into your bed--

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
2-- knowing you are safe, as
you begin to reach the liminal

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.495 align:middle line:90%
state--

00:07:56.495 --> 00:07:57.295 align:middle line:90%
1.

00:07:57.295 --> 00:08:08.230 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Your body is now still and
sleeping deeply and heavily,

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.360 align:middle line:90%
but you remain focused.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.380 align:middle line:90%


00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.720 align:middle line:84%
I would like you to
look into the darkness

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.040 align:middle line:90%
of your closed eyelids.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.980 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.590 align:middle line:84%
Notice any shapes
and colors forming.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:41.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
It might be very
subtle at first,

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.210 align:middle line:84%
but just let go
and allow your gaze

00:08:48.210 --> 00:09:44.030 align:middle line:84%
to travel through
all the visuals,

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:47.675 align:middle line:84%
allowing anything to take
form as you relax and let go.

00:09:47.675 --> 00:10:43.060 align:middle line:90%


00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.230 align:middle line:84%
And when you begin to drift
too deeply into sleep,

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:51.430 align:middle line:84%
try to guide your visuals
more intentionally,

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:middle line:84%
forming the shapes yourself
using your imagination.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.180 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine a
wormhole forming.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.480 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:84%
See how it shifts and
dances around your vision.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:15.810 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:middle line:84%
And as your body becomes
sleepy, your mind

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.610 align:middle line:90%
stays focused and aware.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:46.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.590 align:middle line:84%
Remember to help
your visuals along

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:50.660 align:middle line:90%
by using your daydreaming mind.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:12:22.390 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:27.490 align:middle line:84%
And now visualize yourself
standing in the middle

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.130 align:middle line:90%
of a beautiful forest.

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:35.060 align:middle line:90%


00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:37.835 align:middle line:90%
It's vibrant and green.

00:12:37.835 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.425 align:middle line:84%
The sun's rays are
hitting the ground.

00:12:43.425 --> 00:12:46.240 align:middle line:90%


00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.515 align:middle line:90%
Everything looks golden.

00:12:47.515 --> 00:12:50.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:58.360 align:middle line:84%
You look up toward the trees and
notice a blue and violet sphere

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.490 align:middle line:90%
portal slowly forming.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.820 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.265 align:middle line:90%
It is glowing as it grows.

00:13:07.265 --> 00:13:13.480 align:middle line:90%


00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And as it grows, you
realize it is another world.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:28.360 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:90%
It is the astral world.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:36.380 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:47.700 align:middle line:84%
The portal is now expanding
and taking over the forest,

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.210 align:middle line:84%
and this is activating
your astral body.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:90%


00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.660 align:middle line:84%
And you are ready to
float into the portal.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.830 align:middle line:90%


00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:11.610 align:middle line:84%
You begin to rise, until you
are inside the glowing violet

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.340 align:middle line:90%
scene.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:19.005 align:middle line:84%
As you elevate from the ground,
you feel so light, as light

00:14:19.005 --> 00:14:19.805 align:middle line:90%
as a feather.

00:14:19.805 --> 00:14:32.760 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:52.330 align:middle line:84%
You begin to slowly soar
over the glowing scenery,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:56.440 align:middle line:84%
and you allow the astral
energy to guide you.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:11.350 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.350 --> 00:16:45.010 align:middle line:84%
And you let go completely,
letting the astronaut energy

00:16:45.010 --> 00:17:11.815 align:middle line:90%
lift you, higher and higher.

00:17:11.815 --> 00:17:45.400 align:middle line:90%


00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.440 align:middle line:84%
And you keep floating in
total comfort and ease.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:18:47.050 align:middle line:90%


00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Somewhere deep inside
your astral memory,

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.100 align:middle line:84%
you know that you've
done this before.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:19:24.110 align:middle line:90%


00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:52.520 align:middle line:84%
The knowledge is embedded
in your whole, entire body,

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.280 align:middle line:84%
in your whole being,
in your whole energy.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:20.795 align:middle line:90%
You know how to do this.

00:20:20.795 --> 00:20:43.410 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.410 --> 00:21:05.480 align:middle line:84%
You've done this before,
and you are remembering.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:41.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.370 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness feels like
it's growing, and growing,

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:48.960 align:middle line:90%
and expanding, and rising.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:22:14.440 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Astral projection is a
normal part of your being,

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and now you understand
it completely.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.385 align:middle line:84%
Feel free to play
with the scenery.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:09.595 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:23:09.595 --> 00:23:47.080 align:middle line:90%


00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.620 align:middle line:90%
And who do you encounter?

00:23:48.620 --> 00:24:18.180 align:middle line:90%


00:24:18.180 --> 00:24:25.365 align:middle line:84%
Are you over a city or
floating over nature?

00:24:25.365 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:90%


00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:46.630 align:middle line:84%
Are you over the ocean,
or are you deep in space?

00:25:46.630 --> 00:26:19.020 align:middle line:90%


00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:23.760 align:middle line:84%
The portal is for you
to create and explore

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.265 align:middle line:84%
the astral experience
that you desire.

00:26:26.265 --> 00:27:02.630 align:middle line:90%


00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Your astral body is now
completely activated,

00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.620 align:middle line:84%
and you can feel the vibrations
or the tingling sensation.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:28:13.990 align:middle line:90%


00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.240 align:middle line:90%
Release your mind, and let go.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:42.680 align:middle line:90%


00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.685 align:middle line:84%
Your body is heavy,
heavy, and resting.

00:28:46.685 --> 00:29:09.910 align:middle line:90%


00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And you can let go, and float
upward, and keep moving up,

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:33.170 align:middle line:84%
until you are far
from your body,

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:35.980 align:middle line:84%
but you are always
connected in consciousness.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:49.098 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.098 --> 00:29:53.140 align:middle line:84%
You know you are safe and
in control at all times.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:30:07.200 align:middle line:90%


00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.610 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to leave
you with affirmations

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:15.940 align:middle line:84%
to help you transition
into the astral realm

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:20.050 align:middle line:84%
by reprogramming your
mind to know that it

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.970 align:middle line:90%
is possible to astral project.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:28.240 align:middle line:90%


00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.595 align:middle line:90%
I am prepared for astral travel.

00:30:30.595 --> 00:31:03.590 align:middle line:90%


00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:06.575 align:middle line:84%
Astral travel is just a
normal part of my life.

00:31:06.575 --> 00:31:43.150 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:46.390 align:middle line:84%
My consciousness is open
to the astral plane.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:32:17.820 align:middle line:90%


00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.325 align:middle line:84%
I am connected to
my astral body.

00:32:20.325 --> 00:32:57.810 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.810 --> 00:32:59.960 align:middle line:90%
My mind is calm and aware.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:32.920 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.215 align:middle line:90%
My entire being is at peace.

00:33:35.215 --> 00:34:12.469 align:middle line:90%


00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:14.289 align:middle line:90%
My awareness has expanded.

00:34:14.289 --> 00:34:52.280 align:middle line:90%


00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.175 align:middle line:84%
I am in a total
state of total peace.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:30.755 align:middle line:84%
I leave my physical
body every night.

00:35:30.755 --> 00:36:02.950 align:middle line:90%


00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I remember my
out-of-body experiences.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:37:02.710 align:middle line:90%


00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.980 align:middle line:84%
I can leave my physical
body any time I choose.

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:43.590 align:middle line:90%


00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:46.065 align:middle line:84%
I experienced
tranquility and peace.

00:37:46.065 --> 00:38:23.080 align:middle line:90%


00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:25.330 align:middle line:84%
My consciousness
is expanded when

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:27.610 align:middle line:90%
experiencing the astral plane.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:27.605 align:middle line:84%
Leaving my body to experience

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:26.065 align:middle line:84%
I know I am more than
my physical body.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:25.600 align:middle line:84%
