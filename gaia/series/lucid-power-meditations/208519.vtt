00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:20.215 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.215 --> 00:00:21.015 align:middle line:10%


00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:25.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Your third eye is a portal
into different dimensions

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.070 align:middle line:10%
of being.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.410 align:middle line:90%


00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.965 align:middle line:10%
It is also referred to as
the mind's eye, or inner eye.

00:00:34.965 --> 00:00:39.660 align:middle line:90%


00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.270 align:middle line:10%
Focusing on this area can
activate your astral body

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.795 align:middle line:10%
and begin the vibrational
stage rather quickly.

00:00:48.795 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:90%


00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.640 align:middle line:10%
Today, we will focus on the
third-eye chakra, or brow

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.040 align:middle line:10%
chakra, located in the middle
of your forehead as the gateway

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.629 align:middle line:10%
into the astral plane.

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:09.140 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:10%
With an activated
third eye, you will

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.420 align:middle line:10%
be able to navigate your life
through your multidimensional

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.025 align:middle line:10%
awareness and through your
higher frequency energy.

00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:27.170 align:middle line:90%


00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.530 align:middle line:10%
In this recording,
I will guide you

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.170 align:middle line:10%
through a relaxation meditation,
a third-eye visualization

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.760 align:middle line:10%
leading to the
astral experience.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.510 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.320 align:middle line:84%
Make sure that you will not
be disturbed for the remainder

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.830 align:middle line:90%
of this recording.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.270 align:middle line:90%
Make yourself comfortable.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.560 align:middle line:84%
You can be laying down or
in a reclined position.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.950 align:middle line:90%


00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.425 align:middle line:90%
Slowly close your eyes.

00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:06.860 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.140 align:middle line:84%
Know that you can, at any time,
wake up in case you need to,

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:84%
and you are
completely in control.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:29.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.490 align:middle line:10%
Take a deep breath
in through your nose,

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:10%
hold it for a couple of seconds,
and exhale through your mouth.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.305 align:middle line:84%
Take another deep breath,
hold it, and exhale.

00:02:50.305 --> 00:02:53.540 align:middle line:90%


00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:10%
Repeat this a few more times.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:23.260 align:middle line:90%


00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Now allow your breath
to reach a natural flow

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.565 align:middle line:90%
and begin to relax your body.

00:03:29.565 --> 00:03:34.340 align:middle line:90%


00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.570 align:middle line:84%
Feel your mind releasing any
stressful thoughts or tension

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.135 align:middle line:84%
that you may have accumulated
throughout the day.

00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:90%


00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.465 align:middle line:10%
Slowly begin to feel a nice,
warm energy around your feet.

00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:10%
You can imagine the energy
as a golden light removing

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:13.000 align:middle line:10%
all the tension
stored in your feet,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.220 align:middle line:10%
relaxing all the
muscles around each toe

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.730 align:middle line:10%
and making its way down
and into your heel.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:90%


00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.130 align:middle line:10%
The golden light moves
up to your ankles,

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.660 align:middle line:10%
releasing and renewing
all the muscles

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:10%
as it moves up to
your shins and calves.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.350 align:middle line:10%
You feel peaceful and relaxed
as you imagine the golden energy

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.910 align:middle line:10%
flowing into your knees,
renewing all the tendons

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.015 align:middle line:10%
and muscles in and
around your knees.

00:05:01.015 --> 00:05:04.300 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:12.320 align:middle line:10%
As it continues to
travel up to your thighs,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:19.240 align:middle line:10%
relaxing all the muscle
groups in your legs,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.035 align:middle line:10%
it feels so good to
just be and let go.

00:05:23.035 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.530 align:middle line:10%
The golden light is soothing
as it enters your buttocks

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:44.140 align:middle line:10%
muscles, pelvic area, and lower
abdomen, releasing all tension

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:10%
and just relaxing.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.310 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:10%
Keep your breathing
nice and steady,

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.720 align:middle line:10%
releasing any tension
through your breath,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:07.570 align:middle line:10%
as the warm golden energy
moves up into your chest area,

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.450 align:middle line:10%
and it feels so
good and peaceful.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.580 align:middle line:90%


00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.510 align:middle line:10%
The golden energy moves up
your back and spinal column,

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.910 align:middle line:10%
relaxing all the big
and small muscles, all

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:10%
the way up to your shoulders
and down to your arms, elbows,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:10%
wrists, hands, and fingers,
releasing all the tension

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.020 align:middle line:10%
stored in these muscles.

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.590 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:15.240 align:middle line:10%
This golden energy travels up
to your chin, jaw, cheeks, nose,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:23.495 align:middle line:10%
and eyes, relaxing all
the muscles of your face.

00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:26.860 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:34.230 align:middle line:10%
It feels so good to let go
of all facial expressions

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.470 align:middle line:10%
and just let go and relax.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.420 align:middle line:10%
The warm, golden
light now travels up

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:46.825 align:middle line:10%
to your forehead and scalp.

00:07:46.825 --> 00:07:49.610 align:middle line:10%


00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.750 align:middle line:10%
You may feel a
tingling sensation

00:07:53.750 --> 00:08:02.160 align:middle line:10%
as the light flows
inside your head,

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.310 align:middle line:10%
relaxing your
whole, entire head.

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.460 align:middle line:90%


00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:84%
You may also feel
a gentle vibration.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:27.610 align:middle line:90%


00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.909 align:middle line:10%
And now that you are
completely relaxed,

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:39.240 align:middle line:10%
I would like you to visualize
a small sphere the size

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:45.180 align:middle line:10%
of the fist of your hand
floating at the level

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:51.790 align:middle line:10%
of your third eye,
above your eyebrows

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.770 align:middle line:10%
at the center of your forehead.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:10%
It is an indigo sphere,
so luminous and vibrant.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.710 align:middle line:90%


00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:13.190 align:middle line:10%
You can see the energy
vibrating and moving

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.765 align:middle line:10%
within this small sphere.

00:09:14.765 --> 00:09:24.730 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:31.060 align:middle line:10%
Slightly roll your eyes
upward with your eyes closed,

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:36.730 align:middle line:10%
as if you were trying
to see the sphere

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:10%
right above your eyebrows.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.550 align:middle line:90%


00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:49.070 align:middle line:10%
Make sure you feel no
discomfort while doing this,

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:56.690 align:middle line:10%
just slightly gaze in that
direction for a second,

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.855 align:middle line:10%
and then back to your
normal eyesight position.

00:09:59.855 --> 00:10:11.200 align:middle line:90%


00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:10%
Now do this one more time,
slightly rolling your eyes

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:23.200 align:middle line:10%
upward and center, as if
you are seeing the sphere

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.790 align:middle line:10%
through closed eyelids.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:31.190 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.930 align:middle line:10%
And then back to
your normal position

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:10%
once again, focusing
on your breathing,

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.020 align:middle line:10%
relaxing, and letting go.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:07.140 align:middle line:10%
I am going to count from 15
to 1, and when I reach 1,

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:15.120 align:middle line:10%
you will be more
relaxed than before,

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.835 align:middle line:10%
the sphere coming closer
and closer to your forehead.

00:11:20.835 --> 00:11:31.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:90%
15.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:37.214 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.214 --> 00:11:38.014 align:middle line:90%
14.

00:11:38.014 --> 00:11:43.190 align:middle line:90%


00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:43.990 align:middle line:90%
13.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:48.170 align:middle line:90%


00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:48.970 align:middle line:90%
12.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:53.150 align:middle line:90%


00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:90%
11.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.130 align:middle line:90%


00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:58.930 align:middle line:90%
10.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.612 align:middle line:90%


00:12:02.612 --> 00:12:03.412 align:middle line:90%
9.

00:12:03.412 --> 00:12:07.592 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.592 --> 00:12:08.392 align:middle line:90%
8.

00:12:08.392 --> 00:12:12.074 align:middle line:90%


00:12:12.074 --> 00:12:12.874 align:middle line:90%
7.

00:12:12.874 --> 00:12:17.854 align:middle line:90%


00:12:17.854 --> 00:12:19.450 align:middle line:90%
6.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:25.240 align:middle line:10%
The sphere is gently
coming closer and closer

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:10%
to your third eye.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:31.565 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.565 --> 00:12:32.365 align:middle line:90%
5.

00:12:32.365 --> 00:12:36.600 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.220 align:middle line:10%
Feeling calm and relaxed.

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:44.275 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.275 --> 00:12:45.075 align:middle line:90%
4.

00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:49.950 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.020 align:middle line:10%
You feel light and peaceful.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:57.990 align:middle line:90%


00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.790 align:middle line:90%
3.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:04.530 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:08.910 align:middle line:84%
Basking in the closeness of
this beautiful indigo sphere.

00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:15.040 align:middle line:90%


00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:90%
2.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:90%


00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:25.665 align:middle line:84%
The closer it is, the
more relaxed you feel.

00:13:25.665 --> 00:13:27.895 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.895 --> 00:13:28.695 align:middle line:90%
And 1.

00:13:28.695 --> 00:13:33.560 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.080 align:middle line:10%
Feeling protected and at peace.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:10%
You are now completely relaxed,
as the indigo sphere is now

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.020 align:middle line:10%
touching your third eye.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:90%


00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:14.900 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, the sphere enters
your third-eye space

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.630 align:middle line:84%
so that half of it is inside
your forehead and half of it

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.430 align:middle line:90%
is outside.

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:32.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:38.320 align:middle line:84%
The sphere feels cool, and you
can feel a very gentle tingling

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:84%
sensation or a slight vibration
coming from the sphere.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:52.620 align:middle line:90%


00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Focus on the sensations that
may arise in your third eye.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:42.680 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.810 align:middle line:10%
You feel this energy
radiating from the sphere

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:55.450 align:middle line:10%
begin to flow through
your whole body,

00:15:55.450 --> 00:15:58.015 align:middle line:10%
activating your astral energy.

energy body until you

00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:10%

seep into your consciousness,
