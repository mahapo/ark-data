00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Hello, I'm Reece Jones, and
welcome to this sleep talk down

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.800 align:middle line:84%
and lucid dream
incubation video.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.259 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'll be guiding
you through the process

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.860 align:middle line:84%
of relaxing your mind,
preparing yourself for sleep.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:84%
And then, once your
mindspace has been softened,

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:84%
sowing the seeds for a lucid
dream later on in the night.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.140 align:middle line:84%
In this particular video,
the sleep talk down theme

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.810 align:middle line:84%
will be reverse psychology,
and the lucid dream incubation

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:84%
theme will be mastering
the art of levitation.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:07.610 align:middle line:90%


00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And so to begin, please
turn off all of your lights,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.390 align:middle line:84%
lay down on your bed,
and get into a position

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.340 align:middle line:84%
that you feel comfortable
with, either on your belly,

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.920 align:middle line:90%
on your side, or on your back.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.150 align:middle line:84%
Whichever position you feel most
comfortable in, adopt it now.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And then make any
final adjustments

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.950 align:middle line:84%
you need in order to
feel fully settled.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.460 align:middle line:84%
For example, perhaps you'd
like to fluff your pillow

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:84%
or maybe you'd like
to stretch your legs

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and then snuggle into your
comforter nice and tight.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.710 align:middle line:84%
Whatever makes you feel cozy
is fine and should be done now.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:03:06.150 align:middle line:90%


00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.650 align:middle line:84%
It's at this point
that I'd usually

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
ask you to close your
eyes, but today I'd

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.250 align:middle line:90%
like to try something different.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going to keep
our eyes open instead.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.200 align:middle line:84%
So with eyes open,
take a deep breath in--

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.970 align:middle line:90%
and out.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.890 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.360 align:middle line:90%
And another deep breath in--

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.975 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.975 --> 00:03:32.775 align:middle line:90%
and out.

00:03:32.775 --> 00:03:36.190 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.270 align:middle line:84%
Then allow your breath to
settle into a normal rhythm, not

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.085 align:middle line:84%
forcing it to go
one way or another.

00:03:42.085 --> 00:03:45.360 align:middle line:90%


00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.140 align:middle line:84%
Now I want you to lie here and
let your mind do its thing.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:90%
Just like the breath.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.520 align:middle line:84%
I don't want you to force
it to go one way or another.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.840 align:middle line:84%
So if your mind is in
a calm, restful state,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.710 align:middle line:84%
and you're naturally settling
into a clear headspace,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.630 align:middle line:90%
go with that.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.310 align:middle line:84%
But if your mind's still feeling
busy with internal chatter

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.460 align:middle line:90%
and the like, don't resist that.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.630 align:middle line:84%
With your eyes open,
just let things unfold

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.230 align:middle line:90%
in the way they want to unfold.

00:04:21.230 --> 00:05:37.000 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:84%
And as my voice
re-emerges, perhaps I

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.370 align:middle line:90%
caught you mid-thought.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.960 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.000 align:middle line:90%
What were you thinking?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.930 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you were thinking,
why do I have my eyes open.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Isn't this supposed to
be a sleep talk down?

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.420 align:middle line:90%
And, of course, you're right.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.510 align:middle line:84%
This is indeed a
sleep talk down.

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.120 align:middle line:84%
But as the old saying
goes, there's more than one

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.030 align:middle line:84%
way to skin a cat,
and studies have

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:84%
shown that by using reverse
psychology on yourself,

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.250 align:middle line:84%
you can actually heighten the
chances of falling into sleep.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.940 align:middle line:84%
In other words, by keeping
your eyes open now and forcing

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.420 align:middle line:84%
yourself to stay awake, when
the lucid dream incubation

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.380 align:middle line:84%
phase eventually comes
and you close your eyes,

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:28.445 align:middle line:84%
you should be primed and
ready to start drifting away.

00:06:28.445 --> 00:07:41.310 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:44.420 align:middle line:84%
And, once more,
my voice returns.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
Did I catch you
in thought again?

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.390 align:middle line:90%
That's OK.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.140 align:middle line:84%
We're still just letting our
minds wander freely for now.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
But in just a moment
here, I'm going

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:58.460 align:middle line:84%
to ask you to slowly
rein things in a bit.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.950 align:middle line:84%
With your eyes
still open, I want

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.390 align:middle line:84%
you to begin honing
your awareness now.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.250 align:middle line:84%
I want you to turn
your attention away

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.590 align:middle line:84%
from the random
meanderings of your mind

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.850 align:middle line:84%
and place it squarely
on your breath instead,

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.530 align:middle line:84%
allowing that to be
your object of focus.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:21.470 align:middle line:84%
If your mind was just lost
in fantasy or thoughts

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.110 align:middle line:84%
of the day just
gone, now train it

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:29.150 align:middle line:84%
solely on the in and out
sensation of the breath,

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.200 align:middle line:90%
and revel in it as you do.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.080 align:middle line:90%
Observe its exquisite form.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:90%
Appreciate it.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:42.990 align:middle line:84%
Notice how you don't even have
to consciously control it.

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:49.840 align:middle line:84%
Just like magic, your body has
your back, looking after you.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:54.430 align:middle line:84%
And within that acknowledgment,
devote yourself fully

00:08:54.430 --> 00:09:01.300 align:middle line:84%
to watching the process unfold,
all the while remembering

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:02.350 align:middle line:90%
to keep your eyes open.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:10:06.810 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:12.390 align:middle line:84%
It's not always easy to maintain
one's focus on the breath.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.750 align:middle line:84%
How can something
so seemingly simple

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:19.240 align:middle line:84%
be so difficult to
implement in practice?

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.940 align:middle line:84%
But that's just
the way of things.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.900 align:middle line:84%
Most of us aren't trying to
focus on something so singular

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:90%
as the breath.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.030 align:middle line:84%
Our minds are always
looking for something

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:34.990 align:middle line:84%
more complicated to
attach themselves to.

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:41.460 align:middle line:84%
But realize now the breath is
mysterious in its simplicity,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:45.510 align:middle line:84%
and given the right training,
can be just as fascinating

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:48.450 align:middle line:90%
as any illusion of the mind.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.290 align:middle line:84%
So remind yourself of this
now and return your focus

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:58.470 align:middle line:84%
to the breath, all the while
keeping your eyes open.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.657 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're purposely
keeping our eyes open

00:11:01.657 --> 00:11:03.240 align:middle line:84%
until the beginning
of the lucid dream

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.720 align:middle line:84%
incubation with the intent
to more effortlessly induce

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.490 align:middle line:90%
sleep when it finally comes.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:12:22.170 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And so, I spend a final minute
or two with the breath here.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.540 align:middle line:90%
Eyes open.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.240 align:middle line:84%
No need to chastise
yourself if you are lost in

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:90%
thought again just there.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.260 align:middle line:84%
Chastisement is, after
all, just another thought.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.470 align:middle line:84%
Instead, just allow
yourself to start fresh,

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.430 align:middle line:84%
returning to the breath,
free of judgment.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:14:21.550 align:middle line:90%


00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:84%
You are now in a
supremely relaxed state

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:28.810 align:middle line:84%
and may go ahead
and close your eyes.

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.870 align:middle line:84%
We're ready to begin incubating
a lucid dream for later

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.120 align:middle line:90%
on in the night.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.710 align:middle line:84%
By following along with my words
and visualizing them as you go,

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:42.790 align:middle line:84%
you'll prime yourself to draw
upon these very same images

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:90%
during REM.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:84%
There's no need to
follow along strictly.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:53.590 align:middle line:84%
Just continue relaxing and
allow my words to wash over you.

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:57.790 align:middle line:90%
Whatever images come, come.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:84%
And even if you fall
asleep during this process,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:05.525 align:middle line:84%
know that your subconscious will
soak these words in and store

00:15:05.525 --> 00:15:06.325 align:middle line:90%
them for later.

00:15:06.325 --> 00:15:09.460 align:middle line:90%


00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.625 align:middle line:90%
So, let's begin.

00:15:11.625 --> 00:15:16.500 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:24.030 align:middle line:84%
You come to on a strange barren
world, rocky and mountainous.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Immediately, you question
your surroundings.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.905 align:middle line:90%
"Where am I?"

00:15:28.905 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:90%
You ask.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:90%
"How did I get here?"

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.310 align:middle line:84%
You try to answer both
of these questions

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.790 align:middle line:84%
but find yourself
searching, unable to locate

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.250 align:middle line:90%
anything concrete.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:45.780 align:middle line:84%
For a moment, you try to
explain away this forgetfulness,

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:48.630 align:middle line:90%
but catch yourself mid excuse.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.820 align:middle line:90%
"Wait," you think.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:55.270 align:middle line:90%
"Maybe I'm dreaming."

00:15:55.270 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
And so you prepare yourself for
the nose-pinch reality check.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.130 align:middle line:84%
"If I can breathe in through
my blocked nose, I'm dreaming,"

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:04.900 align:middle line:90%
You think.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:10.744 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, on
trying to do so, you can.

00:16:10.744 --> 00:16:12.940 align:middle line:90%
"I am.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.560 align:middle line:84%
I'm dreaming," you say
out loud, getting straight

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.560 align:middle line:84%
to grounding yourself and
stabilizing the scene.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:17:22.260 align:middle line:90%


00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:26.960 align:middle line:84%
The scene is stable and
your consciousness is clear.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.430 align:middle line:84%
You're experiencing a
higher layer of lucidity,

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:34.310 align:middle line:84%
perfectly able to
recall important details

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.430 align:middle line:90%
from your waking life.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:41.650 align:middle line:84%
For example, you remember your
name, your age, your address,

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:43.240 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.770 align:middle line:84%
Your mind is firing
on all cylinders.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:51.210 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, you hear a
noise in the distance.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.830 align:middle line:84%
It starts as a low rumble but
quickly grows in severity.

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.660 align:middle line:84%
You turn your attention
to the mountains

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:03.670 align:middle line:84%
and see that they're
breaking apart, splintering

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:07.090 align:middle line:90%
into multiple rocky shards.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:12.870 align:middle line:84%
It's a grand sight, equal
parts, awesome and bewildering

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.590 align:middle line:90%
in scope.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
"Wow," you think as
the rocky boulders

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:21.600 align:middle line:84%
that were once the mountain
settle on the ground.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:28.400 align:middle line:84%
They're still mammoth even now,
but smaller, more manageable.

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you decide to go and
have some fun with them,

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.825 align:middle line:84%
kicking off the ground and
flying over to get closer.

00:18:34.825 --> 00:19:36.380 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:38.660 align:middle line:84%
Upon landing by the
boulders, you're

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:43.040 align:middle line:84%
immediately struck by
their exquisite texture.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.530 align:middle line:90%
They look uncannily real.

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.540 align:middle line:90%
Realer than real, in fact.

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.080 align:middle line:84%
You go over to one and
rest your hand on it,

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:84%
feeling its dream
essence pulsate

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.030 align:middle line:90%
through your fingertips.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:58.730 align:middle line:84%
"I'm dreaming," you
remind yourself,

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.960 align:middle line:84%
checking in to ensure
that lucidity continues.

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.190 align:middle line:84%
You look around and see
another huge rocky boulder.

00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:09.980 align:middle line:84%
This one looks slightly
different, though.

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:14.780 align:middle line:84%
Just as big, but a
slightly smoother texture.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:16.910 align:middle line:84%
You go over and engage
with that one too.

00:20:16.910 --> 00:21:22.900 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.905 align:middle line:84%
You feel a call to
do something more.

00:21:26.905 --> 00:21:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Now lucidity is still strong
and seems to be rising.

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:34.820 align:middle line:84%
The longer you stay
within this space,

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.900 align:middle line:90%
the larger your ambitions grow.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:42.890 align:middle line:84%
"I am a gold here,"
you think, or shrug.

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:47.504 align:middle line:84%
You take a few steps back and
survey the scene once more.

00:21:47.504 --> 00:21:50.830 align:middle line:90%
There are eight orders or so.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:53.710 align:middle line:84%
"I can make them
dance," you think.

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:56.660 align:middle line:90%
Half sarcastically, half not.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.120 align:middle line:84%
"I can raise them up
with my mind alone.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.080 align:middle line:84%
I can do what I want
with this scene.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.580 align:middle line:84%
Manipulate it in
any way I see fit."

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And so you start with
something small, a tiny pebble

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.400 align:middle line:90%
by one of the big boulders.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.250 align:middle line:84%
You lift your hand up and
obscure it from your view,

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and with your mind
alone, you will it away.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.130 align:middle line:84%
"When I lower my hand,
the pebble will be gone,"

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.450 align:middle line:90%
you think.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:31.440 align:middle line:90%
And so it is.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:23:49.300 align:middle line:90%


00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.960 align:middle line:84%
You now turn your mind
to a grander experiment,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:58.130 align:middle line:84%
moving the boulders with
a mere blink of your eyes.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:01.430 align:middle line:84%
In low-layer lucidity, you
may not feel so confident

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.410 align:middle line:90%
in doing such a thing.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:06.710 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps you wouldn't think
to do such a thing at all.

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:10.820 align:middle line:84%
But here in this
high-layer state,

00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.640 align:middle line:84%
you feel confident
in your abilities.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Nonetheless, you prime your
mind for what's about to occur.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:84%
"When I blink my eyes, I'll
move this boulder from here

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.100 align:middle line:84%
to there off in
the distance," you

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.400 align:middle line:84%
think to yourself
calmly and assuredly.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:36.080 align:middle line:84%
And just like before, on
the first attempt, it is so.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:38.515 align:middle line:90%
Again, your confidence grows.

00:24:38.515 --> 00:25:50.230 align:middle line:90%


00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:84%
And so, you set your mind
to one last experiment.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.730 align:middle line:90%
The grandest one yet.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.000 align:middle line:84%
"I want to make these
things levitate,"

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000 align:middle line:84%
you say out loud
to the dreamscape.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.320 align:middle line:84%
And as you do, the scene starts
to rumble again, seemingly

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.230 align:middle line:90%
in response to your request.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.740 align:middle line:84%
"Rise up," you
say, staring a hole

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.110 align:middle line:90%
through one of the boulders.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:24.150 align:middle line:84%
And after a brief shake,
it follows your command,

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.160 align:middle line:90%
raising up.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.820 align:middle line:84%
"You too, rise up,"
you say to another.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And it works with
that one as well.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.330 align:middle line:90%
"All of you then," you say.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:40.980 align:middle line:90%
"All of you into the air now."

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:45.990 align:middle line:84%
And just like that, with one
last push of mental strength,

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:51.060 align:middle line:84%
you lift up the entire group
of boulders into the air

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:58.640 align:middle line:84%
and keep them there,
hanging, levitating.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.650 align:middle line:90%
You smile wide.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.640 align:middle line:84%
A mixture of emotions
flooding your system.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:10.880 align:middle line:90%
Joy, power, awe.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.290 align:middle line:90%
"What's next then?"

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:17.390 align:middle line:84%
you think, knowing that not
even the sky is the limit.

00:27:17.390 --> 00:29:44.200 align:middle line:90%


00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:84%
You have now successfully
planted the seeds

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.530 align:middle line:84%
for a lucid dream
later on in the night,

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:51.720 align:middle line:84%
and have primed
yourself to recognize

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.090 align:middle line:90%
it as such when it occurs.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:58.980 align:middle line:84%
You're now also in a state
of supreme relaxation,

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:03.660 align:middle line:84%
fully at haze, either
sleeping or just now

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.030 align:middle line:84%
ready to begin the
first phase of sleeping.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:14.760 align:middle line:84%
And so, with that, I draw
this session to a close.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Remember, you are
a lucid dreamer.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:21.750 align:middle line:90%
Happy dreaming.

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:25.100 align:middle line:90%
