00:00:04.464 --> 00:00:07.936 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:22.840 align:middle line:90%


00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.960 align:middle line:90%
I'm Reece Jones.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.530 align:middle line:84%
And welcome to this sleep
talk-down and lucid dream

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:90%
incubation video.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.630 align:middle line:90%


00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.590 align:middle line:84%
Today, I'll be guiding you
through the process of relaxing

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.340 align:middle line:84%
your mind, preparing
yourself for sleep,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and then, once your mind
space has been softened,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.095 align:middle line:84%
sowing the seeds for a lucid
dream later on in the night.

00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:52.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
In this particular video, the
dream theme will be liminality.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Please note you're
free to fall asleep

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.230 align:middle line:90%
at any part of this video.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.640 align:middle line:84%
So when you begin to feel
tired, don't hesitate

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.880 align:middle line:90%
to follow that feeling.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:84%
If that happens during the
sleep talk-down, that's fine.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.020 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't happen until
the lucid dream incubation,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.580 align:middle line:90%
that's also fine.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.440 align:middle line:84%
First and foremost,
prioritize falling to sleep.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Do not wait for my
permission to do so.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Follow my words until you begin
to feel drowsy, at which point,

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.150 align:middle line:84%
allow yourself to let go
and gently drift away.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.600 align:middle line:90%


00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.480 align:middle line:84%
And so to begin, please
lay down on your bed

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.350 align:middle line:84%
and get into a position that
you feel comfortable with--

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.050 align:middle line:84%
on your belly, on your
side, or on your back.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.284 align:middle line:84%
Whatever position you feel most
comfortable in, adopt it now.

00:02:09.284 --> 00:02:12.420 align:middle line:90%


00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And then make any
final adjustments

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.045 align:middle line:84%
you need in order to
feel fully settled.

00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:50.520 align:middle line:90%


00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.720 align:middle line:84%
If you haven't already, you
should now close your eyes

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.790 align:middle line:84%
and take a deep
breath in and out.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.150 align:middle line:84%
And settle into this
moment here on the bed.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.670 align:middle line:84%
Whatever your day
has been like, you're

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.930 align:middle line:84%
now free to drop any
mental attachment to it.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.260 align:middle line:84%
The day is over, and
it's time to relax.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.470 align:middle line:84%
So allow yourself
to do exactly that

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.790 align:middle line:84%
by focusing on this current
experience here on the bed,

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.915 align:middle line:90%
listening to my voice.

00:03:30.915 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.360 align:middle line:84%
To help hone your
focus further, you

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.400 align:middle line:84%
should now settle your attention
on the breath, wherever

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.820 align:middle line:84%
that stands out to
you most noticeably--

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:84%
either in the rising and
falling of your chest

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.779 align:middle line:84%
or in the air coming in
and out of your nose.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.420 align:middle line:90%


00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.560 align:middle line:84%
Fully dedicate yourself
to following the breath,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.720 align:middle line:84%
soaking in all of the fine
details, observing them keenly,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.260 align:middle line:84%
covering the entire
breath with your focus,

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.140 align:middle line:90%
relaxed but attentive.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:05:10.120 align:middle line:90%


00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And as you breathe,
try to cultivate

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.840 align:middle line:84%
that feeling of fascination
you once felt as a child.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.110 align:middle line:84%
As an adult, you're so
accustomed to the sensation

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:84%
of breathing that,
in a sense, it's

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.960 align:middle line:90%
become unimpressive to you.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.020 align:middle line:84%
But through your
focus and attention,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.370 align:middle line:84%
you can rekindle that feeling
of interest and intrigue.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:90%


00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.660 align:middle line:90%
So try to do that now.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.375 align:middle line:84%
Feel into the sense
of being alive.

00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:47.070 align:middle line:90%


00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:84%
Feel into the wonderful
sensation that is breathing.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:06:23.030 align:middle line:90%


00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.570 align:middle line:84%
Just let the breath come
and go as it pleases.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Don't try to force it
or direct it in any way.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:90%
If it's shallow, that's fine.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.950 align:middle line:90%
If it's deep, that's also fine.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.580 align:middle line:84%
Don't grade the
quality of your breath.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.510 align:middle line:90%
Merely observe it.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:84%
And as you observe it,
feel gratitude for it.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.630 align:middle line:84%
Recognize that you are
alive and breathing.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:22.720 align:middle line:90%


00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.180 align:middle line:84%
To help you stay
focused, you might

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.290 align:middle line:84%
want to start softly counting
along with each breath.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:35.350 align:middle line:84%
So for example, on the next
breath in, think, "one."

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.970 align:middle line:84%
On the next breath
out, think, "one."

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And then on the next
breath in, think, "two."

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:51.585 align:middle line:84%
On the next breath out,
think, "two," and so on.

00:07:51.585 --> 00:07:52.960 align:middle line:84%
If that doesn't
work for you, you

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.485 align:middle line:84%
could use the mental note
of "in" and "out" instead.

00:07:56.485 --> 00:07:59.100 align:middle line:90%


00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:05.662 align:middle line:84%
Either way, do this
with a soft definition.

00:08:05.662 --> 00:08:08.130 align:middle line:84%
Let the labeling
of the breath help

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.480 align:middle line:84%
you stay focused, but don't do
it with some intense pressure.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:47.090 align:middle line:90%


00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the arising
of the thought

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:53.030 align:middle line:84%
itself is not
necessarily what we're

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.230 align:middle line:90%
looking to get rid of here.

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.290 align:middle line:84%
We're merely trying to
let go of the attachment

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:04.990 align:middle line:84%
to it, to let go of the
entanglement and distraction

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.370 align:middle line:90%
that thoughts often bring.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.500 align:middle line:84%
So when a thought
arises, that's fine.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:13.540 align:middle line:90%
Don't fight it.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Just notice the arising
and notice the falling away

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.330 align:middle line:84%
and carry on with
following the breath.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:54.400 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.860 align:middle line:84%
And as my voice punctuates
the silence once more,

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:84%
use it as a chance to
check in with yourself.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Are you still following
along with the breath?

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Or have you become
entrenched in thought?

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:14.190 align:middle line:84%
If so, use this opportunity to
once again observe the thought

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:16.600 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:90%
Drop your identification to it.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:24.090 align:middle line:84%
Let it fall away
in its own time.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And then turn your attention
back to the breath.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:53.360 align:middle line:90%


00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And now as you become more
and more relaxed, more

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:03.820 align:middle line:84%
and more settled into
the present moment,

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:09.180 align:middle line:84%
start paying attention
to your visual field.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Just because your
eyes are closed,

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.140 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't mean that your
visual field is gone.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.650 align:middle line:90%
It is, in fact, still there.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.430 align:middle line:84%
What you'll see will depend
on you as an individual

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.170 align:middle line:84%
and where you're at
in your sleep cycle.

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.100 align:middle line:84%
But invariably,
something will be

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:34.660 align:middle line:84%
there, either darkness
or a color tone

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.160 align:middle line:90%
or perhaps even some hypnagogia.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.170 align:middle line:84%
Whatever you may
see, observe it now

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:47.780 align:middle line:84%
and lean further into
the feeling of relaxation

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.580 align:middle line:90%
as you do.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:12:22.400 align:middle line:90%


00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:29.800 align:middle line:84%
You are now in a supremely
relaxed state, either sleeping

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:33.590 align:middle line:90%
or on the edge of sleeping.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And so we're ready
to begin sowing

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.600 align:middle line:84%
the seeds for lucid dreams
later on in the night.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:46.100 align:middle line:84%
By following along with my words
and visualizing them as you go,

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.120 align:middle line:84%
you'll prime yourself to draw
upon these very same images

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.710 align:middle line:90%
during REM.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.370 align:middle line:84%
There's no need to
follow along precisely.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Just continue relaxing and
allow my words to wash over you.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.080 align:middle line:90%
Whatever images come, come.

00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.630 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're
now asleep, know

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:84%
that your subconscious will soak
these words in and store them

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:90%
for later.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.660 align:middle line:90%


00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:20.260 align:middle line:90%
So let's begin.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:33.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:39.280 align:middle line:84%
You find yourself in a place
between realms, not quite

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.815 align:middle line:90%
dreaming yet, not quite awake.

00:13:41.815 --> 00:13:44.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.330 align:middle line:84%
You've entered this place
with your lucidity intact,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:50.860 align:middle line:90%
your consciousness unbroken.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.420 align:middle line:90%


00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:59.740 align:middle line:84%
You understand who you
are and where you are

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:03.630 align:middle line:90%
and what has just occurred.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:84%
This is a limbo state,
a liminal place,

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.475 align:middle line:84%
a void of souls, not
one thing nor another.

00:14:14.475 --> 00:14:17.270 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:21.560 align:middle line:90%
And it's vast.

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:27.180 align:middle line:84%
This is the waiting area
between dreams, you realize.

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.635 align:middle line:84%
And with this realization,
you begin to lucidly explore.

00:14:31.635 --> 00:15:32.490 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.470 align:middle line:90%
This place is strange to you.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.830 align:middle line:84%
On one level, it feels like
somewhere you've never been

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:46.610 align:middle line:90%
before, alien and unrelatable.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:53.750 align:middle line:84%
But on another level, you
sense a certain familiarity.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:16:02.560 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere you look is black
and shiny and metallic,

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
and your reflection
in these surfaces

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.360 align:middle line:90%
warps as you gaze at it.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.130 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:16.030 align:middle line:84%
All around you is
uniform, one and the same,

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:21.140 align:middle line:84%
an otherworldly sheen
both above and below.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.740 align:middle line:84%
It vaguely reminds
you of a mirror maze

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:30.190 align:middle line:84%
from Earth, formless
and sprawling.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:17:33.210 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:37.920 align:middle line:84%
And still, you're lucid,
stopping from time to time

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.650 align:middle line:90%
to check in with yourself.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:43.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm in the place
between dreams, you

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:47.050 align:middle line:84%
think, kneeling down to
rub the metallic floor

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.600 align:middle line:90%
and ground yourself.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.580 align:middle line:84%
I'm waiting for a
new scene to form.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.270 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.270 --> 00:18:00.010 align:middle line:84%
And so you get up and
continue to explore the void,

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:04.240 align:middle line:84%
knowing and expecting a
fully fleshed-out scene

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:90%
to emerge shortly.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.940 align:middle line:90%
It always does.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.320 align:middle line:84%
It never stays
this way for long.

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.980 align:middle line:84%
You know that if you can
just maintain your lucidity

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.610 align:middle line:84%
for another minute
or two, something

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:28.590 align:middle line:84%
will appear, a
character or an object,

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:32.145 align:middle line:84%
something other than the
sprawling black metallic mass.

00:18:32.145 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:90%


00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And as time ticks
on, your expectations

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.280 align:middle line:90%
are eventually proven correct.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.340 align:middle line:84%
Off in the distance, you
see what you can only

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:58.240 align:middle line:84%
describe as a portal of
sorts, a dream portal perhaps,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:01.510 align:middle line:84%
shimmering in the same way as
the void that surrounds it.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:90%


00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.720 align:middle line:84%
And so you head forward,
knowing that just beyond it

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:13.760 align:middle line:84%
lies the next chapter
in tonight's saga.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.020 align:middle line:84%
At first, you walk
at a casual pace.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.560 align:middle line:84%
But then you fly,
kicking off the ground

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.250 align:middle line:84%
and propelling yourself
forward with great force.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:90%


00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.830 align:middle line:90%
The feeling is exhilarating.

00:20:30.830 --> 00:21:36.200 align:middle line:90%


00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.430 align:middle line:84%
And now, landing
by the portal, you

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:45.500 align:middle line:84%
can see the object
in its full splendor,

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.260 align:middle line:90%
glorious and majestic.

00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:57.280 align:middle line:84%
It beckons you forth to observe
it more closely, to feel it,

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.310 align:middle line:90%
to soak it in.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:04.390 align:middle line:84%
It's made of wonderfully
reflective gray stone,

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:08.830 align:middle line:84%
and there are huge steps
leading up to the gate itself.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:11.890 align:middle line:90%


00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:15.360 align:middle line:84%
And so you walk them,
paying attention

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.140 align:middle line:84%
to the sensation of the stone
beneath your feet as you do.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:23:22.310 align:middle line:90%


00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.250 align:middle line:84%
And upon reaching
the top, you take

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:31.280 align:middle line:84%
in the resplendence of the
huge triangle gateway, framed

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.950 align:middle line:84%
by a spiral stone arch with a
cloudy interdimensional haze

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:40.190 align:middle line:90%
behind it.

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:44.680 align:middle line:84%
Your breath is taken away as
you watch the mist pulsate

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:90%
and spiral.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Beyond this lies
a new realm, you

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:56.840 align:middle line:84%
think, a fully fleshed-out
dream, proper, just waiting.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.410 align:middle line:84%
And with this knowing
comes a deep desire

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:01.700 align:middle line:90%
to step through the portal.

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:08.590 align:middle line:84%
But before doing so,
you turn back around

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:13.695 align:middle line:84%
and soak in the imagery
of the void one last time.

00:24:13.695 --> 00:25:21.640 align:middle line:90%


00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.030 align:middle line:84%
You now step through
the portal, taking

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:28.210 align:middle line:90%
a deep breath in as you do.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:84%
The sensation is
reminiscent of stepping

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:37.890 align:middle line:84%
through a cool waterfall,
tingly and wet.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:43.300 align:middle line:84%
And without a fuss, just
like that, you find yourself

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:50.270 align:middle line:84%
in a new scene, fully fledged
and fully formed, lucidity

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:53.290 align:middle line:90%
still intact.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:56.010 align:middle line:84%
I'm dreaming, you
remind yourself again

00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:00.800 align:middle line:84%
before heading off to
explore this new area.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.260 align:middle line:84%
You're intrigued and excited
to see what it has to offer.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:11.480 align:middle line:84%
All the while, you remain
calm, reminding yourself not

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.640 align:middle line:84%
to let your emotions
get the better of you.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.380 align:middle line:90%


00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.465 align:middle line:90%
And so a new adventure begins.

00:26:21.465 --> 00:29:45.440 align:middle line:90%


00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.620 align:middle line:84%
You have now successfully
planted the seeds

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.740 align:middle line:84%
for a lucid dream
later on in the night

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and have primed
yourself to recognize

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.950 align:middle line:90%
it as such when it occurs.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:01.900 align:middle line:84%
You're now also in a state
of supreme relaxation,

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:08.480 align:middle line:84%
fully at ease and ready to begin
the first phase of sleeping.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.250 align:middle line:84%
And so if you
haven't already, you

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:16.715 align:middle line:90%
may now let go and drift away.

00:30:16.715 --> 00:30:19.440 align:middle line:90%


00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:23.440 align:middle line:90%
It's time for sleep.

00:30:23.440 --> 01:00:16.000 align:middle line:90%
