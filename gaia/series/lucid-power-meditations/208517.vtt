Settle your body into
a comfortable position

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.770 align:middle line:84%
Take a very good deep breath,
let the breath fill your lungs,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.845 align:middle line:84%

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.550 align:middle line:84%

allowing yourself to
relax, trust, and let go.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:40.530 align:middle line:90%

them, giving yourself this time

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And with every exhale, you just
keep relaxing more and more,

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.865 align:middle line:84%
since you are releasing
more and more tension.

00:04:45.865 --> 00:04:49.020 align:middle line:90%


00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:84%
Now let this wonderful,
swirling, violet light flow up

all the large and small
muscles of your neck,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.710 align:middle line:84%
releasing any stress
stored in the area

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.930 align:middle line:84%

let go as they are flooded

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:11.250 align:middle line:90%

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
This rejuvenating light
now enters your chest

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and upper arms, relaxing
all the muscles of your arms

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:53.015 align:middle line:84%
all the way down to your elbows,
wrists, hands, and fingers.

00:05:53.015 --> 00:05:57.250 align:middle line:90%


00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.540 align:middle line:84%
Let the bright blue light
flow through your back,

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.140 align:middle line:84%
flooding all the large
and small muscles,

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.940 align:middle line:84%
and you are feeling
light as a feather.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.650 align:middle line:84%
This wonderful, relaxing
light moves into your abdomen,

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:23.490 align:middle line:84%
relaxing all the
muscles of your stomach

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.370 align:middle line:84%
and releasing all
the tension stored.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:38.540 align:middle line:84%
It is time to let go and
allow, allow yourself to relax,

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.860 align:middle line:84%
and you notice the violet
blue light enters your hips

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.880 align:middle line:84%
and buttocks muscles, and you
feel deeply, deeply relaxed.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.770 align:middle line:90%


00:06:52.770 --> 00:07:03.920 align:middle line:84%
This brilliant light now travels
down your upper thighs, knees,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:15.120 align:middle line:84%
calves, shins, all the
way down to your ankles,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:20.840 align:middle line:84%
feet, until it reaches
the tips of your toes.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:90%


00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:32.650 align:middle line:84%
You are completely relaxed and
at one with the astral energy.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.070 align:middle line:84%
You are feeling light
and so comfortable.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:46.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:53.580 align:middle line:84%
And now that you are feeling
relaxed and at peace,

00:07:53.580 --> 00:08:00.440 align:middle line:84%
you feel the sphere begin
to levitate with you in it.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.420 align:middle line:84%
You know are guided
by your highest self

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.100 align:middle line:90%
and you trust this journey.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:21.620 align:middle line:84%
As you rise up slowly into
the sky within this sphere,

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.700 align:middle line:84%
you have a feeling of
peace and tranquility.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:90%


00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:34.735 align:middle line:84%
Like a baby being rocked in his
mother's arms, you feel safe.

00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:40.460 align:middle line:90%


00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.430 align:middle line:84%
You know that your
destination is near,

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:52.130 align:middle line:84%
and so you wait patiently for
the sphere to arrive smoothly

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.405 align:middle line:90%
into the astral plane.

00:08:53.405 --> 00:09:01.790 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:12.840 align:middle line:84%
You are in good hands, and
you go higher and higher,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.490 align:middle line:90%
feeling lighter and lighter.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:25.000 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to count from
10 to 1, and when I reach one,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.585 align:middle line:84%
you will have arrived
to the astral plane.

00:09:28.585 --> 00:09:34.110 align:middle line:90%

find yourself laying down
on bright green grass

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:33.490 align:middle line:90%
with aqua blue tones.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.770 align:middle line:90%


00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:43.600 align:middle line:84%
You sit up and notice
that you are up on a hill

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.590 align:middle line:84%
overlooking a
beautiful lake that

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:55.710 align:middle line:84%
is surrounded by
colorful trees, flowers,

00:11:55.710 --> 00:12:01.400 align:middle line:84%
and even the clouds seem to have
a purple and pink glow to them.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.790 align:middle line:84%
You decide to walk
down to the lake,

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:84%
and you're surprised
at how light you feel.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:19.400 align:middle line:84%
You know that if you want,
you can fly down to the lake,

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:22.490 align:middle line:84%
but you're enjoying
lightly walking down

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:29.980 align:middle line:84%
the beautiful path,
surrounded by flowers

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:33.420 align:middle line:90%
that you've never seen before.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Even the colors seem
unfamiliar but vibrant,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:40.535 align:middle line:90%
and you can feel them.

00:12:40.535 --> 00:12:47.670 align:middle line:90%

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
You arrive at the edge
of the quiet lake,

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.660 align:middle line:84%
and you feel so peaceful,
as if the lake itself is

00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:10.820 align:middle line:90%
emitting relaxing vibrations.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:20.340 align:middle line:84%
You look down at your body
out of curiosity and notice

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.710 align:middle line:84%
that even you have
a slight glow.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:30.280 align:middle line:90%


00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.730 align:middle line:84%
You wonder what your
face looks like,

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:84%
and you get closer to
the crystal clear water

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.140 align:middle line:84%
to get a good look
at your reflection.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle line:84%
You get down on your knees
and peek over the edge.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:51.980 align:middle line:84%
To your surprise, you see
the one looking back at you

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:57.050 align:middle line:84%
is a wonderful astral
version of you,

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:84%
and it can be
anything you imagine--

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:09.600 align:middle line:84%
a being of light or similar to
how you look in waking reality

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.755 align:middle line:90%
but with a slight glow.

00:14:10.755 --> 00:14:13.640 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
Maybe your hair is
bright pink color.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.310 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.380 align:middle line:84%
Your skin looks
radiant and young.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.785 align:middle line:84%
Your eyes are shining,
and your face is smiling.

00:14:27.785 --> 00:14:31.190 align:middle line:90%


00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.980 align:middle line:84%
A warm and friendly
feeling washes over you.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.430 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:41.150 align:middle line:84%
You begin to understand
that you are so much

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:44.700 align:middle line:90%
more than your waking reality.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:50.910 align:middle line:84%
You are a multidimensional
being able to experience

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.020 align:middle line:84%
otherworldly planes,
and you can feel

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:58.010 align:middle line:90%
your consciousness expanding.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:03.070 align:middle line:90%


00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:08.770 align:middle line:84%
You can sense the
great mystery within,

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:84%
and you find comfort
in the connection

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.390 align:middle line:84%
you feel to this astral
world and to yourself.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:22.690 align:middle line:90%


00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.655 align:middle line:84%
And from this space,
explore this realm.

00:15:26.655 --> 00:15:31.440 align:middle line:90%


00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.755 align:middle line:84%
You can fly or just take
in the current view.

00:15:35.755 --> 00:15:39.425 align:middle line:90%


00:15:39.425 --> 00:15:40.225 align:middle line:90%
What do you see?

00:15:40.225 --> 00:15:48.340 align:middle line:90%


00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.330 align:middle line:90%
How do you feel?

00:15:49.330 --> 00:16:03.030 align:middle line:90%


00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.255 align:middle line:84%
Allow your
imagination to expand.

00:16:06.255 --> 00:17:20.400 align:middle line:90%


00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Finally, you'll end
back into the space

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:30.770 align:middle line:84%
where you began this
journey, and you

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:39.200 align:middle line:84%
lay down on the smooth, soft
grass and look up into the sky.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.540 align:middle line:90%


00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:50.450 align:middle line:84%
You can't tell if it is day
or night, as the color seems

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:57.050 align:middle line:84%
so vibrant, and yet you can
see the deep space all around.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:18:01.010 align:middle line:90%


00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.480 align:middle line:84%
Beyond the clouds, you can
see giant spheres of light.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.090 align:middle line:90%


00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:14.380 align:middle line:84%
Take this moment to
create an intention

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:19.520 align:middle line:84%
to connect more and
more to the astral plane

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.790 align:middle line:84%
and to remember
who you really are.

00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:39.800 align:middle line:90%


00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.670 align:middle line:84%
As you lay there, you
begin to feel sleepy,

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.245 align:middle line:90%
and the weather is just perfect.

00:18:46.245 --> 00:18:50.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
Allow yourself to drift
off into sleep, feeling

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:05.660 align:middle line:84%
light and peaceful, knowing that
these following affirmations

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:13.560 align:middle line:84%
will enter your unconscious
mind like seeds,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:19.360 align:middle line:84%
and what will flourish are your
memories of the astral plane

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:84%
and your ability to travel there
whenever you want, consciously.

00:19:25.780 --> 00:20:20.370 align:middle line:90%


00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.950 align:middle line:90%
I am prepared for astral travel.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:29.950 align:middle line:90%


00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:33.430 align:middle line:84%
Astral travel is just a
normal part of my life.

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:42.160 align:middle line:90%


00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.520 align:middle line:84%
My consciousness is open
to the astral plane.

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:90%


00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:54.965 align:middle line:84%
I am connected to
my astral body.

00:20:54.965 --> 00:21:02.360 align:middle line:90%


00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.765 align:middle line:90%
My mind is calm and aware.

00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:12.170 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:14.585 align:middle line:90%
My entire being is at peace.

00:21:14.585 --> 00:21:22.230 align:middle line:90%


00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:24.320 align:middle line:90%
My awareness has expanded.

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:30.610 align:middle line:90%


00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:34.090 align:middle line:84%
I am in a state of
total peace and bliss.

I leave my physical
body every night.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:90%
I am calm and at peace.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.780 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.680 align:middle line:84%
I always create a
positive experience.
