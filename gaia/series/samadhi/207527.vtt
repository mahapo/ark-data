By egoic consciousness,

of craving and aversion
that operate unconsciously,

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:46.010 align:middle line:84%
the collective samskaras, or
conditioned patterns, which

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.790 align:middle line:84%
create the conditions of
maya, the identification

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.270 align:middle line:84%
with our characters

in this lifetime.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.120 align:middle line:84%
The self structure is an

We don't want to get rid of
that interface or destroy it.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.500 align:middle line:84%
The path is about
dis-identifying from it,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.690 align:middle line:84%
so that our sense of I
or the sense of existence

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:24.490 align:middle line:84%
is not tied to a limited
form, so that we don't suffer

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:90%
when the world of form changes.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:34.040 align:middle line:84%
The human path is a journey
from pre-egoic existence, which

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.710 align:middle line:84%
is the merged oneness
that we experienced

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.840 align:middle line:84%
when we were a baby
with our mother

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.200 align:middle line:90%
to the creation of a person.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.750 align:middle line:90%

This is a necessary
part of our evolution

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:52.480 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring about
self-consciousness, to bring

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:57.130 align:middle line:90%
about a sense of self or I.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.120 align:middle line:84%

We're in an ego

But the next step beyond
self-consciousness

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:11.470 align:middle line:84%
is to realize transpersonal
levels of self

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:15.430 align:middle line:84%
to realize shared
levels of consciousness,

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:19.810 align:middle line:84%
various levels of
logos, or higher mind.

if you prefer that language.

the egoic consciousness,
this dismantling

Whether you call that practice
meditation, self-inquiry,

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:84%

that one has to awaken to.

compiled the Yoga Sutras 2,500

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:29.110 align:middle line:84%
years ago, taught that the
entire endeavor of yoga

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:34.150 align:middle line:84%
is aimed at the cessation of
the whirlpool of the mind.

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:37.480 align:middle line:84%
You could say it is
the cessation of karma,

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.870 align:middle line:84%
the cessation of deep
unconscious patterns

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:42.385 align:middle line:90%
that govern one's life.

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:51.290 align:middle line:84%
These conditioned patterns were
called the vrittis in Sanskrit.

Likewise, the zen
master Dogen said

00:25:54.710 --> 00:26:00.590 align:middle line:84%
that, "Meditation is the
dropping off of mind and body."

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:05.370 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, it is
nirvana or Nirodha.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:08.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the cessation
of the fluctuations

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:12.570 align:middle line:84%
of the limited egoic mind, which
bring about the identification

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.505 align:middle line:90%
with a limited sense of self.

In Christianity, we find
the same perennial teaching

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.430 align:middle line:84%
but expressed through a
very different metaphor,

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:27.850 align:middle line:84%
using the language that was
common at that time in history.

To realize samadhi
in Christian terms

00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:39.080 align:middle line:84%
is to attain the kingdom of God
through the forgiveness of sins

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:90%
by realizing Christ.

The word sin in Hebrew means
literally to miss the mark.

It means to miss
the present moment,

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:56.820 align:middle line:84%
to pursue happiness in the
objects of the external world,

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:00.285 align:middle line:84%
rather than realizing the
source of true fulfillment.

To come into the now,
to the present moment,

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.940 align:middle line:84%
is to learn to surrender
the preferences

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:22.700 align:middle line:84%
of the conditioned mind, to burn
up opposing states by remaining

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.640 align:middle line:84%
non-reactive to anything
that is appearing

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.280 align:middle line:90%
within the field of change.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:33.720 align:middle line:84%
To meditate is to burn
up the conditioned self,

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:39.330 align:middle line:84%
or you can say to free energy
from the conditioned self.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:42.750 align:middle line:84%
This truth is found in
the Gospel of Thomas,

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:46.830 align:middle line:84%
which says, "If you bring
forth what is within you, what

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:90%
you bring forth will save you.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:10%

A mountain may be

If meditation is simply a
cessation or a stopping,

if it's simply
coming to stillness,

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:30.340 align:middle line:84%
then why do we need so many

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.760 align:middle line:90%
The truth is we can just stop.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.270 align:middle line:84%
We can surrender the
activities of our character.

It is this persistence
of the illusion that

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.200 align:middle line:84%
makes it necessary
for most people

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.380 align:middle line:84%
to penetrate into
the unconscious mind.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:21.230 align:middle line:84%
To stay awake, we have to purify
the avatar of its samskaras,

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.690 align:middle line:84%
of its karma, or
its programming,

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.690 align:middle line:84%
so that the unconscious
aspects of self

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:29.710 align:middle line:90%
are no longer driving the show.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.490 align:middle line:84%
When I say purify, I don't
mean that the avatar is somehow

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.200 align:middle line:90%
bad or negative.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.250 align:middle line:84%
I simply mean that it is
possible to dis-identify

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:41.440 align:middle line:90%
a sense of self from it.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.500 align:middle line:84%
And the
dis-identification process

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.280 align:middle line:84%
is what we call
purification or cleaning.

I'm cleaning myself of myself.

Our sadhana is to unite
all aspects of our self

so that we are not divided.

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:02.430 align:middle line:84%
We penetrate into the
unconscious by creating

being here in the now as well
as surrendered to what is.

When we engage in our sadhana,
our spiritual practice that

Rather than giving a long

This living energy
of the higher mind

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.370 align:middle line:84%
is the innate intelligence
of the universe.

01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
This nature wisdom has been
systematically suppressed,

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:29.440 align:middle line:84%
demonized, exploited,
and controlled

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:32.860 align:middle line:90%
throughout the last millennia.

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:36.280 align:middle line:10%
In order to free energy from
the unconscious definitions

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.340 align:middle line:10%
that we hold, we
must unbind the knots

01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:43.680 align:middle line:10%
that create identification
with the ego structure,

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:47.655 align:middle line:10%
letting go of grasping at
comfort, letting go of knowing.

Right now at this
time in history,

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:59.530 align:middle line:84%
at this time within
yourself, the debt

01:21:59.530 --> 01:22:04.810 align:middle line:84%
that Socrates is speaking of
is coming due both individually

01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:06.970 align:middle line:90%
and collectively.

01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:11.995 align:middle line:84%
There is only one currency with
which you can pay this debt.

01:22:11.995 --> 01:22:14.365 align:middle line:90%
You must pay with yourself.

When we free our inner
energy, our inner aliveness

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:36.350 align:middle line:10%
from its prison in
pathological structures,

01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:42.090 align:middle line:10%
it becomes free to connect us
with higher levels of mind.

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:45.750 align:middle line:90%
Energy is what connects us all.

01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:50.450 align:middle line:84%
Another name for
this energy is love.

01:22:50.450 --> 01:22:55.910 align:middle line:84%
All true spiritual masters say
that love is the true religion.

01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:59.000 align:middle line:84%
Love is the religion
of the future.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.060 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be institutionalized,
systematized, or conditioned.

01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Love is inseparable from
the realization of the one

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:12.110 align:middle line:90%
primordial consciousness.

01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:15.095 align:middle line:90%
To love is to be one with.
