00:01:24.284 --> 00:01:27.888 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
[NARRATOR] Samadhi is an 
ancient Sanskrit word for which

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:29.556 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
there's no
modern equivalent.

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.195 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
There's a fundamental
challenge with making

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.130 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
a film about Samadhi.

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.968 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
Samadhi points to
something that can't be

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:43.270 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
conveyed on the level of mind.

00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:57.584 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
This film is simply
the outer manifestation

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
of my own inner journey.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:03.957 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
The intention is not to
teach you about Samadhi

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:06.994 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
or provide information
for your mind,

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:10.998 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
but to inspire you to directly
discover your true nature.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:26.747 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
Samadhi is relevant
now more than ever.

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:32.285 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
We are at a time in history
where we have not only

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:36.690 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
forgotten Samadhi, but we've
forgotten what we forgot.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:49.636 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
This forgetting is Maya,
the illusion of the self.

00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.763 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:33.213 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
As humans, most of us live
immersed in our daily lives

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.783 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
with little thought of who
we are, why we are here,

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:37.784 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
or where we're going.

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:48.261 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
Most of us have never realized
the true self, the soul,

00:03:48.261 --> 00:03:51.765 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
or what the Buddha
called anata, that which

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:54.668 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
is beyond name and form.

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:55.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Beyond thinking.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.641 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
As a result, we believe we
are these limited bodies.

00:04:04.611 --> 00:04:08.849 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
We live in fear, either
conscious or unconscious,

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.986 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
that the limited self structure
that we are identified with

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:14.187 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:23%
will die.

00:04:25.866 --> 00:04:28.201 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
In today's world,
the vast majority

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:31.271 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
of people who are engaged
in religious or spiritual

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:37.177 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
practices, such as yoga,
prayer, meditation, chanting,

00:04:37.177 --> 00:04:41.081 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
or any kind of ritual, or
practicing techniques which

00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:44.017 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
are conditioned which means
they are just part

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.652 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
of the ego construct.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:53.560 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
The seeking and the
activity isn't the problem.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.397 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
Thinking you have found the
answer in some external form

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:58.198 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
is the problem.

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:04.738 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
Spirituality, in its
most common form,

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:07.474 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
is no different than the
pathological thinking

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
that is going on everywhere.

00:05:10.944 --> 00:05:14.147 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
It is a further
agitation of the mind.

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:18.151 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
More human doing as
opposed to human being.

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.691 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
The ego construct wants more
money, more power, more love,

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.126 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
more of everything.

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:31.331 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
Those on the so-called
spiritual path

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:37.938 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
desire to be more spiritual,
more awake, more equanimous,

00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:41.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
more peaceful, more enlightened.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.813 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
The danger for you
watching this film

00:05:46.813 --> 00:05:50.483 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
is that your mind will
want to acquire Samadhi.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.855 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
Even more dangerous is
that your mind might

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:58.191 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
think it has acquired Samadhi.

00:06:01.328 --> 00:06:04.197 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
Whenever there's a desire
to attain something,

00:06:04.197 --> 00:06:07.334 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
you can be sure it's the
ego construct at work.

00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:11.438 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
Samadhi is not about
attaining or adding

00:06:11.438 --> 00:06:13.240 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
something more to yourself.

00:06:18.078 --> 00:06:23.016 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
To realize Samadhi is to
learn to die before you die.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.092 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Life and death are like yin and
yang, an inseparable continuum

00:06:32.092 --> 00:06:36.229 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
endlessly unfolding with
no beginning and no end.

00:06:37.597 --> 00:06:41.601 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
When we push away death,
we also push away life.

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:47.007 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
When you experience the truth
directly of who you are,

00:06:47.007 --> 00:06:49.909 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
there is no longer any
fear of life or death.

00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:58.151 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
We are told who we are by
our society and our culture.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:01.888 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
And at the same time, we
are slaves to the deeper

00:07:01.888 --> 00:07:05.091 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
unconscious biological
craving and aversion

00:07:05.091 --> 00:07:06.693 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
that governs our choices.

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.835 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
The ego construct is nothing
more than the impulse

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:16.636 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
to repeat.

00:07:17.704 --> 00:07:20.974 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
It's simply the path
that energy once took,

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:24.544 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
and the tendency for the
energy to take that path again,

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:27.447 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
whether it is positive or
negative for the organism.

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:36.756 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
There are endless levels
of memory or mind,

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:39.025 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
spirals within spirals.

00:07:39.959 --> 00:07:43.263 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
When your consciousness
identifies with this mind

00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:47.534 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
or ego construct, it ties you
to social conditioning,

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:50.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
which you could call the matrix.

00:07:54.941 --> 00:07:58.278 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
There are aspects of the ego
that we can be conscious of,

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:02.982 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
but it's the unconscious,
the archaic wiring,

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:06.486 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
the primal existential
fears that are actually

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:08.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
driving the whole machine.

00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:16.629 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
Endless patterns of grasping
towards pleasure and avoidance

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:21.101 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
of pain are sublimated into
pathological behaviors.

00:08:21.835 --> 00:08:26.673 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
Our work, 
our relationships,

00:08:28.241 --> 00:08:31.978 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
our beliefs, 
our very thoughts,

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:33.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and our whole way of living.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:41.654 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Like cattle, most humans live
and die in passive subjugation,

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:45.492 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
feeding their lives
to the matrix.

00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:12.185 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
We live lives locked
into narrow patterns.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:15.355 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
Lives often filled
with great suffering.

00:09:15.355 --> 00:09:18.591 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
And it never occurs to us that
we can actually become free.

00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:29.169 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
It is possible to let
go of the life that has

00:09:29.169 --> 00:09:31.070 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
been inherited from the past.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.709 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
To live the one that is
waiting to come forth

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
through the inner world.

00:10:08.475 --> 00:10:12.312 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
We were all born into this world
with biological conditioned

00:10:12.312 --> 00:10:16.182 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
structures, but
without self-awareness.

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:23.556 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Often when you look into
a young child's eyes,

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:27.527 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
there's no trace of self,
only luminous emptiness.

00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:36.035 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
The person one grows into is a
mask worn over consciousness.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.010 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Shakespeare said, 
"all the world's a stage

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:47.647 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
and all the men and women,
merely players."

00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:57.357 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
In an awakened individual,
consciousness

00:10:57.357 --> 00:11:00.760 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
shines through the personality,
through the mask.

00:11:04.464 --> 00:11:06.666 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
When you are awake,
you don't become

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.668 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
identified with your character.

00:11:09.202 --> 00:11:12.272 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
You don't believe that you are
the masks that you are wearing.

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:19.312 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
But nor do you give
up playing a role.

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:47.173 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
When we are identified with
our character, our persona,

00:11:47.173 --> 00:11:50.410 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
this is Maya, the
illusion of the self.

00:11:54.314 --> 00:11:57.951 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
Samadhi is awakening from
the dream of your character

00:11:57.951 --> 00:11:59.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
in the play of life.

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:17.537 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
2,400 years after Plato
wrote the "Republic,"

00:12:17.537 --> 00:12:21.140 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
humanity is still making
its way out of Plato's cave.

00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:29.082 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
In fact, we may be more
transfixed by illusions

00:12:29.082 --> 00:12:30.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
than ever.

00:12:36.723 --> 00:12:39.058 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
Plato had Socrates
describe a group

00:12:39.058 --> 00:12:42.829 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
of people who lived chained
in a cave all of their lives

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:44.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
facing a blank wall.

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:49.335 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
All they could see were
shadows projected on the wall

00:12:49.335 --> 00:12:51.704 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
by the things passing
in front of a fire which

00:12:51.704 --> 00:12:53.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
was behind them.

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:55.508 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
This puppet show
became their world.

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:03.383 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
According to Socrates, 
the shadows

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:05.418 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
were as close as the
prisoners would ever

00:13:05.418 --> 00:13:07.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
get to seeing reality.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.627 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Even after being told
about the outside world,

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:18.197 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
they continued to believe that
the shadows were all that is.

00:13:19.499 --> 00:13:22.669 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
Even if they suspected
there was something more,

00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:25.204 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
they were unwilling to
leave what was familiar.

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:37.950 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
Humanity today is
like the people

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:40.420 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
who have only seen the
shadows on the cave wall.

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:44.123 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
The shadows are analogous
to our thoughts.

00:13:45.058 --> 00:13:48.294 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
The world of thinking is
the only world that we know,

00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:50.096 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
but there is
another world that's

00:13:50.096 --> 00:13:53.966 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
beyond thinking, 
beyond the dualistic mind.

00:13:57.103 --> 00:13:59.238 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
Are you willing
to leave the cave?

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:02.909 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
To leave all that you
have known to find out

00:14:02.909 --> 00:14:04.644 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
the truth of who you are?

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:18.591 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
In order 
to experience Samadhi,

00:14:18.591 --> 00:14:21.728 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
it's necessary to turn attention
away from the shadows,

00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:25.331 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
away from the thoughts,
towards the light.

00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:30.069 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
When a person is only
used to darkness,

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:32.872 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
then they must gradually
become accustomed to the light.

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:52.625 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
Like acclimatizing
to any new paradigm,

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:57.597 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
it takes time and effort and a
willingness to explore the new,

00:14:57.597 --> 00:14:59.265 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
as well as shed the old.

00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:21.254 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
The mind can be likened to
a trap for consciousness,

00:15:21.254 --> 00:15:22.789 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
a labyrinth or a prison.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.867 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
It is not that you are in
prison, you are the prison.

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:46.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
The prison is an illusion.

00:15:48.514 --> 00:15:51.617 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
If you are identified
with an illusory self,

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:52.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
then you are asleep.

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:56.689 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
Once you are aware
of the prison,

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:59.058 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
if you fight to get
out of the illusion,

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:01.627 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
then you're treating the
illusion as if it's real,

00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
and you still remain asleep.

00:16:05.298 --> 00:16:07.967 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
Except now, the dream
becomes a nightmare.

00:16:08.868 --> 00:16:12.004 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
You'll be chasing and
running from shadows forever.

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:23.950 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
Samadhi is awakening from the
dream of the separate self

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.451 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
or the egoic construct.

00:16:26.886 --> 00:16:31.023 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
Samadhi is awakening from
identification with the prison

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:32.525 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
that I call me.

00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:43.269 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
You can never actually be
free because wherever you go,

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.071 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
your prison is there.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.944 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
Awakening is not about getting
rid of the mind or the matrix.

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:55.481 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
On the contrary, when you're
not identified with it,

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:58.517 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
then you can experience the
play of life more fully.

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:02.255 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
Enjoying the show as it is
without craving or fear.

00:17:03.956 --> 00:17:06.158 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
In the ancient teachings,
this was called

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:10.696 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
the divine game of Leela,
the game of playing in duality.

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:24.510 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
Human consciousness
is a continuum.

00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
On one extreme humans 
are identified

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.049 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
with the material self.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:35.021 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
On the other extreme is
Samadhi, the cessation of self.

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:41.827 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
Every step we take on the
continuum towards Samadhi,

00:17:41.827 --> 00:17:43.095 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
brings less suffering.

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:49.902 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
Less suffering does not
mean life is free from pain.

00:17:53.439 --> 00:17:57.376 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
Samadhi is beyond the
duality of pain and pleasure.

00:17:59.011 --> 00:18:01.647 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
What it means is 
that there is less mind,

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:05.618 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
less self creating resistance
to whatever unfolds.

00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:09.822 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
And not resistance is
what creates suffering.

00:18:22.068 --> 00:18:24.737 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
Realizing Samadhi
even once allows

00:18:24.737 --> 00:18:27.406 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
you to see what is at the
other end of the continuum.

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:31.677 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
To see that there is something
other than the material world

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
and self-interest.

00:18:34.747 --> 00:18:36.682 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:41%
When there is an
actual cessation

00:18:36.682 --> 00:18:38.918 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
of the self structure 
in Samadhi,

00:18:38.918 --> 00:18:40.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
there is no egoic thought.

00:18:41.587 --> 00:18:43.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:21%
No self.

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:44.290 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
No duality.

00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:50.496 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
Yet, there is still the 
"I am," the Anatta or no self.

00:18:53.733 --> 00:18:57.269 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
In that emptiness is the
dawn of prajna or wisdom.

00:18:59.672 --> 00:19:01.807 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
The understanding
that the imminent self

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:04.877 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
is far beyond the
play of duality,

00:19:04.877 --> 00:19:06.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
beyond the entire continuum.

00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:16.756 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
The imminent self is timeless,
unchanging, always now.

00:19:17.923 --> 00:19:21.894 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
Enlightenment is the merging
of the primordial spiral,

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:24.864 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
the ever changing
manifested world,

00:19:24.864 --> 00:19:30.236 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
or lotus, in which time unfolds
with your timeless being.

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:38.277 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
Your inner wiring grows like
an ever unfolding flower

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:41.080 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
as you disidentify 
with the self,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.382 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
becoming a living bridge

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:46.652 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
between the world 
of time and the timeless.

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.644 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
Merely realizing
the imminent self

00:20:11.644 --> 00:20:13.813 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
is only the beginning
of one's path.

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:17.316 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
Most people will have
to experience and lose

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:20.519 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Samadhi countless times 
in meditation

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.321 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
before they are
able to integrate it

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:24.023 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
into other facets of life.

00:20:26.325 --> 00:20:29.495 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
It's not unusual to
have profound insights

00:20:29.495 --> 00:20:32.665 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
into the nature of your
being during meditation

00:20:32.665 --> 00:20:37.002 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
or self-inquiry, only to find
yourself once again

00:20:37.002 --> 00:20:39.805 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
falling back 
into old patterns.

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:41.907 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
Forgetting the truth
of who you are.

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:52.518 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:53.986 --> 00:20:58.190 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
To realize that stillness
or emptiness in every facet

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:01.527 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
of life, every facet 
of one's self,

00:21:01.527 --> 00:21:05.664 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
is to become emptiness
dancing as all things.

00:21:23.249 --> 00:21:26.819 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
Stillness is not something
separate from movement.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:30.156 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
It is not opposite to movement.

00:21:30.923 --> 00:21:33.959 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
In Samadhi, stillness
is recognized

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:36.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
to be identical with movement.

00:21:36.829 --> 00:21:39.732 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Form is identical to emptiness.

00:21:42.368 --> 00:21:47.740 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
This is nonsensical to the
mind because mind is the coming

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:49.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
into being of duality.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:02.655 --> 00:22:06.525 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
Rene Descartes, the father
of Western philosophy,

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:10.863 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
is famous for the saying,
"I think, therefore I am."

00:22:12.364 --> 00:22:15.267 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
No other phrase more
clearly encapsulates

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:19.838 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
the fall of civilization and
the full scale identification

00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:22.074 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
with the shadows
on the cave wall.

00:22:25.811 --> 00:22:30.849 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
Descartes' error, like the
error of almost all humans,

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:34.954 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
was the equating of fundamental
being with thinking.

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:49.401 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
At the beginning of his
most famous treaties,

00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:51.470 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
Descartes wrote that
almost everything

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.038 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
can be called into doubt.

00:22:53.806 --> 00:22:56.375 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
He can doubt his senses
and even his thoughts.

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:06.719 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
Likewise, in the 
"Kalama Sutta," the Buddha

00:23:06.719 --> 00:23:10.155 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
said that in order to
ascertain the truth,

00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:15.160 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
one must doubt all traditions,
scriptures, teachings,

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:18.597 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
and all the content of
one's mind and senses.

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:26.171 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
Both of these men started
with great skepticism,

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:28.707 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
but the difference was
that Descartes stopped

00:23:28.707 --> 00:23:31.043 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
inquiring at the
level of thinking

00:23:31.043 --> 00:23:32.878 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
while the Buddha went deeper.

00:23:33.646 --> 00:23:37.383 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
He penetrated beyond the
deepest levels of the mind.

00:23:39.952 --> 00:23:44.356 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
Maybe if Descartes had gone
beyond his thinking mind,

00:23:44.356 --> 00:23:47.192 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
he would have realized
his true nature

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:50.496 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
and Western consciousness
would be very different today.

00:23:53.465 --> 00:23:55.267 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:58.537 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
Instead, Descartes
described the possibility

00:23:58.537 --> 00:24:01.206 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
of an evil demon that
could be keeping us

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:02.975 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
under a veil of illusion.

00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:08.013 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Descartes did not recognize
this evil demon for what it was.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.955 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
As in the movie 
"The Matrix," we could all

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:19.992 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
be hooked up to some
elaborate program feeding us

00:24:19.992 --> 00:24:22.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
an illusory dream world.

00:24:22.494 --> 00:24:26.265 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
In the movie, humans lived
out their lives in the matrix.

00:24:26.265 --> 00:24:28.233 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
While on another level, 
they were merely

00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:31.003 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
batteries feeding
their life force

00:24:31.003 --> 00:24:34.573 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
to the machines which used their
energy for their own agenda.

00:25:06.772 --> 00:25:09.975 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
People always want to blame
something outside themselves

00:25:09.975 --> 00:25:13.879 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
for the state of the world
or for their own unhappiness,

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:18.050 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
whether it's a person, a
particular group or country,

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.920 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
religion, or some kind of
controlling Illuminati,

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.257 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
like Descartes' evil demon
or the sentient machines

00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:26.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
in "The Matrix."

00:25:29.762 --> 00:25:34.133 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Ironically, the demon Descartes
envisioned was the very thing

00:25:34.133 --> 00:25:35.901 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that he defined himself by.

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:39.204 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
When you realize Samadhi, 
it becomes clear

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:40.806 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that there is a controller.

00:25:41.373 --> 00:25:44.676 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
There is a machine, 
an evil demon leaching

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:46.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
your life day after day.

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:50.983 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
The machine is you.

00:26:01.493 --> 00:26:04.663 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
Your self structure is made
up of many little conditioned

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:07.366 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
sub-programs, 
or little bosses.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.036 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
One little boss
that craves food.

00:26:11.036 --> 00:26:12.304 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
Another craves money.

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:18.076 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
Another status, position, power.

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:24.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
Sex, intimacy.

00:26:25.717 --> 00:26:28.754 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
Another wants consciousness
or attention from others.

00:26:29.555 --> 00:26:31.790 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
The desires are
literally endless

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.392 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
and can never be satisfied.

00:26:35.093 --> 00:26:39.264 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
We spend a lot of our time and
energy decorating our prisons.

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
Succumbing to pressures
to improve our masks.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:46.271 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
And feeding these little bosses
making them more powerful.

00:26:47.206 --> 00:26:48.974 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
Like drug addicts,
the more we try

00:26:48.974 --> 00:26:52.511 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
to satisfy the little bosses,
the more we end up craving.

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:03.155 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
The path to freedom is not
self-improvement or somehow

00:27:03.155 --> 00:27:06.391 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
satisfying the self's agenda,
but it's a dropping

00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:08.393 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
of the self's agenda altogether.

00:27:13.232 --> 00:27:16.068 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
Some people fear that
awakening their true nature

00:27:16.068 --> 00:27:18.670 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
will mean that they
lose their individuality

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:20.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
and enjoyment of life.

00:27:21.206 --> 00:27:23.175 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
Actually, the opposite is true.

00:27:23.876 --> 00:27:26.945 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
The unique individuation
of the soul

00:27:26.945 --> 00:27:31.049 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
can only be expressed when the
conditioned self is overcome.

00:27:36.221 --> 00:27:39.892 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
Because we remain asleep
in the matrix, most of us

00:27:39.892 --> 00:27:43.362 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
never find out what the soul
actually wants to express.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.513 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
The path to Samadhi
involves meditation

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:04.650 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
which is both observing 
the conditioned self,

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.521 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
that which changes, and
realizing your true nature,

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:11.857 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
that which does not change.

00:28:14.626 --> 00:28:17.429 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
When you come to
your still point,

00:28:17.429 --> 00:28:20.933 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
the source of your
being, then you'll

00:28:20.933 --> 00:28:24.736 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
await further instructions
without any insistence on how

00:28:24.736 --> 00:28:26.838 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
your outer world has to change.

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:31.109 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
Not my will, but
higher will be done.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:42.254 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
If the mind only tries to change
the outer world to conform

00:28:42.254 --> 00:28:46.058 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
with some idea of what you
think the path should be,

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:48.727 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
it's like trying to change
the image in a mirror

00:28:48.727 --> 00:28:50.662 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
by manipulating the reflection.

00:28:52.164 --> 00:28:54.900 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
To make the image
in a mirror smile,

00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:58.337 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
you obviously can't
manipulate the reflection.

00:28:58.337 --> 00:29:02.207 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
You have to realize the you
that is the authentic source

00:29:02.207 --> 00:29:03.375 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
of the reflection.

00:29:05.711 --> 00:29:08.547 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
Once you realize
the authentic self,

00:29:08.547 --> 00:29:10.716 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
it doesn't mean that
anything on the outside

00:29:10.716 --> 00:29:12.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
necessarily needs to change.

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:18.690 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
What changes is the conscious,
intelligent inner energy,

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:22.894 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
or prana, which is freed
from conditioned patterns

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:25.697 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
and becomes available to
be directed by the soul.

00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:33.538 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
You can only become aware
of the soul's purpose

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:36.208 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
when you are able to
watch the conditioned self

00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:40.746 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
and its endless pursuits...
and let them go.

In Greek mythology, it was
said that the gods condemned

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:05.704 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Sisyphus to repeat a meaningless
task for all eternity.

00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:10.776 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
His task was to endlessly
push a boulder up a mountain

00:30:10.776 --> 00:30:12.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
only to have it roll down again.

00:30:24.856 --> 00:30:29.094 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
The French existentialist and
Nobel Prize winning author,

00:30:29.094 --> 00:30:32.898 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Albert Camus, solved the
situation of Sisyphus

00:30:32.898 --> 00:30:34.866 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
as a metaphor for humanity.

00:30:35.634 --> 00:30:37.969 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
He asked the
question, how can we

00:30:37.969 --> 00:30:40.739 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
find meaning in this
absurd existence?

00:30:47.245 --> 00:30:50.515 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
As humans, we are
toiling endlessly.

00:30:50.515 --> 00:30:53.318 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
Building for a tomorrow
that never arrives.

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:56.555 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
And then, we die.

00:31:09.501 --> 00:31:13.205 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
If we truly realize
this truth, then we

00:31:13.205 --> 00:31:15.674 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
will either go mad
if we are identified

00:31:15.674 --> 00:31:17.509 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:61%
with our egoic personas.

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.849 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
Or we will awaken
and become free.

00:31:32.891 --> 00:31:35.861 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
We can never succeed
in the outer struggle

00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:38.830 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
because it's just a
reflection of our inner world.

00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:43.735 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
The cosmic joke, the
absurdity of the situation

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:47.038 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
becomes clear when there's
a complete and utter failure

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:50.909 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
of the egoic self to awaken
through its futile pursuits.

In Zen, there is a saying,
"before enlightenment,

00:32:20.205 --> 00:32:23.008 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
chop wood, carry water.

00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:28.680 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
After enlightenment,
chop wood, carry water."

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:38.990 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
Before enlightenment, one must
roll the ball up the hill.

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:43.261 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
After enlightenment, one must
also roll the ball up the hill.

00:32:44.963 --> 00:32:46.264 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:43%
What has changed?

00:32:47.666 --> 00:32:50.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
The inner resistance to what is.

00:32:52.003 --> 00:32:57.275 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
The struggle has been dropped
or rather, the one who struggles

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:59.878 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
has been realized
to be illusory.

00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:05.050 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
The individual will,
or individual mind,

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:09.654 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
and divine will, or
higher mind, are aligned.

Samadhi is ultimately a
dropping of all inner resistance

00:33:24.336 --> 00:33:27.706 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
to all changing phenomena
without exception.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.911 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
The one who is able to
realize inner peace,

00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:38.283 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
irrespective of circumstance,
has attained true Samadhi.

00:33:39.284 --> 00:33:41.920 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
You drop resistance
not because you

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:46.558 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
condone one thing or another,
but so that your inner freedom

00:33:46.558 --> 00:33:48.793 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
is not contingent on the outer.

00:33:52.264 --> 00:33:56.434 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
It's important to note that
when we accept reality as it is,

00:33:56.434 --> 00:33:58.236 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
it doesn't necessarily
mean that we

00:33:58.236 --> 00:34:00.805 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
stop taking action
in the world or we

00:34:00.805 --> 00:34:03.008 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
become meditating passivists.

00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:06.378 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
Actually, the
opposite can be true.

00:34:07.112 --> 00:34:09.514 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
When we're free to act
without being driven

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:12.017 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
by unconscious
motives, then it is

00:34:12.017 --> 00:34:14.653 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
possible to act in
alignment with the Tao,

00:34:15.453 --> 00:34:18.556 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
with the full force of our
inner energy behind us.

Many will argue that in
order to change the world

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:36.574 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
and bring about peace,
we need to fight harder

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:38.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
against our perceived enemies.

00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:43.148 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
Fighting for peace is
like shouting for silence.

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:46.751 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
It just creates more
of what you don't want.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.289 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
These days, there's a
war against everything.

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:52.958 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
A war against terror.

00:34:53.992 --> 00:34:55.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
A war against disease.

00:34:56.528 --> 00:34:57.796 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
A war against hunger.

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:03.969 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Every war is actually 
a war against ourselves.

00:35:13.645 --> 00:35:16.548 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
The fight is part of
a collective delusion.

00:35:17.382 --> 00:35:19.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
We say that we want peace,

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:22.587 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
but we continue to elect leaders
who engage in war.

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:27.659 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
We lie to ourselves saying that
we are for human rights,

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:31.096 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
but continue to buy
products made in sweatshops.

00:35:32.197 --> 00:35:35.734 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
We say we want clean air,
but we continue to pollute.

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:39.270 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
We want science to
cure us of cancer

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:42.173 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
but won't change our
self-destructive habitual

behaviors that make us
more likely to be sick.

00:35:45.877 --> 00:35:49.714 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
We delude ourselves that we
are promoting a better life.

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:53.418 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
We don't want to see our
hidden parts that are

condoning suffering and death.

our own thinking and behavior,

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:13.238 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
actually lets us continue
to delude ourselves.

00:36:13.238 --> 00:36:17.142 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
That we don't have to change the
way we operate on this planet.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.546 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
The inner world is where
the revolution must first

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:22.814 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:28%
take place.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:29.354 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
Only when we can directly feel
the spiral of life within,

00:36:29.354 --> 00:36:32.490 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
will the outer world come
into alignment with the Tao.

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:39.230 align:start line:79% position:50% size:81%
Until then, anything we do will
add to the chaos already created

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:31%
by the mind.

00:36:42.067 --> 00:36:45.437 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
War and peace arise together
in an endless dance.

00:36:46.738 --> 00:36:48.239 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
They are one continuum.

One half cannot exist
without the other.

00:36:53.078 --> 00:36:55.547 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
Just as light cannot
exist without dark.

00:36:55.814 --> 00:36:57.749 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
And up cannot
exist without down.

00:36:59.184 --> 00:37:01.920 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
The world seems to want
light without darkness.

00:37:02.454 --> 00:37:04.089 align:middle line:85% position:46% size:68%
Fullness without emptiness.

00:37:05.824 --> 00:37:07.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
Happiness without sadness.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:32.484 --> 00:37:35.653 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
The more the mind gets
involved, the more fragmented

00:37:35.653 --> 00:37:36.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
the world becomes.

00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:40.959 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
Every solution that
comes from the egoic mind

00:37:40.959 --> 00:37:44.162 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
is driven by the idea
that there is a problem,

00:37:44.696 --> 00:37:47.232 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
and the solution becomes 
an even greater problem

00:37:47.232 --> 00:37:49.300 align:middle line:79% position:46% size:41%
than what it was
trying to solve.

00:37:53.104 --> 00:37:55.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
What you resist, persists.

00:38:07.552 --> 00:38:11.189 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
Human ingenuity creates
new antibiotics

00:38:11.189 --> 00:38:14.325 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
only to find nature
getting more cunning

00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:16.127 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
as bacteria get stronger.

00:38:17.028 --> 00:38:20.532 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Despite our best efforts
in the ongoing fight,

00:38:20.532 --> 00:38:23.535 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
the prevalence of cancer
is actually increasing.

00:38:24.736 --> 00:38:28.306 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
The number of hungry people
in the world steadily grows.

00:38:30.008 --> 00:38:34.579 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
The number of terrorist attacks
worldwide continues to rise.

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:42.854 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
What's wrong with our approach?

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:48.726 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
Like the sorcerer's apprentice
from Goethe's poem,

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:51.095 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
we have taken hold
of a great power,

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:53.565 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
but we do not have the
wisdom to wield it.

00:38:59.103 --> 00:39:01.706 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
The problem is that we do
not understand the tool

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:02.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
that we are using.

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:05.710 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
We do not understand 
the human mind

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
and its proper role and purpose.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:39:18.256 --> 00:39:21.593 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
The crisis is born of the
limited conditioned way

00:39:21.593 --> 00:39:25.630 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
in which we think, the way
we feel, and experience life.

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:38.576 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Our rationalism has
robbed us of our ability

00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:41.746 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
to recognize and
experience the wisdom

00:39:41.746 --> 00:39:43.581 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
of many ancient cultures.

00:39:48.286 --> 00:39:51.522 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Our egoic thinking has
robbed us of the ability

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:55.793 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
to feel the depth and
profound sacredness of life.

00:39:56.594 --> 00:39:58.363 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
The numinosity of life.

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:01.599 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
And to realize entirely
different levels

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:05.803 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
of consciousness, which are
now almost lost to humanity.

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:14.112 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
In the ancient
Egyptian tradition,

00:40:14.112 --> 00:40:17.915 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
Nedirs were archetypal
forms whose characteristics

00:40:17.915 --> 00:40:20.418 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
could be embodied by
those who purified

00:40:20.418 --> 00:40:23.955 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
their physical and spiritual
bodies in such a way

00:40:23.955 --> 00:40:27.292 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
that they were fit to house
higher consciousnesses.

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:33.698 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
The original Nedir, or
the divine principle

00:40:33.698 --> 00:40:37.835 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
of this wisdom, was known
as Thoth for Tahuti.

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:43.141 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Often depicted as a scribe with
the head of a bird, or ibis,

00:40:43.141 --> 00:40:46.611 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
and represented the origin
of all knowledge and wisdom.

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.684 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
Thoth could be described 
as the cosmic principle

00:40:52.684 --> 00:40:54.585 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:58%
of thinking or thought.

00:40:57.021 --> 00:41:02.126 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
Thoth gave us language,
concepts, writing, mathematics,

00:41:02.126 --> 00:41:05.263 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
and all the arts and
manifestations of the mind.

00:41:07.365 --> 00:41:10.134 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Only those who had gone
through special training

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:13.237 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
were allowed to access
Thoth's sacred knowledge.

00:41:18.176 --> 00:41:20.511 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
The Book of Thoth is
not a physical book,

00:41:21.179 --> 00:41:24.582 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
but is the wisdom of the
Akashic or etheric realm.

00:41:27.485 --> 00:41:30.822 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
Legend tells that Thoth's
knowledge was deeply

00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:34.092 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
hidden in a secret place
within every human being,

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:37.228 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
and was protected
by a golden serpent.

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:46.571 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
The archetypal or perennial
myth of the serpent or dragon

00:41:46.571 --> 00:41:50.975 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
guarding a treasure is one
that permeates many cultures.

00:41:55.413 --> 00:42:01.652 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
And has been called by names
such as Kundalini Shakti, Chi,

00:42:01.652 --> 00:42:04.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
Holy Spirit, and inner energy.

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:10.128 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
The golden serpent is
the egoic construct which

00:42:10.128 --> 00:42:12.263 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
is bound in the inner energies.

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:15.933 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
And until it's
mastered and overcome,

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:19.404 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
the soul will never be able
to attain the true wisdom.

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:22.774 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
It was said that the 
Book of Thoth brought nothing

00:42:22.774 --> 00:42:25.676 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
but suffering to any
individual who read it.

00:42:27.512 --> 00:42:31.582 align:start line:79% position:44% size:78%
Even though they would find the
secrets of the gods themselves

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:34.051 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:56%
and all that is hidden
within the stars.

00:42:35.987 --> 00:42:38.122 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
What must be understood
is that the book

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:41.726 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
brought suffering to any
individual who read it

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.829 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
and the ego that
tried to control it.

00:42:46.898 --> 00:42:50.535 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
In the Egyptian tradition,
awakened consciousness

00:42:50.535 --> 00:42:52.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
was represented by Osiris.

00:42:53.905 --> 00:42:56.574 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
Without this awakened
consciousness,

00:42:56.574 --> 00:43:00.778 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
any knowledge or understanding
attained by the limited self

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:04.482 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
would be dangerous,
disconnected from higher wisdom.

00:43:08.486 --> 00:43:11.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
The Eye of Horus had to be open.

00:43:16.027 --> 00:43:18.796 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
The esoteric meaning
that we find here

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:22.166 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
is similar to the more
familiar story of the fall

00:43:22.166 --> 00:43:23.434 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:56%
in the Garden of Eden.

00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:27.405 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
The Book of Thoth parallels
the tree of knowledge,

00:43:27.405 --> 00:43:30.675 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
of good and evil, 
whose fruits Adam and Eve

00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:31.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
were tempted to eat.

00:43:41.719 --> 00:43:45.389 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Humanity, of course, has already
eaten the forbidden fruit.

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:48.559 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
Already opened
the Book of Thoth.

00:43:49.427 --> 00:43:51.329 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
And has been cast
out of the garden.

00:43:55.766 --> 00:44:00.104 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
The serpent is a metaphor
for the primordial spiral

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:03.474 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
that extends from the
microcosm to the macrocosm.

00:44:06.811 --> 00:44:10.147 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
Today, the serpent
is living as you.

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:17.121 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
It is the egoic mind expressed
as the manifested world.

00:44:19.023 --> 00:44:23.027 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
We have never before had
access to so much knowledge.

00:44:23.794 --> 00:44:26.597 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
We've gone deep into
the material world,

00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:29.200 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
even finding the
so-called God Particle.

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:33.437 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
But we've never been
more  limited, more ignorant

00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:36.974 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
of who we are and how to live.

00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:39.610 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
And we do not understand 
the mechanism

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:41.812 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
by which we create suffering.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:45:28.593 --> 00:45:31.762 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Our thinking has created
the world as it is now.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:35.032 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
Whenever we label
something as good or bad

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:38.636 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
or create a preference in our
mind, it's due to the coming

00:45:38.636 --> 00:45:42.373 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
into being of the egoic
structures or self interests.

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:48.779 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
The solution is not to fight
for peace or conquer nature,

00:45:49.447 --> 00:45:51.649 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
but to simply
recognize the truth

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:56.887 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
that the very existence
of the ego structure

00:45:56.887 --> 00:46:01.025 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
creates duality, a split
between self and other.

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:03.127 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Mine and yours.

00:46:03.961 --> 00:46:05.129 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
Man and nature.

00:46:06.464 --> 00:46:07.832 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:41%
Inner and outer.

00:46:10.968 --> 00:46:13.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
The ego is violence.

00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:18.042 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
It requires a barrier, 
a boundary from the other

00:46:18.042 --> 00:46:19.110 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:38%
in order to be.

00:46:20.378 --> 00:46:23.681 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
Without the ego, there is
no war against anything.

00:46:24.382 --> 00:46:25.650 align:middle line:85% position:48% size:48%
There is no hubris.

00:46:26.183 --> 00:46:29.420 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
There is no overreaching
nature to create profit.

00:46:31.222 --> 00:46:33.891 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
These external
crises in our world

00:46:33.891 --> 00:46:36.327 align:middle line:85% position:44% size:78%
reflect a serious inner crisis.

00:46:38.262 --> 00:46:39.964 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:63%
We don't know who we are.

00:46:41.265 --> 00:46:45.102 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
We are completely identified
with our egoic identities,

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:50.241 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
consumed by fears, and are
cut off from our true nature.

00:46:52.843 --> 00:46:57.381 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
Races, religions, countries,
political affiliations,

00:46:58.049 --> 00:47:01.152 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
and any group that we
belong to all reinforce

00:47:01.152 --> 00:47:02.753 align:middle line:85% position:47% size:53%
our egoic identities.

00:47:04.855 --> 00:47:08.325 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:65%
Almost every group that
exists on the planet today

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:11.595 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
wants to claim its perspective
as true and correct,

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:14.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:81%
as we do on an individual level.

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:18.102 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:43%
By claiming the
truth as its own,

00:47:18.102 --> 00:47:21.739 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
the group perpetuates its
own existence in the same way

00:47:21.739 --> 00:47:25.710 align:start line:79% position:36% size:73%
that an ego or self structure
defines itself against other.

00:47:30.081 --> 00:47:33.117 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
Now more than ever,
different realities

00:47:33.117 --> 00:47:36.654 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
and polarized belief systems
are coexisting on Earth.

It is possible for
different people

to experience completely
different thoughts

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:46.964 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%

An event that may appear
apocalyptic to one person,

So what is becoming
obvious is that

00:48:14.258 --> 00:48:16.560 align:middle line:79% position:43% size:48%
your external
circumstances don't

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.730 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%

To realize Samadhi is to
become a self-propelled wheel.

An analogy can be
made with metatron's cube.

00:48:50.694 --> 00:48:54.832 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Metatron is mentioned in various
ancient Christian, Islamic,

00:48:54.832 --> 00:48:58.135 align:middle line:79% position:41% size:58%
and Jewish texts, and
is archetypally related

00:48:58.135 --> 00:49:00.271 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:38%
to the Egyptian
Nedir, Thoth,

as well as Hermes Trismegistus
of Greece.

00:49:05.342 --> 00:49:09.580 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:81%
Metatron is intimately connected
with the tetragrammaton.

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:14.451 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
The tetragrammaton is the
fundamental geometric pattern,

00:49:14.919 --> 00:49:17.721 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:50%
the template or
primordial emanation

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:20.591 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:53%
of physical reality,
which has been called

00:49:20.591 --> 00:49:22.893 align:middle line:85% position:45% size:73%
the word of God or the logos.

Here, we see a two-dimensional
representation of the figure,

00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:33.938 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:63%
but if you look a certain
way, you see a 3-D cube.

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:39.944 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
When you see the cube, nothing
has changed in the figure,

00:49:39.944 --> 00:49:43.447 align:middle line:79% position:36% size:73%
but your mind has added a
new dimension to your seeing.

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:49.086 align:middle line:79% position:45% size:45%
Dimensionality, or
one's perspective,

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:52.456 align:middle line:79% position:40% size:75%
is simply a matter of becoming
habituated to a new way

of perceiving the world.

00:49:56.527 --> 00:50:00.497 align:middle line:79% position:38% size:68%
Upon realizing Samadhi, we
become free of perspective.

00:50:00.965 --> 00:50:04.435 align:middle line:79% position:42% size:70%
We're free to create new
perspectives because there's

00:50:04.435 --> 00:50:08.639 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:78%
no self invested in or attached
to a particular viewpoint.

beyond the limited
self structure.

Einstein said the true
measure of a human being

00:50:29.827 --> 00:50:34.265 align:start line:79% position:40% size:75%
is determined primarily by the

has attained liberation
from the self.

existence of the self is bad.

the mind makes a good servant,

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.056 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
but a poor master.

00:51:17.875 --> 00:51:21.345 align:middle line:10% position:41% size:58%
When the mind and
senses are your master,

00:51:21.345 --> 00:51:24.782 align:middle line:10% position:43% size:65%
they will create endless

If you want 
to realize Samadhi,

00:51:34.992 --> 00:51:38.162 align:middle line:10% position:43% size:65%
do not judge your thoughts
as good or bad,

00:51:38.996 --> 00:51:42.132 align:middle line:79% position:44% size:61%
but find out who you are
prior to thought,
