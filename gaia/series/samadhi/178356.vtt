like galaxies, have a black
hole or mysterious singularity

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.440 align:middle line:90%
at their center.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.900 align:middle line:84%
In this analogy,
we're going to use

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.480 align:middle line:84%
this new definition
of a black hole

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.222 align:middle line:84%
as the center that
is everywhere.

00:27:00.222 --> 00:27:07.110 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.830 align:middle line:84%
In Zen, there are
many poems and koans

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that bring us face to face
with the gateless gate.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.860 align:middle line:84%
One must pass the gateless
gate to realize Samadhi.

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.460 align:middle line:90%


00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:29.440 align:middle line:84%
An event horizon is a boundary
in space-time beyond which

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:32.590 align:middle line:84%
events cannot effect
an outside observer,

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:36.430 align:middle line:84%
which means that whatever is
happening beyond the event

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:40.690 align:middle line:90%
horizon is unknowable to you.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.440 align:middle line:84%
You could say that the event
horizon of a black hole

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:48.360 align:middle line:84%
is analogous to
the gateless gate.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:53.710 align:middle line:84%
It is the threshold between
the self and no self.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:57.340 align:middle line:84%
There is no "me" that
passes the event horizon.

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:01.460 align:middle line:90%


00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:06.470 align:middle line:84%
In the center of a black hole is
the one-dimensional singularity

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.590 align:middle line:84%
containing the mass
of billions of suns

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:15.710 align:middle line:84%
in an unimaginably small space,
effectively an infinite mass,

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.550 align:middle line:84%
literally a universe in
something infinitesimally

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.910 align:middle line:90%
smaller than a grain of sand.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:26.210 align:middle line:84%
The singularity is
something unfathomable,

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.540 align:middle line:90%
beyond time and space.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:33.680 align:middle line:84%
According to physics,
movement is impossible.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:37.900 align:middle line:84%
The existence of
things is impossible.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Whatever it is,
it does not belong

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.960 align:middle line:90%
to the world of perception.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.100 align:middle line:84%
Yet, it cannot be described
as merely stillness.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.095 align:middle line:84%
It is beyond stillness
and movement.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:56.430 align:middle line:84%
When you realize the center
that is everywhere and nowhere,

00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:59.700 align:middle line:90%
duality breaks down--

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.915 align:middle line:84%
form and emptiness,
time and the timeless.

00:29:02.915 --> 00:29:06.650 align:middle line:90%


00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.800 align:middle line:84%
One could call it
a dynamic stillness

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.940 align:middle line:84%
or a pregnant emptiness
within the center

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.650 align:middle line:90%
of absolute darkness.

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:18.600 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:25.080 align:middle line:84%
The Taoist teacher Lao Tzu
said, "Darkness within darkness.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.048 align:middle line:84%
The gateway to all
understanding."

mythologist Joseph Campbell

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.580 align:middle line:84%
describes a recurring
symbol, part

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:52.740 align:middle line:84%
of the perennial philosophy
which he calls the axis mundi,

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:56.400 align:middle line:84%
the central point, or
the highest mountain,

00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.180 align:middle line:84%
the pole around
which all revolves,

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:05.400 align:middle line:84%
the point where stillness
and movement are together.

From this center, a

Just as a sun gets sucked into
a black hole, when you approach

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.470 align:middle line:10%
One must be willing to

accept one's inherent power

If your mind is not moved,

just as your evolution

the singularity that

In the same way, we cannot

We can't see it

by which seeing is possible.

Like the black hole,
Samadhi is not nothingness,

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:45.680 align:middle line:90%
and neither is it a thing.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:52.650 align:middle line:84%
It is the collapse of the
duality of thing and no thing.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:57.460 align:middle line:84%
There is no gate to
enter the Great Reality.

But there are infinite paths.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:05.470 align:middle line:10%
The paths, the dharmas,

out how, and none ever will.

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:49.190 align:middle line:84%
Samadhi is simultaneously a
timeless state of consciousness

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and a stage in an unfolding
development process, something

As one spends more and more

more and more direction

that it becomes a total
surrender of one's self

00:53:20.010 --> 00:53:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and a surrender so

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:28.370 align:middle line:84%
