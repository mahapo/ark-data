00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.790 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Nassim Haramein.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm a researcher
scientist that

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.470 align:middle line:84%
has been working on unifying
physics and many other sciences

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.000 align:middle line:90%
with it.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.119 align:middle line:84%
I am as well a CEO of a research
laboratory called Torus Tech.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.240 align:middle line:84%
And the chairman of a
non-profit foundation

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.150 align:middle line:84%
called Resonance
Science Foundation.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.000 align:middle line:84%
And CEO of a distribution
company called Arc.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.680 align:middle line:10%
>> And Arc is what?

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.680 align:middle line:10%
>> Arc is a technology that's
being distributed that was

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.160 align:middle line:10%
developed at Torus Tech over
the years as a result of some

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.750 align:middle line:10%
of the mathematics and
the physics I've written.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.290 align:middle line:10%
It sounds like that
really wasn't planned

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.500 align:middle line:10%
and then you discovered.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.300 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.810 align:middle line:10%
Actually, it was
one of those things

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.310 align:middle line:10%
where you're going somewhere.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.940 align:middle line:10%
And on the way, you
find something else.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:10%
And so I was working
on gravity control.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:10%
And I realized that everything
around the technology

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.930 align:middle line:10%
I was building seemed to grow
faster, stronger, bigger.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.020 align:middle line:10%
The plants were taking
over the laboratory.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:10%
So I was trying to figure
out what was going on.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.610 align:middle line:10%
And so this was in 1999.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.630 align:middle line:10%
So a while ago.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.890 align:middle line:10%
And I realized that
maybe the water structure

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:10%
was being affected, that the
energy potential of the water

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.470 align:middle line:10%
was being affected.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:10%
So I did a bunch of tests
with water, independent tests,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.630 align:middle line:10%
and found that there
was significant chemical

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.680 align:middle line:10%
change in the water as
a result of the exposure

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.200 align:middle line:10%
to the technology
I was building.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.160 align:middle line:84%
And then throughout the years,
I did more tests, more plant

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.880 align:middle line:90%
tests, animal tests, and so on.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.340 align:middle line:84%
And I realized, OK,
there is application

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.540 align:middle line:90%
to health and wellness.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And so I eventually developed
that branch parallel

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
to continuing to work on energy
production and gravity control.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.620 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.440 align:middle line:10%
You mentioned something
you said unifying physics.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:10%
What does that mean?

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.730 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, physics
currently is fragmented.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.370 align:middle line:10%
You have physics for the
big relativistic equations,

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.670 align:middle line:10%
like very big--

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.640 align:middle line:10%
for very big objects.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.770 align:middle line:10%
Planets, stars, galaxies,
clusters, superclusters.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.600 align:middle line:10%
And you have physics for the
small, like quantum physics that

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.490 align:middle line:10%
deals with particles
and subatomic particles

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.390 align:middle line:10%
and all kinds of dynamics
that are occurring

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.320 align:middle line:10%
in the very small world.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.490 align:middle line:10%
And these two
theories don't agree.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.270 align:middle line:10%
They describe the
universe differently.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.920 align:middle line:10%
One describes it as a
smooth continuum and--

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.970 align:middle line:10%
cosmologically.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.390 align:middle line:10%
And the other one describes
it as quantized, little bits

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.090 align:middle line:10%
or granular in nature.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.120 align:middle line:10%
And the two formalisms
don't work together.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.560 align:middle line:10%
And this is something
that Einstein

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.020 align:middle line:10%
worked till the end
of his life since he

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.545 align:middle line:10%
was involved in the beginning
of both of these theories.

00:03:49.545 --> 00:03:54.300 align:middle line:10%
He felt like there must be a
way to connect them clearly

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.760 align:middle line:10%
since big things are
made out of small things.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.560 align:middle line:10%
So there must be some kind of
relationship between the two.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.250 align:middle line:10%
And it was kind of startling
to me when I was younger

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.920 align:middle line:10%
and I was going to
physics conference

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.810 align:middle line:10%
and talking with physicists.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And I was implying
the importance

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.890 align:middle line:84%
of finding a unified
view of physics.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.980 align:middle line:84%
And at the time,
the prevailing view

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.770 align:middle line:84%
was that it was OK
to have two theories.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:90%
They work just fine.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.350 align:middle line:84%
And we didn't need
to unify them.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.530 align:middle line:84%
And for me, it was
clear that there

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.770 align:middle line:84%
must be a solution that
involves the small in the big

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and the big with
the small so that it

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.640 align:middle line:84%
would be a continuum or an
understanding of our world

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:90%
that's unified.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And of course, I encountered
a lot of resistance

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.420 align:middle line:84%
because there was many
different reasons.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.640 align:middle line:84%
One of them being if
Einstein couldn't find it,

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.120 align:middle line:90%
don't even think about it.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, many
physicists admire Einstein.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.370 align:middle line:90%
And they should.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.520 align:middle line:90%
He was an excellent scientist.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.360 align:middle line:84%
However, Einstein didn't
have the tools we have today.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.050 align:middle line:84%
He didn't have the
data we have today.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.250 align:middle line:90%
We live in a different world.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.120 align:middle line:84%
It's a world in which
we've observed black holes.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.760 align:middle line:84%
We've observed all
kinds of phenomenons.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.640 align:middle line:84%
We've done experiments in
laboratories that were not

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.680 align:middle line:84%
possible at the
time, and so on that

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.970 align:middle line:84%
has led us to a
place where I felt

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.920 align:middle line:84%
like a unified view of
physics could be found.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.210 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I believe
if Einstein was around,

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:84%
he would have with
everything that's

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:58.160 align:middle line:84%
known, because what I found that
unify physics is directly linked

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.170 align:middle line:84%
to some of the predictions of
his own theory, which namely

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.550 align:middle line:90%
black holes and singularities.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So I understand, since
we're on the topic of Einstein,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.410 align:middle line:84%
that there was something that he
realized there was this mistake

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.090 align:middle line:90%
that he made.

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:17.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.980 align:middle line:84%
There was a very
important inflection point

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.000 align:middle line:84%
in Einstein's
discoveries that was

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.760 align:middle line:90%
missed by historians generally.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.700 align:middle line:10%
And that is that early on,
some of the experiments that

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.610 align:middle line:10%
were done and the
result of his theory

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.640 align:middle line:10%
was interpreted in such a way
that space time, as he describes

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:46.870 align:middle line:10%
space and time being this fabric
that could bend to produce

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:10%
gravity, was interpreted
as only an analytical tool

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.750 align:middle line:10%
to describe reality,
meaning that it

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.850 align:middle line:10%
was a mathematical model.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:04.750 align:middle line:10%
And it had no physicality,
reality to it.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.460 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.520 align:middle line:10%
And the result was
that there was no need

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:20.320 align:middle line:10%
anymore to have this
fluid dynamic space that

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.510 align:middle line:10%
used to be called the ether.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.960 align:middle line:10%
And so the ether,
which was in physics

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:10%
at the time, which Maxwell had
used to write the famous Maxwell

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.710 align:middle line:10%
equations for the
electromagnetic field.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:10%
This ether, which
was supposed to be

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.950 align:middle line:10%
prevalent in all
the space and being

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:10%
the medium from
which all waves moved

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.250 align:middle line:10%
and all the dynamics
occurred, this ether

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:10%
was removed and replaced
with a conceptual model

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:10%
called spacetime.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:08:00.650 align:middle line:10%
And Einstein went along
with it for over 10 years.

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:08.020 align:middle line:10%
And then he eventually realized
that relativity required

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.790 align:middle line:10%
an ether, that space be
filled with this energy,

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.690 align:middle line:10%
with this field.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:20.500 align:middle line:10%
But by then, it was too late.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.880 align:middle line:10%
Physicists had taken
off with a certain view.

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.720 align:middle line:10%
They ignored him when he
tried to put it back in.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.190 align:middle line:10%
And as well he had some
significant objections

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:10%
to the way quantum theory
was being developed.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:38.890 align:middle line:10%
And that didn't
make him so popular

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.200 align:middle line:10%
as well in the
physics community.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.380 align:middle line:10%
So the result is that
ether was removed.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:84%
And I think that was
probably one of the biggest

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:56.560 align:middle line:84%
downfalls to understanding our
universe and the physics of it

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:90%
until modern age.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Now there's physicists that
are starting to realize this.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:05.530 align:middle line:84%
One of them is a
Nobel Prize winner

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:10.810 align:middle line:84%
in physics, Frank Wilczek
which did a conference in 2017

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.860 align:middle line:84%
called the materiality of the
vacuum, where he actually-- it's

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:20.260 align:middle line:84%
an excellent conference that
you can find on YouTube.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Where you can see that
the main problem that's

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:34.750 align:middle line:84%
occurring in physics that is
stopping us from understanding

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:84%
the physical world from one
end to the other with one

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.890 align:middle line:84%
fundamental theory is the
result of having removed

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:84%
the ether or having removed
vacuum fluctuation, which

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.010 align:middle line:84%
we found, again,
in modern physics,

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.125 align:middle line:84%
but we named them
something else.

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:58.900 align:middle line:90%


00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:05.620 align:middle line:84%
So really it's been a sinuous
path towards modern physics.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:10.440 align:middle line:84%
And certainly, physics has
become fragmented as a result.

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.240 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.660 align:middle line:10%
So can you set us
straight where do you

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.470 align:middle line:10%
find that we really are today?

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:25.550 align:middle line:10%
>> Today physics is
in-- really in a bind.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:10%
Physicists are looking
feverishly for new physics,

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.720 align:middle line:10%
where the standard
model is stuck.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.640 align:middle line:84%
There's more and
more experiments

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that's showing that the standard
model has some serious deviation

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:90%
from experiments.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.160 align:middle line:10%
There is problems with the
standard cosmological model.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:56.150 align:middle line:10%
At this point in physics, as
well string theory in general

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.120 align:middle line:10%
is thought to have failed
in unifying physics.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:06.910 align:middle line:10%
So it's like everybody is
in this moment of floating,

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.300 align:middle line:10%
kind of lost trying
to find something

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.490 align:middle line:10%
to sink their teeth in.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.640 align:middle line:10%
And it's a very powerful
moment at the same time

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:10%
because it's a moment
of opportunity.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:22.600 align:middle line:10%
It is in those moments
typically that something

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.940 align:middle line:10%
emerged that completely
revolutionized physics.

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:33.340 align:middle line:10%
And so I'm fairly excited
because from the physics

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.590 align:middle line:10%
I've written in the last
few months and the paper

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:43.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm about to release, I've
solved most of these issues,

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:50.050 align:middle line:10%
and shown a very continuous
theory from this Planck scale,

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.980 align:middle line:10%
from quantum scale all the
way to cosmological scale,

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:10%
predicting all of the
scales accurately, very,

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.370 align:middle line:10%
very accurately.

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.750 align:middle line:10%
All the constants, all the
forces with some 12 to 13

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.990 align:middle line:10%
digit accuracy,
which is remarkable.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.250 align:middle line:10%
And I'm talking
much to experiments,

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.470 align:middle line:10%
not much to other theories.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:20.540 align:middle line:10%
So I'm talking very
accurate predictions that

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.520 align:middle line:10%
are confirmed by experiments.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.360 align:middle line:10%
And as a result, we can
have a complete view

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:33.980 align:middle line:10%
of the physical world, which
has very profound meaning as

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.030 align:middle line:10%
well in our understanding
of ourselves,

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:41.870 align:middle line:10%
in our understanding
of our environment,

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.980 align:middle line:10%
our relationship to each
other, and understanding

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.020 align:middle line:10%
of our consciousness
in the midst of it.

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:55.460 align:middle line:84%
>> So with that, what are we
learning about the relationship

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.650 align:middle line:84%
with our self, with our
environment with one another?

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.940 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I think one of the
first things that we're learning

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:10.600 align:middle line:10%
about ourselves from these
equations is that there is no

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:15.070 align:middle line:10%
such thing as a
materialistic view,

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.280 align:middle line:10%
because in order to have
a materialistic view,

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:24.740 align:middle line:10%
you'd have to know what
material is, what matter is.

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:28.300 align:middle line:84%
And when you look closely,
what this equation

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:84%
tells you is that matter is
actually an entanglement network

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.970 align:middle line:84%
of information, that it
is a flow of information

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.380 align:middle line:90%
through a field.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.860 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing really there.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:48.130 align:middle line:84%
There's just a
field, and the field

00:13:48.130 --> 00:13:52.360 align:middle line:84%
organizes itself in little
particles we call matter.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.900 align:middle line:84%
But when you look
closely, all you can see

00:13:55.900 --> 00:14:00.460 align:middle line:84%
is an electrostatic field that
defines a region of space.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.260 align:middle line:90%
We call it a particle.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:07.000 align:middle line:84%
But there's not like a
thing, like people think

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.260 align:middle line:90%
of particles as billiard balls.

00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:11.420 align:middle line:90%
They're not billiard balls.

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.660 align:middle line:90%
They're just fields in space.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:17.840 align:middle line:10%
And it's the space that
provides the energy

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.400 align:middle line:10%
to produce the fields.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.260 align:middle line:90%
And that's what was missed.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And it was missed because,
as I was saying historically,

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:28.580 align:middle line:84%
the ether or the
energy of the field

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.870 align:middle line:90%
was removed from the equations.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.670 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.970 align:middle line:10%
So where is this
energy coming from?

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a good question.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:45.230 align:middle line:84%
So basically what you're asking
there is what started it all.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.720 align:middle line:90%
What is the source of reality?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.775 align:middle line:90%


00:14:50.775 --> 00:14:56.720 align:middle line:10%
And I wish I could say, oh, it
started right there, except that

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.310 align:middle line:10%
what the equation show--

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:10%
And when I say what
the equation show,

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.520 align:middle line:10%
I mean that in a
very precise way.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.210 align:middle line:10%
I don't mean that
in a loose way,

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:14.702 align:middle line:10%
meaning that it
literally shows this,

00:15:14.702 --> 00:15:18.350 align:middle line:10%
that you have fractal
divisions of space,

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.560 align:middle line:10%
meaning that space
organizes-- make particles

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.940 align:middle line:10%
or subatomic particles.

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:26.450 align:middle line:10%
Then these subatomic
particles organizes

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:10%
make protons, electrons,
stars, galaxies,

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.550 align:middle line:10%
clusters, superclusters, so on.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:41.240 align:middle line:10%
And you can find mathematical
resolutions for these equations

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.690 align:middle line:10%
past our universe, so
that our universe--

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:48.270 align:middle line:10%
think of Russian dolls,
one inside each other.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.720 align:middle line:10%
It's like embedded from
infinitely big to infinitely

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:10%
small.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:10%
So the source of the
energy is the relationship

00:15:57.050 --> 00:16:00.830 align:middle line:10%
of infinities with infinities.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.180 align:middle line:10%
And Cantor, a very, very
famous mathematician

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:10%
which was brilliant,
came up with a theorem

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.590 align:middle line:10%
similar to that in
mathematics that

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.890 align:middle line:10%
were called an infinite
amount of infinities.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:19.760 align:middle line:10%
And so when you think of an
infinite amount of infinities,

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.900 align:middle line:10%
you think that doesn't
seem to make any sense.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:27.540 align:middle line:10%
Well, it does in the context
of a fractal structure,

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:32.120 align:middle line:10%
meaning in a fractal structure,
you can take a boundary

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.570 align:middle line:10%
and find an infinite
amount of divisions in it.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.030 align:middle line:10%
But it's still a boundary
that you can say, OK,

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.220 align:middle line:10%
that's an infinity.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:42.710 align:middle line:10%
And then there's
another infinity here,

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.970 align:middle line:10%
it's another boundary.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.330 align:middle line:10%
And so then an infinite
amount of infinities

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.200 align:middle line:10%
is an infinite amount of
boundaries producing infinities.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.610 align:middle line:90%


00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:59.120 align:middle line:10%
And so very literally,
this equation

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:06.470 align:middle line:10%
outputs all of our reality very
precisely, and all of its forces

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:13.550 align:middle line:10%
unified by saying there
is an infinite amount

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:19.460 align:middle line:10%
of fractal divisions that
are driving each other.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So think of a change in density,
like a little change in density

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:31.400 align:middle line:84%
in air pressure, in air
density like cold air, hot air,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:84%
few degree change will
produce a hurricane.

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.045 align:middle line:84%
A huge energy event
that's moving millions

00:17:38.045 --> 00:17:41.210 align:middle line:84%
of tons of water
that is producing

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.850 align:middle line:84%
huge electrical
discharges and all this.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.690 align:middle line:84%
Even they found antimatter
jets being produced

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:50.750 align:middle line:90%
at the center of hurricanes.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So an anti-matter jets
is high energy physics.

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:84%
You have gamma ray
emission and all this.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So basically, think
of the universe being

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.680 align:middle line:84%
this gaseous fluid,
which we call

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:13.570 align:middle line:84%
a plasma, that has changed in
density from infinitely big,

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:18.820 align:middle line:84%
less dense to infinitely
small, more dense.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:22.300 align:middle line:84%
And the result is
that it's driving,

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:26.200 align:middle line:84%
it's spinning itself
into existence.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:28.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's where the
energy comes from.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.630 align:middle line:84%
>> You also mentioned
that there's information,

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:90%
this field full of information.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:35.150 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.110 align:middle line:10%
>> So yeah, I talk about this
field as a field of information

00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:43.960 align:middle line:10%
because in physics and
information theory,

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:50.110 align:middle line:10%
it's acceptable to discuss
energy in terms of information.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.620 align:middle line:84%
Energy and information can
be equivalent in physics.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.710 align:middle line:84%
So you can think
of, for instance,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.700 align:middle line:84%
the position of a particle,
the angular momentum,

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.180 align:middle line:84%
the state of a particle
as a set of information,

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.610 align:middle line:84%
which is different than
the set of information

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
of the particle beside it
because it's in different

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.850 align:middle line:84%
coordinates, it's undergoing
different dynamics.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And so you can
think of every bit

00:19:16.810 --> 00:19:18.340 align:middle line:90%
of the structure of spacetime.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:84%
So let's just start
from the beginning.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:28.180 align:middle line:10%
Imagine that space is made
of little bits of information

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:31.160 align:middle line:10%
or little particles
that are oscillating,

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:36.110 align:middle line:10%
each one representing
one bit of information.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:41.210 align:middle line:10%
These particles are oscillating
at billions of times smaller

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.100 align:middle line:10%
than an atom.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.760 align:middle line:10%
It's called the Planck scale.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.700 align:middle line:10%
And so that if you grew a
little Planck scale particle,

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:56.540 align:middle line:10%
so that it was a grain of sand,
then the proton, which is teeny,

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.660 align:middle line:10%
would all of a sudden
have the diameter

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.540 align:middle line:10%
of approximately from our
sun to Alpha Centauri,

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.270 align:middle line:10%
which is 40 trillion kilometers.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.840 align:middle line:10%
So these little particles,
these little fluctuations

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.650 align:middle line:10%
are occurring at a scale
that's so far removed

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:17.720 align:middle line:10%
from what we experience daily
that we have no idea it's there.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:23.060 align:middle line:10%
And think of these little
bits of fluctuation

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.130 align:middle line:10%
as bits of information.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:28.950 align:middle line:10%
And they're flowing
in a coherent manner.

00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:34.760 align:middle line:10%
So when they make
like a smoothie vortex

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.210 align:middle line:10%
together like trillions
of them, billions of them.

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.310 align:middle line:10%
Imagine the amount of sand--

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:44.450 align:middle line:10%
grains of sand you could
put in a bubble from the sun

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:49.850 align:middle line:10%
to Alpha Centauri, 40 trillion
kilometer bubble, like the sand

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:54.260 align:middle line:10%
would be very, very fine, like
very small resolution compared

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.640 align:middle line:10%
to the bubble.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.310 align:middle line:10%
So imagine the number
of grains of sand.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.480 align:middle line:10%
Well, imagine all these
are moving coherently

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.880 align:middle line:10%
because they're
stuck in this vortex.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:07.490 align:middle line:10%
They're spinning together.

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:12.500 align:middle line:10%
And that region of
space, we call a proton.

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.050 align:middle line:10%
And when we calculate
that, we get

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:16.860 align:middle line:10%
the right mass for the proton.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.140 align:middle line:84%
We get the right
radius for the proton.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.470 align:middle line:90%
We get the right energy.

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:24.710 align:middle line:84%
We get all these things
come out that are correct.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.770 align:middle line:84%
And then we do the same
equation for the smoothie

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
of the electron, we
get the correct answer.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:84%
We do the same thing for
galaxies, for clusters,

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.660 align:middle line:84%
for the universe, we
get the right answers.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:40.290 align:middle line:84%
We get the right temperatures
for the universe, for instance.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:43.220 align:middle line:84%
We get all the right
answers without the need

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.440 align:middle line:84%
for dark matter, dark
energy, and all this stuff.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:53.990 align:middle line:84%
So it really describes our
universe much differently.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.440 align:middle line:84%
It's basically the
fluid dynamics of space

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.640 align:middle line:90%
that makes up our reality.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:84%
So you can think of it as
an exchange of information

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:08.000 align:middle line:90%
across all these scales.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.110 align:middle line:84%
You can think of this
Planck fluctuation

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.190 align:middle line:84%
as an exchange of information
across all these scales.

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:19.792 align:middle line:90%


00:22:19.792 --> 00:22:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And the equation
treats it like that.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:27.080 align:middle line:84%
That's how you get the right
temperatures and all this stuff.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:33.410 align:middle line:84%
And so basically, you can
think of the material world

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:39.710 align:middle line:84%
like a superhighway network of
information of the universe.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:46.210 align:middle line:84%
You can think of it almost
as the mind of the universe

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.010 align:middle line:90%
thinking.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.590 align:middle line:90%


00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:55.190 align:middle line:84%
And as it gets together and it
becomes more and more complex,

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:59.390 align:middle line:84%
like all the particles get
together and they make a cell.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.090 align:middle line:10%
And then the cell divide
and make two cells

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:10%
and gets more and more
complex, eventually

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.690 align:middle line:10%
the flow of information
through the whole system

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:16.900 align:middle line:10%
has enough bit rate, you can
think, to become self-aware.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.360 align:middle line:10%
The system becomes self-aware.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.880 align:middle line:10%
And it's like the universe
becoming self-aware.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.540 align:middle line:10%


00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:31.150 align:middle line:10%
And the danger there is that
when it becomes self-aware,

00:23:31.150 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:10%
it might think that it's
separate from the rest

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.750 align:middle line:10%
of the universe,
because it doesn't

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.180 align:middle line:10%
know it's part of this
flow of information.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:43.210 align:middle line:10%
It's thinking, wow,
how did I get here?

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.790 align:middle line:10%
And what is this universe?

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:47.920 align:middle line:10%
You see.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:53.560 align:middle line:10%
And that's really what's
happened to the humankind

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.710 align:middle line:10%
We have thought
that we are not part

00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:01.390 align:middle line:10%
of this dynamic of creation.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:07.715 align:middle line:10%
And that we can somehow analyze
it without considering ourselves

00:24:07.715 --> 00:24:08.515 align:middle line:10%
in it.

00:24:08.515 --> 00:24:12.160 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.540 align:middle line:10%
And as well, we
-I think wrongly-

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:20.890 align:middle line:10%
assume that the event
of becoming conscious

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:29.300 align:middle line:10%
was just a random fluke
that all of a sudden

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:33.050 align:middle line:10%
we became aware
of our existence.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:35.930 align:middle line:10%
We started being able
to ask questions about,

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:37.190 align:middle line:10%
what is the universe?

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:38.330 align:middle line:10%
How did we get there?

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:10%
And all this stuff, which
is really not obvious

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.970 align:middle line:10%
that this would occur
just from random function.

00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:47.820 align:middle line:10%
>> So you're saying
it's not a fluke?

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:48.660 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.460 align:middle line:10%
No.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.750 align:middle line:10%
I'm saying it's a
fundamental dynamics

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.490 align:middle line:10%
of the structure of spacetime.

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:59.072 align:middle line:10%
It's a fundamental dynamic
of the structure of reality.

00:24:59.072 --> 00:25:02.550 align:middle line:10%
It's the result of the
mechanics of information

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:06.120 align:middle line:10%
flowing through the
structure of reality.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:10%
It is a highly
coordinated effort

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:13.560 align:middle line:10%
of reality to produce
something that would eventually

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.180 align:middle line:10%
become aware of itself.

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:21.780 align:middle line:10%
So it is a consequence
of reality itself,

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:27.970 align:middle line:10%
not some epiphenomena
occurring in your brain.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:33.840 align:middle line:10%
And so that changes a lot of
how we think of ourselves.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.570 align:middle line:10%
And how we think of
the universe around us,

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:41.040 align:middle line:10%
because then we realize we're
part of this amazing network,

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:48.170 align:middle line:10%
this amazing structure
of information flow.

00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:52.490 align:middle line:10%
And that we're connected to
it, so that we have information

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:55.160 align:middle line:10%
that is not necessarily local.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.710 align:middle line:10%
We have access to
non-local information.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:59.510 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:10%
So let's go there.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.210 align:middle line:10%
Are you saying that you
might be able to tap

00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:10.160 align:middle line:10%
into an understanding that your
neighbor is doing something

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.340 align:middle line:10%
that you--

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:13.925 align:middle line:10%
>> That you're not
observing directly?

00:26:13.925 --> 00:26:14.725 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:26:14.725 --> 00:26:16.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:18.240 align:middle line:10%
Well, think about it this way.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:24.050 align:middle line:10%
How many times have you in
your life thought of somebody,

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:28.220 align:middle line:10%
and maybe that person,
you hadn't talked to

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.450 align:middle line:10%
in a year or two or whatever.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:32.130 align:middle line:10%
And you just think about them.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:32.930 align:middle line:10%
And guess what?

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.260 align:middle line:10%
The phone rings and boom,
they're calling you.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:39.250 align:middle line:10%
And it's like, whoa,
and people say,

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.950 align:middle line:10%
well, coincidence and
anecdotal and all this.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And it is anecdotal, but
it's happening to most people

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.230 align:middle line:90%
in their life multiple times.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's like, well,
how is it happening?

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.330 align:middle line:90%
How did you know?

00:26:55.330 --> 00:27:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, you're tapped into
a field that's non-local.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:04.120 align:middle line:84%
The assumption
that consciousness

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:09.310 align:middle line:84%
is located in your brain or
in some part of your body

00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:13.370 align:middle line:84%
may be completely erroneous,
is consciousness--

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.810 align:middle line:84%
your body may just
be an antenna that's

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:20.110 align:middle line:84%
tuned to a certain set
of information that's

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.720 align:middle line:90%
part of a field.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:84%
It's your participation
in this field

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:84%
that you call consciousness,
your consciousness, you see.

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.550 align:middle line:84%
And if that's true,
then that means

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:41.770 align:middle line:84%
you could have access to
information of the field

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.880 align:middle line:84%
since it's all connected through
this field that's non-local.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:50.230 align:middle line:84%
You could know what's going on
in some place across the world.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Now if that's true, you think
that there would be studies

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:56.680 align:middle line:90%
that would have shown that.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.380 align:middle line:90%
Well, there is.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.440 align:middle line:84%
In the '70s, there
were studies that

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.930 align:middle line:84%
were conducted at Stanford
that were published

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:09.130 align:middle line:84%
in some of the most
respectful journal in science

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:16.270 align:middle line:84%
that were exploring for spying
purposes something that's

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:19.370 align:middle line:90%
called remote viewing.

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And one of those researchers,
Elizabeth Rauscher, Dr. Rauscher

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.330 align:middle line:90%
was my co-author.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.730 align:middle line:84%
So I discussed it
at length with her.

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:30.460 align:middle line:84%
And they were
pulling random people

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:36.460 align:middle line:84%
like students out of campus
and sticking them in the room

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.970 align:middle line:84%
and asking them to remote view
a place in Russia or whatever.

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And they were getting
incredible results,

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:84%
like very significantly
non-trivial statistical results

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:57.810 align:middle line:84%
showing clearly that people
had non-local access, even

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:01.560 align:middle line:84%
people that were not
trained in any way,

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.850 align:middle line:84%
they weren't
spiritual in any way.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:07.087 align:middle line:10%
They were not-- they were just
a random student they picked off

00:29:07.087 --> 00:29:07.887 align:middle line:10%
the street.

00:29:07.887 --> 00:29:17.700 align:middle line:10%
So we call that
intuition in many ways.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.790 align:middle line:84%
We call that-- we have
all kinds of names for it.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Remote healing, remote
viewing, all this stuff,

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.960 align:middle line:90%
remote influencing.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:33.120 align:middle line:84%
And these are all evidence
that we are tapped

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.280 align:middle line:90%
into a field of information.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And that actually creative
capacity of a being

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:49.070 align:middle line:84%
is actually their capacity
to tap into this field

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and extract information and
come up with something new.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:00.560 align:middle line:10%
Like if you look in history and
you read the history of science,

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.130 align:middle line:10%
you will find that most of
the greatest discoveries that

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:08.360 align:middle line:10%
were made in science
were made by somebody

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:13.800 align:middle line:10%
that was highly intuitive,
somebody that followed their gut

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.600 align:middle line:10%
feeling.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:17.390 align:middle line:10%
I mean, so many of them when
they were asked, How did you

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:21.050 align:middle line:10%
come up with that? it was so
different than anything else

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:21.890 align:middle line:10%
that was known.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:26.420 align:middle line:10%
And they said-- typically
they say I had a gut feeling.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:29.720 align:middle line:10%
I had an intuition that
it may be like that.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.050 align:middle line:10%
Of course, they
followed the lead.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:36.230 align:middle line:10%
Most people might have
the exact same intuition,

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:41.160 align:middle line:10%
but never actually
do the rigorous work

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:46.620 align:middle line:10%
that it took to follow
those intuition.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:47.910 align:middle line:10%
But some of them did.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.180 align:middle line:10%
And when they did, they found,
Oh, wow, maybe it's right.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.250 align:middle line:10%
And then publish.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:58.570 align:middle line:10%
I mean, how did Einstein come
up with the relativity of space

00:30:58.570 --> 00:30:59.370 align:middle line:10%
and time?

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:03.090 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is not
clearly something

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:07.620 align:middle line:10%
that's evident to
you on a daily basis.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:14.730 align:middle line:10%
And this is what's missing
generally in current physics,

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:21.330 align:middle line:10%
is that the tendency is to think
that if we render enough math,

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:25.290 align:middle line:10%
and if we just follow
the math somehow,

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:28.060 align:middle line:10%
it's going to tell us
how the universe works.

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.630 align:middle line:10%
And that's just not the case.

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:33.420 align:middle line:10%
All the great
discoveries in physics

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:40.570 align:middle line:10%
were done by people that
had a model in their head.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:48.030 align:middle line:10%
They had-- or in the field
that they had come up with.

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:49.740 align:middle line:90%
They had an intuition.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.410 align:middle line:90%
They had a feeling.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.840 align:middle line:10%
They had reflections--
deep reflections

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.480 align:middle line:10%
about the nature of
reality in the field

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.710 align:middle line:10%
that they were studying.

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:00.570 align:middle line:10%
They came up with something.

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:03.270 align:middle line:10%
And then they went
to the mathematics

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.760 align:middle line:10%
to see if it pans out.

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.260 align:middle line:84%
And then mathematics
makes sense.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:14.560 align:middle line:84%
And actually, then mathematics
is an excellent tool.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:17.490 align:middle line:84%
It's an excellent
language, because it really

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:20.970 align:middle line:84%
helps your cognitive
mind actually understand.

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:22.890 align:middle line:90%
And this is really important.

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:26.580 align:middle line:84%
Because, for instance, the
equations I wrote basically

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.260 align:middle line:90%
tells us we're all one.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:34.390 align:middle line:84%
But you know how many people in
the world, how many masters have

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:38.300 align:middle line:84%
gone throughout the ages
telling everybody we're all one?

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.430 align:middle line:84%
Well, that doesn't
do you any good

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.790 align:middle line:90%
if you don't know it's true.

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:46.390 align:middle line:90%
It's just a concept.

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:48.460 align:middle line:90%
It's just a dogma.

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:53.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you all of a
sudden actually understand

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.300 align:middle line:90%
the mechanics on that--

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:59.860 align:middle line:84%
is true, then actually
you start to integrate it.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:01.360 align:middle line:90%
You start to feel it.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:04.750 align:middle line:84%
And then you can build
technology based on that.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:08.290 align:middle line:84%
You can change the way you
run your world based on that.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:10.060 align:middle line:90%
That makes a huge difference.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.940 align:middle line:90%


00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:15.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's what
science does for us,

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:22.420 align:middle line:84%
is that it removes the dogma,
it removes the beliefs,

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:28.470 align:middle line:84%
meaning it replaces "I have to
have faith that, that is true."

00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:30.850 align:middle line:90%
It's like, Oh, we're all one.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:32.510 align:middle line:90%
Oh, well, I got to believe that.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:36.230 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't feel like it, but
I got to believe that.

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:42.600 align:middle line:84%
To actually this is the proof
that this is how it works.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.510 align:middle line:84%
And this is the mechanics
on how it works.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:49.760 align:middle line:84%
And now I can start
to feel it in my body.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:54.440 align:middle line:84%
When I write these equations
and they show me this stuff,

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.780 align:middle line:90%
it's very deep.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:02.690 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I can feel the
changes inside my being

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:05.510 align:middle line:84%
that are occurring
as I'm integrating

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.820 align:middle line:90%
when I'm discovering.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:13.010 align:middle line:10%
>> It sounds like this is what
you do that you get a thought

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:14.120 align:middle line:10%
and intuition.

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.880 align:middle line:10%
Would you like to talk
about maybe one or two

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:18.170 align:middle line:10%
of your experiences with that?

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:18.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:26.060 align:middle line:10%
I mean, I think, first of all,
I don't believe in genius.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.940 align:middle line:10%
I believe everybody is genius.

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:33.650 align:middle line:10%
It's like just the
fact that you're alive,

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:37.040 align:middle line:10%
that you're made out of
100 trillion cells that

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.440 align:middle line:10%
are operating just
perfectly, and you're

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:43.100 align:middle line:10%
dividing a million cells a
second and billions of chemical

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:46.520 align:middle line:10%
change are occurring every
second for you to stay alive,

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.500 align:middle line:10%
that's all genius.

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:52.159 align:middle line:10%
The miracle of your
existence is genius already,

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:53.570 align:middle line:10%
like you were born genius.

00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:56.510 align:middle line:10%


00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:00.680 align:middle line:10%
And I think the only
difference between people

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:06.020 align:middle line:10%
that are finding very new
solutions and creative ways

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:14.660 align:middle line:10%
and that are very dynamic that
way is that they have a capacity

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:24.810 align:middle line:10%
to focus on a specific problem
uninterrupted long enough

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:28.230 align:middle line:10%
to get a really
good sense of it,

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:34.320 align:middle line:10%
and start to pick on the
fringes of what's known,

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:37.590 align:middle line:10%
like feelings and intuition.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:41.110 align:middle line:10%
And so when people ask me, how
do you come up with this stuff?

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:46.350 align:middle line:10%
This is literally it's like
thinking about something.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.640 align:middle line:10%
Thinking about reality.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.900 align:middle line:10%
Thinking about a problem.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.700 align:middle line:10%
Thinking about how things work.

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.110 align:middle line:10%
And getting a sense
in my gut and my heart

00:35:55.110 --> 00:36:05.850 align:middle line:10%
and my being in my whole being
that it's like a certain way.

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:16.400 align:middle line:10%
And that might sound very
unscientific to some.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:23.180 align:middle line:84%
But actually, this is how great
discoveries are made in science.

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:31.460 align:middle line:84%
And then I start to see
these things in my head.

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And I start asking more and
more questions about it.

00:36:35.090 --> 00:36:38.840 align:middle line:84%
And I start feeling more
and more answers about it.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:41.365 align:middle line:90%
I start seeing the whole thing.

00:36:41.365 --> 00:36:44.480 align:middle line:84%
I don't try to
extract the details

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:48.760 align:middle line:90%
before I see the whole thing.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I try to remove any box
that I put around it.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:57.560 align:middle line:84%
I try to not isolate the
system, but open the system,

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.180 align:middle line:90%
like, Oh, OK.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.350 align:middle line:10%
Well, if it's like this,
how is it in relationship

00:37:03.350 --> 00:37:05.010 align:middle line:10%
to the rest of the universe?

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Why is it behaving this
way relative to the whole?

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.640 align:middle line:90%
And so on.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:14.730 align:middle line:84%
And so then I get
a global sense.

00:37:14.730 --> 00:37:16.470 align:middle line:90%
I don't have details yet.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:19.590 align:middle line:84%
But I got an image,
I got a model,

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:23.370 align:middle line:84%
I've got a global sense
of what it's doing.

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.260 align:middle line:90%
And it's more than a thought.

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.930 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling of
how it's working.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:35.310 align:middle line:10%
And then I start to pick
apart pieces and start

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:40.080 align:middle line:10%
to see OK, if they work in
the context of what's known

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.440 align:middle line:10%
and what is known
and how would it

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:47.320 align:middle line:10%
have to be modified
to match what I feel.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.890 align:middle line:10%
And so on.

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:56.980 align:middle line:10%
And the result is
that eventually, you

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:59.950 align:middle line:10%
may find that you have
to do some corrections

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:06.700 align:middle line:10%
to your feelings, to
your initial model.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:12.880 align:middle line:10%
But in general, what I
found is that it naturally

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.460 align:middle line:10%
tends towards the truth.

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:18.650 align:middle line:10%
It naturally tends
towards the truth.

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:23.320 align:middle line:10%
In fact, I think that
children naturally

00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:28.270 align:middle line:10%
tend towards the truth,
that they naturally

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:33.610 align:middle line:10%
instinctively know what's up.

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:36.580 align:middle line:10%
For instance, you
give a model that's

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:43.060 align:middle line:10%
fairly arrested to a child
like the Big Bang model.

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:47.950 align:middle line:10%
You say, it all started with
an explosion, a Big Bang.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.700 align:middle line:10%
And it made the universe.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.900 align:middle line:10%
It made all-- it made all space
and time, all the forces, all

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:53.860 align:middle line:10%
the universe.

00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:57.590 align:middle line:10%
And the kid will look
at you typically.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:02.720 align:middle line:10%
And I have two children, I know,
with like some kind of dismayed

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.980 align:middle line:10%
look in their face.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:08.060 align:middle line:10%
And they go, well,
what exploded?

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.710 align:middle line:10%
What made it explode?

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:10.880 align:middle line:10%
Why did it explode?

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.400 align:middle line:10%
And what was it that exploded?

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.620 align:middle line:10%
I mean, if it's
the whole universe,

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:18.500 align:middle line:10%
that means it was the
whole universe already.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.640 align:middle line:10%
So what happened before that?

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.700 align:middle line:10%
And so like all these--

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:27.080 align:middle line:10%
and naturally, so you
see the child naturally

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.970 align:middle line:10%
is going to think
fractally, is going

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:37.340 align:middle line:10%
to think that they must be
all kinds of things before.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.010 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to
say, well, I'm not

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:43.130 align:middle line:10%
going to think about
what happened before.

00:39:43.130 --> 00:39:48.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm just going to assume
an explosion, which

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.200 align:middle line:10%
is what we've done in physics.

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:57.260 align:middle line:10%
Basically, we might as well
have changed the word God

00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:02.540 align:middle line:10%
for Big Bang, basically, because
we start the equation with, oh,

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:05.060 align:middle line:10%
and there was a miracle.

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.580 align:middle line:10%
And then da, da, da.

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.700 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's not quite science.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:13.040 align:middle line:10%
That's not quite physics.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:21.800 align:middle line:84%
So naturally,
children will tend--

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:25.670 align:middle line:84%
when we're young,
we're so creative.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:32.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's because we have
that sense that natural sense

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:34.160 align:middle line:90%
of knowingness.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:40.520 align:middle line:84%
See knowingness doesn't
come from studying books.

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Studying books and
studying what's known

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:48.600 align:middle line:84%
is important because it might
give you ideas, first of all.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It might inspire
you, all this stuff.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:54.860 align:middle line:84%
But if you're going to do
something truly creative,

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:58.890 align:middle line:84%
something truly transformative,
something truly new,

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:01.610 align:middle line:84%
then you have to step
into the unknown.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:04.500 align:middle line:90%


00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And realize that
knowledge does not come--

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.890 align:middle line:84%
like fundamental knowledge,
true knowledge, true creativity

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.620 align:middle line:90%
does not come from the outside.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:20.670 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't come from
replicating what

00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:24.810 align:middle line:84%
you saw because then you're just
doing what everybody is doing.

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:30.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it comes from
inside knowledge,

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:33.340 align:middle line:84%
true knowledge
comes from within.

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.150 align:middle line:84%
And what do we
know about within?

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:40.860 align:middle line:84%
How much time in our
day do we spend actually

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:43.530 align:middle line:90%
exploring what's within?

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.020 align:middle line:84%
Are we connected to
what's within or are

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.940 align:middle line:90%
we completely disconnected?

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:53.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, clearly what's within
is doing an extremely good job

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:58.790 align:middle line:84%
at keeping things going, like
your heart, your breathing,

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:03.500 align:middle line:84%
your nervous system, millions
of chemical change every second,

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.240 align:middle line:90%
it's running the show.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.140 align:middle line:90%
And it's got a long to do list.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Every second, it's
got a long to do list.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:16.550 align:middle line:84%
And if you had to
run that to do list,

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.200 align:middle line:90%
it would not be a good day.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:22.220 align:middle line:84%
You would have a really
bad day really quick.

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
fundamental, fantastic

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.370 align:middle line:90%
incredible that's happening.

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:36.110 align:middle line:84%
When we say the fact
that life could not

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:38.630 align:middle line:84%
have emerged from
random function,

00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:43.580 align:middle line:84%
it's not just that it couldn't
have emerged in the first life

00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:48.210 align:middle line:84%
that we think of life like
the first microbe or whatever.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:53.570 align:middle line:84%
But it's the fact that
it not only did that,

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.630 align:middle line:84%
produce the microbe,
but it could

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:01.550 align:middle line:84%
have produced a microbe after
billions of years of evolution.

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:06.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, oh, shit, a rock
fell on it and killed it.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:11.080 align:middle line:84%
It's like now it's going to take
another billion years before it

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:15.530 align:middle line:84%
makes another one and
tries again, right.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:20.260 align:middle line:84%
But it did-- but what's
remarkable is that it's

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:24.670 align:middle line:84%
continuously doing
it, it's continuously

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:26.290 align:middle line:90%
doing the right thing.

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:32.320 align:middle line:84%
And didn't just did it once, it
continuously do it every second.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.980 align:middle line:84%
It continuously stays
coherent and continues

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.760 align:middle line:90%
to produce life, right.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:42.382 align:middle line:90%


00:43:42.382 --> 00:43:46.660 align:middle line:10%
One of the greatest
evolutionary biologists I know,

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:51.640 align:middle line:10%
Elisabet Sahtouris,
once told me,

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:56.810 align:middle line:10%
if you want to understand
human evolution,

00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:04.970 align:middle line:10%
then just look at the evolution
of a fetus in a mother's womb,

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:07.070 align:middle line:10%
and you will see it go through.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.190 align:middle line:10%
It looks like a cell
and then it looks

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:13.655 align:middle line:10%
like a little fish and then
it looks like a little--

00:44:13.655 --> 00:44:16.220 align:middle line:10%
and you can see
the transformation

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.590 align:middle line:10%
to the complexity
of a human being.

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:26.360 align:middle line:10%
And so basically this miracle
is happening every second,

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:31.310 align:middle line:10%
and we kind of miss it.

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:36.890 align:middle line:10%
We forget about-- we forget
about the genius of creation

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:42.680 align:middle line:10%
that's occurring, and so we
think that there was geniuses

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.874 align:middle line:10%
but they were very
special people.

00:44:45.874 --> 00:44:54.970 align:middle line:10%
And, yeah, we underestimate
our capacity so profoundly.

00:44:54.970 --> 00:44:58.570 align:middle line:10%
And because we've been
taught, especially

00:44:58.570 --> 00:45:02.830 align:middle line:10%
from our educational
system, that--

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:05.170 align:middle line:10%
don't have a creative thought.

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:10.270 align:middle line:10%
I mean, when you go to
school it's like, oh, look,

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:13.690 align:middle line:10%
I solved this equation
completely differently.

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:15.610 align:middle line:10%
No, no, no, no,
no, you don't want

00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:17.200 align:middle line:10%
to do that because
you're not going

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.510 align:middle line:10%
to pass if you-- in the test.

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:22.570 align:middle line:10%
You have to solve it this way.

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:25.450 align:middle line:10%
And so because
these institutions

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:30.460 align:middle line:10%
were made to produce
worker bees, automaton that

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.710 align:middle line:10%
will reproduce
and everybody will

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:38.620 align:middle line:10%
do it the same and everybody--
and so creative thoughts are not

00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:43.270 align:middle line:10%
encouraged, yet only
creative thoughts

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:46.104 align:middle line:10%
are going to bring us forward.

00:45:46.104 --> 00:45:52.280 align:middle line:10%
Only creative thoughts are going
to evolve our civilization.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:57.110 align:middle line:10%
Why would we not encourage
that in a facility that we call

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:58.820 align:middle line:10%
educational?

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:04.800 align:middle line:10%
We should embrace
creative thoughts,

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:10.820 align:middle line:10%
especially if they contradict
what we are teaching.

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:14.360 align:middle line:10%
If they contradict
what we're teaching,

00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.050 align:middle line:10%
that may be because
there is something there

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:23.180 align:middle line:10%
that is an evolution from
what we are teaching.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:27.470 align:middle line:84%
We know that something
that's true in one era

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:31.760 align:middle line:84%
typically becomes
untrue in the next.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.140 align:middle line:90%
That's how we evolve.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.690 align:middle line:90%


00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:40.250 align:middle line:84%
And Newtonian physics was
taught to be ultimate and true

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:44.760 align:middle line:84%
for a very long time, and
then came Einstein and said,

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:48.020 align:middle line:84%
well, it's true in
certain circumstances

00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:53.500 align:middle line:84%
but it requires a little bit
more understanding in others,

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:54.300 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:47:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So things change, and we
should embrace change.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.710 align:middle line:84%
We should embrace
change, we should

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:11.720 align:middle line:84%
embrace creative thoughts, we
should embrace instinct, gut

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:18.830 align:middle line:84%
feeling because these are
all the foundation of genius.

00:47:18.830 --> 00:47:25.670 align:middle line:84%
You wouldn't want Michelangelo,
da Vinci not following

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:33.830 align:middle line:84%
their instinctive
creative inspiration when

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:36.200 align:middle line:90%
they're painting or sculpting.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:43.670 align:middle line:84%
That's what made those pieces
remarkable and venerated

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:44.540 align:middle line:90%
around the world.

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:47.185 align:middle line:90%


00:47:47.185 --> 00:47:50.000 align:middle line:90%
That was their creative genius.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's really sad that we
tend to squash that in children.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:04.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's produced a society that
is lacking in Einstein and Borg

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.800 align:middle line:90%
and like in--

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.590 align:middle line:90%
like Marx Planks.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:15.510 align:middle line:84%
We should have so many
more amazing scientists

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:21.420 align:middle line:84%
and artists and musicians
and all this stuff.

00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:26.490 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's something
that's inherent

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:31.110 align:middle line:84%
to the human experience, it's
inherent to consciousness.

00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:38.310 align:middle line:84%
But we suppress it very
profoundly in the first 20 or 25

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:42.960 align:middle line:84%
years of our lives in the
educational system, which

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:51.090 align:middle line:84%
attempts to
implement and enforce

00:48:51.090 --> 00:48:56.850 align:middle line:84%
knowledge that is taught
to be true at the time

00:48:56.850 --> 00:49:04.080 align:middle line:84%
as ultimate facts and unmovable
facts, which we know eventually

00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:05.100 align:middle line:90%
will fall.

00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:10.320 align:middle line:84%
So it's best to actually
teach these things

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:16.150 align:middle line:84%
as what is known at this time,
what do you guys think about it?

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:20.400 align:middle line:90%
What is your feeling about this?

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:25.020 align:middle line:84%
Instead of thinking of
them as ultimate facts

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.880 align:middle line:90%
that are immutable.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:32.760 align:middle line:84%
What tends to happen is
squashing the creative saying

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:35.250 align:middle line:90%
that it's a waste of time.

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:38.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm, right.

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:42.690 align:middle line:84%
You know, I mean, this
is what led Einstein

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:49.980 align:middle line:84%
to say imagination is
more important than facts,

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:51.570 align:middle line:90%
and so on like that.

00:49:51.570 --> 00:49:56.760 align:middle line:84%
That basically-- and I'm just
paraphrasing-- but basically

00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:04.680 align:middle line:84%
clearly pointing out that if
you can't imagine, if you can't

00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:09.060 align:middle line:84%
be creative, if you can't
break outside the box,

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:15.420 align:middle line:84%
you can't solve anything,
you can't evolve.

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:21.030 align:middle line:84%
And evolution is
critical, especially

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:23.490 align:middle line:84%
at this time in
the human history.

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:28.570 align:middle line:84%
It's critical that we break the
box and look outside the box

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:31.510 align:middle line:84%
because currently
the box is becoming

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:34.000 align:middle line:90%
a prison for so many people.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.640 align:middle line:10%
And it's a prison we
built for ourselves.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:43.710 align:middle line:10%
So I encourage
people to look inside

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:48.840 align:middle line:10%
and see what knowledge is there,
what do they have to contribute?

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.340 align:middle line:10%
Why are they here?

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.670 align:middle line:10%
And what is their
contribution to the whole?

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:57.750 align:middle line:10%
And to experience this oneness.

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:04.770 align:middle line:10%
Not some esoteric oneness coming
from some spiritual concept,

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:10.080 align:middle line:10%
but oneness in the literal
sense of all the atoms

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.770 align:middle line:10%
that they're made of and all the
molecules that they're made of,

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:15.870 align:middle line:10%
like in the physicality.

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:20.580 align:middle line:10%
That the physicality that seems
so restrictive and mechanic

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:24.840 align:middle line:10%
is actually completely
non-linear and connected.

00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.530 align:middle line:10%
And through this physicality,
through this experience,

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:30.690 align:middle line:10%
we can experience oneness.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:33.690 align:middle line:10%
>> So let's talk about
that a little bit more

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.890 align:middle line:10%
because that's out
there in the world,

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:37.620 align:middle line:10%
this oneness we're
all connected.

00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:41.650 align:middle line:10%
And you were explaining
from the very little plank

00:51:41.650 --> 00:51:43.886 align:middle line:10%
to the massive universes.

00:51:43.886 --> 00:51:46.900 align:middle line:90%


00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:50.280 align:middle line:10%
Are we like literally
sharing an atom here?

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:53.650 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, we're
sharing many, right.

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:59.290 align:middle line:10%
You're emitting atoms
like billions, millions.

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:02.800 align:middle line:10%
You're sharing about a
million cell every second.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.580 align:middle line:10%
Each cell is made up of
about 100 trillion atoms.

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:11.840 align:middle line:10%
We're exchanging air,
we're exchanging atoms.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:16.720 align:middle line:10%
There is no possibility,
there's no way

00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:21.850 align:middle line:10%
to isolate anything
from anything else.

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:25.300 align:middle line:10%
That is I could put
you in a box that we

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:28.150 align:middle line:10%
call the Faraday cage,
that will block some

00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:31.540 align:middle line:10%
of the electromagnetic
field, maybe most of it,

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:35.440 align:middle line:10%
but still you will be sharing
the same gravitational field

00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.510 align:middle line:10%
as mine.

00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:40.240 align:middle line:10%
So if you think of the
gravitational field

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.620 align:middle line:10%
as a waveform of
information, then we're

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:47.190 align:middle line:10%
sharing the same information,
whether you're in this Faraday

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:50.160 align:middle line:10%
cage box or not.

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:56.040 align:middle line:10%
And so there is no way to
actually isolate anything

00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.370 align:middle line:10%
from anything else.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:02.610 align:middle line:10%
In fact, many laws
of physics, certainly

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:05.070 align:middle line:10%
laws of entropy
and thermodynamics,

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:08.010 align:middle line:10%
start with this principle.

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:11.265 align:middle line:84%
And it says within
an isolated system.

00:53:11.265 --> 00:53:14.560 align:middle line:90%


00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:18.030 align:middle line:84%
And typically students,
typically teachers

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:21.720 align:middle line:84%
don't point out or
don't realize that--

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:26.490 align:middle line:84%
look up an isolated system
in a physics dictionary.

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:29.250 align:middle line:84%
If it's a good dictionary
you will start by saying,

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:31.980 align:middle line:84%
no such thing has
ever been found.

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:33.900 align:middle line:84%
There is no such
thing as an isolate--

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:38.430 align:middle line:84%
you cannot isolate anything
from the rest of the universe.

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:44.410 align:middle line:84%
So all you have in the
universe is relationships.

00:53:44.410 --> 00:53:46.510 align:middle line:90%
It's all relationships.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:49.000 align:middle line:84%
And the equations I'm
writing are clearly

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.830 align:middle line:90%
showing that it's all ratios.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:55.180 align:middle line:84%
It's relationship
between things that

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:57.850 align:middle line:84%
produces the forces,
that produces

00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:00.760 align:middle line:90%
the effect we call reality.

00:54:00.760 --> 00:54:06.010 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the density change
relationship across scales.

00:54:06.010 --> 00:54:10.540 align:middle line:84%
And so, absolutely,
we're sharing atoms

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:14.320 align:middle line:84%
but we're sharing much
deeper levels of things.

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:17.275 align:middle line:84%
We're sharing electromagnetic
fields, for instance.

00:54:17.275 --> 00:54:19.870 align:middle line:90%


00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:22.960 align:middle line:84%
You're bathing in an
electromagnetic field right now,

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:29.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm bathing in the same
electromagnetic field as you.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:33.040 align:middle line:84%
There's infrared
coming from the light,

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:36.490 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds of
photon frequencies,

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:41.740 align:middle line:90%
including X-ray, microwaves.

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:45.100 align:middle line:84%
There's microwave radiation
coming from the galaxy

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:46.990 align:middle line:90%
right now that we're bathing in.

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:52.390 align:middle line:84%
There's background radiation
from the so-called Big Bang

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:54.070 align:middle line:90%
we're bathing in.

00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:59.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's constant
interaction going on

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:05.080 align:middle line:84%
that we're not aware of because
our senses are fairly limited

00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:10.030 align:middle line:84%
to a very, very small
band of information.

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:13.180 align:middle line:84%
And so if we try to
look through our senses,

00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:17.950 align:middle line:84%
we can easily believe
that we're isolated.

00:55:17.950 --> 00:55:22.180 align:middle line:10%
We can easily believe-- like for
instance, when I tell people,

00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:24.280 align:middle line:10%
do you realize you're
a galactic being?

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.470 align:middle line:10%
They go, what the heck
are you talking about?

00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:29.800 align:middle line:10%
They go, oh, my god, it must
be a new ager or wah wah

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.270 align:middle line:10%
person, right?

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:32.740 align:middle line:10%
You're a galactic being.

00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:42.000 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking about it directly,
like as matter of a fact.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:42.800 align:middle line:10%
Why?

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:46.190 align:middle line:10%
Because you're on the planet
that's inside a solar system,

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:48.080 align:middle line:10%
that's inside a galaxy.

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:52.690 align:middle line:10%
Whether you like it or not
you are a galactic being,

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:57.950 align:middle line:10%
flying around in a galaxy, on a
planet with about seven billion

00:55:57.950 --> 00:56:00.650 align:middle line:10%
people as your passengers.

00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:05.580 align:middle line:10%
So it's like this is happening.

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:12.800 align:middle line:10%
And so-- but how many times in
a day or in a week or in a month

00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:19.280 align:middle line:10%
or in a lifetime do you think
of yourself as a galactic being?

00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:23.030 align:middle line:10%
It's very, very rarely
because we're stuck--

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:28.340 align:middle line:10%
so we're stuck on the horizontal
plane of like our daily life

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:31.640 align:middle line:10%
and we forget what I
call going vertical.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:35.150 align:middle line:84%
Like go vertical and
get some perspective.

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:38.070 align:middle line:84%
And literally you're
going to realize,

00:56:38.070 --> 00:56:41.520 align:middle line:84%
wow, I am a galactic
being, or you

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.440 align:middle line:84%
can say I'm a
super cluster being

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:45.360 align:middle line:84%
or I'm a universal
being, whatever.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:47.880 align:middle line:84%
You are in all
those things so you

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:51.060 align:middle line:90%
can say that with confidence.

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:55.530 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
look at your problems

00:56:55.530 --> 00:57:00.660 align:middle line:84%
from the galactic perspective,
from the galactic perspective

00:57:00.660 --> 00:57:04.200 align:middle line:84%
when you look at yourself
or you look at humanity,

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:06.930 align:middle line:84%
do you see separation
between humans?

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.450 align:middle line:84%
Do you see that
like, oh, that guy

00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:12.090 align:middle line:84%
that caught you off on the
highway is a big problem

00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:13.110 align:middle line:90%
or whatever?

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:13.910 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:18.690 align:middle line:84%
From that perspective all
that is really irrelevant.

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Like clearly from the Galactic
perspective, first of all,

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:26.804 align:middle line:84%
if you were a
galactic structure,

00:57:26.804 --> 00:57:30.480 align:middle line:84%
the sun would not
even be on your radar

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.520 align:middle line:90%
because it's too small.

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:36.300 align:middle line:84%
Like if you look at the
galaxy from the outside,

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:37.740 align:middle line:90%
our sun doesn't show up.

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:44.010 align:middle line:84%
It's too dim, it's too
small, it's too-- you know.

00:57:44.010 --> 00:57:49.100 align:middle line:84%
But even if you saw that, it's
like you looking at your body,

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:53.520 align:middle line:84%
you're not going to notice
this one atom over there.

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.160 align:middle line:84%
Well, that would be
our sun for the galaxy.

00:57:56.160 --> 00:58:03.720 align:middle line:84%
And then if you saw the little
planet beside it called Earth,

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:06.900 align:middle line:84%
you wouldn't think of
it as like, oh, well,

00:58:06.900 --> 00:58:10.680 align:middle line:84%
yeah, but there's like white
people and there's Black people

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and there's yellow people
and there's red people.

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.840 align:middle line:90%
You wouldn't think of it.

00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:19.260 align:middle line:10%
You would just say there's the
human beings that are living

00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:21.600 align:middle line:10%
on this planet, one thing.

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's just a question
of perspective.

00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:27.750 align:middle line:84%
It's just a question
of perspective.

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Oneness comes-- if you're
missing the oneness,

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:35.340 align:middle line:84%
if you're missing
the organization is

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:39.570 align:middle line:84%
because you've not taking
the appropriate perspective,

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:41.623 align:middle line:90%
you haven't--

00:58:41.623 --> 00:58:45.450 align:middle line:84%
if you think it's random,
it's because you got your nose

00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:47.670 align:middle line:90%
in the Persian rug.

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:50.160 align:middle line:10%
If you got your nose
in the Persian rug,

00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.740 align:middle line:10%
you see all kinds
of colors, you see

00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:55.305 align:middle line:10%
all kinds of strands of things.

00:58:55.305 --> 00:58:57.570 align:middle line:10%
They might even
be mites in there

00:58:57.570 --> 00:59:00.580 align:middle line:10%
that you're seeing running
around, like all this stuff,

00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:04.530 align:middle line:10%
and it's like, this is a
completely random thing.

00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:07.560 align:middle line:10%
There's all these fibers,
all different colors.

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:12.360 align:middle line:10%
And then you back out, you take
the Galactic perspective and all

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.730 align:middle line:10%
of a sudden you see the pattern.

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:16.050 align:middle line:10%
And you see it's one thing.

00:59:16.050 --> 00:59:18.120 align:middle line:10%
It's not a bunch of
things, it's one thing.

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:23.720 align:middle line:10%
It's one beautiful scenery of
a person in the woods with dogs

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.520 align:middle line:10%
or whatever.

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:31.080 align:middle line:10%
And so that is the
perspective we typically

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:35.740 align:middle line:10%
are missing because we've got
our nose in the rug every day.

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:40.050 align:middle line:10%
And so from that perspective,
we don't get the whole.

00:59:40.050 --> 00:59:44.280 align:middle line:10%
We don't get the whole picture,
and it's hard to be inspired.

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:49.650 align:middle line:10%
It seems completely random
and it's discouraging

00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:52.480 align:middle line:10%
and you can't see the pattern.

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:57.770 align:middle line:10%
And so getting the
Galactic perspective

00:59:57.770 --> 01:00:02.180 align:middle line:10%
is almost a direction.

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:05.990 align:middle line:10%
You can't really
get that perspective

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:09.080 align:middle line:10%
from looking outside yourself.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:13.910 align:middle line:10%
It's actually going inside
yourself, finding your center,

01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:17.780 align:middle line:10%
and then thinking of like
what if that center was

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:23.200 align:middle line:10%
the center of the galaxy and
I was the galaxy, how would

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.430 align:middle line:10%
I feel?

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:28.780 align:middle line:10%
How would I feel about
the unity of human beings?

01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:33.490 align:middle line:10%
Would it be hard for
me to feel united

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:35.585 align:middle line:10%
with all the human beings?

01:00:35.585 --> 01:00:36.385 align:middle line:10%
No.

01:00:36.385 --> 01:00:39.465 align:middle line:90%


01:00:39.465 --> 01:00:42.250 align:middle line:10%
You don't have a
hard time feeling

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:45.400 align:middle line:10%
united with one atom
that's in your body.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:49.540 align:middle line:10%
You know it's your atom and
you know it's part of you

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:52.360 align:middle line:10%
and you're united with it.

01:00:52.360 --> 01:01:01.350 align:middle line:10%
You don't-- and so it really
it's easy to unify if you take

01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:10.110 align:middle line:10%
the proper perspective, if you
see it from the proper frame

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:11.610 align:middle line:10%
of reference.

01:01:11.610 --> 01:01:15.570 align:middle line:10%
And when you don't, when
life is really tough,

01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:19.990 align:middle line:10%
when everything seems
so dark and difficult,

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:23.700 align:middle line:10%
this is when it's the
most critical to take

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:26.940 align:middle line:10%
a different perspective,
to take the galactic

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:30.270 align:middle line:10%
perspective because
then you will

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:33.930 align:middle line:10%
get a different sense of
the importance of what

01:01:33.930 --> 01:01:36.590 align:middle line:10%
you're experiencing.

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:41.580 align:middle line:10%
You will see a different purpose
for what you're experiencing.

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:44.790 align:middle line:10%
And you might actually
turn something

01:01:44.790 --> 01:01:49.170 align:middle line:10%
that's horrifying into
an incredible opportunity

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:53.100 align:middle line:10%
for growth and transformation.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:57.630 align:middle line:10%
And that's so important
at this time in history

01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:01.420 align:middle line:10%
because so many people are
experiencing very, very

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.270 align:middle line:10%
difficult experiences.

01:02:04.270 --> 01:02:09.970 align:middle line:10%
And that's critical.

01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:17.500 align:middle line:84%
Just recently my mom passed
during this episode with COVID,

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:22.990 align:middle line:84%
and there's so
many great lessons

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:28.960 align:middle line:84%
that are emerging from what
is happening in the world.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:34.390 align:middle line:84%
One of them, for instance,
is clearly showing people

01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:36.700 align:middle line:90%
how connected we are.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:40.150 align:middle line:84%
That if something
happens over there,

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:42.640 align:middle line:90%
it's not isolated over there.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:45.610 align:middle line:90%
It has global impact.

01:02:45.610 --> 01:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And so we see the
connectivity of all the humans

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:55.120 align:middle line:84%
that where all of our
faiths are linked together.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:07.200 align:middle line:84%
And as well lessons of
unity, deeper reflection

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.230 align:middle line:84%
about ourselves
because so many people

01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:11.980 align:middle line:90%
stop working and all this.

01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:18.420 align:middle line:84%
So I looked at the passing of
my mom, and, of course, it's sad

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.890 align:middle line:90%
and it's difficult at times.

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:24.870 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time I know
that so many people dedicated

01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:32.460 align:middle line:84%
their life in this moment, in
this episode for the benefit

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:37.200 align:middle line:84%
of the evolution of humanity
so that these lessons

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.020 align:middle line:90%
could be learned.

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:45.270 align:middle line:84%
In some ways this virus
is teaching humanity

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:47.320 align:middle line:90%
a very important lesson.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:53.160 align:middle line:84%
And so, again, it's a
question of perspective.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.250 align:middle line:84%
If you take the
larger perspective,

01:03:56.250 --> 01:04:03.790 align:middle line:84%
you start to get a deeper sense
of why something is happening.

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:07.750 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't negate that you
might be having a hard time

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:11.150 align:middle line:84%
and that you have deep
emotions about what's going on,

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:15.380 align:middle line:84%
but at the same time you can
have this larger perspective

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:21.220 align:middle line:84%
which gives you a place to
center around so that you

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:27.490 align:middle line:84%
feel the deeper purpose of why
events occurs in your life.

01:04:27.490 --> 01:04:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So all that is the result
of following your--

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:37.060 align:middle line:90%
firing your instinct, firing--

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:41.720 align:middle line:84%
following your bliss where
it feels good, where--

01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:48.670 align:middle line:84%
and doing some self reflection,
taking the time every day

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:54.230 align:middle line:84%
to turn your senses from
the outside to the inside.

01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:59.110 align:middle line:90%
Those are important moments.

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:01.780 align:middle line:84%
This is where the
knowledge comes from.

01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:04.600 align:middle line:90%
It comes from within you.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:09.360 align:middle line:84%
This is how you will
be able to apply

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:15.000 align:middle line:84%
your creativity to your life,
to your career, to what you're

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.740 align:middle line:90%
doing, and to--

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:21.726 align:middle line:84%
and help humanity
at a deeper level.

01:05:21.726 --> 01:05:26.160 align:middle line:10%
>> So if we could take
a little bit of a pivot,

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.010 align:middle line:10%
I'm wondering if you are willing
to share what you're currently

01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:31.140 align:middle line:10%
working on with us.

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.400 align:middle line:10%
The paper or--

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.510 align:middle line:10%
>> I'm working on many things.

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:38.550 align:middle line:10%
One of them is a
scientific paper

01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:43.590 align:middle line:10%
that flashes out some of the
mathematics and the formalism

01:05:43.590 --> 01:05:47.280 align:middle line:10%
that was missing when I
wrote the holographic math

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.740 align:middle line:10%
solution for both the
proton, the electron,

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:51.000 align:middle line:10%
and for the universe.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.400 align:middle line:10%
Kind of putting
all these together,

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:57.900 align:middle line:10%
like I found a pattern, and to--

01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:01.140 align:middle line:10%
with Dr. Olivier Alirol.

01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:08.820 align:middle line:10%
And we are finishing this paper
that's very important because it

01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:13.830 align:middle line:10%
unifies all these
principles and give

01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:22.620 align:middle line:10%
a very straightforward path, a
formal path to understanding all

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:26.490 align:middle line:10%
of the scales in the
universe, all of the constants

01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:32.520 align:middle line:10%
and all of the forces at a
very deep level of accuracy.

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:37.500 align:middle line:10%
And it tells us that
clearly all these things

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.190 align:middle line:10%
are connected through
this fabric of space,

01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:47.580 align:middle line:10%
that this network of information
that connects us all,

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:50.740 align:middle line:10%
so that's exciting.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:56.730 align:middle line:10%
I'm working as well on applying
this knowledge into technologies

01:06:56.730 --> 01:07:03.990 align:middle line:10%
to link our technology to this
fundamental network of creation

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:09.030 align:middle line:10%
so that we can extract energy
from it, that we can control

01:07:09.030 --> 01:07:12.720 align:middle line:10%
gravitational field for
space travel and all this,

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.500 align:middle line:10%
that we can bring our
civilization to a different way

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:18.330 align:middle line:10%
of interacting with the world.

01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:26.490 align:middle line:10%
Instead of digging out
basically rotten dinosaurs

01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:30.960 align:middle line:10%
you know which turns
into oil so that we can

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:37.440 align:middle line:10%
run our cars, they probably--

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:40.680 align:middle line:10%
like there's ways
to extract energy

01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:46.320 align:middle line:10%
from the source of
energy that made

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:49.560 align:middle line:10%
the dinosaurs in the
first place, that made

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:53.400 align:middle line:10%
the biology in the first place.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And from the source, when you
extract it from the source,

01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:04.200 align:middle line:84%
then the environmental
impact is nil.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.440 align:middle line:84%
You're extracting energy
directly from space time,

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:11.040 align:middle line:84%
it has very positive effect
on your civilization.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And eventually it leads
to controlling gravity.

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:18.689 align:middle line:84%
We built a whole
society, we built

01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:24.990 align:middle line:84%
our whole technological society
on controlling electromagnetic

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:28.920 align:middle line:84%
fields because we figured out
how they worked and we figured

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.100 align:middle line:84%
out how to direct
them and control them

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:34.710 align:middle line:84%
and embed information
in it so that you

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
can have a phone call
on your cell phone

01:08:38.220 --> 01:08:41.080 align:middle line:90%
and you can do all these things.

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next step for
evolution of humanity

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:49.859 align:middle line:84%
is to actually understand
gravitational fields

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and the fundamental
forces at a deeper level.

01:08:53.170 --> 01:08:56.770 align:middle line:84%
And then learn to use
them to their advantage--

01:08:56.770 --> 01:09:00.790 align:middle line:84%
to our advantage
so that we can not

01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:06.279 align:middle line:84%
be stuck to one planet
which has limited resources.

01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:12.939 align:middle line:84%
And open our world to the solar
system, eventually the galaxy,

01:09:12.939 --> 01:09:16.580 align:middle line:84%
the cluster, the universe,
whatever the case may be.

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:20.900 align:middle line:84%
But when we control gravity, it
will be a completely new ball

01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:21.700 align:middle line:90%
game.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:23.710 align:middle line:90%
It's going to change everything.

01:09:23.710 --> 01:09:28.310 align:middle line:84%
And it's not going to be
in 10 generations from now,

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:34.149 align:middle line:84%
it will be in our generation
that these discoveries

01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:37.100 align:middle line:90%
will emerge and happen.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:42.279 align:middle line:84%
So it's very, very
exciting to be alive today

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.680 align:middle line:90%
to see that happening.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Where did all this
come from for you?

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:51.600 align:middle line:10%
I mean, where were your
curiosities at one point

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.355 align:middle line:10%
in your life that led you here?

01:09:53.355 --> 01:09:56.050 align:middle line:10%


01:09:56.050 --> 01:10:00.870 align:middle line:10%
>> I think for me from when
I was really young I was very

01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:01.980 align:middle line:10%
inquisitive.

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:06.210 align:middle line:10%
I wanted to understand
how nature worked.

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:09.150 align:middle line:10%
It was really weird
for me, in fact,

01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:12.930 align:middle line:10%
to see that all
the adults were not

01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:15.120 align:middle line:10%
asking fundamental questions.

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.550 align:middle line:10%
They were just going
about their day

01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:20.010 align:middle line:10%
acting like
everything was normal.

01:10:20.010 --> 01:10:24.360 align:middle line:10%
That they were down here
working to pay their bills

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:26.550 align:middle line:10%
and everything,
and then they would

01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:30.000 align:middle line:10%
get to the end of their lives
and maybe in the last two

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.040 align:middle line:10%
weeks of their life
they would start

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.930 align:middle line:10%
asking fundamental questions.

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:37.080 align:middle line:10%
And I'd be like, it's
kind of too late.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.630 align:middle line:10%
Now you've got two
weeks to figure it out.

01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:41.490 align:middle line:10%
You had a whole lifetime.

01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:44.950 align:middle line:10%
So it was like-- for me
it was kind of weird.

01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:48.480 align:middle line:84%
It's like people arrive
here and they just

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:52.290 align:middle line:90%
go on doing like everybody else.

01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:56.620 align:middle line:84%
And people are not asking
like, how did I get here?

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.770 align:middle line:84%
What is this
experience I'm having.

01:10:58.770 --> 01:11:01.230 align:middle line:90%
What is this life?

01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Why are these people
doing all these things?

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:08.380 align:middle line:90%
And it just was strange.

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:14.990 align:middle line:84%
So to me it was like, OK, I need
to know what the heck this is.

01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:17.550 align:middle line:84%
How did I get here and
what is this experience

01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm having that I'm
calling reality?

01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Because it's like, OK,
so I started to dig.

01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:25.680 align:middle line:90%
I started to think.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:32.610 align:middle line:84%
I would sit for hours
contemplating, looking at people

01:11:32.610 --> 01:11:34.470 align:middle line:90%
walking in the street.

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:40.380 align:middle line:90%
I lived close to a theater and--

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:43.140 align:middle line:84%
in Montreal, and there
was a bench in front

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.240 align:middle line:90%
of the exit of the theater.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And I would just
sit on that bench

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.150 align:middle line:84%
and look at people come out of
the theater and how they moved

01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:53.010 align:middle line:84%
and how they talked
to each other.

01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:57.330 align:middle line:90%
And I would classify people.

01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:01.350 align:middle line:84%
I could see strands
of people like,

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:04.480 align:middle line:84%
oh, this is a person
that's more like this

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:07.750 align:middle line:84%
and this is a person that's
more-- and I could see patterns.

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And I would look in nature
and I would see patterns

01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:13.110 align:middle line:90%
and I would think--

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
and, I mean, there
was definitely a lot

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:18.140 align:middle line:90%
of snow in Canada at the time.

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And I would look at the
snowflakes and look at each one

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.320 align:middle line:84%
and go, wow, they're
all different

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.150 align:middle line:90%
but they're all hexagonal.

01:12:28.150 --> 01:12:31.090 align:middle line:84%
Like and why are
they all like this?

01:12:31.090 --> 01:12:34.890 align:middle line:90%
And what makes this happen?

01:12:34.890 --> 01:12:40.630 align:middle line:10%
And so I had an inquisitive
mind and I wanted to know.

01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:49.250 align:middle line:10%
And I felt like people were
as well living a double life.

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:52.340 align:middle line:10%
I felt like there was
the part of people

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:56.780 align:middle line:10%
that they were externalizing
like their behavior,

01:12:56.780 --> 01:13:00.590 align:middle line:10%
the way they are, but
then internally there

01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:03.650 align:middle line:10%
was a whole other person that--

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:06.260 align:middle line:10%
asking much deeper questions.

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:12.830 align:middle line:10%
And that person is
not often exposed.

01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:18.710 align:middle line:10%
And I would like, have very
deep philosophical conversation

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:22.640 align:middle line:10%
with people trying to see
if I could help them expose

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.420 align:middle line:10%
that deeper part
of themself that

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:32.270 align:middle line:10%
is like asking deeper questions
about the nature of reality.

01:13:32.270 --> 01:13:34.100 align:middle line:10%
I had the--

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:38.360 align:middle line:10%
I was fortunate that my father
was a child psychologist

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.720 align:middle line:10%
and was a director
of child psychology

01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:43.310 align:middle line:10%
at the University of Montreal.

01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:48.560 align:middle line:10%
And so he was hanging out
with a lot of deep thinkers

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.120 align:middle line:10%
and philosophers.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.130 align:middle line:10%
And my father used
to bring his students

01:13:52.130 --> 01:14:05.240 align:middle line:10%
to our home to have like group
psychology events, and so on.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:09.200 align:middle line:10%
And I would talk
with his student

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:18.630 align:middle line:10%
and I just felt like
there's a mystery.

01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:25.020 align:middle line:10%
And I felt like if there's
a mystery and I'm here

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:28.960 align:middle line:10%
and I know there's a mystery,
that means there's an answer.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.870 align:middle line:10%
It's not going to--

01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:34.800 align:middle line:10%
it can't be solved.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:38.370 align:middle line:84%
And often I was
told by many people

01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:41.680 align:middle line:84%
along the way,
many, many people,

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.890 align:middle line:84%
you're never going to
solve that, you're never

01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:46.035 align:middle line:90%
going to know.

01:14:46.035 --> 01:14:50.520 align:middle line:84%
Just go along with it and forget
about it and just do your thing

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.784 align:middle line:90%
and don't make waves.

01:14:52.784 --> 01:14:57.450 align:middle line:90%
And it was just not my type.

01:14:57.450 --> 01:14:59.550 align:middle line:90%
I just needed to know.

01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:05.970 align:middle line:84%
And I felt like
there is nothing--

01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:10.270 align:middle line:84%
if there's a question,
then there is an answer.

01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:17.660 align:middle line:84%
It's just a question of
actually feeling the answer,

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:23.330 align:middle line:84%
knowing the answer,
experiencing the answer,

01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:28.190 align:middle line:84%
and then being able
to cognify that answer

01:15:28.190 --> 01:15:32.060 align:middle line:84%
at a deep enough level that
you can communicate it.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's in mathematics
or in conversation

01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:41.030 align:middle line:84%
or in philosophy, but to
be able to communicate it

01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:45.510 align:middle line:90%
and to explore it with others.

01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:53.390 align:middle line:84%
There is very
profound moments when

01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:57.770 align:middle line:84%
you're communicating
something that you believe

01:15:57.770 --> 01:16:05.000 align:middle line:84%
is a very deep truth with
others because typically others

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.785 align:middle line:90%
recognize it.

01:16:06.785 --> 01:16:10.850 align:middle line:84%
If they're just even just
a little bit open to it,

01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:15.260 align:middle line:84%
they will recognize it and
you will see that change

01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:17.130 align:middle line:90%
in the other person.

01:16:17.130 --> 01:16:20.520 align:middle line:84%
And they might
actually go further

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:26.940 align:middle line:84%
than you did with that truth,
with that line of thought,

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:29.380 align:middle line:90%
and you will learn as well.

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:35.410 align:middle line:84%
And as you-- so it's really an
amazing collective evolution.

01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:38.130 align:middle line:90%


01:16:38.130 --> 01:16:49.020 align:middle line:84%
And it was very exciting
to have the possibility

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:51.180 align:middle line:84%
to think about all
these things but I

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:55.080 align:middle line:84%
was having a very hard time
in the educational system.

01:16:55.080 --> 01:17:00.030 align:middle line:10%
And my father being
a child psychologist

01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:07.260 align:middle line:10%
and involved in
education and so on, I

01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:11.040 align:middle line:10%
was probably his worst
case, his worst nightmare.

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.700 align:middle line:10%
But I was just a child
that didn't fit anywhere.

01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:21.730 align:middle line:10%
And so early on I had to
go and do my own thing.

01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:26.070 align:middle line:10%
And I spent many, many
years, some 25 years

01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:29.190 align:middle line:10%
in nature in the
mountains climbing,

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:35.710 align:middle line:10%
skiing, and so on because I
wanted to be close to nature.

01:17:35.710 --> 01:17:41.760 align:middle line:10%
And that was really important to
me, to feel the natural world.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.630 align:middle line:10%
Maybe if I could feel
the natural world enough,

01:17:45.630 --> 01:17:48.990 align:middle line:10%
it would tell me something,
it would talk to me,

01:17:48.990 --> 01:17:50.520 align:middle line:10%
it would tell--

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:54.270 align:middle line:10%
I could become
more empathic to it

01:17:54.270 --> 01:17:59.110 align:middle line:10%
and I could understand its
nature at a deeper level.

01:17:59.110 --> 01:18:04.380 align:middle line:10%
And so I loved being in nature.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:17.950 align:middle line:10%
And eventually I had to
become more than just

01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:21.070 align:middle line:10%
internally thinking about this.

01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:26.530 align:middle line:10%
I knew that I had to
explore it more in detail

01:18:26.530 --> 01:18:30.290 align:middle line:10%
and formalize it
and transmit it.

01:18:30.290 --> 01:18:37.720 align:middle line:10%
And so I started on this
daunting path of learning

01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:40.300 align:middle line:10%
physics and
mathematics and so on

01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:46.360 align:middle line:10%
to eventually write these
equations that describe,

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:49.495 align:middle line:10%
I think, the fundamental
nature of reality.

01:18:49.495 --> 01:18:52.738 align:middle line:90%


01:18:52.738 --> 01:18:55.350 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, I feel like we
skipped over a lot.

01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:56.150 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS]

01:18:56.150 --> 01:18:59.565 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, sorry.

01:18:59.565 --> 01:19:00.365 align:middle line:10%
>> There it is.

01:19:00.365 --> 01:19:03.230 align:middle line:10%
>> You're going to have
to do a lot of cutting.

01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:06.270 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, no.

01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:07.070 align:middle line:10%
It was beautiful.

01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:09.212 align:middle line:10%
So I want to make sure that
you have an opportunity

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:11.170 align:middle line:10%
to say something that
you feel needs to be said

01:19:11.170 --> 01:19:13.940 align:middle line:10%
and I'm not asking,
or something that you

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:15.680 align:middle line:10%
feel is important to say.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I appreciate it.

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.460 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, thank you.

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:24.440 align:middle line:84%
Well, you know, I think
what's important at this time

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:29.730 align:middle line:84%
is that people
realize that there

01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:36.048 align:middle line:84%
is more to reality than
what it appears to be.

01:19:36.048 --> 01:19:43.170 align:middle line:84%
That there's many-- from
traditions that talk about

01:19:43.170 --> 01:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
it's all an illusion,
what about--

01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:53.670 align:middle line:84%
and in one sense I
think that's accurate

01:19:53.670 --> 01:19:58.360 align:middle line:84%
as much as the reverse
statement is accurate,

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:01.980 align:middle line:90%
which is everything is real.

01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:04.860 align:middle line:84%
What I mean by
everything is real is

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:13.350 align:middle line:84%
that your thoughts, your
feelings, your intuition, it's

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.500 align:middle line:90%
all real.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:18.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not something
that's just some kind

01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:21.210 align:middle line:84%
of like random
chemical event that's

01:20:21.210 --> 01:20:24.060 align:middle line:84%
occurring in your brain
that's making that happen,

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:29.500 align:middle line:84%
like there's something that
the universe is talking to you

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:32.290 align:middle line:90%
and you're talking back.

01:20:32.290 --> 01:20:37.240 align:middle line:84%
And you don't know you're in a
conversation with the universe,

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:42.550 align:middle line:84%
although you might realize it
in your being, in your head.

01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:44.880 align:middle line:84%
Like you might
say-- you might know

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:49.180 align:middle line:84%
because we do have these
conversations constantly

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:52.760 align:middle line:90%
in the shower, going to work.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:55.870 align:middle line:84%
It's not like we're sitting
there completely blank.

01:20:55.870 --> 01:20:59.690 align:middle line:84%
So we're driving and we're
thinking about 20 million things

01:20:59.690 --> 01:21:03.220 align:middle line:84%
and we're having a
conversation about them,

01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:05.150 align:middle line:90%
who are we talking about?

01:21:05.150 --> 01:21:07.480 align:middle line:90%
Who are we talking to?

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.520 align:middle line:90%
What is going on?

01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:15.220 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're talking to
this fundamental field.

01:21:15.220 --> 01:21:19.570 align:middle line:84%
We're part of this
fundamental field.

01:21:19.570 --> 01:21:26.080 align:middle line:84%
And we're like a tool of this
fundamental field learning

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:31.680 align:middle line:84%
about itself, growing,
evolving, transforming.

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.440 align:middle line:84%
And we're all connected
through that field.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:40.164 align:middle line:10%
We all have the same faith,
we're all on the same planet.

01:21:40.164 --> 01:21:43.240 align:middle line:10%
Everything we do in a day.

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:45.450 align:middle line:10%
So to have like--

01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:46.890 align:middle line:10%
level of awareness.

01:21:46.890 --> 01:21:48.330 align:middle line:10%
What am I doing?

01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:50.460 align:middle line:10%
What is the actions I'm taking?

01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:53.010 align:middle line:10%
What am I thinking?

01:21:53.010 --> 01:21:56.760 align:middle line:10%
Right now there's all these
manifestations and riots

01:21:56.760 --> 01:22:02.740 align:middle line:10%
about racism and
so on in the world.

01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:14.140 align:middle line:10%
And it's like many people that
nobody would consider racist,

01:22:14.140 --> 01:22:16.810 align:middle line:10%
does that mean they don't
have those thoughts?

01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:20.340 align:middle line:10%
No, it doesn't actually.

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:25.350 align:middle line:10%
If you did good accounting
of your thoughts and you--

01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:30.550 align:middle line:10%
you will find that sometimes
those thoughts come up.

01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:31.990 align:middle line:10%
Where are they coming from?

01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:39.810 align:middle line:10%
And it might be the Chinese
or the Africans or--

01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:48.570 align:middle line:10%
but it's like--
and it's happening.

01:22:48.570 --> 01:22:51.770 align:middle line:10%
And if you're not aware
that it's happening,

01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:54.560 align:middle line:10%
then there's no way
for you to edit it.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.420 align:middle line:10%
There's no way for
you to transform it.

01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:01.160 align:middle line:10%
And now you're part of something
you don't want to be part of.

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:09.920 align:middle line:10%
So to actually become aware, to
have self awareness to the point

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:13.670 align:middle line:10%
that you're able
to actually monitor

01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:17.300 align:middle line:10%
what is the conversation
that's going on here?

01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:19.700 align:middle line:10%
And who am I talking to?

01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:25.070 align:middle line:10%
And to realize you're talking to
a field, a morphogenetic field

01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:27.830 align:middle line:10%
that connects all
things, and that you

01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:30.830 align:middle line:10%
have a responsibility
in what you're

01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:36.290 align:middle line:10%
putting in that field, how
you're interpreting reality

01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:41.720 align:middle line:10%
is impacting the whole, then
you realize your responsibility.

01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:45.440 align:middle line:10%
And you're going to fail,
you're going to get pissed off,

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:48.638 align:middle line:10%
you're going to scream,
you're going to have moments.

01:23:48.638 --> 01:23:50.430 align:middle line:10%
Somebody's going to
cut you on the highway,

01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:54.000 align:middle line:10%
you're going to give
them the finger, it's OK.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.500 align:middle line:10%
It's OK.

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:59.610 align:middle line:10%
Like, you have to
be good to yourself,

01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:04.290 align:middle line:10%
to understand you will have
hard times, you will fail,

01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:05.850 align:middle line:10%
you will do the wrong thing.

01:24:05.850 --> 01:24:12.120 align:middle line:10%
What's important is how fast
can you go back to being benign,

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:16.200 align:middle line:10%
to learning from what
happened, to evolving.

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.460 align:middle line:10%
That is what's important.

01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:22.020 align:middle line:10%
It's the universe
helping evolve you?

01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:23.700 align:middle line:10%
Take the opportunity.

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:29.550 align:middle line:10%
Whatever is happening that may
be looking negative in your life

01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:31.780 align:middle line:10%
is an opportunity for growth.

01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:35.250 align:middle line:10%
And if you take it
like that, then you

01:24:35.250 --> 01:24:42.870 align:middle line:10%
will be the most brilliant and
the most amazing contributor

01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:46.220 align:middle line:10%
to the human experience.

01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:48.000 align:middle line:90%
