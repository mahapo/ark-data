00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.090 align:middle line:90%
>> Bruce Lipton 2.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.890 align:middle line:90%
Take 1.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.957 align:middle line:90%
Marker.

00:00:13.957 --> 00:00:20.540 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Who are you?

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.790 align:middle line:10%
>> I am a happy guy.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And I had to learn that,
because maybe 40 years,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:90%
that was questionable.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.450 align:middle line:84%
But the last number of
years has been a joy.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, how did
you get that way?

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:84%
>> First, understanding I was
responsible for whether I wanted

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.322 align:middle line:90%
to be happy or not.

00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:42.530 align:middle line:90%
And then that was a decision.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.320 align:middle line:10%
Do you want this or do you
want-- oh, I want that one.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:90%
And then chose it.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.960 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you write that "I
have come full circle from

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.670 align:middle line:84%
a reductionist, scientific take
on life to a spiritual one,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.660 align:middle line:84%
also from an agnostic scientist
to a card-carrying mystic."

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.590 align:middle line:90%
How so?

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:90%
How did you get that way?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, for the most
formative years of my life,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.667 align:middle line:84%
you get a lot of wisdom from
so-called "spiritual people."

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:16.000 align:middle line:84%
But as a kid, you could see
through it all of a sudden--

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.080 align:middle line:84%
And said, well,
the words are nice,

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.910 align:middle line:84%
but their lives don't
even match anything

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.200 align:middle line:90%
that they're talking about.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And there's some point
where, even as a kid,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.780 align:middle line:84%
it's like, how valid is that
statement if that person is

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:90%
living this way?

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.790 align:middle line:10%
And so at some point, I just
disregarded spirituality as not

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.370 align:middle line:10%
really relevant because
it didn't serve those that

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:10%
were telling me about it,
and dove into science,

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.410 align:middle line:10%
because science was--

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:10%
whatever was true in science
on this side of the planet

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.458 align:middle line:10%
was true on the other
side of the planet.

00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:43.990 align:middle line:90%
So it was a pervasive truth.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.850 align:middle line:90%
And I love science.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And this has really
got me into the field.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.250 align:middle line:10%
And then I was most
fortunate to be

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.590 align:middle line:10%
at the right place
at the right time

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.650 align:middle line:10%
to work on stem cells, which
everybody hears about today,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.260 align:middle line:10%
but this was over 50 years ago.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.630 align:middle line:90%
And I was cloning stem cells.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And nobody really even
knew about stem cells,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.390 align:middle line:90%
but I was working with them.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.850 align:middle line:84%
And as I started
working with them,

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.910 align:middle line:84%
I started to realize,
through my research,

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:84%
that the fate of
the cells was not

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:90%
controlled by their genetics.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.570 align:middle line:10%
The fate of the cell was
controlled by the environment

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.130 align:middle line:10%
that they were in.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, it takes
away the concept of genetics.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:10%
And I go, what's the
relevance of genetics?

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:10%
So if I say, this trait is
under genetic control, what

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.140 align:middle line:10%
that means in people's mind is
there's an automatic system,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.020 align:middle line:10%
a gene is going to turn on,
it's going to engage the trait,

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:10%
and that's my
behavior or my life.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.317 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, well,
that's really interesting.

00:02:40.317 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:84%
When we are teaching
that, what are we

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.470 align:middle line:90%
teaching people about genetics?

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.030 align:middle line:84%
I go, well, genes
control your life.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.560 align:middle line:84%
That, as far as we
know, you didn't

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.640 align:middle line:90%
pick the genes you came with.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.150 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't like the
characteristics you have,

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:90%
you can't change those genes.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And then we add on top
of that that the genes

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.420 align:middle line:90%
turn on and off by themselves.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.800 align:middle line:90%
I say, what are we teaching?

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.510 align:middle line:90%
Victimization.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.000 align:middle line:84%
You're a victim
of your heredity.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.170 align:middle line:84%
And it becomes really critical
because victim means powerless.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.930 align:middle line:10%
And if people are programmed
that their health is

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:21.400 align:middle line:10%
beyond their control, then
they seek someone powerful that

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.630 align:middle line:10%
will facilitate their health.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.420 align:middle line:10%
And so they give up power.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm powerless, so
I have no power,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.710 align:middle line:10%
but I accept what you say,
and that becomes my truth.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.010 align:middle line:10%
And then what, really,
the root comes down

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.660 align:middle line:10%
to is understanding that
consciousness is translated

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.500 align:middle line:10%
by the brain into
complementary chemistry, which

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.170 align:middle line:10%
goes into the blood, and that
blood nourishes and instructs

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:10%
50 trillion cells.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.480 align:middle line:10%
So the chemistry of the
blood is controlling

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.390 align:middle line:10%
the genetics and the
behavior, but the chemistry

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.300 align:middle line:10%
comes from the brain.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.840 align:middle line:90%
I go, yeah, but which chemistry?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Whatever picture is
held in the mind.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.710 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if
you say, I'm in love--

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:90%
a picture of love--

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.730 align:middle line:84%
I go, well that's a
beautiful picture.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.380 align:middle line:90%
All the romantic movie stuff.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:84%
And I go, if that's in your
mind, the chemistry that

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.300 align:middle line:84%
comes from that love primarily
is dopamine, which is pleasure.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:90%
That's why we seek it.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.800 align:middle line:10%
Oxytocin is another
chemical released in love

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.170 align:middle line:10%
because that bonds
me to the source.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.950 align:middle line:10%
Vasopressin is released,
because that chemical

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.250 align:middle line:10%
makes me more attractive to my
partner so my partner stays.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
And most importantly,
growth hormone

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.317 align:middle line:90%
is released when you're in love.

00:04:42.317 --> 00:04:43.650 align:middle line:90%
And I go, what is that relevant?

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.950 align:middle line:84%
I say, growth hormone is
what keeps you healthy

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.750 align:middle line:90%
and maintains your biology.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.770 align:middle line:10%
So I say, so the chemical
cocktail translated from love

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.250 align:middle line:10%
manifests an expression in the
body of health and harmony.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.760 align:middle line:10%
And that's why people, they say,
oh, look how in love they are.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.080 align:middle line:90%
See how they glow?

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.510 align:middle line:90%
That glow is biology.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And I say, yeah, but
why are they glowing?

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.770 align:middle line:84%
I say because the
environment of that chemistry

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.470 align:middle line:90%
enhances vitality.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.710 align:middle line:84%
And I say, wait, same
person opens up their eyes

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:84%
and sees something
that scares them,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.150 align:middle line:84%
you don't release
the love cocktail.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.760 align:middle line:84%
You release stress
hormones and factors

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.280 align:middle line:90%
that affect the immune system.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And I go, this is a completely
different chemistry.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.760 align:middle line:84%
I go, oh, so if I have a
picture of love, I am healthy.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
But then we find out
that a picture of fear

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.600 align:middle line:84%
generates chemistry that
puts us into a protection.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.850 align:middle line:90%
That's what fear is all about.

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:90%
I need protection.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.640 align:middle line:90%
And I say, so what?

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.060 align:middle line:84%
I say, well, then, the chemicals
that are released in fear

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.290 align:middle line:84%
redirect the body's
energy away from growth

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and puts the energy
into everything

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.780 align:middle line:90%
I need to escape the fear.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So I say, oh, so
what does it mean?

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I say, the moment you
have fear, stress hormones

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:84%
shut down the growth and
maintenance of the body.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.960 align:middle line:90%
I go, why?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.910 align:middle line:84%
Because why should
I expend energy

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.090 align:middle line:84%
to grow the body if I'm being
chased by a saber toothed tiger?

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.100 align:middle line:84%
I want all of the energy
available to escape the tiger.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:14.340 align:middle line:10%
So I redirect the
energy in the body

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.560 align:middle line:10%
with the chemistry
that comes from fear,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.240 align:middle line:10%
redirects it not toward
maintenance of the body,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.350 align:middle line:10%
but redirects it toward
escaping the fear.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:25.620 align:middle line:84%
And I go, and most
important aspect of that

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.910 align:middle line:84%
is that stress hormones
shut down the immune system.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.620 align:middle line:90%
So why should they do that?

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.100 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is this--
because the immune system uses

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.830 align:middle line:84%
so much energy that when
people are sick, sometimes,

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.030 align:middle line:84%
they don't even have the
energy to get out of bed.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.640 align:middle line:90%
So then I put a situation here.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.120 align:middle line:84%
I say, you have a bacterial
infection, I always like to add,

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:84%
possibly diarrhea
coming from this.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.225 align:middle line:84%
And you say, oh, I want my
immune system to handle this.

00:06:50.225 --> 00:06:51.850 align:middle line:84%
And I say, but at
the same time, you're

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
being chased by a
saber toothed tiger.

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:84%
Where do you want
the energy to go?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.300 align:middle line:90%
You want to split it?

00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:90%
And I go, are you kidding me?

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.980 align:middle line:10%
I put everything in to
running away from the tiger,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:10%
because if the
tiger catches you,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.870 align:middle line:10%
that bacteria is no longer
your problem at that moment.

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.090 align:middle line:10%
So the idea is, stress hormones
shut down the immune system

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.000 align:middle line:10%
to conserve energy
to escape the threat.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.720 align:middle line:84%
All of this sounds, on paper,
this is a beautiful mechanism.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And then I say, but when
was this mechanism designed?

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:24.190 align:middle line:84%
I say hundreds of
thousands of years ago.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And I say, oh, then,
well, what fears

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:29.310 align:middle line:90%
did we have 100,000 years ago?

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.460 align:middle line:10%
I go, saber toothed tiger.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.260 align:middle line:90%
I go, so what?

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.480 align:middle line:84%
I say, so I'm living in
growth, the happy part, feeding

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.700 align:middle line:84%
my system, nourishing
and everything.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.230 align:middle line:90%
The tiger shows up.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.720 align:middle line:84%
The stress hormones are
released into the body.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.710 align:middle line:10%
That allows me to run like crazy
to get away from that tiger.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.580 align:middle line:84%
So maximum 10
minutes, I'm running.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.110 align:middle line:10%
I escape.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:53.010 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.530 align:middle line:84%
I say, oh, I go back
to growth again.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.920 align:middle line:84%
So the inhibition
of body maintenance

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.130 align:middle line:84%
and the inhibition of the immune
system is not a long-term thing.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:04.470 align:middle line:84%
It's supposed to
be just minutes.

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:09.240 align:middle line:84%
But today's world,
stress is 24/7/365.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:10%
We were not designed
for prolonged inhibition

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.020 align:middle line:10%
of the maintenance of
the body or prolonged

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.800 align:middle line:10%
shutting down the immune system,
because this opens us up,

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.480 align:middle line:10%
now, for infection and disease.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.650 align:middle line:10%
And so the interesting aspect
about that is since we have

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:28.620 align:middle line:10%
programmed the public,
oh, disease is connected

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:33.049 align:middle line:10%
to your genes, well,
let's-- a fact of science.

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:37.270 align:middle line:10%
Less than 1% of disease
is connected to genes.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.559 align:middle line:84%
Over 90% of illness is
connected to environment

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:45.507 align:middle line:84%
and our perception or
response to that environment.

00:08:45.507 --> 00:08:46.840 align:middle line:90%
And all of a sudden, I say, why?

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, then, the
pathologies that affect us,

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.330 align:middle line:84%
we're not genetically designed
to have those pathologies.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:90%
We are manifesting them.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.410 align:middle line:90%
There's no cancer gene--

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:90%
a fact of life.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.850 align:middle line:10%
There is not one gene
that causes cancer.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.170 align:middle line:90%
You want to get cancer?

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.360 align:middle line:84%
Oh, you have to
activate over 10.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.550 align:middle line:10%
Usually 15 to 20 different genes
must be activated simultaneously

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:10.630 align:middle line:10%
to manifest a cancer.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:middle line:90%
I go, that many different genes?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.330 align:middle line:84%
If I said one gene
causes cancer,

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:15.890 align:middle line:90%
you say, oh, one gene mutated.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:16.690 align:middle line:90%
I got cancer.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:20.018 align:middle line:90%
I go, it takes 10, 15, 20 genes.

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.060 align:middle line:84%
I go, oh, well, then, all
of a sudden coincidence

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.170 align:middle line:90%
is not part of it.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:27.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, there's an expression of
life contributing to the cancer.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.270 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, we end
up blaming the gene,

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.500 align:middle line:10%
saying the genes cause cancer.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.860 align:middle line:10%
That disempowers us, because
as I said, I have no control.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.550 align:middle line:10%
The genes did it.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.300 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, but
the reality is,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.950 align:middle line:84%
there is no genetic
linkage to cancer.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Cancer is an inappropriate
response to an interpretation

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:49.460 align:middle line:90%
of the world.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:84%
The environment they live
in, the perceptions they have

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:54.600 align:middle line:90%
are manifesting in a cancer.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So what people
really need to hear

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
is, cancer is a
symptom, not a problem.

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.250 align:middle line:90%
I go, so what?

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.970 align:middle line:84%
I go, the way we've
created medicine

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.570 align:middle line:84%
and pharmaceutical companies
is if you have a symptom,

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:10.430 align:middle line:90%
we try to stop it.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.020 align:middle line:10%
I go, yeah, but the
symptom isn't the problem.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.850 align:middle line:84%
So you can put any kind of drug
that kill your cancer cells--

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.790 align:middle line:84%
chemotherapy, radiation-- say,
oh, I killed the stupid cells.

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:23.940 align:middle line:10%
And I go, they were a
symptom of something higher.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.840 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
outcome of cancer

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:29.640 align:middle line:84%
is based on the consciousness
of the individual.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.570 align:middle line:84%
If that person feels
they're a total victim,

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:35.120 align:middle line:90%
they really just succumb to--

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.580 align:middle line:84%
the cancer beats me
because I'm a victim.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And there are other people who
say, I'm not accepting that.

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:45.090 align:middle line:10%
Forget that whole idea
of that prognosis.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.250 align:middle line:10%
And I go, what about them?

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:10%
I say, they have the best
chance of never having a cancer,

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.250 align:middle line:10%
because they didn't attribute
the cancer to something

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.570 align:middle line:10%
out of their control.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.930 align:middle line:10%
They start to recognize,
my life is not in harmony.

00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:58.790 align:middle line:10%
I'm stressed all the time.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:01.040 align:middle line:10%
Survival is questionable.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.340 align:middle line:10%
And I go, oh, well, that's
a source of stress hormones

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.320 align:middle line:10%
and that's a source of
inhibiting the immune system.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.520 align:middle line:10%
And just to emphasize,
how powerful

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.920 align:middle line:10%
is stress hormones in shutting
down the immune system?

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.120 align:middle line:10%
The answer is simple.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.660 align:middle line:10%
Medical doctors give
patients stress hormones

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:10%
before they transplant a
foreign organ into them.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.690 align:middle line:10%
So if I'm going to receive
a kidney, a lung, a heart,

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:29.270 align:middle line:10%
before I get that transplant,
I am given stress hormones

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:31.070 align:middle line:10%
by the medical doctor.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.210 align:middle line:10%
I go, why?

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.550 align:middle line:10%
Because it will inhibit
the immune system

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:38.810 align:middle line:10%
and prevent me from
rejecting the foreign organ

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.920 align:middle line:10%
the moment put into the system.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.010 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, I
say, oh, my god, they

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.840 align:middle line:84%
use stress hormones
therapeutically

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.370 align:middle line:90%
to shut down the immune system.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:84%
What do you think happens to the
average person on the street?

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:54.320 align:middle line:10%
They are, in fear, shutting
down and compromising

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.430 align:middle line:10%
their immune system--

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:middle line:10%
not because the immune
system won't work.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.010 align:middle line:84%
It's because you're redirecting
the energy of the body

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:03.590 align:middle line:90%
to escape a fear.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:08.230 align:middle line:10%
>> So from this story, I'm
hearing that you came full

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:10.240 align:middle line:10%
circle with spirituality,
because now,

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:15.190 align:middle line:10%
we're starting to talk about the
mindset and what you need to do

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:17.360 align:middle line:10%
to be able to get you on
the track that you really,

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.800 align:middle line:10%
really want to be on, right?

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:19.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of the hardest things
to understand is simply this--

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.420 align:middle line:90%
that we are programmed.

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.490 align:middle line:84%
The movie "The Matrix" is
like a science fiction story.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.930 align:middle line:84%
No, the movie "The
Matrix" is a documentary.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:90%
We've all been programmed.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:34.600 align:middle line:90%
I say, why?

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.550 align:middle line:10%
Step back and make a
simple understanding.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.410 align:middle line:10%
We talk about the
brain being a computer.

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:40.630 align:middle line:10%
It is-- a computer
beyond anything

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.860 align:middle line:10%
that humans have
created, which, again,

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:46.250 align:middle line:10%
refers to the intelligence
of the cells over humans.

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:47.500 align:middle line:90%
I go, so what's the relevance?

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.630 align:middle line:90%
It's a computer, just like any.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:51.640 align:middle line:90%
I go, what's the relevance?

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, first, you have to
have an operating system.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.480 align:middle line:90%
I say, oh.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.480 align:middle line:84%
In the last trimester
of fetal development,

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.640 align:middle line:90%
the operating system is engaged.

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.190 align:middle line:10%
I go, yeah, but I go to the
store, buy a brand-new computer,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:09.770 align:middle line:10%
bring it home, push on, it boots
up, operating system is there.

00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:10.950 align:middle line:90%
Boots up.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:11.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, I say do something.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:12.867 align:middle line:90%
And you go, like what?

00:13:12.867 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:10%
I say, oh, a drawing,
spreadsheet, Word document.

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:17.690 align:middle line:10%
I go, oh, I can't do that.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.040 align:middle line:10%
I say, why not?

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.240 align:middle line:10%
First, you have to
put in a program

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.210 align:middle line:10%
so you can operate the computer.

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.680 align:middle line:10%
The startup, booting up, it
says the computer's ready,

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.070 align:middle line:10%
but there's no program.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:35.690 align:middle line:84%
From the last trimester of
pregnancy through age seven,

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:38.960 align:middle line:84%
the function of the brain
is not at a higher vibration

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness, alpha
and beta and gamma.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.240 align:middle line:90%
It's at a lower vibration.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.310 align:middle line:10%
By testing with
wires on a head--

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:49.700 align:middle line:10%
EEG-- the vibration
of a developing child

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.747 align:middle line:10%
is predominantly in theta,
which is below consciousness.

00:13:53.747 --> 00:13:54.830 align:middle line:10%
What does theta represent?

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:59.690 align:middle line:10%
I said, it's expressed
as, well, a child's

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:02.120 align:middle line:10%
creating a reality,
a fantasy world,

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:10%
coming into the real world.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.810 align:middle line:10%
Theta is a mixture of
fantasy and reality.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:11.600 align:middle line:10%
I can ride a broom, but in my
mind as a kid, it's not a broom.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.780 align:middle line:90%
It is a full-blown stallion.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.403 align:middle line:10%
And so my mother says, give me
the broom, I'm looking at her,

00:14:18.403 --> 00:14:20.570 align:middle line:10%
I don't even know what the
heck she's talking about.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.250 align:middle line:10%
This isn't a broom,
it's a horse.

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:10%
Or I love it, the
famous tea party.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.890 align:middle line:84%
We pour nothing into that
cup and drink this nothing

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:84%
and go, oh, that was
the best tea I ever had.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.230 align:middle line:90%
And I go, theta--

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:84%
fantasy and reality
coming together.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.470 align:middle line:84%
That's a character-- up
until, by seven, it changes,

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:43.890 align:middle line:84%
because then, we get a higher
vibration called consciousness,

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:44.890 align:middle line:90%
alpha.

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So in this pre-seven
period, I say, what is

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.430 align:middle line:90%
the function of being in theta?

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:51.750 align:middle line:90%
Are you ready?

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.630 align:middle line:90%
Theta is hypnosis.

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.873 align:middle line:84%
This is why when you want
to hypnotize somebody

00:14:56.873 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
in the old-fashioned way--
they used to use a watch,

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:01.780 align:middle line:84%
and watch this, and it's
like, what is it doing?

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.290 align:middle line:10%
It's slowing down
your consciousness

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:07.200 align:middle line:10%
to focus on that little watch.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.960 align:middle line:10%
And as you drop consciousness
down, guess what?

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:10%
You're now entering
into the theta zone.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So that's what relaxing is
all about in hypnotherapy.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.860 align:middle line:10%
Stop the function of
the higher vibration,

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:22.270 align:middle line:10%
calm down, get into theta.

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.810 align:middle line:10%
I say, so what is hypnosis?

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.600 align:middle line:84%
It takes environmental
experiences

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.940 align:middle line:84%
and downloads them into
the subconscious mind.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:34.200 align:middle line:90%
So I'm a young boy.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.880 align:middle line:84%
How do I know what the rules
are to be a member of a family

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.450 align:middle line:84%
and to be a member
of a community?

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.567 align:middle line:90%
There are rules.

00:15:41.567 --> 00:15:43.150 align:middle line:84%
You can't go out and
do what you want.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.850 align:middle line:10%
And so where do you
get the rules from?

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.430 align:middle line:10%
A young kid doesn't read a book.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.500 align:middle line:10%
I say, ah, nature
helped him out.

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.180 align:middle line:84%
Said, you want to
know the rules,

00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:53.790 align:middle line:84%
put you in record,
watch your parents.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:54.990 align:middle line:90%
Watch your siblings.

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.340 align:middle line:90%
Watch your community.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.610 align:middle line:10%
What you're observing is not
going into the conscious mind.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.320 align:middle line:10%
It's not functioning
at that level.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.930 align:middle line:10%
What you're observing is
going download straight

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.590 align:middle line:10%
into the subconscious mind.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So where do you get your
behavioral programs from?

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.080 align:middle line:90%
Not from you.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.620 align:middle line:84%
You get them by observing
the people or individuals

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.250 align:middle line:84%
that you put as, these
are the important people--

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:21.990 align:middle line:84%
my teachers, mom, dad,
siblings, and community.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.570 align:middle line:90%
I observe them, download them.

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:26.002 align:middle line:90%
I go, oh, well, interesting.

00:16:26.002 --> 00:16:27.960 align:middle line:84%
The conscious mind isn't
working at that point.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.860 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not working.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:29.970 align:middle line:90%
I say, why is it relevant?

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:31.200 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is this.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.980 align:middle line:10%
What got downloaded into
your subconscious programming

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.830 align:middle line:10%
was never reviewed by you.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:39.075 align:middle line:10%
It wasn't filtered by you.

00:16:39.075 --> 00:16:40.200 align:middle line:10%
I say, what does that mean?

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.410 align:middle line:10%
I say, I can get good
programs and bad programs,

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.130 align:middle line:10%
and I'm just getting programs.

00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:48.360 align:middle line:10%
So I have no understanding,
when the programs are coming in,

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.570 align:middle line:10%
are these really good or bad?

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:10%
I'm just recording.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.510 align:middle line:10%
So unfortunately, about
70% of those programs

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.330 align:middle line:10%
are disempowering,
self-sabotaging, limiting

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:58.680 align:middle line:10%
beliefs that we acquire.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.550 align:middle line:10%
So I say, oh, I'm getting
programmed, and most of them

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:07.020 align:middle line:10%
are not going to strengthen
my existence on this planet.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.760 align:middle line:10%
And I go, oh, wow.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.250 align:middle line:10%
I go, well, I don't have
to worry about the program

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.990 align:middle line:10%
if I-- because
the next evolution

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.819 align:middle line:10%
is, I start to
get consciousness.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:10%
That's creative.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:20.609 align:middle line:10%
Subconscious-- habits,
programs, downloaded.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:22.109 align:middle line:10%
This is the way life is.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:10%
That's the program.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.680 align:middle line:90%
Conscious mind is creative.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'd rather have this,
and I would like to have that.

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:30.130 align:middle line:10%
That's your choice
kind of thing.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.610 align:middle line:10%
So I go, oh, yeah,
that's what makes humans

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:33.990 align:middle line:10%
different than lower animals.

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.270 align:middle line:10%
Lower animals are stimulus,
response, stimulus, response.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.200 align:middle line:10%
No thought.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.280 align:middle line:10%
The birds come to Capistrano.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:41.080 align:middle line:10%
When?

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.520 align:middle line:10%
On a day.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.730 align:middle line:10%
How do they know that day?

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:44.980 align:middle line:10%
Did they look at the calendar?

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.310 align:middle line:84%
I go, no, it's built into the
environmental information.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:51.280 align:middle line:84%
The turtles come out of
the eggs and they all

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.620 align:middle line:84%
come out on about,
essentially, the same day.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.942 align:middle line:90%
I go, wow, what a coincidence.

00:17:54.942 --> 00:17:55.900 align:middle line:90%
It's not a coincidence.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.780 align:middle line:10%
It's built into the environment.

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:00.130 align:middle line:10%
But it's not thinking.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.450 align:middle line:90%
It's not creative.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.660 align:middle line:84%
This is where we
distinguish ourselves above.

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:06.670 align:middle line:84%
So I say, well, I can
create Heaven on Earth.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:07.600 align:middle line:90%
I go, that's an idea.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:08.560 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty good.

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.370 align:middle line:10%
And using the conscious
mind, I can manifest it.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.580 align:middle line:10%
So I say, oh, according
to quantum physics,

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.800 align:middle line:10%
the most valid
science on the planet,

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.102 align:middle line:10%
consciousness is what is
creating our life experiences.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:25.060 align:middle line:10%
So I said, well, what if
I have a consciousness

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:10%
of Heaven on Earth?

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.720 align:middle line:10%
I go, well, then, you
manifest Heaven on Earth.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.962 align:middle line:84%
And then I go, well, this
is really good, because I

00:18:31.962 --> 00:18:32.920 align:middle line:90%
can create what I want.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:38.120 align:middle line:84%
I go, one small monkey wrench
that blows the whole thing.

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:90%
And I go, what is that?

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.850 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
indeed creative,

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.100 align:middle line:90%
but consciousness can think.

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:84%
And being creative, that
thinking, is really good.

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:50.820 align:middle line:84%
But then I say, if
consciousness is thinking, then

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:55.930 align:middle line:84%
where is the answer to whatever
I'm seeking going to come from?

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:10%
It's going to come
from my brain.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.630 align:middle line:10%
Consciousness is
reviewing, thinking,

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.350 align:middle line:10%
putting pictures together.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And I go, yeah, but
if I'm thinking,

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:10.917 align:middle line:84%
am I looking out at the world
or is my focus looking in?

00:19:10.917 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And I go, well, that's
the unfortunate part.

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:13.920 align:middle line:90%
Thought is on the inside.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.960 align:middle line:90%
So consciousness is redirected.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:84%
Instead of looking at the world
and adjusting my behavior,

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:90%
it's redirected.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:23.190 align:middle line:10%
And now I'm focusing on thought.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Wait.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:84%
Let's say I'm driving
a car down the street.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.670 align:middle line:84%
And if I'm thinking as I'm
driving, then all of a sudden,

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.942 align:middle line:84%
my consciousness is not going
to pay attention to the road.

00:19:34.942 --> 00:19:37.400 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, well, now,
we're in a serious problem.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:10%
I've got a car going 60 miles
an hour down the highway

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.790 align:middle line:10%
and my consciousness
is now looking inside.

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:90%
Who's driving the car?

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.840 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
crux of the problem.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:54.290 align:middle line:84%
The moment consciousness is
busy, subconscious is autopilot.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.550 align:middle line:90%
It knows how to walk.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.080 align:middle line:90%
It knows anything you learn.

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:58.040 align:middle line:90%
You drive the car.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.810 align:middle line:84%
You learned how
to drive the car.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:00.920 align:middle line:90%
Your job.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Once you learn it, you don't
have to think about it.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.240 align:middle line:90%
It's an automatic habit.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:90%
So basically, it says this.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.900 align:middle line:84%
You can create your life
with your conscious mind,

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:18.445 align:middle line:84%
but it turns out 95% of the day,
the conscious mind is thinking.

00:20:18.445 --> 00:20:19.570 align:middle line:90%
Oh, so what does that mean?

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:23.590 align:middle line:10%
I say, the 95% of the
day, your behavior

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:27.700 align:middle line:10%
is not controlled by the
creative wishes and desires.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.040 align:middle line:10%
It's now controlled by
the downloaded program

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.832 align:middle line:10%
that I got from somebody else.

00:20:31.832 --> 00:20:33.790 align:middle line:10%
And I go, what if those
are negative programs--

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:35.470 align:middle line:10%
which 70% are?

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:38.350 align:middle line:90%
I say, this is the problem.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:40.870 align:middle line:84%
Since consciousness is
not observing my behavior

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.500 align:middle line:84%
because it's inside
looking for thoughts, then

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.140 align:middle line:84%
whatever behavior is being
expressed at that moment,

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.690 align:middle line:84%
consciousness does
not observe it.

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.160 align:middle line:90%
It's inside.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.660 align:middle line:10%
So I say, well,
what does that mean?

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.600 align:middle line:10%
I say, well, if you
have a negative program,

00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.140 align:middle line:10%
you will manifest negative
behavior and you won't see it.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.580 align:middle line:90%
Everybody else will.

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.760 align:middle line:90%
So how many years now?

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.160 align:middle line:10%
30 some plus years I've
used this one story.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.120 align:middle line:10%
It's been repeated 1,000 times.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:13.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's so pivotal
to understanding

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to say it again.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.480 align:middle line:10%
And that is this.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.330 align:middle line:10%
You have a friend, and you
know your friend's behavior

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.650 align:middle line:10%
very well.

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:25.010 align:middle line:10%
And you happen to know
your friend's parent.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.650 align:middle line:10%
And one day, you see your friend
has the exact same behavior

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:10%
as their parent.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:32.480 align:middle line:10%
Well, of course,
you can't hold back.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.850 align:middle line:10%
Hey, Bill, you're
just like your dad.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.120 align:middle line:10%
Then I say, back away from
Bill, because the moment

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.400 align:middle line:10%
you say that, the first
thing Bill is going to say

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.970 align:middle line:10%
is, how can you
compare me to my dad?

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.250 align:middle line:10%
I'm nothing like my dad.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.500 align:middle line:10%
And everyone in the
audience laughs.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.208 align:middle line:10%
And I say, they laugh
because they understand.

00:21:51.208 --> 00:21:52.250 align:middle line:10%
I said, what do you mean?

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:56.640 align:middle line:10%
They all have seen somebody
deny their behavior.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.340 align:middle line:10%
And I go, why is it relevant?

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.290 align:middle line:10%
Because everybody else
can see the behavior

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:01.460 align:middle line:10%
that Bill is expressing.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.990 align:middle line:10%
Who's the one that can't see it?

00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.980 align:middle line:10%
Bill.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:04.910 align:middle line:10%
Why not?

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:07.740 align:middle line:10%
Because the reason he's
playing that behavior,

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.550 align:middle line:10%
he's not paying attention.

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.910 align:middle line:90%
So what's the point?

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:12.890 align:middle line:90%
The point is this.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:17.390 align:middle line:84%
95% of your life is not coming
from the wishes and desires

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.910 align:middle line:84%
of the creative mind,
which is busy thinking.

00:22:19.910 --> 00:22:21.465 align:middle line:84%
It's going to come
from the programs.

00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:84%
And I go, yeah, but
the programs mainly

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:23.990 align:middle line:90%
didn't even come from you.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.380 align:middle line:10%
They came from somebody else.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:27.770 align:middle line:10%
You downloaded somebody
else's behavior.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.140 align:middle line:10%
And if that behavior
doesn't support

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:32.970 align:middle line:10%
your program and
your wishes, too bad,

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:34.970 align:middle line:10%
because that's the program
that's going to play,

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.660 align:middle line:10%
whether you see it or not.

00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:10%
And this is why Bill cannot
see he's like his dad.

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:42.800 align:middle line:10%
And the most profound ending--

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.610 align:middle line:10%
sorry.

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:44.300 align:middle line:10%
Save it.

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Big drum roll.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:90%
Profound ending.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.390 align:middle line:90%
Is this.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.940 align:middle line:90%
We are all Bill.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.527 align:middle line:84%
Every one of us is
doing this every day.

00:22:53.527 --> 00:22:54.860 align:middle line:90%
And I go, what is the relevance?

00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.760 align:middle line:84%
And now, we put the
story into conclusion.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.560 align:middle line:90%
It's this.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.430 align:middle line:10%
Creative mind-- I want love, I
want health, I want happiness,

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.920 align:middle line:10%
I want a great job, I
want money, I want this.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.967 align:middle line:10%
I go, that's good creativity.

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.550 align:middle line:84%
I say, so, in the
morning, you wake up

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:10.340 align:middle line:84%
and you say, today,
I'm going to go

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.470 align:middle line:84%
get those things that my
creative mind has just

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:13.400 align:middle line:90%
thought of.

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:17.030 align:middle line:84%
And then you go out to
work and you come home

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:18.270 align:middle line:90%
at the end of the day.

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.410 align:middle line:90%
Guess what?

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:20.940 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:22.440 align:middle line:90%
Didn't happen today.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.000 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be successful.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.410 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to find a relationship.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.710 align:middle line:90%
It didn't happen.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And I was looking for it.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:33.430 align:middle line:10%
Explanation-- how
come I didn't find it?

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.880 align:middle line:84%
And the answer is,
well, it's not me.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm the one that
had the great vision

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.100 align:middle line:90%
of being happy and successful.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.530 align:middle line:10%
So it's not me.

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:45.660 align:middle line:84%
The universe is
not supporting me.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.700 align:middle line:10%
I'm a victim.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:50.190 align:middle line:84%
I'm a victim, because
if I was in power,

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:52.660 align:middle line:84%
I would have created
what I wanted.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.410 align:middle line:90%
And I got this crap instead.

00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:57.300 align:middle line:10%
I'm a victim.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:01.470 align:middle line:84%
I go, again, definition
of victim-- powerless.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:03.540 align:middle line:10%
It says, I have great
wishes and desires

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.760 align:middle line:10%
what I want on this
planet, but I'm powerless.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.560 align:middle line:10%
I'm a victim.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Why-- every day I went out to
get it, and every day I go home

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.550 align:middle line:90%
and it didn't get it.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:15.060 align:middle line:10%
I like to joke and say,
every day you go out there,

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.510 align:middle line:10%
and you are shooting yourself
in the foot with a gun,

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.730 align:middle line:10%
and you come home
limping, bloody foot,

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:25.920 align:middle line:10%
and you are contemplating, who
the hell shot me in the foot?

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.560 align:middle line:84%
And you don't even realize
the smoking gun is still

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.880 align:middle line:90%
in your hand.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.950 align:middle line:84%
You've been shooting
yourself in the foot all day

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.540 align:middle line:84%
because you've been
engaging programs

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:35.290 align:middle line:84%
that you haven't been
paying attention to,

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and these programs
undermined your life.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:42.553 align:middle line:84%
And so all of a sudden, we
buy the belief of victim.

00:24:42.553 --> 00:24:43.720 align:middle line:90%
I go, so why is it relevant?

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.800 align:middle line:84%
Because if my life
is not working out,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.750 align:middle line:90%
it had nothing to do with me.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:90%
I wanted to be successful.

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:51.250 align:middle line:84%
So then how come
it didn't work out?

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:53.500 align:middle line:90%
I'm a victim.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.040 align:middle line:10%
And I say, end of line,
because the moment

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:10%
you acknowledge you're a
victim, whether it's to genetics

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:04.410 align:middle line:10%
or whatever you want, you're
acknowledging I have no power.

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:09.450 align:middle line:10%
And we program the
population to have no power.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:12.780 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's kind of
interesting that some people

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.930 align:middle line:10%
have a lot of power and
other people have no power.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.210 align:middle line:10%
And here's an exciting fact.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:21.900 align:middle line:10%
We're all equally powerful.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:10%
Well, then how come there
are people that are powerful

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.980 align:middle line:10%
and I'm down here?

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is simply this.

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.330 align:middle line:84%
You have been programmed
not to have power,

00:25:33.330 --> 00:25:35.610 align:middle line:84%
because if I take
away your power,

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:38.340 align:middle line:90%
I have the power and you don't.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.950 align:middle line:10%
So you start out everybody
equally powerful,

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:44.130 align:middle line:10%
then you buy teachings, and
the teachings disempower you

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:48.100 align:middle line:10%
every day, and the teacher is
getting more powerful every day.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:52.360 align:middle line:10%
Whether it's
religion or medicine,

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:57.010 align:middle line:10%
we give up power and then
say that those people--

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:58.930 align:middle line:10%
the doctor, the priest--

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.087 align:middle line:10%
they're the powerful ones.

00:26:00.087 --> 00:26:01.420 align:middle line:10%
Listen to what they have to say.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:03.460 align:middle line:10%
And then you listen to what they
have to say and almost all of it

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:10%
is, like, I'm sorry.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.880 align:middle line:10%
Your prognosis in this
life is not so good.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And you go, oh,
I'm a victim again.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:14.880 align:middle line:10%
And I love it because we go
back to the movie "The Matrix."

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.410 align:middle line:10%
Yep, everybody got programmed.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.450 align:middle line:10%
But I said, what was
unique about the story?

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:22.500 align:middle line:84%
Here's a red pill and
here's a blue pill.

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.250 align:middle line:10%
Take the blue pill,
wake up tomorrow, life

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:10%
is exactly the same way
that it's always been.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:34.380 align:middle line:84%
Take the red pill and you
get out of the program.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And I go, what would
be the consequence

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:40.510 align:middle line:90%
of getting out of that program?

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:43.510 align:middle line:84%
And now, science has
revealed the answer.

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.043 align:middle line:10%
When people fall in love--

00:26:45.043 --> 00:26:46.960 align:middle line:10%
and it doesn't have to
be with another person,

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.730 align:middle line:10%
but I use that in the model.

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.800 align:middle line:10%
I can be in love with cooking--

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.180 align:middle line:10%
a chef.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.620 align:middle line:10%
I can be in love with gardening.

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:56.050 align:middle line:10%
I can be in love
with being an artist.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:26:57.790 align:middle line:10%
I say, what is the relevance?

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:03.800 align:middle line:10%
When you're in love and doing
something, you're not thinking.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.600 align:middle line:10%
You're being present.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:10%
You just met this person after
30 years looking for somebody.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.720 align:middle line:10%
They're standing right
in front of your face.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.750 align:middle line:10%
Is this the time to let go of
reality and go inside and think?

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.070 align:middle line:10%
The answer is, obviously not.

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:18.320 align:middle line:10%
This is the time to-- oh,
my god, this person is here.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.920 align:middle line:10%
Let's have a good time.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.860 align:middle line:10%
And to get what--

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:27.800 align:middle line:10%
in 24 hours, the blah, blah,
blah of 30 years disappears.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.640 align:middle line:10%
24 hours later,
oh, I'm so in love.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.885 align:middle line:10%
Life is so beautiful.

00:27:32.885 --> 00:27:34.910 align:middle line:10%
You know the food is better?

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:36.230 align:middle line:10%
The music's great.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:40.030 align:middle line:10%
Even that crappy job
isn't so crappy anymore.

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:43.250 align:middle line:10%
I go, wait, 24-hour
transformation from hell

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.420 align:middle line:10%
on Earth to Heaven on Harth?

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.440 align:middle line:10%
You stopped playing
the program, and that's

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.160 align:middle line:10%
when you took over creativity
and you created what?

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.620 align:middle line:10%
Heaven on Earth was what
you were looking for.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.020 align:middle line:10%
So I say, are you powerful?

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.130 align:middle line:10%
I say, absolutely.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.830 align:middle line:10%
The moment you let
go of the program,

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.280 align:middle line:10%
you can exercise creative mind.

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:10%
That will be the guide that
determines my behavior, my life

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:10%
experiences, and
my consequences.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.630 align:middle line:10%
But when I'm thinking,
I let all that go

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.260 align:middle line:10%
and I just play the program.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.140 align:middle line:10%
And as mentioned up to
70% of those programs

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.510 align:middle line:10%
are going to be disempowering
and self-sabotaging.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:26.060 align:middle line:10%
And that's why people are
struggling all over the place,

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.190 align:middle line:10%
because we continue
the programming.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.290 align:middle line:10%
Genes control your
life, not you.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:31.490 align:middle line:10%
God controls your life.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:32.865 align:middle line:10%
You have nothing
to do with that.

00:28:32.865 --> 00:28:36.320 align:middle line:84%
But I'm in the middle here,
wearing my black suit.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.570 align:middle line:90%
I will connect you with God.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:40.620 align:middle line:10%
And then I go--

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.920 align:middle line:10%
and when that control
ended, guess what?

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.970 align:middle line:10%
The new control came in.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:47.480 align:middle line:10%
The guy in the
white suit says, I'm

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.700 align:middle line:10%
between your health
and your life.

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.360 align:middle line:10%
You need me.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.620 align:middle line:10%
And so we traded the white
and the black back and forth.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.910 align:middle line:10%
And it was like, both
those entities, they

00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:04.470 align:middle line:10%
thrive by you not
acknowledging your power,

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:05.970 align:middle line:10%
because if you don't
have power, you

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:09.630 align:middle line:10%
will buy whatever those
individuals have told you

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:11.640 align:middle line:10%
because I am the victim.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.510 align:middle line:10%
And this is time for an
end, because the programs

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:21.750 align:middle line:10%
we have been programmed with are
so self-destructive of not just

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:10%
the individual, but of
nature, that we are now

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:30.060 align:middle line:10%
trapped in a corner facing
our own extinction called

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:32.760 align:middle line:10%
the sixth mass
extinction of life.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:36.570 align:middle line:10%
Five times, life thriving on
this planet, and some event

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.610 align:middle line:10%
came and essentially
wiped out most of life.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:10%
The last time, 66
million years ago,

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:45.750 align:middle line:10%
thriving, lush, tropical
forests, jungles and everything,

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:48.630 align:middle line:10%
dinosaurs all over the place.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.510 align:middle line:10%
A comet hits the
Yucatan Peninsula,

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:55.710 align:middle line:10%
upends the environment because
of the impact on the planet.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.810 align:middle line:10%
90% of life gets wiped out.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:00.220 align:middle line:10%
The dinosaurs disappear,
the whole thing.

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.870 align:middle line:10%
And then it starts up again.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:05.160 align:middle line:10%
Well, that was the
fifth time that it ended

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.990 align:middle line:10%
and then it had to restart.

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:10.830 align:middle line:84%
And science today has revealed
the most important fact,

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and that is we're in the
sixth mass extinction.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.660 align:middle line:10%
We're losing
species of organisms

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.520 align:middle line:10%
faster than we've
ever lost them before.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.400 align:middle line:84%
I go, the planet is
having a problem?

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.660 align:middle line:90%
I go, no.

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:27.820 align:middle line:10%
Human behavior is now
attributed as the cause,

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.240 align:middle line:10%
because human behavior
is undermining nature.

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.310 align:middle line:10%
Thinking that
we're so damn smart

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.550 align:middle line:10%
and we can tell nature
what to do, and it's like,

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.690 align:middle line:10%
it doesn't work that way.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:84%
And one of the illustrations
that I would just

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.570 align:middle line:84%
love for people to
see how visually it is

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.450 align:middle line:84%
is Walt Disney's movie
called "Fantasia."

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:51.640 align:middle line:10%
The story is, Mickey
Mouse is helping a master.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.660 align:middle line:84%
And the master has the book
of all those spells, potions,

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.800 align:middle line:90%
and things like that.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.030 align:middle line:90%
The master leaves.

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:02.350 align:middle line:10%
And Mickey has a little bit of
knowledge and looks at the book

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:05.350 align:middle line:10%
and says, oh, I
can control my jobs

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.390 align:middle line:10%
with-- like in today's world.

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.910 align:middle line:10%
Hey, people, we'll make
machines do your jobs.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:13.960 align:middle line:10%
Well, he said,
oh, this one broom

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:20.050 align:middle line:10%
that I can have it carry water
and fill up the water tank.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.660 align:middle line:10%
So he goes-- he
learned the magic,

00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.820 align:middle line:10%
how to make the
broom carry the water

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.930 align:middle line:10%
and put it into the water tank.

00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.420 align:middle line:10%
And he falls asleep.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.490 align:middle line:10%
And what happened was, the
broom kept filling up the water,

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.290 align:middle line:10%
filling it up.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:34.665 align:middle line:10%
And there was a point where
the water is now overflowing.

00:31:34.665 --> 00:31:36.160 align:middle line:10%
Now, the water is
all over the lab.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.840 align:middle line:10%
And he wakes up in shock.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.550 align:middle line:10%
He's like, oh, my god, the
thing is flooded in here.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.040 align:middle line:10%
So what does he want to do?

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.090 align:middle line:10%
Wants to stop the broom.

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.965 align:middle line:10%
Well, he never learned
how to stop the broom.

00:31:44.965 --> 00:31:46.660 align:middle line:10%
So he gets an axe,
hits the broom,

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.160 align:middle line:10%
but breaks it, now,
into two brooms.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.780 align:middle line:10%
So now there are two
brooms carrying water,

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.905 align:middle line:10%
and then another hit, and
then there's more brooms.

00:31:51.905 --> 00:31:55.460 align:middle line:10%
And at some point, it's way
the hell out of control.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.970 align:middle line:10%
And then at the very
end, the master comes in,

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:03.710 align:middle line:10%
sees this big mess
completes his magic

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:06.110 align:middle line:10%
as he knows, stops the mess.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:09.890 align:middle line:10%
And somewhere along the line,
the narrator said, it's like,

00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:14.360 align:middle line:10%
what happens with a little bit
of knowledge is very dangerous.

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.640 align:middle line:10%
And Mickey's little
bit of knowledge

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.300 align:middle line:10%
allowed him to get the
brooms, the technology,

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:24.450 align:middle line:10%
to carry the water, but not
enough knowledge to control it.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:27.230 align:middle line:10%
And I go-- coincidence.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.990 align:middle line:10%
Science today is
Mickey Mousing around

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.690 align:middle line:10%
with our biology with not
enough conventional knowledge

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.103 align:middle line:10%
to understand what
they're doing.

00:32:34.103 --> 00:32:35.520 align:middle line:10%
And I go, well,
what's the result?

00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:38.870 align:middle line:84%
And I say, planet is
engulfed with health crisis--

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:40.040 align:middle line:90%
every country.

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.540 align:middle line:90%
People are sick.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Cancer goes up.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:45.840 align:middle line:10%
Cardiovascular disease,
Alzheimer's, diabetes,

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.470 align:middle line:10%
all on the rise in a world
where massive amounts of money

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:50.270 align:middle line:10%
are put into that.

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.478 align:middle line:90%
And I go, what's the problem.

00:32:51.478 --> 00:32:54.730 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, you're investing
in the wrong mechanism?

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.070 align:middle line:84%
Health isn't coming from
that pharmaceutical pill.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.110 align:middle line:84%
Health is coming from
the consciousness.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:02.260 align:middle line:10%
If you give up and say the
pharmaceutical pill did it,

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:05.560 align:middle line:10%
you believe in the pill, well,
that's the placebo effect.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.700 align:middle line:10%
Oh, the pill healed me.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.700 align:middle line:10%
No, it was a sugar pill.

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.590 align:middle line:10%
Oh.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:12.730 align:middle line:10%
Your belief in the
pill healed you.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.780 align:middle line:10%
>> So they need to
change the cards.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:15.580 align:middle line:10%
>> No!

00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:16.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:17.650 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:18.845 align:middle line:90%
>> This is scene 2, take 2.

00:33:18.845 --> 00:33:19.645 align:middle line:90%
Marker.

00:33:19.645 --> 00:33:27.180 align:middle line:90%


00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.050 align:middle line:90%
>> So-- we're set?

00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:29.850 align:middle line:10%
OK.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:32.950 align:middle line:90%


00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk a little
bit about the history.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:38.770 align:middle line:10%
You've brought up
frontier science

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.900 align:middle line:10%
and conventional science.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.790 align:middle line:10%
You've brought up
Darwin, Newton.

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:46.590 align:middle line:90%


00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:51.250 align:middle line:84%
I would love for people to
get a grasp on where science

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:56.720 align:middle line:84%
used to be, where it
is today, maybe how

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.860 align:middle line:90%
it came to be that way.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.320 align:middle line:90%
What kind of got in the way?

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.300 align:middle line:84%
Because it seems
like it's really

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.910 align:middle line:90%
steered our belief system.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:04.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:34:04.710 --> 00:34:06.990 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.790 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:08.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:11.060 align:middle line:84%
I can do question by question,
or you can take it away.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, probably just
try and take it away.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.389 align:middle line:90%


00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:18.070 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:21.920 align:middle line:10%
The idea that knowledge is
power is not a new concept.

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:27.010 align:middle line:10%
That's been in human
history for millennia.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:31.630 align:middle line:84%
And the significance
is that science came in

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:34.520 align:middle line:84%
to understand the nature
of how life works.

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:37.239 align:middle line:10%
But when science came
back in the 1500s--

00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:40.780 align:middle line:10%
and 1543 is actually the date
of what we call the Scientific

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:45.699 align:middle line:10%
Revolution, because that's
the day that Copernicus died.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:47.590 align:middle line:10%
And you go, who's Copernicus?

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:51.370 align:middle line:10%
I go, at the time,
what was happening

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:55.810 align:middle line:10%
was that the Church
was losing its flock.

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:59.320 align:middle line:10%
They were going out because they
sort of lost interest in it.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.470 align:middle line:10%
And Martin Luther
was also involved,

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:06.010 align:middle line:10%
giving other people ideas
other than what was coming

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:07.580 align:middle line:10%
the dogma from the Church.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.760 align:middle line:10%
And the Church started
losing attendance

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:12.010 align:middle line:10%
in this period of
the Reformation.

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:13.840 align:middle line:84%
But they had a
mission statement.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.740 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to bring
the people back in.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:17.540 align:middle line:10%
And so they thought
to themselves, well,

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.640 align:middle line:10%
people show up at
the church when?

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.780 align:middle line:90%
Holidays.

00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Holidays, festivals.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:23.780 align:middle line:90%
That's when they show up.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:28.020 align:middle line:10%
But the problem was, in
the calendar at the time,

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:30.440 align:middle line:10%
there are two versions of dates.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.950 align:middle line:10%
One is called sidereal,
which means every year,

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:36.230 align:middle line:10%
on the same day,
same thing happens.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:42.890 align:middle line:10%
Christmas-- every year, December
25, for a couple thousand years.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.650 align:middle line:10%
But other events are
linked to the moon

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:48.450 align:middle line:10%
cycle, which is 28 days.

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:49.400 align:middle line:10%
So why is it relevant?

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.170 align:middle line:10%
Because 28 days doesn't
go into 365 evenly.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:59.060 align:middle line:84%
So all of a sudden, it says then
the two calendars of an event

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.970 align:middle line:84%
based on the moon
cycle does not line up

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:05.100 align:middle line:84%
with events based
on the solar cycle.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:10.550 align:middle line:84%
So they were lost because
Easter versus Christmas is not

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.350 align:middle line:90%
on the same day every year.

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:15.140 align:middle line:10%
And the Church wanted to
coordinate its activities,

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.800 align:middle line:10%
had to say, well, how will we
know what day Easter is on?

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.080 align:middle line:90%
Well, they didn't know.

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:24.470 align:middle line:10%
And they entertained
the idea of, well,

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:26.210 align:middle line:10%
maybe this guy
Copernicus, who was

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:29.630 align:middle line:10%
a priest, but also an
astronomer and a medical doctor,

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:30.570 align:middle line:10%
would help them.

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:33.950 align:middle line:10%
So they went to Copernicus and
said, we have this problem.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:36.350 align:middle line:84%
We want to coordinate the
dates of the festivals,

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.360 align:middle line:90%
but they don't line up.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.360 align:middle line:10%
So Copernicus goes
back to his lab.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.450 align:middle line:10%
And the first thing is this.

00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:46.700 align:middle line:10%
At that time, the
Bible was the provider

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.680 align:middle line:10%
of truth, the purveyor of truth.

00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.320 align:middle line:10%
And in the Bible, it
said that the Earth is

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.240 align:middle line:10%
the center of God's universe.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:57.470 align:middle line:10%
So he figured, well, if I
study the planets moving

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:02.720 align:middle line:10%
around the Earth, I'll
be able to get the dates.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:05.540 align:middle line:10%
He was never able to do that,
putting the Earth in a center

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.570 align:middle line:10%
and having everything,
including the sun, go around.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.800 align:middle line:10%
But he went back to--

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.750 align:middle line:10%
I think it was Ptolemy
in ancient Egypt

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:14.450 align:middle line:10%
who came up with the idea
that the sun was the center

00:37:14.450 --> 00:37:17.240 align:middle line:10%
and that the Earth
revolves around the sun.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.520 align:middle line:10%
And he said he said, well,
let me try that data.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.020 align:middle line:10%
He puts the data,
and lo and behold,

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.460 align:middle line:10%
he's able to accurately
predict Easter and Christmas

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:30.020 align:middle line:10%
because he's incorporated, now,
the moon cycle and the sun cycle

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:31.310 align:middle line:10%
and puts it together.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:34.220 align:middle line:10%
So he goes back to the
leaders of the Church

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:35.480 align:middle line:10%
and he says, I got it.

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.120 align:middle line:10%
And they say, OK,
Copernicus, tell us.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.180 align:middle line:10%
What happened?

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.000 align:middle line:10%
He says, see how I did this?

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.860 align:middle line:10%
You got all the
dates right here.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:45.630 align:middle line:10%
And they said, but
how did you do that?

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:48.410 align:middle line:10%
And this is where Copernicus
comes in and goes,

00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.930 align:middle line:10%
I had to make one slight change.

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:50.730 align:middle line:10%
And they go, what?

00:37:50.730 --> 00:37:53.300 align:middle line:10%
They said, well, the Earth is
not the center of the universe

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.500 align:middle line:10%
as it says in the Bible.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.730 align:middle line:10%
The sun would be the center.

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:57.620 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
all the priests

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.510 align:middle line:84%
were like, oh, my
god, heresy, heresy!

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:03.180 align:middle line:10%
But then the result was, he
was able to do the prediction.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.630 align:middle line:10%
So now, the Church is in a bind.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:08.870 align:middle line:10%
He's they're able to use his
data, but they use his data,

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:11.270 align:middle line:10%
it compromises the Bible.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:13.670 align:middle line:10%
So they made a deal.

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:16.550 align:middle line:10%
Copernicus, don't ever tell
anybody how you got this data

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:19.820 align:middle line:10%
and we'll let you stay alive,
because otherwise, you'd

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:22.550 align:middle line:10%
be a heretic and we'd have
to burn you at the stake.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:27.470 align:middle line:10%
So here's Copernicus with
a secret that completely

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:32.690 align:middle line:10%
undoes the idea of the Church
and their power of knowledge--

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.100 align:middle line:10%
infallible knowledge.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.000 align:middle line:10%
Well, it's kind
of fallible here.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.240 align:middle line:10%
And once you open
up that thing, it's

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.608 align:middle line:10%
like opening up Pandora's box.

00:38:39.608 --> 00:38:41.900 align:middle line:10%
Everybody will start to look,
where else is infallible?

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.680 align:middle line:10%
So they ensured that
Copernicus would never

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:49.610 align:middle line:10%
tell anybody how he got the
results because it was heresy.

00:38:49.610 --> 00:38:51.290 align:middle line:10%
And here's a guy.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:54.290 align:middle line:10%
Imagine you had this secret that
could change the entire world

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:57.590 align:middle line:10%
and you can't talk about it
because they'll kill you.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.040 align:middle line:90%
So what does he do?

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.620 align:middle line:90%
He waits and he waits.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:05.410 align:middle line:10%
And on his deathbed,
he releases a book.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.380 align:middle line:10%
Here, the science
is in the book.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to die.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.570 align:middle line:90%
You can't use me as your excuse.

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.790 align:middle line:84%
You're going to be
left with the book.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:19.840 align:middle line:10%
And he died in
1543 on that date.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.220 align:middle line:10%
And his death is marked as
the foundation or the birth

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.260 align:middle line:10%
of the modern
Scientific Revolution,

00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.940 align:middle line:10%
because basically, he
said to the Church, well,

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:29.910 align:middle line:10%
your Bible is wrong.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:30.910 align:middle line:10%
Here's the right answer.

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.990 align:middle line:10%
You can't kill me.

00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.920 align:middle line:10%
I'm gone.

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.110 align:middle line:10%
Deal with the answer.

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:38.560 align:middle line:10%
And that's one of the
things that broke the power

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.090 align:middle line:10%
structure of the Church.

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.660 align:middle line:10%
And they didn't kill him
because he died naturally.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:48.910 align:middle line:10%
But it's interesting-- one of
his followers not that long

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:49.928 align:middle line:10%
after, Bruno--

00:39:49.928 --> 00:39:51.220 align:middle line:10%
I can't remember his last name.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:56.140 align:middle line:10%
Bruno, a priest, started
teaching Copernicus' stuff.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.430 align:middle line:10%
Now, the church wasn't
going to tolerate it now.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:02.123 align:middle line:10%
So what they did is they
took Bruno Giordano,

00:40:02.123 --> 00:40:03.290 align:middle line:10%
I think something like that.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:07.550 align:middle line:10%
They took him, stripped him of
his clothes, tied him to a log,

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:11.690 align:middle line:10%
carried him through town, and
then burned him at the stake.

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:12.890 align:middle line:10%
For what?

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:15.860 align:middle line:10%
For repeating the
words of Copernicus.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:17.990 align:middle line:10%
And then it goes
well, then, guess who

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:19.760 align:middle line:10%
was the next guy who did that?

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.500 align:middle line:10%
Galileo.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:23.180 align:middle line:10%
And they couldn't kill Galileo.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:27.920 align:middle line:10%
He was wholly recognized as an
important person in the world.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.570 align:middle line:84%
They couldn't kill
him, so they just

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:33.180 align:middle line:84%
put him under house arrest
for the rest of his life

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.060 align:middle line:90%
so he couldn't leave his house.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.420 align:middle line:10%
And that's how they
punished Galileo

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.645 align:middle line:10%
for Copernicus and stuff.

00:40:41.645 --> 00:40:43.020 align:middle line:10%
And so essentially,
what they did

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.150 align:middle line:10%
was just push everything
down that suggested

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:47.610 align:middle line:10%
that they might be wrong.

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:50.520 align:middle line:10%
But then Darwin comes
along at some point

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:54.130 align:middle line:10%
and challenges the whole
foundation of Genesis.

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:55.690 align:middle line:10%
And at that moment--

00:40:55.690 --> 00:41:00.120 align:middle line:10%
because people were quite aware.

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.750 align:middle line:10%
No computers and things to
play in your mind other than,

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.090 align:middle line:10%
what did they use for
entertainment in those days?

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:10.350 align:middle line:10%
A lot of it was breeding
animals and plants.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:13.370 align:middle line:10%
So people like Darwin
raised pigeons.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.920 align:middle line:10%
People raised other
animals and other plants.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:17.180 align:middle line:10%
And what did they know?

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:22.100 align:middle line:10%
Just as Darwin said, you
mate two parents together,

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:24.960 align:middle line:10%
they mate, the
offspring comes out.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.050 align:middle line:10%
Let's say a litter
of six puppies.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.000 align:middle line:10%
Five of them are
healthy puppies.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:30.980 align:middle line:10%
One is a runt of the litter.

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:35.797 align:middle line:10%
And the story goes is, well,
what if you took the runts

00:41:35.797 --> 00:41:37.130 align:middle line:10%
and made it in with other runts?

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:39.080 align:middle line:10%
You get a lineage of runts.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.510 align:middle line:10%
Well, the whole idea
is, they took that idea

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:45.440 align:middle line:10%
and said that the runt lineage
will lead to a new species.

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.680 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden,
everybody's familiarity

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.840 align:middle line:10%
with breeding plants
and animals totally

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:53.930 align:middle line:10%
made sense with that
description that Darwin offered.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:59.340 align:middle line:10%
Instead of the idea of a magical
seven days of manifestation,

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.900 align:middle line:10%
it was like, oh, it's breeding,
alterations of genetics,

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.980 align:middle line:10%
which they didn't
know about, heredity.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.970 align:middle line:10%
But it was alterations
that gave rise

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:12.190 align:middle line:10%
to this whole ecosphere of
all these different organisms.

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:14.700 align:middle line:10%
So that's when the
Church lost the power,

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:19.440 align:middle line:10%
because the public at that point
said, no, Genesis, probably not.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Breeding of animals
and plants, we've

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.900 align:middle line:90%
seen that and seen it work.

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.930 align:middle line:10%
So the Church lost its power.

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:27.540 align:middle line:10%
Science took over
because people no longer

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.090 align:middle line:10%
trusted the so-called
truth of the Church.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:36.010 align:middle line:10%
But now, today, still,
we take science as truth.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.280 align:middle line:10%
Unfortunately, in today's
political situation,

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.570 align:middle line:10%
even science is getting
knocked as not being right

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:46.460 align:middle line:10%
for the benefit of some
people to take power.

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:50.960 align:middle line:10%
And yet, no, science
is pretty darn correct

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:53.720 align:middle line:10%
if you don't have a bias.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:59.300 align:middle line:10%
Science is not supposed to have
a bias, but money makes bias.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.660 align:middle line:10%
And we're being
given information

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:06.940 align:middle line:10%
that's not scientifically
accurate anymore to give power

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:09.565 align:middle line:10%
to other entities, such as
the pharmaceutical industry.

00:43:09.565 --> 00:43:12.090 align:middle line:10%


00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.810 align:middle line:10%
I don't think I even
answered your question.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:15.620 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, you did.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.020 align:middle line:10%
You went into--

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:17.603 align:middle line:10%
>> Anybody know what
the question was?

00:43:17.603 --> 00:43:19.130 align:middle line:10%
No?

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.860 align:middle line:10%
OK, there was something there.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:25.460 align:middle line:10%
>> You have said that quantum
physics is the most valid

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.700 align:middle line:10%
science on the planet.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.500 align:middle line:10%
>> What is it?

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.520 align:middle line:10%
>> Quantum physics, you said--

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Is the most valid science.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.580 align:middle line:84%
>> --is the most valid
science on the planet.

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:36.480 align:middle line:84%
>> And you can argue against
people saying that it is not

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.280 align:middle line:90%
valid.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.980 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.630 align:middle line:90%
Besides Trump, who said that?

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:45.290 align:middle line:90%


00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.350 align:middle line:84%
No, unfortunately, in
the world of science,

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:51.770 align:middle line:84%
it's very, very clear,
understanding that quantum

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:57.380 align:middle line:84%
physics, not just an
idea, but validated year

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:02.000 align:middle line:84%
after year, all the observations
and the prognostications

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.240 align:middle line:84%
have been validated
beyond any other science.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.700 align:middle line:10%
So basically comes down
to an interesting part.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:09.740 align:middle line:10%
If I'm going to
question a science,

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.440 align:middle line:10%
the last quiet type of
science I would question

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:13.370 align:middle line:10%
would be physics--

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.710 align:middle line:10%
quantum physics--
because it is now

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:17.960 align:middle line:10%
so truthful compared
to every other science

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.760 align:middle line:10%
that the other ones
don't even match up.

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.550 align:middle line:10%
So quantum physics
changes the whole game,

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.240 align:middle line:10%
because Newtonian physics
separated the universe

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:28.520 align:middle line:10%
into matter and energy.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:35.090 align:middle line:84%
And in the process, this is
how Newton avoided the Church.

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:38.900 align:middle line:10%
Allowed him to do research and
avoided the power of the Church

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.040 align:middle line:10%
at that time by what?

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.470 align:middle line:90%
He said, matter and energy.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:44.750 align:middle line:84%
The body is made out
of matter and it only

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.190 align:middle line:90%
is affected by matter.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.630 align:middle line:90%
Energy is a different realm.

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.030 align:middle line:90%
And that's the invisible realm.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:55.910 align:middle line:10%
So he divided the universe
into physics and metaphysics.

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:59.750 align:middle line:10%
Physics, the mechanical
reality of what we do, physics.

00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.510 align:middle line:10%
Metaphysics is the
invisible energy

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:04.790 align:middle line:10%
that they had no recognition
of, but they said

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:06.500 align:middle line:10%
the Church has the metaphysics.

00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:08.930 align:middle line:10%
Church has the idea
of spirituality.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.850 align:middle line:10%
There was no connection
of spirituality.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:14.070 align:middle line:10%
According to Newton, you
could understand the universe

00:45:14.070 --> 00:45:17.800 align:middle line:10%
without invoking any
invisible forces,

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.960 align:middle line:10%
because when he understood
the nature of how

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.250 align:middle line:10%
the planets moved--

00:45:21.250 --> 00:45:25.150 align:middle line:10%
and most people are so
unaware of, well, yeah,

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.020 align:middle line:10%
Newtonian physics came from.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:30.490 align:middle line:10%
It is like, he first
had to create calculus.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:31.570 align:middle line:10%
And nobody mentions that.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:33.778 align:middle line:10%
It's like, well, that's not
a little-- like, oh, hey,

00:45:33.778 --> 00:45:35.070 align:middle line:10%
on Monday, I created calculus.

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:36.880 align:middle line:10%
I go, calculus?

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.060 align:middle line:10%
He had to create that because
it's the mathematics of moving

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.390 align:middle line:10%
things.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:44.320 align:middle line:10%
And so he created
calculus equations,

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.420 align:middle line:10%
put the data about
the solar system--

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:49.330 align:middle line:10%
physical data, size of a
planet, mass of the planet,

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:52.960 align:middle line:10%
the speed of the planet,
the vector of the orbit,

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.030 align:middle line:10%
put that data in,
solved the equation,

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:58.720 align:middle line:10%
and predicts the movement of
the planets in the solar system.

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.880 align:middle line:10%
Relevance is very
clear for science.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:03.190 align:middle line:10%
Science is based on prediction.

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:06.040 align:middle line:10%
If I can tell you what's
going to happen in the future

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.680 align:middle line:10%
and it does, then
somewhere along the line,

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:10.420 align:middle line:10%
I have some insight
into, there's

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:13.390 align:middle line:10%
a mechanism, and understanding
that mechanism gives you

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:17.840 align:middle line:10%
that result. So science is
predicated on prediction.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.230 align:middle line:10%
Newton's science, he predicted
the movements of the universe

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:26.510 align:middle line:10%
without God, spirit,
or invisible forces.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:27.980 align:middle line:10%
And I say, what's the result?

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:30.080 align:middle line:10%
Well, Newton's understanding
of the material world

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.840 align:middle line:10%
is you don't need to invoke
invisible things like spirit.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.120 align:middle line:84%
You could just study
the physical plane.

00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:36.890 align:middle line:10%
So he said, OK,
science, we're going

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:38.090 align:middle line:10%
to study the physical
plane, but we're

00:46:38.090 --> 00:46:39.715 align:middle line:10%
going to leave all
that spiritual stuff

00:46:39.715 --> 00:46:40.880 align:middle line:10%
to you, the Church.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:43.740 align:middle line:10%
And that allowed science
to operate independently

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:44.540 align:middle line:10%
of the Church.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:47.410 align:middle line:10%
But it made a schism
in the universe.

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:50.060 align:middle line:10%
Said it's made out of two
things, matter and energy.

00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:53.240 align:middle line:10%
And atoms were supposed to be
the smallest part of matter.

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.790 align:middle line:10%
And by 1895, they started
to find, wait, there's

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:57.230 align:middle line:10%
smaller things in the atom.

00:46:57.230 --> 00:47:00.200 align:middle line:10%
There's a nucleus, the
electrons and protons.

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:06.530 align:middle line:10%
And by 1927, which is the actual
date of quantum physics becoming

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:13.070 align:middle line:10%
"the" science,
people started to see

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:15.752 align:middle line:10%
there was something even
smaller inside the atom.

00:47:15.752 --> 00:47:17.210 align:middle line:10%
And now, what are
we talking about?

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:20.100 align:middle line:10%
Things like quarks and
photons and stuff like that.

00:47:20.100 --> 00:47:21.440 align:middle line:10%
And I go, what's relevant?

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.350 align:middle line:10%
Well, we attribute protons,
neutrons, electrons

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.180 align:middle line:10%
to being physical particles.

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.830 align:middle line:10%
They're made out of
invisible energy.

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:30.890 align:middle line:90%
So wait a minute.

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:32.490 align:middle line:90%
Everything comes from energy.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:34.370 align:middle line:10%
The source is energy.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:37.250 align:middle line:10%
Quantum physics
recognizes this changes

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:39.890 align:middle line:10%
the duality of the
universe, matter and energy,

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.090 align:middle line:10%
into a singularity.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:43.430 align:middle line:10%
It's all energy.

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:45.620 align:middle line:10%
Everything is energy.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:49.400 align:middle line:10%
And this is why quantum
physics is important in regard

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:50.810 align:middle line:10%
to its emphasis.

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:53.240 align:middle line:10%
And I go, so why
is this relevant?

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.820 align:middle line:10%
I'll give a quote
from Albert Einstein.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.808 align:middle line:10%
We talk about the energy
around us as being a field.

00:47:59.808 --> 00:48:01.100 align:middle line:10%
We're all in a field right now.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:04.070 align:middle line:10%
I mean, as I'm sitting here,
television broadcasts, cell

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:06.960 align:middle line:10%
phone broadcasts, solar
energy, it's all happening,

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.760 align:middle line:10%
invisible fields.

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.800 align:middle line:10%
I'm in it.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.900 align:middle line:10%
Now, here's the quote.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.300 align:middle line:10%
If you get it, it's
like, the world changes.

00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.070 align:middle line:10%
From Einstein.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:23.450 align:middle line:10%
"The field is the soul
governing agency of matter."

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:27.790 align:middle line:10%
So that matter as we see it
didn't just come by itself.

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:30.520 align:middle line:84%
It came from a field
shaping matter.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.470 align:middle line:90%
Give very simple explanation.

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:35.540 align:middle line:10%
I take a piece of iron,
I file, I file it down.

00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.900 align:middle line:10%
Get a pile of iron dust,
called iron filings.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.640 align:middle line:10%
Put it in a salt shaker.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.540 align:middle line:10%
Piece of paper.

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:42.260 align:middle line:10%
Sprinkle the iron
filings on the paper.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.060 align:middle line:10%
And guess what?

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.940 align:middle line:10%
I get a random pile of iron
filings every time I do it.

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.440 align:middle line:10%
Random pile.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.440 align:middle line:10%
And I say, oh, before
you do it next time,

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:53.590 align:middle line:10%
put a magnet underneath
the piece of paper.

00:48:53.590 --> 00:48:54.650 align:middle line:10%
I say, why?

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:57.130 align:middle line:10%
Because a magnet has
an invisible energy

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:59.240 align:middle line:10%
field, the magnetic field.

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:00.040 align:middle line:10%
I say, so what?

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:01.210 align:middle line:10%
I put the magnet
under the paper.

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:02.377 align:middle line:10%
I sprinkle the iron filings.

00:49:02.377 --> 00:49:05.260 align:middle line:10%
And now, it's not
a random pattern.

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:07.990 align:middle line:10%
Now, it's the beautiful,
elaborate pattern

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:09.790 align:middle line:10%
of an electromagnetic field.

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.530 align:middle line:10%
The particles show
the whole field.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:13.780 align:middle line:10%
And so there's a structure.

00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.180 align:middle line:10%
Every time I throw away those
filings, sprinkle again,

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.000 align:middle line:10%
the field gave shape
to the particles.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.020 align:middle line:10%
When there was no
magnetic field--

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:24.590 align:middle line:10%
particles random, that's
all it was, put a field in,

00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:28.070 align:middle line:10%
particles precisely
going to a pattern.

00:49:28.070 --> 00:49:29.210 align:middle line:10%
Focus.

00:49:29.210 --> 00:49:34.892 align:middle line:10%
The field is the soul governing
agency of those particles.

00:49:34.892 --> 00:49:36.350 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden,
it says, yeah,

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:37.642 align:middle line:10%
but what level does this cover?

00:49:37.642 --> 00:49:39.980 align:middle line:10%
I said, every level
of the structure

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.080 align:middle line:10%
of the energy in the universe.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.360 align:middle line:10%
I go, so fields of
energy shape us?

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.950 align:middle line:10%
I go, yes.

00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.410 align:middle line:10%
And now all of a sudden,
I say, yeah, but thought

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:50.690 align:middle line:10%
is not manifest as a particle.

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:53.550 align:middle line:10%
Thought is an energy field.

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:58.670 align:middle line:10%
And so your thoughts generate
a field that your particles--

00:49:58.670 --> 00:50:00.620 align:middle line:10%
cells, not iron filings--

00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:05.090 align:middle line:10%
your particles assemble
to complement the field.

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:07.010 align:middle line:10%
If you change your
perception of the field,

00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:08.510 align:middle line:10%
you change your biology.

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:10.370 align:middle line:10%
If you have a
misperception of the field,

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:14.377 align:middle line:10%
you've misorganized or
misstructured your biology.

00:50:14.377 --> 00:50:16.460 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, I
say, so why is it relevant?

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.440 align:middle line:10%
The idea that a human body is
just a physical thing affected

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.480 align:middle line:10%
by physical things like
pharmaceutical drugs

00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.990 align:middle line:10%
is an illusion.

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:24.190 align:middle line:10%
The illusion of reality--

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:27.240 align:middle line:10%
I love it because
Einstein, again,

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:32.040 align:middle line:10%
obviously one of my
heroes, Einstein writes,

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:38.250 align:middle line:10%
"Reality is an illusion,
albeit a persistent one."

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.540 align:middle line:90%
The simple point is what?

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:42.510 align:middle line:84%
The material expression
of the universe

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:middle line:84%
is an illusion because there
is no physical structure

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.320 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.880 align:middle line:10%
It's all energy.

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:49.770 align:middle line:10%
And wow, there's
a characteristic.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:50.680 align:middle line:10%
What's energy?

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.900 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's in waves.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.510 align:middle line:84%
And I know that from
experimental studies,

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that invisible force field--
drop a rock into the pond,

00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:01.890 align:middle line:84%
the energy of the falling rock
transmitted into the water

00:51:01.890 --> 00:51:04.930 align:middle line:84%
shapes the water in
the shape of the field.

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:09.050 align:middle line:84%
So the ripples are an
expression of an energy field.

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:09.850 align:middle line:10%
One.

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:13.290 align:middle line:10%
Number two, it's invisible.

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:15.030 align:middle line:10%
Now, we've got a problem.

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:18.390 align:middle line:10%
If energy is invisible, then
how the heck can I see you?

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.280 align:middle line:10%
And comes an answer--

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.270 align:middle line:10%
sounds like a joke.

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:25.310 align:middle line:10%
Way profound answer is this.

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:29.410 align:middle line:10%
The only reason you can see me
is because the lights are on.

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:32.930 align:middle line:10%
It's like-- I go,
the reason is this.

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.150 align:middle line:10%
My body is an energy field.

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:36.820 align:middle line:10%
It's not physical.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:39.940 align:middle line:10%
But photons of light
coming from a light source

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:43.540 align:middle line:10%
hit my energy field, and
the energy of the photon

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:48.730 align:middle line:10%
is deflected by the energy of
the body and deflected back.

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.950 align:middle line:10%
You're not seeing me.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:53.980 align:middle line:10%
You're seeing a
veneer of photons

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.832 align:middle line:10%
that are hitting the surface
of me and bouncing back.

00:51:57.832 --> 00:51:59.290 align:middle line:10%
I go, so you mean
there's nothing--

00:51:59.290 --> 00:52:00.290 align:middle line:10%
no structure underneath?

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:02.890 align:middle line:10%
I go, these are what
the scan technologies--

00:52:02.890 --> 00:52:05.753 align:middle line:10%
MRI, CAT scans, all
these kinds of scans.

00:52:05.753 --> 00:52:06.670 align:middle line:10%
So why is it relevant?

00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:08.620 align:middle line:10%
I said, they don't read light.

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:12.730 align:middle line:84%
They could see your structure
by looking through your body.

00:52:12.730 --> 00:52:15.340 align:middle line:10%
I go, well, then, how can
they see my structure?

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.350 align:middle line:10%
Because it doesn't
measure light.

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:20.090 align:middle line:10%
It measures
electromagnetic fields.

00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:24.280 align:middle line:10%
So when you see the structure
in a CAT scan of a human body,

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.398 align:middle line:10%
oh, yeah, there's
vertebrae, and lungs,

00:52:26.398 --> 00:52:27.940 align:middle line:10%
and I can see all
this kind of thing.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:31.870 align:middle line:10%
I go, but what you're
seeing is an energy profile,

00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:middle line:10%
because CAT scans
don't read light.

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.297 align:middle line:90%
They read energy.

00:52:35.297 --> 00:52:36.880 align:middle line:84%
So what does the
human body look like?

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:37.907 align:middle line:90%
I say, look at an MRI.

00:52:37.907 --> 00:52:38.740 align:middle line:90%
That's what you are.

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:41.320 align:middle line:10%
And I say, yeah, but it's all
this-- it's like an X-ray,

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.620 align:middle line:10%
because everything is energy.

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:43.840 align:middle line:10%
You can see through it.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.830 align:middle line:10%
I go, yeah.

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:48.160 align:middle line:84%
But if you hit the photons
of light on the surface,

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.370 align:middle line:84%
it'll bounce back, so you
see a reflection of light.

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:55.180 align:middle line:84%
But you do not see my
body, because it's not

00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:57.010 align:middle line:90%
made out of matter.

00:52:57.010 --> 00:53:02.820 align:middle line:84%
And I go, then everything that
you see is made out of matter?

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.750 align:middle line:10%
So that there is no physical
element to the universe,

00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:09.410 align:middle line:10%
because everything you perceive
as matter made out of atoms,

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:12.080 align:middle line:10%
and atoms are built
out of energy,

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:17.590 align:middle line:10%
not matter, then you're looking
at an expression of energy.

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:19.450 align:middle line:10%
And I say, why is it relevant?

00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:23.260 align:middle line:10%
Because as conventional
science would say,

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.650 align:middle line:10%
that chemistry affects the body
because the body is physical

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:28.180 align:middle line:10%
and energy doesn't.

00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:30.280 align:middle line:10%
That's why we
ignore consciousness

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:32.530 align:middle line:10%
and all that stuff.

00:53:32.530 --> 00:53:34.240 align:middle line:10%
Then you say, well,
the body can only

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.730 align:middle line:10%
be affected by something
that is mechanical to affect

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:37.550 align:middle line:10%
a mechanical body.

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:40.180 align:middle line:10%
And then you go, but wait,
the body isn't mechanical.

00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:40.990 align:middle line:10%
The body is energy.

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:41.950 align:middle line:10%
I say, so why?

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:44.500 align:middle line:10%
I said, because energy
affects energy--

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.430 align:middle line:10%
more effective than
chemicals affect energy.

00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:51.230 align:middle line:10%
And so there was a
study in London saying,

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:53.830 align:middle line:10%
well, the body does
respond to physical drugs,

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:56.590 align:middle line:10%
but it also apparently
responds to energy,

00:53:56.590 --> 00:54:00.520 align:middle line:10%
because energy healing was here
hundreds of thousands of years

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.140 align:middle line:10%
before medical school was here.

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:03.460 align:middle line:10%
They didn't take pills.

00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:06.520 align:middle line:84%
They did hands-on
healing, energy.

00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.640 align:middle line:10%
And so McClare,
researcher in physics

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:13.090 align:middle line:10%
in the University of London,
asked a basic question.

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:14.920 align:middle line:10%
If I'm sending a signal--

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.870 align:middle line:10%
and it could be a drug, a
physical/chemical appearing

00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:20.630 align:middle line:10%
signal, or it could be just
a vibrational energy field.

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:22.850 align:middle line:10%
Is there a difference
in the effectiveness?

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:28.400 align:middle line:10%
And the answer turns out
the energy signal is 100%--

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:37.150 align:middle line:10%
OK, 99-- 99% more efficient in
sending a signal than is a drug.

00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:39.460 align:middle line:10%
So I said, well, if
you're giving me a choice,

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:42.240 align:middle line:10%
take a healing thing,
you give me a drug

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.520 align:middle line:10%
or you give me a
vibrational energy,

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:48.390 align:middle line:10%
the energy is nearly 100
times more efficient.

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:50.730 align:middle line:10%
Why would I take the damn drug?

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:52.800 align:middle line:10%
And that's where the
problem comes in,

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:54.870 align:middle line:10%
because if you're a
pharmaceutical company,

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:56.440 align:middle line:10%
you can't sell energy.

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:58.120 align:middle line:10%
There's no, here's
your energy tablet.

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:58.920 align:middle line:10%
It's invisible.

00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:59.790 align:middle line:10%
Just take it.

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:02.620 align:middle line:10%
It's like, no, you can
only sell physical drugs.

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:04.470 align:middle line:10%
So I say, then what
would be the consequence

00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:07.800 align:middle line:10%
and I'm saying this
from a former researcher

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:11.010 align:middle line:10%
in a university in
a medical school?

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:14.940 align:middle line:10%
I'm saying this because
the medical system has

00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:18.060 align:middle line:10%
been manipulated by the
pharmaceutical people

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:23.100 align:middle line:10%
to ignore the invisible
realm and to push drugs.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.522 align:middle line:10%
Now, the medical
doctors are just

00:55:24.522 --> 00:55:26.730 align:middle line:10%
taking whatever the heck
was said in medical school--

00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:28.230 align:middle line:10%
because I was a professor.

00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:29.530 align:middle line:10%
I know this.

00:55:29.530 --> 00:55:32.920 align:middle line:10%
Whatever my words are, that
becomes concrete belief.

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.410 align:middle line:10%
And when we stop--

00:55:34.410 --> 00:55:36.820 align:middle line:10%
well, we didn't start,
even-- teaching about

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:39.160 align:middle line:10%
energy in medicine
until more recently.

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:42.160 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting, because I
talk about the CAT scans reading

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:45.880 align:middle line:10%
energy, the CAT scans weren't
created by medical people.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.920 align:middle line:10%
They were created by physicists.

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.030 align:middle line:10%
I say, so where's the
medical people come in?

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:53.110 align:middle line:10%
They go, oh, my god, with
this scanning device,

00:55:53.110 --> 00:55:55.880 align:middle line:10%
I can get a map of the body.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:59.710 align:middle line:10%
And so if you take a breast
scan with an energy device,

00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:01.720 align:middle line:10%
you can see a tumor.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:02.680 align:middle line:10%
I go, why?

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:05.230 align:middle line:10%
Because tumor cells
have a different energy

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:06.980 align:middle line:10%
than normal cells.

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:08.980 align:middle line:10%
So if I'm reading
an energy field,

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:12.250 align:middle line:10%
the tumor cells will stand
out as a different expression

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:14.180 align:middle line:10%
than the normal cells.

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:18.020 align:middle line:10%
So when a conventional
physician looks at the scan,

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:20.350 align:middle line:10%
breast scan says
there's a tumor.

00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:23.650 align:middle line:10%
Their interest is,
give me a scalpel.

00:56:23.650 --> 00:56:25.970 align:middle line:10%
I know exactly where
to find that damn tumor

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:27.100 align:middle line:10%
and I'll cut it out.

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:29.290 align:middle line:10%
I go, well, yeah, that's
what we've been used to.

00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:31.690 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, what does
quantum physics say?

00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:34.870 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to--
energy shapes matter.

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:39.070 align:middle line:10%
If I put in a different
energy, I can change the shape.

00:56:39.070 --> 00:56:44.335 align:middle line:10%
Hands-on healing is putting
energy into a system.

00:56:44.335 --> 00:56:45.460 align:middle line:10%
I go, so what does it mean?

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:48.320 align:middle line:10%
I said, I can adjust
your health with energy.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:51.910 align:middle line:10%
And I go, wow, this is not in
favor with the pharmaceutical

00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:55.220 align:middle line:10%
industry because they
cannot sell energy.

00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.190 align:middle line:10%
So what do they do?

00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:01.870 align:middle line:10%
Put all their money into
restricting the nature of energy

00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:06.280 align:middle line:10%
in medical school and
emphasizing the role of drugs

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:08.840 align:middle line:10%
as the resource of healing.

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.160 align:middle line:10%
And I go, but energy is
100 times more efficient.

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:15.070 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, but I'm sorry, as
a pharmaceutical person,

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.380 align:middle line:10%
I can't sell you an energy.

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.960 align:middle line:10%
I need to sell you
something physical.

00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.750 align:middle line:10%
And that's why if they
just sold placebos--

00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:23.890 align:middle line:10%
here's something physical.

00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:24.977 align:middle line:10%
It's a sugar pill.

00:57:24.977 --> 00:57:26.560 align:middle line:10%
If you didn't tell
them it was a sugar

00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:29.270 align:middle line:10%
pill, that pill in
their consciousness,

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:32.600 align:middle line:10%
which is not physical
energy, the consciousness--

00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.082 align:middle line:10%
will change the
health of the body

00:57:34.082 --> 00:57:35.540 align:middle line:10%
through changing
the consciousness,

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:38.810 align:middle line:10%
not by the pill changing
the physicality.

00:57:38.810 --> 00:57:41.510 align:middle line:10%
And this becomes
so important for us

00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:44.540 align:middle line:10%
because of connections
to things like, well,

00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:46.190 align:middle line:10%
what is spirituality?

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:47.160 align:middle line:10%
OK, definition.

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.440 align:middle line:10%
You ready?

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.320 align:middle line:10%
Field.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.140 align:middle line:10%
The energy that I talk about--

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:55.490 align:middle line:10%
invisible moving forces that
influence the physical world.

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:57.620 align:middle line:90%
Definition of field.

00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.930 align:middle line:84%
I go, what's the
definition of spirit?

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:03.770 align:middle line:10%
Invisible moving forces that
influence the physical world.

00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:08.090 align:middle line:10%
They go, oh, my god, quantum
physics and spirituality

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:10.220 align:middle line:10%
have the same conclusion.

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.540 align:middle line:10%
And the reality is this.

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:15.240 align:middle line:10%
And it's interesting, because
Tesla was the scientist who

00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.040 align:middle line:10%
saw this way ahead.

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.460 align:middle line:10%
And he said, the
moment medicine starts

00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:23.810 align:middle line:10%
to focus on the energy
field, in a very short time,

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:26.180 align:middle line:10%
will change all of
the history that we

00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.980 align:middle line:10%
have in just a very short time.

00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:32.090 align:middle line:10%
So I'm presuming this
is an opportunity

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:35.300 align:middle line:10%
to help change history
here, because people

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:38.900 align:middle line:10%
need to know their thoughts are
not just things that fly off.

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Their thoughts are translated
into chemistry by the brain,

00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:45.470 align:middle line:84%
and the chemistry is
released into the blood,

00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:47.450 align:middle line:84%
and the blood is
the environment that

00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:49.910 align:middle line:90%
shapes behavior and genetics.

00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:53.430 align:middle line:84%
Change the chemistry, you
change the fate of the cells.

00:58:53.430 --> 00:59:00.220 align:middle line:10%
I go, wow, that's exactly the
results I had 50 years ago

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.370 align:middle line:10%
when I put genetically identical
cells in different Petri dishes.

00:59:03.370 --> 00:59:05.870 align:middle line:10%
All dishes have genetically
identical cells.

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:09.550 align:middle line:10%
I changed the composition of the
culture medium, the nutrients

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:11.060 align:middle line:10%
in which cells grow.

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:12.910 align:middle line:10%
What is culture medium?

00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:15.960 align:middle line:10%
Laboratory version of blood.

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:16.920 align:middle line:10%
I grow human cells.

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:19.260 align:middle line:84%
What's blood made
out of in human?

00:59:19.260 --> 00:59:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Go into the lab, mix it
all up, feed the cells,

00:59:22.590 --> 00:59:24.180 align:middle line:90%
the same thing that blood had.

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:26.700 align:middle line:10%
But since I was in
the lab, I could

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:29.610 align:middle line:10%
change some of
the composition, I

00:59:29.610 --> 00:59:33.090 align:middle line:10%
made three slightly different
versions of culture medium

00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:34.530 align:middle line:10%
with slightly
different chemistry.

00:59:34.530 --> 00:59:37.140 align:middle line:10%
Genetically identical cells.

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:41.340 align:middle line:10%
In dish 1, environment
1, culture medium 1,

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:42.930 align:middle line:10%
the cells form muscle.

00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:47.520 align:middle line:10%
Dish 2, culture medium
2, the cells form bone.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:51.570 align:middle line:10%
Dish 3, put in a culture medium
again with a slightly different

00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:53.890 align:middle line:10%
combination, the
cells form fat cells.

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:56.470 align:middle line:84%
I go, then, what controlled
the fate of the cells?

00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:59.760 align:middle line:84%
The answer was, they were
all genetically the same.

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.650 align:middle line:10%
It was the environment
that was different.

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:05.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I saw
over 50 years ago.

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:08.940 align:middle line:84%
While I was teaching,
genes control life.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:11.670 align:middle line:84%
I go in the lab and
go, that's not true.

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:13.500 align:middle line:90%
Genes didn't control this.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:16.020 align:middle line:84%
This is controlled
by environment.

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:22.040 align:middle line:10%
Well, for 20 to 25 years,
people ignored my study

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:24.110 align:middle line:10%
because everyone was
so focused on genes

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:26.460 align:middle line:10%
that this was taking us away.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:30.530 align:middle line:84%
But 1990, science
fully recognized

01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:34.460 align:middle line:84%
the conventional story of genes
turning on and off controlling

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.900 align:middle line:90%
life is totally false.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Genes do not turn on and off.

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:40.120 align:middle line:90%
Genes are blueprints.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:45.308 align:middle line:84%
And that the consciousness,
as the contractor,

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.600 align:middle line:84%
can take all your blueprints
and read them just the way

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.380 align:middle line:84%
they are or modify them to
thousands of different versions

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:55.235 align:middle line:84%
and create something new
and different out of it.

01:00:55.235 --> 01:00:58.500 align:middle line:84%
And we're pretty good
at creating cancer,

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.430 align:middle line:90%
heart disease, diabetes.

01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:03.410 align:middle line:90%
We're creating those.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:07.460 align:middle line:84%
They didn't come from
our genetic problems.

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.320 align:middle line:10%
They came from our
belief, thought, energy,

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:16.960 align:middle line:10%
field, shaping matter.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.940 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden,
it says, you're

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:21.160 align:middle line:10%
not a victim of your genes.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.740 align:middle line:10%
If anything, you're a
victim of whatever image

01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.300 align:middle line:10%
you're sending in.

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.150 align:middle line:10%
And then power comes from what?

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:29.530 align:middle line:10%
Take the red pill.

01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:31.210 align:middle line:10%
Stop thinking.

01:01:31.210 --> 01:01:34.660 align:middle line:10%
That's why two
people come together,

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:38.530 align:middle line:10%
the moment they stop thinking
as a couple is the moment

01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:41.140 align:middle line:10%
they start creating--
from conscious mind, which

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.940 align:middle line:10%
is normally thinking.

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.510 align:middle line:10%
But if I keep it
present, be mindful,

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:50.243 align:middle line:10%
then conscious mind is directing
my life and not the programs.

01:01:50.243 --> 01:01:52.160 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, you
said, oh, my god, you

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.113 align:middle line:10%
mean, as soon as I stop playing
the program, 24 hours later,

01:01:55.113 --> 01:01:56.030 align:middle line:10%
I had Heaven on Earth?

01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:59.470 align:middle line:10%
I go, Heaven on
Earth is always here.

01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:03.710 align:middle line:10%
It's your issue of whether
you want to see it that way,

01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:05.530 align:middle line:10%
or are you still stuck
in your program ?

01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:08.470 align:middle line:10%
Because program means no
matter how many times you

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:11.170 align:middle line:10%
push that button, the
behavior is always

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:16.630 align:middle line:10%
going to be the same until
you change the program.

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:20.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Fortunately, I think people
are starting to get that.

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:23.110 align:middle line:10%
You're describing epigenetics?

01:02:23.110 --> 01:02:24.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I just did.

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:24.890 align:middle line:10%
>> Right.

01:02:24.890 --> 01:02:26.515 align:middle line:10%
But you didn't put
a name to it, so I--

01:02:26.515 --> 01:02:28.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, OK.

01:02:28.770 --> 01:02:30.520 align:middle line:10%
I'll just sentence,
you can figure it out.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.320 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.060 align:middle line:10%
Well, the relevance, then, of
understanding how consciousness

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:39.010 align:middle line:10%
took over the control of genes
is the source from above,

01:02:39.010 --> 01:02:44.650 align:middle line:10%
consciousness, is shaping
the matter, epigenetics.

01:02:44.650 --> 01:02:48.040 align:middle line:10%
Control above the genes.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.850 align:middle line:10%
And this is where thought
becomes the manifestor

01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:54.780 align:middle line:10%
of our life expression.

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.490 align:middle line:10%
>> Nice.

01:02:56.490 --> 01:02:57.480 align:middle line:10%
Nice.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.115 align:middle line:10%
>> Even that excerpt
was too long.

01:02:59.115 --> 01:03:02.160 align:middle line:90%


01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.375 align:middle line:10%
Not my problem.

01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:04.530 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:09.900 align:middle line:10%
>> You talk about the
significance of water and also

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.730 align:middle line:10%
fractal geometry.

01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh god, yeah.

01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:14.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I'd love
to hear about it.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:18.230 align:middle line:90%


01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:20.590 align:middle line:10%
>> There's a wonderful
mathematics called geometry.

01:03:20.590 --> 01:03:24.490 align:middle line:10%
And geometry is the math of
putting structure into space.

01:03:24.490 --> 01:03:26.140 align:middle line:10%
And that's why when
we were in school,

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.640 align:middle line:10%
we took a form of
geometry that's

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.470 align:middle line:10%
called Euclidean geometry.

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:30.970 align:middle line:10%
And if you go back,
remember, that

01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:35.345 align:middle line:10%
was the math that you had a
protractor and the triangles

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:36.220 align:middle line:10%
and all those things.

01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.320 align:middle line:10%
And what were you doing
on the graph paper?

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:43.060 align:middle line:10%
You were putting structures,
cubes, spheres, pyramids,

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:47.470 align:middle line:10%
triangles, the characters
of Euclidean geometry.

01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:49.280 align:middle line:10%
And you could put
them on a page.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.130 align:middle line:10%
And this is how we
create a building.

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:55.480 align:middle line:10%
This is based on that
kind of geometry.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.610 align:middle line:10%
And I go, well,
this is really cool.

01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:01.600 align:middle line:10%
Euclidean geometry designs
our machines, our buildings,

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.790 align:middle line:10%
the structures we make.

01:04:03.790 --> 01:04:06.490 align:middle line:10%
I go, but does
Euclidean geometry

01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:10.960 align:middle line:10%
create a tree, a snail, a fern?

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.210 align:middle line:10%
I say, well, how would I know?

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:15.490 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, you
can plot all the heck

01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:19.900 align:middle line:10%
you want with all your equations
and Euclidean geometry.

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:23.530 align:middle line:10%
You're still going to get small
squares, cubes, triangles,

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:24.910 align:middle line:10%
spheres, cones.

01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:27.640 align:middle line:10%
But it doesn't really
reflect nature.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.310 align:middle line:10%
So back at the turn--

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:35.590 align:middle line:10%
I think it was at the end of
the 1800s, going into the 1900s.

01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:39.490 align:middle line:84%
A French mathematician
came up with the idea of,

01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:40.810 align:middle line:90%
what is a fractal?

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, in geometry, you have all
those different damn equations.

01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:49.450 align:middle line:84%
Fractals are interesting because
it uses a single equation

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:50.930 align:middle line:90%
and repeats it.

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:51.730 align:middle line:90%
And I say, how?

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:53.740 align:middle line:90%
I say, here's a single equation.

01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Solve it.

01:04:54.610 --> 01:04:55.850 align:middle line:90%
You got an answer.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:56.650 align:middle line:90%
Now what?

01:04:56.650 --> 01:05:00.100 align:middle line:84%
I say, take that answer, put
it back into the equation,

01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.720 align:middle line:90%
solve it again.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.622 align:middle line:90%
Get a different answer.

01:05:03.622 --> 01:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
Put that one back in the
equation and solve it again.

01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:08.600 align:middle line:10%
It's called
iteration, repetition.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.580 align:middle line:90%
I go, so why is that relevant?

01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:14.950 align:middle line:84%
Because it keeps repeating
itself over and over again.

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:16.580 align:middle line:90%
But it builds a big structure.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:17.830 align:middle line:90%
I go, so what's the relevance?

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:20.960 align:middle line:84%
I say, the big structure is
the same as the small structure

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.160 align:middle line:90%
you started with.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:27.010 align:middle line:84%
And so fractals have
iteration repeat.

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:29.590 align:middle line:10%
And if you can get the
basic understanding

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:31.662 align:middle line:10%
of a fractal image,
you can repeat that

01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:34.120 align:middle line:10%
over and over and over again
and get something very massive

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.680 align:middle line:10%
out of it.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.820 align:middle line:10%
And I go, the thing
that happened--

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:43.570 align:middle line:10%
and that was in the '80s, a
scientist, Benoit, at IBM,

01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:46.040 align:middle line:10%
had access to computers
and said, well,

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.380 align:middle line:10%
why did he need computers?

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.580 align:middle line:10%
The answer is this.

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:52.150 align:middle line:84%
From the very beginning, he
said, I have that equation

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:54.760 align:middle line:84%
and I get it and solve
it and repeat it again.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.690 align:middle line:10%
But to put a picture on a piece
of paper-- graph paper-- of what

01:05:58.690 --> 01:06:01.420 align:middle line:10%
that represented
would take maybe

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.370 align:middle line:10%
a million or more calculations.

01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:07.162 align:middle line:10%
So if I said, OK, I'm
Bruce Mathematician.

01:06:07.162 --> 01:06:08.620 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to sit
down today and I'm

01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:10.700 align:middle line:10%
going to show you what
the picture of what

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:11.973 align:middle line:10%
this fractal looks like.

01:06:11.973 --> 01:06:17.000 align:middle line:10%
And I-- once, put the dot
down, solve it again twice,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.910 align:middle line:10%
put the dot down on the
paper, solve it again,

01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:21.320 align:middle line:10%
put the dot down.

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:26.770 align:middle line:10%
I say, after a million
dots, an image will show up.

01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:33.140 align:middle line:10%
And I go, and how long does it
take to compute and calculate

01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.670 align:middle line:10%
a million times?

01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:36.990 align:middle line:10%
I go, years.

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:39.860 align:middle line:10%
And so the earliest people
that had an idea of fractals

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:43.520 align:middle line:10%
never could see a
fractal because they

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:48.440 align:middle line:10%
didn't have years to sit still
and repeat the same thing over

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:51.380 align:middle line:10%
and over again to
millions of times.

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But Benoit Mandelbrot,
in the 1980s,

01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:59.930 align:middle line:84%
had supercomputers
at that time from IBM

01:06:59.930 --> 01:07:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and was the first guy to stick
the equation into computer.

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:05.270 align:middle line:84%
And when he saw the printout,
he's like, oh, my god,

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:07.790 align:middle line:90%
these are living structures.

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:11.570 align:middle line:10%
The images that came out
of solving fractal geometry

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:16.070 align:middle line:10%
equations created structures
that represented life.

01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:20.870 align:middle line:10%
You can see a picture of a
fern in a fractal geometry

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:24.230 align:middle line:10%
and not distinguish it from
a photograph of a real fern.

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:27.440 align:middle line:10%
You can make a mountain
with clouds on it

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.510 align:middle line:10%
with mathematical equations.

01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:32.270 align:middle line:10%
And all of a
sudden, it says, oh,

01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:35.780 align:middle line:10%
nature is not built
on Euclidean geometry.

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:40.370 align:middle line:10%
It's built on fractal geometry,
because when you solve it,

01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:42.140 align:middle line:10%
they create nature
images instead

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.640 align:middle line:10%
of cubes and spheres and cones.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.840 align:middle line:10%
And so what, again, is
the relevance of that?

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.670 align:middle line:10%
And the relevance is--

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:51.170 align:middle line:10%
and here it is.

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:53.690 align:middle line:10%
Because you use
the same equation

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:55.820 align:middle line:10%
and repeat it over
and over again,

01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:59.960 align:middle line:10%
then there's a basic structure
that evolves from that equation,

01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:01.700 align:middle line:10%
but is repeated
over and over again

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:04.640 align:middle line:10%
at higher and higher
magnification.

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.980 align:middle line:10%
And so it says, well, if you
want to understand a human,

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:08.647 align:middle line:10%
do I have to understand
the whole human?

01:08:08.647 --> 01:08:12.380 align:middle line:10%
I go, a cell is a
fractal of a human.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.730 align:middle line:10%
Why?

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:16.170 align:middle line:10%
You look at and say, it doesn't
look exactly like a human.

01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:18.462 align:middle line:10%
I said, well, it really does,
if you put the pseudopods

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:22.439 align:middle line:10%
out-- the arms and the legs
and the body of the cell.

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:23.370 align:middle line:10%
And I go so what?

01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:26.300 align:middle line:10%
I said, this is why, if
we study cell biology,

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:29.109 align:middle line:10%
the mechanisms of
cell biology are

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:32.180 align:middle line:10%
a fractal image of the
mechanisms of the whole biology.

01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:33.920 align:middle line:10%
I don't have to study
the whole human.

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.600 align:middle line:10%
Just study the cell.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.819 align:middle line:10%
The patterns are the same.

01:08:37.819 --> 01:08:41.700 align:middle line:10%
Conclusion-- and
this is the one--

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:48.220 align:middle line:10%
the concept of "as above, so
below" it's not a suggestion.

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:52.569 align:middle line:10%
It is a principle
of fractal geometry.

01:08:52.569 --> 01:08:54.365 align:middle line:10%
If you want to understand
how a body works,

01:08:54.365 --> 01:08:55.990 align:middle line:10%
you don't have to
study the whole body.

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:59.350 align:middle line:10%
Study its cell, because it is
the same image at a smaller

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:00.189 align:middle line:10%
version.

01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:02.200 align:middle line:10%
You want to study what
happens to humans?

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:06.040 align:middle line:10%
We are cells in the
bigger population

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:08.410 align:middle line:10%
of all the other cells.

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:11.410 align:middle line:10%
And so the function of the
cell, the function of the human,

01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:13.450 align:middle line:10%
the function of
human civilization,

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:16.569 align:middle line:10%
communities, all have
the same foundation.

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:17.979 align:middle line:10%
As above, so below.

01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:20.950 align:middle line:10%
So that the future
of evolution could

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:24.020 align:middle line:10%
be understood by looking
the past of evolution.

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:28.430 align:middle line:10%
And that future reveals
we're on the threshold

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:33.260 align:middle line:10%
of a brand-new
world, because we're

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.740 align:middle line:10%
going to see where the
patterns play themselves out.

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:40.020 align:middle line:10%
And it really comes down
to a very interesting fact.

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:45.720 align:middle line:84%
If we look at the evolution of
vertebrates-- fish, amphibians,

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:49.850 align:middle line:84%
reptiles, birds,
mammals-- we see a jumping

01:09:49.850 --> 01:09:53.040 align:middle line:84%
from one kind of organization
to the next to the next.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.080 align:middle line:10%
And I say, well, then, the human
evolution, human civilization

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:02.960 align:middle line:10%
as a multicellular organism,
would, by fractal geometry,

01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:06.690 align:middle line:10%
replicate the
previous evolution.

01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:10.310 align:middle line:10%
So I go, yeah, humans have
been through those levels

01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:11.810 align:middle line:10%
of vertebrate evolution.

01:10:11.810 --> 01:10:14.570 align:middle line:10%
Fish society was
called mariculture.

01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:16.340 align:middle line:10%
They were the first cultures.

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:20.180 align:middle line:10%
They lived at the water, lived
off the proceeds from the water,

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.980 align:middle line:10%
couldn't go into the land
because they needed the water,

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:26.350 align:middle line:10%
so they couldn't just
go out into the land.

01:10:26.350 --> 01:10:29.250 align:middle line:84%
So the first cultures
of humans were

01:10:29.250 --> 01:10:32.520 align:middle line:84%
living on the edges of
continents, using the water,

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:37.367 align:middle line:84%
and also connecting via water
to all the other land sources.

01:10:37.367 --> 01:10:38.700 align:middle line:10%
Then I say, well, what happened?

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.350 align:middle line:10%
That was called the fish phase.

01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:43.020 align:middle line:10%
Then I say, but fish
gave rise to amphibians.

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.140 align:middle line:10%
Say, what did they do?

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:48.250 align:middle line:84%
They carried the water with them
when they got out of the water

01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:50.280 align:middle line:90%
so they could be on land.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:53.190 align:middle line:84%
A tadpole starts as a
swimming, like, fish organism

01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:54.060 align:middle line:90%
in the water.

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:56.273 align:middle line:84%
But when it turns
into a frog, it

01:10:56.273 --> 01:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
doesn't have to
live in the water.

01:10:57.690 --> 01:11:00.010 align:middle line:10%
It carries the water
with it in its body.

01:11:00.010 --> 01:11:02.340 align:middle line:10%
So this allowed the next phase.

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.950 align:middle line:10%
You don't have to live where
the water is at the edge.

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:06.930 align:middle line:10%
Find the water inside--

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.460 align:middle line:10%
agriculture.

01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:10.860 align:middle line:10%
No longer restricted
to the edge.

01:11:10.860 --> 01:11:16.440 align:middle line:10%
You could create food using the
water that you carry with you,

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:21.840 align:middle line:10%
or you can get viaducts, or
even learn how to make wells.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.180 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, you're
not restricted to the front.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.540 align:middle line:10%
So we went from fish society
to amphibian society,

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:30.120 align:middle line:10%
from mariculture to agriculture.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.335 align:middle line:10%
And the next level of
evolution was reptiles.

01:11:33.335 --> 01:11:34.710 align:middle line:10%
I go, what was
unique about them?

01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:36.240 align:middle line:10%
They didn't start in the water.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:39.420 align:middle line:10%
They were expressly designed
to start on the land,

01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:40.570 align:middle line:10%
live on the land.

01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And they were technically
almost digital.

01:11:45.060 --> 01:11:48.660 align:middle line:84%
I mean, their movements, if you
see them, like their heads--

01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:49.650 align:middle line:90%
click.

01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:52.590 align:middle line:90%
Eyes blink.

01:11:52.590 --> 01:11:54.150 align:middle line:90%
It's a mechanism.

01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:56.820 align:middle line:10%
And I go, yeah, it's a machine.

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:59.115 align:middle line:10%
A reptile is a machine.

01:11:59.115 --> 01:12:00.240 align:middle line:90%
I go, so what was relevant?

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.615 align:middle line:84%
I said, well, it started out
as a little five-inch little

01:12:02.615 --> 01:12:03.940 align:middle line:90%
reptile.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But, well, you can
make a bigger one.

01:12:06.540 --> 01:12:07.340 align:middle line:90%
What?

01:12:07.340 --> 01:12:10.220 align:middle line:10%
A dinosaur-- 50-foot
instead of 5-inch.

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:11.360 align:middle line:10%
I say, guess what?

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:15.320 align:middle line:84%
Take the blueprint
of the 5-inch lizard,

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.960 align:middle line:84%
you can blow it up
to a 50-foot lizard.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:18.770 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:22.850 align:middle line:10%
When I was a kid, before
Spielberg and all that stuff,

01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:24.170 align:middle line:10%
there was a great movie--

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:27.830 align:middle line:10%
it was something like
"50,000 BC," Victor Mature.

01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Some old-- nobody knows
who that guy is now.

01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:33.440 align:middle line:84%
But they made dinosaur
movies of caveman.

01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.990 align:middle line:84%
I said, how did they
make these dinosaurs?

01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:40.250 align:middle line:84%
They used macro
photography of lizards

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:44.270 align:middle line:84%
and blew them up in the field
as if they were dinosaurs.

01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:45.970 align:middle line:84%
And they look exactly
like dinosaurs

01:12:45.970 --> 01:12:46.970 align:middle line:90%
behaved, like dinosaurs.

01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:47.770 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:51.230 align:middle line:84%
Because a lizard is the
prototype of a 50-foot dinosaur.

01:12:51.230 --> 01:12:53.570 align:middle line:10%
And I say, where does
that relate to in humans?

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:59.990 align:middle line:10%
I go, industrial civilization
is the mechanized version

01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:02.660 align:middle line:10%
of human civilization.

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And it started out as
small little things.

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:05.580 align:middle line:90%
As what?

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:07.770 align:middle line:90%
Mom and pop shops.

01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:08.640 align:middle line:90%
But then, what?

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:13.120 align:middle line:84%
As they became successful,
they grew bigger and bigger.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.870 align:middle line:84%
And they became
dinosaurs of industry.

01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:17.760 align:middle line:84%
And I go, there's
only one problem

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:20.100 align:middle line:84%
that happened in that
evolution, and that was this.

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:23.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, the body got bigger
and bigger and bigger.

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
The brain stayed
pitifully small.

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:27.340 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:28.507 align:middle line:90%
Because there was a machine.

01:13:28.507 --> 01:13:31.580 align:middle line:84%
I could make-- the movement
of a lizard's foot.

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Let's say 10 muscles cause the
leg of this lizard to move this.

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:40.210 align:middle line:90%
And then I go-- we're done?

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:43.070 align:middle line:10%
>> Sorry, the card stopped.

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.870 align:middle line:90%
>> Take 3.

01:13:43.870 --> 01:13:44.670 align:middle line:90%
Marker.

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:48.400 align:middle line:90%


01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.220 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, you ready?

01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:50.020 align:middle line:10%
>> Ready, yeah.

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:51.020 align:middle line:10%
>> So what was I going to say?

01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:52.060 align:middle line:10%
OK.

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:57.070 align:middle line:10%
So a small, five-inch lizard
is the physical prototype

01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:58.420 align:middle line:10%
of a 50-foot lizard.

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:02.620 align:middle line:10%
So I say, so for example, if we
go to the drawing board of what

01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:04.210 align:middle line:10%
a five-inch lizard
looks like, I said,

01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:06.160 align:middle line:10%
this lizard has a leg
that moves in this--

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.630 align:middle line:10%
and I say, how does it move?

01:14:07.630 --> 01:14:09.370 align:middle line:10%
I say, well, there
are 10 muscles.

01:14:09.370 --> 01:14:12.520 align:middle line:10%
And one nerve fires
those 10 muscles,

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.200 align:middle line:10%
and that makes its movement.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.540 align:middle line:10%
Like, what about a
50-foot dinosaur?

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:19.570 align:middle line:10%
Same pattern, same movement.

01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:23.380 align:middle line:10%
But instead of 10
muscles, 10,000 muscles.

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.520 align:middle line:10%
And I go and how many
nerves necessary?

01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.580 align:middle line:10%
I go, one.

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:31.090 align:middle line:10%
So as the mass of
the body got bigger,

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:33.587 align:middle line:10%
the necessity of making
the nervous system bigger

01:14:33.587 --> 01:14:35.170 align:middle line:10%
wasn't necessary,
because it was still

01:14:35.170 --> 01:14:39.670 align:middle line:10%
the same behavior, whether it's
10 muscles or 10,000 muscles.

01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:44.410 align:middle line:10%
So the machines grew from
little, small machines

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:46.150 align:middle line:10%
to giant dinosaurs.

01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:50.080 align:middle line:10%
Our fractal image of that is
we start with small mom and pop

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.170 align:middle line:10%
businesses, which, as
they got successful,

01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:56.060 align:middle line:10%
grew into large industries.

01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:59.590 align:middle line:10%
So in today's reptilian
version, there's

01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:03.805 align:middle line:10%
this large industries
that manipulate

01:15:03.805 --> 01:15:04.930 align:middle line:10%
everything that's going on.

01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:07.840 align:middle line:10%
And little sidebar-- we
also talk about the fact

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.790 align:middle line:10%
that oil, which
is the energizing

01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:11.830 align:middle line:10%
factor of our civilization,
is referred to as

01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:14.080 align:middle line:10%
the blood of the dinosaur.

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:15.400 align:middle line:10%
Ha!

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.320 align:middle line:10%
So I say, then what?

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:19.270 align:middle line:10%
I say, OK, let's
go beyond dinosaurs

01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:20.870 align:middle line:10%
and say, what did
they give rise to?

01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:25.210 align:middle line:10%
And I said, airplanes,
flight, birds.

01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:29.200 align:middle line:10%
I say, oh, yeah, the Industrial
Revolution created machines

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.210 align:middle line:10%
that put into a flight
mechanism, let Wilbur

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:33.530 align:middle line:10%
and Orville Wright fly.

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:36.770 align:middle line:10%
So the next level of
evolution went from--

01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:39.050 align:middle line:10%
reptilian evolution
is still here,

01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:42.530 align:middle line:10%
but a branch is now called
aeronautics, flying.

01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:44.480 align:middle line:10%
I go, and what was
the evolution of that?

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:51.720 align:middle line:10%
And I go, 1969, the
plane lands on the moon.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:53.140 align:middle line:10%
And I say, then what happened?

01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:55.690 align:middle line:10%
And here comes the
part that is amazing.

01:15:55.690 --> 01:15:57.990 align:middle line:10%
It precipitates evolution.

01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:59.460 align:middle line:10%
I say, how?

01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:04.620 align:middle line:10%
Because they took a picture
of the Earth from the moon,

01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:07.230 align:middle line:10%
and for the first time
in human consciousness,

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:10.050 align:middle line:10%
people saw, oh, my god,
that little blue green thing

01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:15.000 align:middle line:10%
is all alone by itself in space,
and all of a sudden the idea of,

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.600 align:middle line:10%
we have to take care of this.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:19.860 align:middle line:10%
So in 1969, the picture
shows up in the news.

01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:21.100 align:middle line:10%
People see this.

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:22.170 align:middle line:10%
Guess what was created?

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:23.720 align:middle line:10%
Earth Day.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.100 align:middle line:10%
I said, what was that all about?

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:27.170 align:middle line:10%
To recognize that if
that's all we have,

01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:27.890 align:middle line:10%
we have to take care of it.

01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:29.765 align:middle line:10%
Take care of the air,
take care of the water,

01:16:29.765 --> 01:16:32.340 align:middle line:10%
take care of the soil,
take care of the people.

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:36.470 align:middle line:84%
And I say take care
is called nurture.

01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:41.270 align:middle line:10%
And it turns out that
mammals, by definition,

01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:43.400 align:middle line:10%
are called nurturers.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:50.150 align:middle line:84%
So in 1969, a new
organism was created--

01:16:50.150 --> 01:16:51.260 align:middle line:90%
mammals.

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:53.500 align:middle line:90%
But they had no jobs.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:58.310 align:middle line:84%
So people that were the students
and all that, they had a vision,

01:16:58.310 --> 01:17:02.790 align:middle line:84%
but they were not capable, at
that young age, to manifest.

01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:03.920 align:middle line:90%
So they were still--

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:07.460 align:middle line:84%
the young mammals were
stepped on by the dinosaurs.

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.630 align:middle line:90%
And I go, well, that happened.

01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:14.190 align:middle line:10%
And yet what's happening now
is industrial civilization,

01:17:14.190 --> 01:17:17.870 align:middle line:10%
which is precipitating the
mass extinction that we're

01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:20.720 align:middle line:10%
in because of their
dishonoring of the environment

01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.250 align:middle line:10%
and of people--

01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:24.998 align:middle line:10%
is collapsing just like
the dinosaurs collapsed.

01:17:24.998 --> 01:17:27.290 align:middle line:10%
And I said, what happened
when the dinosaurs collapsed?

01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:30.830 align:middle line:10%
The mammals rose up
and nurturers took

01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:34.850 align:middle line:10%
over the planet, the mammals.

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.020 align:middle line:90%
I said, where are we?

01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:42.320 align:middle line:84%
We're at the fall of the
reptiles and the loss of oil--

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:47.900 align:middle line:84%
blood-- and the mammals,
who are now older,

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:50.890 align:middle line:90%
are in positions of control.

01:17:50.890 --> 01:17:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And so there is a
movement to change the way

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:58.050 align:middle line:84%
we have been living from
the reptilian version

01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:00.390 align:middle line:90%
to the mammalian version.

01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:02.940 align:middle line:10%
So the reptilian is coming--

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.560 align:middle line:10%
collapsing.

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:08.220 align:middle line:84%
The mammals are evolving
at the same time.

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:09.393 align:middle line:90%
And where are we today?

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:11.560 align:middle line:10%
You look out the window and
all you see is collapse.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.150 align:middle line:10%
And I go, well, if
that's what you focus on,

01:18:13.150 --> 01:18:14.190 align:middle line:10%
that's the problem.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:16.560 align:middle line:10%
Because you could focus
on the ones coming down,

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.690 align:middle line:10%
tie up your energy,
live in fear,

01:18:18.690 --> 01:18:20.970 align:middle line:10%
have all those problems, or--

01:18:20.970 --> 01:18:24.120 align:middle line:10%
choice-- look at the
one that's being built.

01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.650 align:middle line:10%
See where we're going.

01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:28.980 align:middle line:10%
See where the new ideas, the new
technology, all of that stuff

01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:32.700 align:middle line:10%
is coming in, because that is
the nurturing technology that

01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:35.940 align:middle line:10%
will allow us to survive
the mass extinction we

01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:39.250 align:middle line:10%
have precipitated with
our reptilian thinking.

01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:42.930 align:middle line:84%
The new civilization is
a mammalian, nurturing

01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:44.130 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:46.660 align:middle line:10%
And that will be
the fractal pattern.

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:49.420 align:middle line:84%
And so it's interesting
because, as I said,

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:52.090 align:middle line:84%
you can tell the past, but
you can predict the future.

01:18:52.090 --> 01:18:53.570 align:middle line:90%
And I say, what's the future?

01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:56.980 align:middle line:10%
If we succeed-- and it's
no guarantee we will--

01:18:56.980 --> 01:19:00.520 align:middle line:10%
then mammals will replace
the destructive character

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:04.660 align:middle line:10%
of the reptiles, the industry
people, the small percent that

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.940 align:middle line:10%
are controlling the rest.

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.830 align:middle line:10%
And the evolution
says, what happens

01:19:08.830 --> 01:19:10.010 align:middle line:10%
if we all become mammals?

01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:15.310 align:middle line:10%
The answer is, that nurtures the
garden, the one we destroyed.

01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:19.580 align:middle line:10%
And so a fractal image is
telling us there is a future.

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:23.580 align:middle line:10%
If you follow through on
it, it's going to be great.

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Must we follow through on it?

01:19:25.050 --> 01:19:26.310 align:middle line:90%
Well, no.

01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:28.170 align:middle line:10%
Other civilizations
have been here

01:19:28.170 --> 01:19:29.970 align:middle line:10%
and disappeared in the past.

01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:30.780 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:33.300 align:middle line:84%
They never
successfully completed

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:36.060 align:middle line:90%
the last stage of that.

01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:37.960 align:middle line:90%
They collapsed.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:42.010 align:middle line:10%
Whether it's Atlantis,
Lemuria, or wherever one

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:44.020 align:middle line:10%
you find from ancient history--

01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:45.730 align:middle line:10%
that is not in our
history actually,

01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:47.380 align:middle line:10%
because, those
civilizations existed

01:19:47.380 --> 01:19:49.990 align:middle line:10%
before our modern history--

01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:51.100 align:middle line:10%
the relevance is what?

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:53.880 align:middle line:10%
We are in the same position.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.520 align:middle line:10%
Are we going to make
it as a civilization?

01:19:56.520 --> 01:20:00.390 align:middle line:10%
At this very moment, 50/50.

01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:01.620 align:middle line:10%
I have no idea.

01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:07.580 align:middle line:10%
We have the potential, but we
may not realize our potential.

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:12.480 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you think that AI,
artificial intelligence,

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.000 align:middle line:10%
is in that path?

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.810 align:middle line:10%
>> It is, to a certain extent,
if we understand what it's to be

01:20:18.810 --> 01:20:20.220 align:middle line:10%
used for.

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.600 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is this.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.150 align:middle line:10%
Right now, we've been programmed
with the cultural beliefs

01:20:24.150 --> 01:20:26.622 align:middle line:10%
that we are the workers that
empower what's going on,

01:20:26.622 --> 01:20:28.080 align:middle line:10%
and you go out
there and you do all

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.460 align:middle line:10%
this mechanical, physical work.

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:30.420 align:middle line:10%
And you get a reward.

01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:31.380 align:middle line:10%
You get a paycheck.

01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:33.990 align:middle line:10%
And some people just
scrape by with enough

01:20:33.990 --> 01:20:35.130 align:middle line:10%
of a reward to survive.

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:36.840 align:middle line:10%
Other people
accumulate some money

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.430 align:middle line:10%
and can do things
with it like that.

01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:43.770 align:middle line:84%
And so the issue is, is
artificial intelligence

01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:45.690 align:middle line:90%
going to replace humans?

01:20:45.690 --> 01:20:48.690 align:middle line:10%
And the answer-- that would
be one of the stupidest

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:50.970 align:middle line:10%
ideas in the universe.

01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:52.390 align:middle line:10%
I say, why?

01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:56.380 align:middle line:10%
Because if I say, then why
are we here at this time?

01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:59.070 align:middle line:10%
And the answer is
because we are creators.

01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:03.550 align:middle line:10%
We can create the mess we've
done, which we've done.

01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:06.300 align:middle line:10%
But as we know from
the honeymoon effect,

01:21:06.300 --> 01:21:08.430 align:middle line:10%
we can manifest Heaven on Earth.

01:21:08.430 --> 01:21:14.470 align:middle line:10%
Do I want to turn over the joy
and love and happiness of heaven

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:16.430 align:middle line:10%
on earth and let a
machine experience it?

01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:17.230 align:middle line:10%
Hell no.

01:21:17.230 --> 01:21:18.980 align:middle line:10%
What the hell do I
care about the machine?

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:19.930 align:middle line:10%
It's me.

01:21:19.930 --> 01:21:23.907 align:middle line:10%
So when we focus on AI, you
take yourself out of the picture

01:21:23.907 --> 01:21:25.990 align:middle line:10%
and then all of a sudden,
you see a machine world.

01:21:25.990 --> 01:21:27.790 align:middle line:10%
People are part machines.

01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:31.120 align:middle line:10%
It's like, man, you
missed the story.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.400 align:middle line:10%
We're the creators.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:36.490 align:middle line:10%
You don't replace the
creator with a machine.

01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:37.990 align:middle line:10%
The creator does what?

01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:40.510 align:middle line:10%
If the machines
support us, it gives me

01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:44.390 align:middle line:10%
more free, creative
opportunities.

01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:48.640 align:middle line:10%
So I look to AI as to enhance
my experience of Heaven

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:52.330 align:middle line:10%
on Earth, not to replace my
experience of Heaven on Earth.

01:21:52.330 --> 01:21:56.830 align:middle line:10%
And that's where AI's
got the whole idea wrong.

01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:58.838 align:middle line:10%
What value would humans have?

01:21:58.838 --> 01:22:00.130 align:middle line:10%
Oh, the machine will do it all.

01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:03.850 align:middle line:10%
So then what the heck
are you going to do?

01:22:03.850 --> 01:22:08.790 align:middle line:10%
And the point is, we
are here for a reason.

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:09.940 align:middle line:10%
We don't have to be here.

01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:12.260 align:middle line:10%
We've been lost nearly--

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:16.070 align:middle line:10%
all organisms have been lost
nearly five times in history

01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:17.870 align:middle line:10%
through mass extinctions.

01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:19.920 align:middle line:10%
But we're still here.

01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:22.650 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is there
was a mission statement.

01:22:22.650 --> 01:22:26.010 align:middle line:10%
And the mission statement,
when realized by humans,

01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:28.950 align:middle line:10%
is experiencing what is
called Heaven on Earth.

01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:30.810 align:middle line:10%
And it's beautiful
because there's no one

01:22:30.810 --> 01:22:32.460 align:middle line:10%
definition of Heaven on Earth.

01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:34.350 align:middle line:10%
You can ask 10 people
their definitions.

01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:36.790 align:middle line:10%
You're going to
get 10 definitions.

01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:39.840 align:middle line:10%
So the conclusion is, it's
not just heaven on earth.

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.950 align:middle line:10%
It's what you want.

01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:45.590 align:middle line:10%
If I say to you, tell me
your vision of Heaven,

01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:50.390 align:middle line:10%
it will be your interpretation,
based on your life experiences,

01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:54.050 align:middle line:10%
because that's what you can
draw from, of how would you

01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:56.150 align:middle line:10%
like to put those
experiences in a situation

01:22:56.150 --> 01:22:59.210 align:middle line:10%
where you will enjoy them?

01:22:59.210 --> 01:23:01.610 align:middle line:10%
And different people have
different experiences.

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:03.920 align:middle line:10%
It's not all the same.

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.470 align:middle line:10%
Like, if someone
was talking about--

01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:08.660 align:middle line:10%
you ask a hunter,
what is Heaven?

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:11.850 align:middle line:10%
And that hunter says, oh, I
go out every day duck hunting

01:23:11.850 --> 01:23:12.650 align:middle line:10%
in the morning.

01:23:12.650 --> 01:23:15.830 align:middle line:10%
I go out in the boat and I
shoot ducks all day long.

01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:18.920 align:middle line:10%
I go, oh, so your heaven
is shooting ducks,

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.665 align:middle line:10%
so I guess your heaven is
hell for ducks, isn't it?

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:28.850 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER] I don't want to
be a duck in your Heaven.

01:23:28.850 --> 01:23:30.900 align:middle line:10%
And the simple reality
is, why are we here?

01:23:30.900 --> 01:23:34.220 align:middle line:10%
Because it's the
versatility of a system

01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:37.910 align:middle line:10%
to create all the art,
the music, the writing,

01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:40.760 align:middle line:10%
the sculptures, the
buildings, the technology.

01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.720 align:middle line:90%
We are creators.

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:45.460 align:middle line:84%
If you want to let go
and die and give it to--

01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:46.260 align:middle line:90%
we can walk away.

01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.460 align:middle line:90%
The machine's going to create.

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:48.260 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to die.

01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:52.480 align:middle line:10%
And I go, then why the hell were
you here in the first place?

01:23:52.480 --> 01:23:54.810 align:middle line:10%
And the idea is, from
my personal experience--

01:23:54.810 --> 01:23:58.410 align:middle line:10%
never experiencing it
until I was much older,

01:23:58.410 --> 01:24:03.810 align:middle line:10%
over 50, when I really had
an experience of love that

01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:09.630 align:middle line:10%
truly manifests that
I live in Heaven.

01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:12.960 align:middle line:10%
I wake up every day going,
oh, my god, I'm still here.

01:24:12.960 --> 01:24:19.170 align:middle line:10%
There's another day of social,
loving, physical, mental

01:24:19.170 --> 01:24:23.780 align:middle line:10%
expression-- fun, love,
living in a garden.

01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:26.750 align:middle line:10%
And once I understood
that, the first 50

01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:30.380 align:middle line:10%
years of the mechanism of Bruce
being the machine creating

01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:34.550 align:middle line:10%
all this kind of stuff, had
no real value until the day

01:24:34.550 --> 01:24:39.680 align:middle line:10%
I recognized the value of love,
because love is a destination.

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.320 align:middle line:10%
And that's pretty interesting,
because today's world

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:45.860 align:middle line:10%
is preoccupied with fear,
which is the complete opposite.

01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:47.900 align:middle line:10%
And until you get
out of this fear,

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:51.260 align:middle line:10%
you are not going to
manage your evolution.

01:24:51.260 --> 01:24:55.950 align:middle line:10%
You're being manipulated by
a belief that's not real.

01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:59.460 align:middle line:10%
And as a result,
that's the illusion

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.120 align:middle line:10%
that Einstein talked about.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.970 align:middle line:10%
This reality is an illusion.

01:25:02.970 --> 01:25:04.200 align:middle line:10%
You want a different reality?

01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.300 align:middle line:10%
Change your mind.

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.640 align:middle line:10%
And all of a sudden, it
says, you are powerful.

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:10.380 align:middle line:10%
You're not a victim.

01:25:10.380 --> 01:25:13.340 align:middle line:84%
If you believe you're
a victim, you are.

01:25:13.340 --> 01:25:15.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, believe.

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:18.680 align:middle line:10%
The book-- "The
Biology of Belief."

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.550 align:middle line:84%
What the heck is that
about-- oh, my god,

01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:22.175 align:middle line:84%
that's about what we
just talked about.

01:25:22.175 --> 01:25:25.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:26.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Bravo.

01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, that's great.

01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:28.490 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:30.865 align:middle line:84%
I mean Bruce, unless there's
something else that you feel

01:25:30.865 --> 01:25:32.840 align:middle line:84%
like, yeah, we need
to say this part,

01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:35.630 align:middle line:84%
it's so relevant to what you're
doing, then I feel like--

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:38.540 align:middle line:84%
>> I think you have a project
that I don't want to be involved

01:25:38.540 --> 01:25:40.310 align:middle line:90%
with.

01:25:40.310 --> 01:25:42.590 align:middle line:84%
I think you want to take
this down to five minutes

01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:45.770 align:middle line:84%
and I say, God bless
you for that effort.

01:25:45.770 --> 01:25:46.860 align:middle line:90%
>> I think it's mutual--

01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:48.990 align:middle line:84%
>> I have no idea
how you do that.

01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:50.420 align:middle line:90%
But that's a beautiful part.

01:25:50.420 --> 01:25:52.370 align:middle line:90%
OK, I leave.

01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:54.810 align:middle line:84%
And then sometime in the
future, you show me--

01:25:54.810 --> 01:25:57.140 align:middle line:84%
you see this three and a
half minute piece of you?

01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:00.260 align:middle line:10%
Everything you said
in an hour and a half

01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:03.060 align:middle line:10%
is in that three minutes.

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Good job.

01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:06.480 align:middle line:90%


01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.280 align:middle line:10%
>> Oh, no.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:11.570 align:middle line:10%
I see you in different parts of
the series, not just like, Bruce

01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:13.500 align:middle line:10%
and then that's it.

01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.522 align:middle line:10%
Because you said,
you've covered so much.

01:26:15.522 --> 01:26:16.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, well that
was the problem.

01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:18.230 align:middle line:90%
There's three different books.

01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:20.910 align:middle line:84%
The first book is the biology
of how you create your own life.

01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:23.250 align:middle line:84%
The second book
is, well, if belief

01:26:23.250 --> 01:26:24.870 align:middle line:84%
is creating our life
experience, what

01:26:24.870 --> 01:26:27.390 align:middle line:84%
is the consequence
of mass belief?

01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:29.490 align:middle line:90%
Mass manifestation.

01:26:29.490 --> 01:26:31.440 align:middle line:90%
So that's spontaneous evolution.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.600 align:middle line:84%
It says, and look
what we created?

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.650 align:middle line:90%
Self-destruction.

01:26:34.650 --> 01:26:37.650 align:middle line:90%
So that requires a new creation.

01:26:37.650 --> 01:26:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And the third one
was the honeymoon.

01:26:39.570 --> 01:26:42.510 align:middle line:90%
Because the honeymoon was, how--

01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:46.470 align:middle line:84%
besides yourself, we are
driven to be in community,

01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:50.060 align:middle line:84%
and the first community
is two people.

01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:53.180 align:middle line:10%
And if two people are
in love and two people

01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:56.220 align:middle line:10%
are living in harmony
and creativity,

01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.020 align:middle line:10%
well they're
enjoying this planet

01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:01.920 align:middle line:10%
like, oh, my god, the
garden that it really was.

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:07.200 align:middle line:10%
And it's really interesting
because, by definition, a garden

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.120 align:middle line:10%
is the height of community.

01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Every organism in that garden
is supporting the existence

01:27:12.510 --> 01:27:14.280 align:middle line:90%
of this beautiful garden.

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:17.490 align:middle line:84%
And then it's
community and harmony.

01:27:17.490 --> 01:27:19.710 align:middle line:10%
And then humans
step into the garden

01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:22.170 align:middle line:10%
and put their big feet
all over everything,

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:23.850 align:middle line:10%
are destroying things.

01:27:23.850 --> 01:27:26.400 align:middle line:84%
It's the belief that we
can do whatever we want.

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:27.780 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a garden.

01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:30.990 align:middle line:10%
And as the Indigenous people
of this planet are still here

01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:34.170 align:middle line:10%
to help us-- because
we have forgotten--

01:27:34.170 --> 01:27:37.000 align:middle line:10%
that we are gardeners.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.240 align:middle line:84%
But we've been exploiting
it and taking it apart.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.690 align:middle line:10%
And the net result is we
are now looking at doomsday

01:27:43.690 --> 01:27:45.290 align:middle line:10%
not in thousand years.

01:27:45.290 --> 01:27:46.840 align:middle line:10%
We're talking within a century.

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:49.000 align:middle line:10%
Human civilization
will be doomed

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.870 align:middle line:10%
unless we change how we
relate to the environment,

01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:54.490 align:middle line:10%
because the first
thing is this--

01:27:54.490 --> 01:27:57.760 align:middle line:10%
we evolved from the garden.

01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:01.450 align:middle line:84%
We were never separate
from the garden.

01:28:01.450 --> 01:28:03.820 align:middle line:84%
And the idea that we could
stand outside and tell

01:28:03.820 --> 01:28:06.970 align:middle line:84%
the garden what to do is
like, oh, human hubris.

01:28:06.970 --> 01:28:08.260 align:middle line:90%
We're so smart.

01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Well, we're so smart then how
come we're facing a sixth mass

01:28:10.990 --> 01:28:11.800 align:middle line:90%
extinction?

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:16.120 align:middle line:90%


01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:17.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And on that note.

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:19.410 align:middle line:90%
