She shares that Intuition typically relies on past experiences or current data, while precognition offers insights into the future beyond conventional understanding. Remote viewing, is an independent ability unaffected by present circumstances.\n\nStudies now show that there is scientific importance to adopting a receptive stance rather than an active pursuit when desiring to tap into your precognition.
