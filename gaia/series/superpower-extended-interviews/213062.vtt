00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.830 align:middle line:90%
>> I am Ervin Laszlo.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And you asked me what I
have studied all my life.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.960 align:middle line:90%
I can say I've studied life.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.690 align:middle line:10%
I have not done any
formal studies at all,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.410 align:middle line:10%
not since I was in the
fifth grade, I think.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:10%
That was the last time
when the war intervened,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.860 align:middle line:10%
the Second World War.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.490 align:middle line:10%
And I launched a
career in music.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.150 align:middle line:84%
And sure, I studied it because
I was interested in everything

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.570 align:middle line:84%
around me, interested in
finding out more things.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.380 align:middle line:90%
This is my chance.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.370 align:middle line:90%
And I had time and inclination.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.970 align:middle line:90%
So I have inquired.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.920 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't say
that I've studied.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.200 align:middle line:84%
I've not studied
anything for the sake

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.110 align:middle line:84%
of studying for getting
a degree or getting

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.310 align:middle line:90%
a diploma of some kind.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.190 align:middle line:90%
I did what I was interested in.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.440 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate in my
life that I could live

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.900 align:middle line:90%
like that as a concert pianist.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.690 align:middle line:84%
And later on when I started
writing and my books

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:84%
got published, I was invited to
a university, Yale University

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.650 align:middle line:84%
first, and then to New York
State University and others

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.650 align:middle line:84%
without having actually
passed any degree, attended

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.450 align:middle line:90%
a university.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.760 align:middle line:84%
I started teaching
on universities

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.360 align:middle line:84%
without having attended
any university course.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.160 align:middle line:90%
So I could say yes.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.920 align:middle line:10%
I have studied who I am.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.770 align:middle line:10%
I've studied what the
world around me is.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.036 align:middle line:10%
But I have not studied a subject
for the sake of that subject.

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:10%
>> You are known
for many things.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.950 align:middle line:84%
One is about the Akashic
records, the Akashic field.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.278 align:middle line:10%
And I would love for us to
be able to focus on that.

00:01:54.278 --> 00:01:58.050 align:middle line:84%
>> The Akashic field
is the universe.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:84%
It's how the universe
appears to us.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.710 align:middle line:84%
When we inquire how
things are connected,

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.820 align:middle line:84%
how things are conserved,
we find the answer today

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.289 align:middle line:90%
through the quantum sciences.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.570 align:middle line:84%
All things are connected
to all other things.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.500 align:middle line:84%
And nothing disappears
completely without a trace.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So the universe is
an Akashic field.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.410 align:middle line:84%
The ancients called
it an Akashic field.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.740 align:middle line:84%
Today, we can call it the
universe as it appears

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.660 align:middle line:90%
in the quantum sciences.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
It's an Akashic
universe, you might say.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.730 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I have felt that
what I've been considering,

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.110 align:middle line:84%
what I've been discussing so
many times, so many years is

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.710 align:middle line:84%
actually-- is being
carried out, borne out

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:84%
more and more in
the new sciences,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.980 align:middle line:84%
especially in quantum cosmology,
in quantum consciousness

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.970 align:middle line:90%
research.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.260 align:middle line:84%
This is a remarkable
Akashic kind of a universe.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.390 align:middle line:84%
4,000, 5,000 years ago,
we would have called

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.950 align:middle line:90%
it the Akashic dimension.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.840 align:middle line:90%
Today we call it reality.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.325 align:middle line:90%
But this is what it is.

00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Where did the word
Akashic come from?

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:90%
>> The Akasha was the dimension.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:84%
The Hindu seers about 4
and 1/2, 5,000 years ago

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.510 align:middle line:84%
talked about-- they said there
are four regular dimensions--

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.820 align:middle line:90%
air, water, fire, and Earth.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And they called this
the standard dimension.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.350 align:middle line:84%
But they said there is a
higher or deeper dimension,

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
if you like, which
includes all the others.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.330 align:middle line:90%
This is beyond all the others.

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.380 align:middle line:90%
It includes all the others.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.780 align:middle line:90%
It's the deep dimension.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.810 align:middle line:84%
Later on, Plato himself
talked about this

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
as a platonic
dimension of the soul,

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:90%
of our consciousness, our mind.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.410 align:middle line:84%
But the Akashic dimension
or Akasha dimension

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.325 align:middle line:84%
dates back probably
nearly 5,000 years.

00:03:57.325 --> 00:04:03.175 align:middle line:10%
>> Ervin, you were nominated for
a Nobel Prize at least twice.

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:03.975 align:middle line:10%
Is that correct?

00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:05.250 align:middle line:10%
>> That is correct, yes.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.050 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.710 align:middle line:10%
What were you nominated for?

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:15.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, my work in trying to
understand the relationships

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.680 align:middle line:84%
that make our world what it is,
the systems, a world system,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.880 align:middle line:84%
a world system where all things
are interacting and dependent

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.270 align:middle line:84%
on all other things, not
just the economy but also

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.960 align:middle line:84%
the ecology, the culture,
as well as the finance.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.410 align:middle line:90%
And this is a systemic universe.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.840 align:middle line:84%
I developed the idea of a
universe, which is based

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.030 align:middle line:90%
on the strong interconnections.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.920 align:middle line:84%
This is an Akashic
universe in a way.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.510 align:middle line:10%
Out of this modeling, if
you like, of the world

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.630 align:middle line:10%
that we have created
on Earth came

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.680 align:middle line:10%
a series of forecasts
and expectations,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.370 align:middle line:10%
provisions as to how
we could be evolving,

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.200 align:middle line:10%
how we could be developing.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.590 align:middle line:84%
My main focus always
has been on development,

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:84%
on evolution, not
just economic material

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.550 align:middle line:84%
development but the development
of culture, of thought,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.420 align:middle line:90%
of spirit as well.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
And so because I'm trying to
pull all these things together,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.420 align:middle line:84%
it doesn't fit into
any one discipline.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
The Nobel Prizes are
set up by disciplines,

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.770 align:middle line:84%
to the physics and biology
and other special disciplines.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.650 align:middle line:84%
At the time of Nobel,
there was no idea

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.590 align:middle line:84%
that we could have a super
discipline, a kind of which

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.810 align:middle line:84%
encompasses the others,
brings it together.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So this one then, I
was nominated then

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.340 align:middle line:84%
for the Peace Prize because
this idea of an interconnected

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
universe of which we are a
part where we evolve together

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.950 align:middle line:84%
with other things is a
universe of understanding,

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.220 align:middle line:84%
coherence, and ultimately,
therefore, peace.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:84%
So indirectly without
addressing my work to peace

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.680 align:middle line:84%
so specifically, I
created a foundation

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.640 align:middle line:84%
for understanding the world
as a domain of coherence

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.225 align:middle line:84%
where we can live
and evolve in peace.

00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:24.590 align:middle line:84%
>> That is your goal, is for
our world to live in peace.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.990 align:middle line:84%
I'm wondering, when it
comes to the Akashic field,

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:84%
to the universe,
that somebody might

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:90%
feel as though it's so huge.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.980 align:middle line:90%
It's so gargantuan.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:84%
Why would it be
important for them

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.050 align:middle line:84%
to understand the
interconnectedness

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:90%
of the universe?

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Because we are
interconnected.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.090 align:middle line:90%
The universe is a hologram.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.910 align:middle line:84%
And in a hologram,
all the information

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:84%
that generates the picture
is present in every part.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:84%
The universe may be
gargantuan, but it's in us.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.410 align:middle line:84%
Not only are we in the
universe, the universe

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.850 align:middle line:84%
is in us because everything that
makes the universe what it is--

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.220 align:middle line:84%
today we would call it
all the information,

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.930 align:middle line:90%
all the energy flows--

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:84%
is actually reflected in
every cell of our body,

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.290 align:middle line:90%
in every atom in every cell.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So this is not a materialistic,
cold, independent universe

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:29.220 align:middle line:90%
where all parts are separate.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.580 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is separate.

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.090 align:middle line:84%
We are part of that
whole universe.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.260 align:middle line:84%
If you want to
understand ourselves,

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.870 align:middle line:84%
we have to understand
the universe.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can't
understand the universe

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:43.336 align:middle line:84%
until we have a better
understanding of ourselves.

00:07:43.336 --> 00:07:46.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Sounds like a catch-22.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:53.176 align:middle line:84%
What information, how do we know
that we are all interconnected?

00:07:53.176 --> 00:07:58.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, we have also experiments
on the levels of physics about

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.710 align:middle line:84%
instant interconnection
beyond space and time.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.570 align:middle line:90%
It's called nonlocality.

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:07.590 align:middle line:84%
And then we have obviously
the effects of what we do.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.750 align:middle line:84%
The great ecologist
Garrett Hardin

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:14.130 align:middle line:84%
says you can't do just one thing
because you do any one thing,

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:19.560 align:middle line:84%
it has a dozen or a million
consequences and side effects.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.200 align:middle line:84%
We are connected
because everything we do

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.960 align:middle line:90%
is linked to everything else.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.210 align:middle line:90%
It's like being in a network.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:31.590 align:middle line:84%
When you're in a network, all
the participants in a network

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.919 align:middle line:84%
hear, know, perceive
what you're doing.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.549 align:middle line:90%
And they respond.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.679 align:middle line:84%
And that is the nature
of the universe.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a coherent-- it's
a single universe.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.840 align:middle line:90%
It's a one universe.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.660 align:middle line:84%
The great physicist
Erwin Schrödinger

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.720 align:middle line:84%
said there is no such thing as
consciousness in the plural.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.000 align:middle line:90%
Now, what did he mean by that?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.760 align:middle line:84%
He said there is no such
thing as my consciousness

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.290 align:middle line:90%
and your consciousness.

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.930 align:middle line:84%
It's only our consciousness,
the one consciousness

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:84%
which pervades the universe
because the universe has

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.090 align:middle line:84%
an aspect, which is mind-like,
not just physical-like, not

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.440 align:middle line:90%
just matter-like.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.920 align:middle line:84%
There is no longer a separation
between mind and matter.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.110 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is beyond
any other thing.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.520 align:middle line:84%
So it's an entirely
new way of thinking.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.640 align:middle line:84%
It's also a very old way because
the great thinkers of antiquity,

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.280 align:middle line:84%
the Buddhists, for example,
the Taoists knew this.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And they considered the universe
as an interconnected whole,

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:35.080 align:middle line:84%
which is suffused
by a higher spirit.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:84%
In modern science, in
contemporary science,

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.670 align:middle line:84%
we talk about an interconnected
dynamic attractors

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:48.280 align:middle line:84%
are dynamic impulses which are
present in the universe, which

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.460 align:middle line:84%
is present in us,
in each one of us.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.090 align:middle line:84%
We reflect the universe
because we are connected to it,

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:90%
we are part of it.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:00.520 align:middle line:84%
These concepts are so basic,
so large that you can't simply

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:05.350 align:middle line:84%
deduct them, reduce them, or
derive them from something else.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:06.700 align:middle line:90%
They are fundamental.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.110 align:middle line:90%
This is how we start.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.570 align:middle line:84%
It's not how we come
to this conclusion

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.010 align:middle line:90%
from looking at something else.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:14.410 align:middle line:84%
This something
else is also this.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:84%
Schrodinger says, you can't
go beyond consciousness.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.200 align:middle line:90%
And consciousness is one.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So what we start
with and what we have

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.830 align:middle line:84%
is the sense that
we are a being who

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:31.180 align:middle line:84%
is emerged in space and time,
who is evolving in space

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.820 align:middle line:84%
and time, and who
is interconnecting

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:38.995 align:middle line:84%
with all other things that
evolve in space and time.

00:10:38.995 --> 00:10:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Ervin, is it true that
humans create a past, a present,

00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and a future and that really
time is just there is no time

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:90%
that we know.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So to that end, does that
mean that the information

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:58.180 align:middle line:84%
for our future or
definitely our past

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:84%
is somewhere as if it's
a big gigantic library?

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:07.350 align:middle line:84%
It's the Akashic
records, if you like.

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Information cannot be
created and cannot be deleted

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:18.080 align:middle line:84%
because this is a world which
is an interconnected field.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why I call
it the Akashic field

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:24.400 align:middle line:84%
because the Akashic records
are maintained in this field.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.700 align:middle line:84%
This field is an energy
and information field.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.250 align:middle line:84%
It's a quantum field and
strongly interconnected.

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:84%
Reflecting one thing
reflects another.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.220 align:middle line:84%
Things don't just push
and pull each other.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.650 align:middle line:90%
They resonate with each other.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.210 align:middle line:90%
They show up again.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.540 align:middle line:84%
There is such a thing as
information created here

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.370 align:middle line:90%
having an effect over there.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:53.560 align:middle line:84%
And over there could be another
planet, could be another galaxy.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.570 align:middle line:84%
As far as we know, this universe
is a single resonated field

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.290 align:middle line:84%
in which all things are
connected with all other things.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:04.240 align:middle line:90%
This is a basic concept.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a basic concept that
has been known, as I said,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.620 align:middle line:90%
to the ancient thinkers.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.810 align:middle line:90%
It's re-emerging today.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.730 align:middle line:84%
And it gives us an
entirely different view

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.810 align:middle line:84%
from the standard classical view
of a material universe where

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.880 align:middle line:84%
bits and pieces
of matter are just

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.300 align:middle line:84%
moving about in passive
space and in different time.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.340 align:middle line:90%
That's the Newtonian paradigm.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.240 align:middle line:84%
And that has led to this
machine concept of the universe

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.880 align:middle line:84%
where everything is
separate, everything

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.870 align:middle line:84%
can be treated individually,
where things can be broken apart

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps can
be rebuilt again.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.640 align:middle line:84%
But everything is
basically separate.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Einstein said that this
separation is an illusion.

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And I think all the
great physicists,

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.440 align:middle line:84%
the great scientists
today concur

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:51.410 align:middle line:90%
there is no absolute separation.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I am not here and
you over there.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:57.230 align:middle line:84%
We share the same space
and the same time.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle line:84%
And our destiny is
also interlinked.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:03.260 align:middle line:84%
I believe that everything
that ever happened

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.920 align:middle line:84%
is here to influence
what is happening now.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:84%
I don't believe that
it determines what is

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:90%
going to happen in the future.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:14.900 align:middle line:84%
I think this universe
has a degree of freedom.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Things can be created.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.780 align:middle line:90%
Things can evolve.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.360 align:middle line:90%
Things can be decided yet.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.610 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're living through
an epoch now after the--

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:29.660 align:middle line:84%
we're still in the pandemic but
certainly after a big crisis

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:32.600 align:middle line:84%
in which many things
become possible.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:37.170 align:middle line:84%
But these many things are
not prescribed in the past.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:84%
We can create the future, not
without limits, of course.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:44.430 align:middle line:84%
It has to be built on what
has already been there.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:47.820 align:middle line:84%
But the past does not
determine the future.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.800 align:middle line:84%
The future is determined by
how we interact in the present.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.090 align:middle line:90%
Together, all of us--

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:57.500 align:middle line:84%
that means all beings
in space and time--

00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:02.576 align:middle line:84%
through their interaction create
the world that is coming to be.

00:14:02.576 --> 00:14:06.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Ervin, how do you think it
came to be that we decided we

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.926 align:middle line:90%
were separate from one another?

00:14:08.926 --> 00:14:10.680 align:middle line:90%
>> It's convenient.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:84%
It's very convenient
to take things apart,

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.580 align:middle line:90%
and then you can manipulate it.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:15.840 align:middle line:90%
You build a bicycle.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.670 align:middle line:84%
And if the pedal doesn't
work, you change the pedal.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.470 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.450 align:middle line:90%
Or the spokes on the wheel.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.020 align:middle line:90%
It's very convenient.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.020 align:middle line:84%
You can take things
apart, fix it,

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.340 align:middle line:90%
and put it back together again.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the ideal.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
In nature also, we can take
what we want from nature,

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.960 align:middle line:84%
then we can manipulate things
and replace it somehow.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.400 align:middle line:90%
But it's all separate.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.890 align:middle line:84%
It all can be
independently handled.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.350 align:middle line:84%
Technology is based on
that, materials technology,

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.030 align:middle line:84%
not the new technology, not
the electronic technology.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:84%
The way we are registered
in this conversation

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.860 align:middle line:84%
that we have across
the continents

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.630 align:middle line:90%
is not a material phenomenon.

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not a little bits of matter
being moved here and there.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:04.720 align:middle line:84%
It's information being
cycled simultaneously.

00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And in reality, it's
even cycled even more

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.930 align:middle line:84%
because we in our deeper
sense with our consciousness,

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.960 align:middle line:84%
we can perceive others
in a deeper sense.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.880 align:middle line:84%
And the great yogis
have known this.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.190 align:middle line:84%
The great spiritual
masters have known this.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:25.570 align:middle line:84%
And now this experiment for the
nonlocality of consciousness,

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:30.010 align:middle line:84%
for distance remote
perceptions, remote healing,

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.125 align:middle line:84%
there is new evidence
for all of this.

00:15:32.125 --> 00:15:34.360 align:middle line:84%
This is very, very
different from

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.660 align:middle line:84%
the separate
materialistic world which

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.060 align:middle line:84%
our fathers and forefathers
thought they had.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.520 align:middle line:84%
And because they
created technologies,

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:46.720 align:middle line:84%
they created a world based on
that materialist, separatist

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.320 align:middle line:84%
idea, they could
destroy the harmony.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:53.620 align:middle line:84%
They could destroy the oneness,
which otherwise would be there

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:54.760 align:middle line:90%
in nature.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So that was a dangerous
way to proceed.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.200 align:middle line:90%
We are learning it.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.780 align:middle line:84%
And we are also paying
the cost of what

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.660 align:middle line:84%
it is when you break apart
the resonance, the wholeness

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:90%
of the world in which we live.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.060 align:middle line:84%
And we just look at
one thing at a time,

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.870 align:middle line:84%
us seeing our nation,
our country first,

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.160 align:middle line:90%
never mind the rest.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.980 align:middle line:84%
That kind of
thinking takes apart

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.050 align:middle line:90%
the coherence of the whole.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:23.060 align:middle line:84%
And it breaks apart
the very basis of life.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:24.590 align:middle line:90%
Let me just add.

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:10%
Life is only possible if
every quantum, every particle

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:33.170 align:middle line:10%
in every cell of
our body cooperates

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.970 align:middle line:10%
with every other cell.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:38.240 align:middle line:84%
If there is a break in
cooperation anywhere,

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.080 align:middle line:90%
it's a disease.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.060 align:middle line:84%
If there is a break
in cooperation

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:84%
and their subsidiary elements
of cooperation come together,

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.830 align:middle line:90%
that's a disease.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:48.090 align:middle line:90%
That's a serious disease.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.950 align:middle line:90%
That's cancer.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:55.650 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, that separate
development of growth

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.320 align:middle line:90%
is killing the host, as we know.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:04.089 align:middle line:84%
So just in this whole body
is a cooperative system,

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:09.839 align:middle line:84%
so is the whole human world, the
whole world in the biosphere,

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.490 align:middle line:90%
a cooperative system.

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:13.980 align:middle line:90%
We have neglected it.

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.300 align:middle line:90%
We have forgotten it.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:16.740 align:middle line:90%
We have ignored it.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.430 align:middle line:90%
And we are paying the price.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.040 align:middle line:90%
We are now coming back to it.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:84%
It takes sometimes a crisis
to make us see the light,

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.210 align:middle line:90%
to make us see which way to go.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.460 align:middle line:90%
Now we are learning.

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:29.190 align:middle line:84%
I think we have learned
just now that we

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.760 align:middle line:90%
are all in the same boat.

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:35.070 align:middle line:84%
What happens any one part has an
influence on every other part,

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.040 align:middle line:84%
and that together,
we have the option,

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.680 align:middle line:84%
option not only to
mechanically go on

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.350 align:middle line:84%
and doing the same thing as
we have always been doing

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:46.350 align:middle line:84%
but to do something,
what we really want

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:50.100 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
permissible universe.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.260 align:middle line:84%
A permissive universe
in that sense,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.660 align:middle line:90%
it allows many things to happen.

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.420 align:middle line:84%
We are not forced
into a cage, not

00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:01.140 align:middle line:84%
forced into a big wheel where
we can only do one thing.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.240 align:middle line:84%
That's a lesson we
are now learning.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.510 align:middle line:84%
And we have to make use of it
because we cannot just keep

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.310 align:middle line:84%
going doing what
we have been doing.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what leads to
more and more breakdowns.

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.560 align:middle line:84%
We have to go forward
and create a world

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.680 align:middle line:84%
where all people interact,
where all people can live,

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.580 align:middle line:90%
all people can flourish.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.370 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.720 align:middle line:90%
The information is there.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Our technologies properly
used, properly developed

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.670 align:middle line:90%
can serve this.

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.210 align:middle line:90%
It's up to us.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.520 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's a
tremendous opportunity.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.890 align:middle line:90%
It's an exciting time to live.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:36.020 align:middle line:84%
I wouldn't exchange it for
any other time in history.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's
saying a lot, Ervin.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.670 align:middle line:84%
There is things that seem to get
in the way of being able to have

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.950 align:middle line:84%
the kind of peace
that you talk about,

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:50.780 align:middle line:84%
egos and all of the things
that come with that.

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.290 align:middle line:84%
Do you think it's even
possible for humans

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.730 align:middle line:90%
to have this kind of peace?

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Nature has that
kind of a peace.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.170 align:middle line:84%
I live here in a
hilltop in Tuscany.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.120 align:middle line:90%
And I see nature around me.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.500 align:middle line:90%
Nature is whole.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.330 align:middle line:90%
Nature is harmonious.

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:10.910 align:middle line:84%
It's we who created
this harmony,

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:13.070 align:middle line:84%
so it's not something
we have to create.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.250 align:middle line:84%
It's something we
have to eliminate,

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.990 align:middle line:90%
eliminate the disturbance.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:21.050 align:middle line:84%
We have become a
noise in the system.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:25.290 align:middle line:84%
We have got to get rid of this,
go back to what we truly are.

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:90%
We are part of a whole system.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.280 align:middle line:84%
We are a whole
harmonious resonant part.

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.690 align:middle line:84%
We have got to learn to act
like we are what we truly are.

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:38.540 align:middle line:84%
We are healthy
when we are whole.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
And very interestingly
enough, in several languages

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.580 align:middle line:84%
that I know, even the
very concept of health

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.980 align:middle line:90%
means wholeness.

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.410 align:middle line:90%
And this is true.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:90%
And the ancients knew it.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking at some
ancient scriptures, for example,

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:90%
about health.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.730 align:middle line:84%
And they all say, the
person who is well adjusted,

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.090 align:middle line:84%
the person who has moral
virtues, the person who

00:20:03.090 --> 00:20:06.150 align:middle line:84%
can live together in
peace with others, that's

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:08.400 align:middle line:90%
the person who is healthy.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And they've told this to
us thousands of years ago.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.210 align:middle line:84%
We just thought we
can make ourselves

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.260 align:middle line:84%
healthy by mechanical,
biochemical, biophysical means.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.270 align:middle line:84%
That can help, of
course, sometimes

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.980 align:middle line:90%
if there is a disease at hand.

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:27.300 align:middle line:84%
But the way to be
healthy is to be one,

00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:31.770 align:middle line:84%
to respect your oneness within
your body and your oneness

00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:33.360 align:middle line:90%
with the world around you.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:90%
That's healthy.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:90%
That's flourishing.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.690 align:middle line:90%
That's peace.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:45.260 align:middle line:84%
Peace, health, oneness
are all the same concept.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:50.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Back up a little bit, Ervin,
you mentioned very quickly that

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:84%
you had a second chance studying
the way that you did, reading,

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:56.630 align:middle line:90%
and learning.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:02.716 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering what you
meant by, I had a second chance.

00:21:02.716 --> 00:21:07.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I shifted from being
a professional concert pianist

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:12.090 align:middle line:84%
to being an academic, and then
later on, I shifted from being

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.060 align:middle line:84%
an academic into being
a public servant,

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:17.760 align:middle line:84%
a civil servant at
the United Nations,

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.350 align:middle line:84%
and then finally becoming a
freelance thinker and consultant

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:23.820 align:middle line:90%
and writer.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.230 align:middle line:84%
So I had many second
chances in a way.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.960 align:middle line:84%
I have been always
impatient in the sense

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:33.290 align:middle line:84%
of not wanting to put up with
the same thing year after year.

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:35.390 align:middle line:84%
I was inquiring,
looking forward,

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.230 align:middle line:84%
trying to find out who I am,
what the world is around me.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:45.530 align:middle line:84%
And I managed to get it as
a basis actually for living.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:50.570 align:middle line:84%
I never lived, I never worked
simply just to get a paycheck.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:52.610 align:middle line:90%
Maybe this sounds selfish.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.360 align:middle line:84%
But it has been my ambition,
my aspiration in life

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.760 align:middle line:90%
to follow what I want to do.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:02.630 align:middle line:84%
I was fortunate in having a
wonderful wife and family, two

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.610 align:middle line:84%
boys and several grandchildren,
two great-grandchildren

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:10.130 align:middle line:84%
at the present time, and
understanding colleagues

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.520 align:middle line:84%
around me with whom I
could create the Laszlo

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Institute of New
Paradigm Research

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and carry forward this
work in such a way

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:23.570 align:middle line:84%
that it would benefit not
only us to live from one day

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.730 align:middle line:84%
to the next but
benefit by bringing

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.640 align:middle line:84%
in information, knowledge,
ultimately wisdom

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.606 align:middle line:90%
into the world.

00:22:31.606 --> 00:22:36.970 align:middle line:84%
>> Other people call you a
child prodigy with piano.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.365 align:middle line:90%
Would you agree with that?

00:22:38.365 --> 00:22:39.970 align:middle line:90%
>> That's what it's called.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:45.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think that you
tapped into the Akashic field,

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.910 align:middle line:84%
or do you think that ability
came from somewhere else.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:53.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an experience that
one has when one plays music.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:58.120 align:middle line:84%
Great music played perfectly,
the way that it should be played

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.490 align:middle line:84%
is you're no longer
in this world.

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:02.630 align:middle line:90%
You are in another dimension.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:08.590 align:middle line:84%
It's a dynamic dimension of
wholeness, peace, of resonance.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And that experience
I've had since a child.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.620 align:middle line:90%
My mother was a piano teacher.

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.570 align:middle line:90%
My uncle was a philosopher.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:19.270 align:middle line:84%
I had a heavily
charged childhood

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:23.110 align:middle line:84%
as it were because I
had my piano practice

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.090 align:middle line:84%
sessions in the
morning with my mother,

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.690 align:middle line:84%
walks with my uncle in
the park in the afternoon,

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.210 align:middle line:84%
talking about things
like understanding

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.100 align:middle line:84%
in the world, things
like living with nature

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and this kind of thing, which is
very unusual for a small child.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I thought I forgot
all these things

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:44.060 align:middle line:84%
until I was in my
late teens when

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:48.740 align:middle line:84%
I was having quite a successful
concert career in New York

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.140 align:middle line:84%
City with Life
articles appearing

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.990 align:middle line:84%
on me in "Life Magazine,"
in "Time," and in "Newsweek"

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:55.140 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.220 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a sudden,
this idea cropped up,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.330 align:middle line:90%
but why am I doing this?

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.250 align:middle line:90%
What am I doing?

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.780 align:middle line:84%
And then these are
the questions that you

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.780 align:middle line:84%
ask when you turn to
science and to philosophy.

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.640 align:middle line:90%
So I turned that way.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.880 align:middle line:90%
I started attending courses.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.600 align:middle line:84%
I started cultivating friends
who had similar questions,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:84%
asking these questions, trying
to set out answers of my own.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.800 align:middle line:84%
And then by a fortunate
coincidence or perhaps not

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.770 align:middle line:84%
a coincidence, but
it seems like that,

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.680 align:middle line:84%
these notes got
published as a book,

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.660 align:middle line:84%
even though I didn't have
any background in philosophy

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:34.460 align:middle line:90%
and science.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:38.030 align:middle line:84%
My degree came as a child
prodigy when I was 15 years old.

00:24:38.030 --> 00:24:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I got an artist degree in
music at the Franz Liszt

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:90%
Academy in Budapest.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:84%
But I had no academic
qualifications.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.770 align:middle line:84%
And yet when I wrote this
book and was published,

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.440 align:middle line:84%
I got an invitation from
the Philosophy Department

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:56.950 align:middle line:84%
in Yale University to come and
give seminars on this thinking

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.095 align:middle line:90%
on my ideas.

00:24:58.095 --> 00:24:58.970 align:middle line:90%
So I went over there.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:03.060 align:middle line:84%
And I was launched then on a
career in the academic world,

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:06.430 align:middle line:84%
going from there to
various other universities.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:10.020 align:middle line:84%
And so it's something
that I just followed.

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.180 align:middle line:84%
And it's not because
it was prescribed.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:14.100 align:middle line:84%
It was something
that is happening

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:20.730 align:middle line:84%
to me, coming to me from the
experience of music as a child.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.900 align:middle line:84%
From the age of nine, I was
playing concerts solo and also

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.220 align:middle line:90%
with orchestra.

00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And performing to a public
with a group of musicians

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.230 align:middle line:84%
who follow you, who
become one with you

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:38.630 align:middle line:84%
is such an incredible
experience.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:43.390 align:middle line:84%
It's a feeling sense of being
fulfilled or being one or being

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.100 align:middle line:90%
carried forward.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:46.990 align:middle line:90%
It's difficult to describe.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:90%
But that's what motivated me.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.990 align:middle line:84%
That's what I've been
searching for in science also.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.290 align:middle line:84%
Wherever I see, I
search for that oneness,

00:25:56.290 --> 00:26:01.900 align:middle line:84%
for that interaction for
this collaboration, which

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.190 align:middle line:84%
makes the body, a living
body, makes it whole.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:10.940 align:middle line:84%
A society becomes healthy if
it has this collaboration.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.640 align:middle line:90%
I'm searching for that.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.100 align:middle line:84%
And I try to
contribute by showing

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.170 align:middle line:90%
that nature operates like that.

00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.240 align:middle line:90%
The universe is like that.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Even the universe,
as we saw before,

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.800 align:middle line:84%
is an Akashic field where
all things are connected,

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.510 align:middle line:90%
all things are conserved.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I feel that this
is based on what I experience,

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:32.440 align:middle line:90%
what I've always experienced.

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:35.120 align:middle line:84%
And I want to cultivate
this experience.

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:39.160 align:middle line:84%
It is what makes me whole
and makes me living.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you say that
on a regular basis,

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:48.360 align:middle line:84%
you consciously connect to
the Akashic field every day?

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Not consciously,
subconsciously, deeply,

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.130 align:middle line:90%
spiritually, yes.

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:84%
I have a little place
here in my house,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.560 align:middle line:84%
but it could have been
anywhere else, which

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:05.120 align:middle line:84%
is a little shrine or a
little place of meditation,

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:09.530 align:middle line:84%
has a Buddha in it for a
feeling of timelessness

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:14.450 align:middle line:84%
and which is a beautiful
view opening to a valley that

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:19.890 align:middle line:84%
has been not only permanently
inhabited but also permanently

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:20.690 align:middle line:90%
worked.

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.810 align:middle line:84%
The land has been permanently
worked for 5,000 years

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:84%
from the Etruscan times,
which was before the Romans.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:33.170 align:middle line:84%
And this valley has something
very human about it.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:38.550 align:middle line:84%
It shows the interaction of
people, of humanity with nature,

00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.840 align:middle line:84%
not as something that
we impose on nature.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And new settlements very often
are industrial settlements

00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:49.700 align:middle line:84%
or just massive
living settlements,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.150 align:middle line:84%
which are something that you
put over, place on nature,

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:54.810 align:middle line:90%
doesn't really belong to it.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:58.290 align:middle line:84%
Here I have a sense that
we belong to nature,

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.630 align:middle line:84%
that this valley
has been existing.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And it is part of humanity
to be part of this valley.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:12.370 align:middle line:84%
So I feel that my experience is
one which gives me the strength

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:16.600 align:middle line:84%
to move forward, gives me the
strength also to have whatever

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.370 align:middle line:90%
insight I possess.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And people claim
that I could show

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.620 align:middle line:90%
them the way to some insights.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:28.000 align:middle line:84%
And that is something not that I
manufacture, not that I create,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.490 align:middle line:90%
not that I do consciously.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:36.280 align:middle line:84%
This connection that I have to
the field is a subconscious,

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:90%
is a spontaneous connection.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.530 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can
have it any other way.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:44.620 align:middle line:84%
I think we must be in a
different altered state

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.560 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness in
order to really connect

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.110 align:middle line:84%
to the field, the
ordinary state--

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.720 align:middle line:84%
And we can measure this
by the EEG patterns,

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.550 align:middle line:84%
the electroencephalographic
patterns,

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:57.740 align:middle line:84%
in ordinary states of
delta, for example.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:90%
We see the world around us.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.240 align:middle line:84%
And we go down deeper down
to alpha and beta and theta.

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I think
we can also have

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:10.930 align:middle line:84%
experiences that go beyond
the everyday sites around us.

00:29:10.930 --> 00:29:13.700 align:middle line:90%
We are in a deeper dimension.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.160 align:middle line:90%
I connect through music.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.790 align:middle line:84%
I connect through ideas,
through great literature,

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.380 align:middle line:84%
through enjoying
nature, and also

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:27.090 align:middle line:84%
through enjoying creating
theories that makes sense to me.

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.530 align:middle line:90%
And I try to communicate.

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.850 align:middle line:84%
And I hope it makes
sense to others.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:33.160 align:middle line:84%
That is the experience
that I have.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
experience that I

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.860 align:middle line:84%
pursue with all
the time and energy

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.190 align:middle line:90%
to have at my disposition.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:44.790 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you connect, if
I'm following you correctly,

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:48.885 align:middle line:84%
it feels like this
tremendous sense of oneness?

00:29:48.885 --> 00:29:52.770 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many
ways to it, many ways.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung already
has pointed out

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.630 align:middle line:84%
that our everyday
consciousness is just

00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:01.050 align:middle line:84%
a thin layer over a
deeper consciousness,

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:05.010 align:middle line:84%
our psyche is much more than
the surface consciousness

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:84%
of looking at things and events
and interacting with them.

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:12.430 align:middle line:90%
We have a deeper sense.

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:18.180 align:middle line:84%
So we are actually connected
by nature, by the universe.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.520 align:middle line:90%
We are connected being.

00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.290 align:middle line:90%
But we eliminate it.

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is
not only an avenue

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:29.960 align:middle line:84%
to a deeper connection, a
deeper dimension of the world.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.900 align:middle line:90%
It's also a filter.

00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Everyday consciousness
is a filter.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:40.240 align:middle line:84%
It filters out what we could be
feeling, what we could perceive

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.530 align:middle line:84%
by reducing it only to
the everyday happenings

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:48.040 align:middle line:84%
to the items that are
immediately close to us.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:52.360 align:middle line:84%
Einstein, Schrödinger, Jung,
all the great scientists

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:55.000 align:middle line:90%
have come across this notion.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.100 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is not only
a new avenue, an opening,

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.430 align:middle line:90%
it's also a restriction.

00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:07.040 align:middle line:84%
But it's up to us
whether we stay

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:11.800 align:middle line:84%
within that kind of restricted
everyday consciousness

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.060 align:middle line:90%
or whether we go deeper.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.890 align:middle line:90%
We can all go deeper.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:19.120 align:middle line:84%
We can all enter
into altered states.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.130 align:middle line:90%
Prayer does that.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.260 align:middle line:90%
Meditation does that.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.820 align:middle line:90%
Art does that.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Nature does that.

00:31:27.550 --> 00:31:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And so our culture
and the highest levels

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:34.560 align:middle line:84%
of cultural expression are
these expressions of oneness,

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.030 align:middle line:90%
of belonging.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:40.930 align:middle line:84%
And when young people today they
talk about unconditional love,

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.060 align:middle line:90%
they talk about this experience.

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.340 align:middle line:84%
You can't just talk
about unconditional love.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.840 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what it means.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.040 align:middle line:90%
You must feel it.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.810 align:middle line:90%
You must experience it.

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:54.570 align:middle line:84%
And people who do that, who
really talk about it, who really

00:31:54.570 --> 00:32:00.800 align:middle line:84%
are a sense of this
love, projected,

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.390 align:middle line:84%
created toward
receiving this love also

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:09.710 align:middle line:84%
from everything, that is then
they are in another dimension.

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:13.110 align:middle line:84%
They're entering into the true
dimension, which you and I,

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.990 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about the
Akashic dimension.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:17.240 align:middle line:90%
It's also the quantum dimension.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:20.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the new science,
new spirituality.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.820 align:middle line:84%
The two things are
no longer separate.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.690 align:middle line:84%
The new science bears
out many of the insights

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:29.660 align:middle line:84%
of great spirituality of
the thousands of years.

00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:30.770 align:middle line:90%
I'm exploring this.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.690 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my tasks,
one of my mission,

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:39.830 align:middle line:84%
a sense of exploring the great
truths that have been expressed

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:42.170 align:middle line:84%
coming to the fore
thousands of years

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:46.670 align:middle line:84%
ago, how they are transmitted
today in science because they

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:48.980 align:middle line:84%
are there in science,
whether it comes

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
to healthy living, good eating,
good rapport with each other,

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.740 align:middle line:90%
with nature.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.360 align:middle line:90%
It has all been known.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.000 align:middle line:84%
And now the new biology, the
quantum biology, the quantum

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.990 align:middle line:84%
psychology, the consciousness
research, the new physics

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:08.070 align:middle line:84%
telling us that this indeed is
not just imagination, that's

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.966 align:middle line:90%
the way things are.

00:33:09.966 --> 00:33:15.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Many people assume that they
have an inability to be able

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
to reach those altered states
of course without using drugs.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:22.900 align:middle line:84%
And they don't feel they
have a sense of creativity.

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:26.320 align:middle line:84%
Is there something that
you can offer to inspire

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.195 align:middle line:90%
people who feel that way?

00:33:28.195 --> 00:33:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that is a mistake.

00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:36.870 align:middle line:84%
That is a dangerous fallacy
of the modern mindset.

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:39.690 align:middle line:84%
These people consciously
or subconsciously

00:33:39.690 --> 00:33:43.500 align:middle line:84%
operate on the Newtonian
paradigm, which says,

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:48.030 align:middle line:84%
the only reality is bits
of matter called atoms

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:52.320 align:middle line:84%
moving around in passive
space and in different time.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.520 align:middle line:90%
And we are just that.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.630 align:middle line:84%
And going anything beyond
it is just imagination.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:59.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is the normal
paradigm, which

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.550 align:middle line:90%
is no longer valid in science.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:06.460 align:middle line:84%
But it's still
powerful in society.

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.070 align:middle line:84%
People who feel
like you are saying,

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.739 align:middle line:84%
they can't go
beyond the surface,

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:14.500 align:middle line:84%
they operate on the
basis of this paradigm.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:20.679 align:middle line:84%
Very often what we believe
influences what we actually see.

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:25.540 align:middle line:84%
Very often we don't even see or
perceive what we don't believe.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.310 align:middle line:84%
And when these
people don't believe

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that they can go beyond it,
they don't go beyond it.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:32.840 align:middle line:90%
They can't.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.300 align:middle line:90%
We have to open up.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.620 align:middle line:90%
The first thing is to open up.

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.350 align:middle line:84%
The great blessing in
disguise, if I might say,

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:42.429 align:middle line:84%
the current pandemic is
that it opens up people.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:45.650 align:middle line:84%
It's more than the
world as usual.

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:47.199 align:middle line:90%
There is more to this world.

00:34:47.199 --> 00:34:48.909 align:middle line:84%
There are more
possibilities also,

00:34:48.909 --> 00:34:52.550 align:middle line:84%
more dangers but
more opportunities.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:57.309 align:middle line:84%
And so this old
mindset, the restricted,

00:34:57.309 --> 00:35:01.030 align:middle line:84%
just me, just this world, just
this bits of metal around me,

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:05.140 align:middle line:84%
just this one life, all this
paradigm is breaking down.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:07.240 align:middle line:84%
That is the blessing
in disguise.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:10.240 align:middle line:84%
>> You're saying that
quantum consciousness,

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:15.200 align:middle line:84%
the Akashic field, the
universe, it's all the same.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:18.550 align:middle line:84%
So to that, could you
give us a definition

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.556 align:middle line:90%
of quantum consciousness?

00:35:21.556 --> 00:35:28.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Entering into the one
consciousness of the universe.

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.270 align:middle line:10%
We talked about spirit.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:38.060 align:middle line:84%
You could talk about
God, the Dao, the Buddha,

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.070 align:middle line:84%
all this kind of
the great spirit

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.560 align:middle line:90%
as in the animistic religions.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.750 align:middle line:84%
There's always a
sense that there

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:49.250 align:middle line:84%
is more to this world than
just the everyday reality.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:52.430 align:middle line:84%
And perceiving that
feeling into it

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.070 align:middle line:84%
is to enter into a
different domain.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:58.100 align:middle line:84%
It calls for a different
sense of consciousness.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.660 align:middle line:84%
Quantum consciousness
is to enter into it.

00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.860 align:middle line:84%
No wonder that the great
religions and spiritual systems

00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.290 align:middle line:90%
always had rituals and rites.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:12.770 align:middle line:84%
These are all avenues
in which you can promote

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:16.060 align:middle line:90%
the opening of consciousness.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:18.310 align:middle line:90%
Drugs is also another one.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:19.960 align:middle line:90%
Some of them are dangerous.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.750 align:middle line:84%
And of course, some of
these religious scriptures

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:25.840 align:middle line:84%
become just dry
dogmas if you're not

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.340 align:middle line:84%
taking the spirit
of the religion

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.750 align:middle line:90%
but only the word of it.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:34.070 align:middle line:84%
The best way is to proceed on
your own experience, to open up.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.720 align:middle line:90%
Children are open.

00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Children live in a
miraculous world.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:41.230 align:middle line:90%
But this is a miraculous world.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:43.470 align:middle line:84%
And we got to learn in
it, just like artists

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:44.890 align:middle line:90%
do continue to live.

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:48.600 align:middle line:84%
I think a great artist
remains a child in that sense.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.240 align:middle line:84%
We don't lose that
sense of wonder.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.980 align:middle line:84%
Again, just to
quote Einstein again

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:55.260 align:middle line:84%
who said so many
wonderful things, he said,

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.260 align:middle line:84%
"There are two ways to
live your life, either

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:02.180 align:middle line:84%
as if everything is a
miracle or as if nothing is."

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.510 align:middle line:84%
Well, these people
who are working

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:09.020 align:middle line:84%
on the old paradigm and the
Newtonian restrictive paradigm,

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:10.700 align:middle line:90%
they think nothing is a miracle.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.520 align:middle line:84%
Everything is just bits
of matter moving around,

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.660 align:middle line:90%
pushed around by energy.

00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.670 align:middle line:84%
If you look at new
science and link it again

00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:22.670 align:middle line:84%
with the old ancient
spirituality insights,

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:26.270 align:middle line:84%
you live in a different
universe because then it

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:27.440 align:middle line:90%
opens up for you.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.170 align:middle line:84%
And you know that you
are part of something

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.570 align:middle line:90%
which you can call divine.

00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:35.840 align:middle line:84%
Certainly, it's more than
the everyday material world.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.130 align:middle line:90%
It is there.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:40.010 align:middle line:90%
And we can become part of it.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:42.260 align:middle line:90%
Our consciousness can join it.

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:46.495 align:middle line:84%
That is to me having a
real quantum consciousness.

00:37:46.495 --> 00:37:50.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So everything that you've
been talking about for the most

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.140 align:middle line:84%
part, would you say is that
all a part of the conscious

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:55.710 align:middle line:90%
revolution?

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:58.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a revolution
of consciousness.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.773 align:middle line:84%
In fact, something
like 15 years ago,

00:38:00.773 --> 00:38:02.440 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book called
"The Consciousness

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.310 align:middle line:84%
Revolution" with Stanislav
Grof and Peter Russell.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:10.030 align:middle line:84%
So I've been thinking about
this idea of a revolution

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:11.200 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness, yes.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And now people start
talking about it.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:16.180 align:middle line:84%
Before, I was perhaps a
bit ahead of the times

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.010 align:middle line:84%
because people didn't
understand what

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:21.620 align:middle line:84%
I mean by a revolution
of consciousness.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.310 align:middle line:84%
Now becoming more
aware of the fact

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:28.540 align:middle line:84%
that there is more to
the world than our body,

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.940 align:middle line:84%
than the cells of our
body, or if you like,

00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.460 align:middle line:84%
the cells of our
body themselves are

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:38.680 align:middle line:84%
a conscious, remarkable,
coherent, oneness, oriented

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.760 align:middle line:90%
entity.

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:42.070 align:middle line:90%
Everything is around us.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:43.960 align:middle line:90%
It's a miraculous universe.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.200 align:middle line:84%
So living in this
universe is to live

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.790 align:middle line:90%
with a different consciousness.

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:53.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you begin
to realize this,

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:56.970 align:middle line:84%
then it's a revolution on
the level of consciousness.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:02.400 align:middle line:84%
But it's also a return, a
return back to ancient wisdom.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.260 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a book, my most
recent, published book,

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.180 align:middle line:84%
which was published a
couple of months ago.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:11.070 align:middle line:84%
It's called "Reconnecting
to the Source."

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And I mean reconnecting
with consciousness,

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:18.570 align:middle line:84%
with our whole sense to
something which is deeper

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:20.730 align:middle line:84%
than the everyday
world, the source

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:24.330 align:middle line:84%
out of which came the world
because now we recognize.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:27.930 align:middle line:84%
And very few people,
other than some really

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:35.040 align:middle line:84%
hard-nosed believers,
old believers,

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.040 align:middle line:84%
would contest that
the world is evolving,

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.860 align:middle line:84%
that evolution is a
fact, that we were not

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.490 align:middle line:84%
born like this
ever myriads years

00:39:44.490 --> 00:39:47.930 align:middle line:84%
ago, that we evolved
from common origins.

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:52.130 align:middle line:84%
And if we do so, then
out of which we evolved

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.280 align:middle line:84%
must have had the seeds
of what we became.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.050 align:middle line:90%
It was all there.

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:00.100 align:middle line:84%
The spirit that makes
the universe what it is

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.660 align:middle line:84%
has been there at
the Big Bang, which

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:04.280 align:middle line:84%
was the beginning
of this universe,

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.370 align:middle line:90%
18.3 billion years ago.

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:15.170 align:middle line:84%
So I think it's all having to
do with recognizing who we are,

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:20.400 align:middle line:84%
evolving beings
in space and time,

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.470 align:middle line:84%
interacting, interdependent,
and jointly creative

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:26.940 align:middle line:90%
with all of the things.

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.220 align:middle line:84%
We forget this,
and then we create

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:33.850 align:middle line:84%
an artificial synthetic world,
which is prone to break down,

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.930 align:middle line:84%
which is breaking
down all around us.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I don't pretend to
tell you to know what

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.790 align:middle line:90%
caused this virus outbreak.

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:43.410 align:middle line:84%
But certainly, one
of the elements

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:47.010 align:middle line:84%
is that we are living more
and more in an unnatural way,

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:53.370 align:middle line:84%
more and more removed from
what makes nature flourishing.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:56.310 align:middle line:84%
We have separated
ourselves off using

00:40:56.310 --> 00:40:59.520 align:middle line:84%
synthetic artificial means
for everything, including

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.330 align:middle line:90%
our health.

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:05.280 align:middle line:84%
What we eat is more synthetic
than natural and more.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.290 align:middle line:90%
What we wear is the same thing.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:09.990 align:middle line:84%
And all we talk to
each other very often

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:15.840 align:middle line:84%
is just slightly the same way
removed from the deeper reality.

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:19.620 align:middle line:84%
We are now being shocked
back into our senses.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.816 align:middle line:84%
And that is something that
we can be grateful for.

00:41:23.816 --> 00:41:27.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Would you please
expand a little bit more

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:32.620 align:middle line:84%
on the scientific materialism
and whether or not you sincerely

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.140 align:middle line:84%
believe it's shifting
and to what degree?

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, science is shifting.

00:41:38.020 --> 00:41:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Science is no longer
what we thought it was.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest
contemporary scientists,

00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:50.220 align:middle line:84%
he died a few decades
ago, Max Planck.

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:53.290 align:middle line:84%
He was the father of
the atomic theory.

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:56.720 align:middle line:84%
He said in one of
his last talks--

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.390 align:middle line:84%
it was in Florence,
Italy, as it happens.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:00.830 align:middle line:90%
He gave a talk.

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:04.100 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "One
thing I can tell you

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:10.460 align:middle line:84%
after 40 years of researching
the deepest reality that we can

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.370 align:middle line:84%
find, which is the reality of
atoms, I can tell you this much,

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:20.180 align:middle line:84%
there is no such thing as
matter in the universe."

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.260 align:middle line:84%
I think the other great
physicists today would certainly

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:24.500 align:middle line:90%
agree with that.

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:26.510 align:middle line:84%
But that's a shock
for other people.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.210 align:middle line:84%
What do you mean
there's no matter?

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:31.684 align:middle line:90%
What is there then?

00:42:31.684 --> 00:42:34.570 align:middle line:84%
What we find and Max
Planck said and I

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:38.830 align:middle line:84%
agree with that, what we
find are clusters and sets

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:42.680 align:middle line:84%
of vibration coherent
with each other,

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:46.690 align:middle line:84%
interacting, building
higher levels of vibration.

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Our body is a vibrating system.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:54.110 align:middle line:84%
And the proton and the neutron
in the nucleus of the electron

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:55.850 align:middle line:90%
are vibrating entities.

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And they build higher
and higher level systems.

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:05.050 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe is a
vibrating whole system.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:08.380 align:middle line:84%
Very, very different idea
from little hard pieces

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:13.570 align:middle line:84%
of matter that Democritus,
the great Greek philosopher,

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.940 align:middle line:84%
thought these are
indestructible.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.170 align:middle line:84%
We know that they are
not indestructible.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:19.960 align:middle line:84%
The deeper we
penetrate, the more

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.590 align:middle line:84%
we find there is nothing hard,
nothing permanent about it.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:25.720 align:middle line:90%
It's all vibration.

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:31.630 align:middle line:84%
It's all coincided,
coherent waves building

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:34.130 align:middle line:90%
higher and higher-level waves.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:38.944 align:middle line:84%
It's a C. It's a quantum
C, information C,

00:43:38.944 --> 00:43:45.050 align:middle line:84%
not a bit of space and time
in which matter moves around.

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:49.330 align:middle line:10%
>> Ervin, if we could talk
a little bit more about what

00:43:49.330 --> 00:43:54.790 align:middle line:10%
critical point you believe
we are in our evolution.

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:58.030 align:middle line:10%
>> We are in a bifurcation.

00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:59.720 align:middle line:10%
So that's a technical term.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.660 align:middle line:10%
It comes from the
physical sciences,

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:08.880 align:middle line:10%
from cybernetics, also
from physical chemistry.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:14.720 align:middle line:10%
But it just means that there
is a sudden change, a forking

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:17.660 align:middle line:10%
in the past of our development.

00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.370 align:middle line:10%
We all evolve.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:21.770 align:middle line:10%
Temporarily, we
could be staying put.

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:25.200 align:middle line:10%
We can seldom move back if ever.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.540 align:middle line:10%
We can move to something
else, or we can disappear.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.860 align:middle line:90%
That's also possible.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:32.870 align:middle line:90%
We can become extinct.

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:37.400 align:middle line:10%
95 or more percent of this
great species since the Cambrian

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.110 align:middle line:10%
revolution have become extinct.

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Why not humanity?

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.750 align:middle line:90%
But we have consciousness.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:45.200 align:middle line:84%
We can recognize who we
are and what we are doing.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we can
consciously change our ways.

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:53.570 align:middle line:10%
But we are at a point
where our evolution needs

00:44:53.570 --> 00:44:57.910 align:middle line:10%
to be taken into our hand
because we have gone off

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:01.520 align:middle line:10%
in a wrong way, not just
in the past few years

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:05.080 align:middle line:10%
but in the past 150,
200 years perhaps.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:12.010 align:middle line:84%
We have put our trust into
a material-based technology.

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:14.510 align:middle line:84%
We can create the
world around us.

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:17.840 align:middle line:84%
We can make what we
want, what we need.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.870 align:middle line:84%
And never mind the
world, never mind

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:22.540 align:middle line:90%
the effect, the consequences.

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Don't think of yourself
as being in the world.

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Think of yourself as being
above the world, master world.

00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:33.950 align:middle line:84%
That has been the ruling
principle in the modern world,

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:36.160 align:middle line:84%
especially, first of all,
in the Western world.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.580 align:middle line:84%
But then in the 20th century,
through the two world wars,

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:44.350 align:middle line:84%
this kind of thinking spread
also to the East and as much

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:47.590 align:middle line:84%
as it could spread also to
the less developed countries

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:49.640 align:middle line:90%
in the south.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:58.040 align:middle line:84%
This sense of making the world
according to our own wishes

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:03.470 align:middle line:84%
created a world in
which we have using

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:08.480 align:middle line:84%
our powers to promote part
of that system and not

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.560 align:middle line:90%
the other parts.

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.560 align:middle line:84%
The part is what
our interests are.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Our power, our wealth is
what we want to promote.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.640 align:middle line:90%
Never mind the rest.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And by doing this, there's
a technical term as well

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.530 align:middle line:90%
like bifurcation.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.480 align:middle line:90%
It's being suboptimizing.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:29.450 align:middle line:84%
When you optimize
a system, you make

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:33.240 align:middle line:84%
it work as well as possible,
the best possible way.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.920 align:middle line:84%
When you suboptimize, it means
that you are only optimizing

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.920 align:middle line:90%
a part of the system.

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:47.110 align:middle line:10%
And that part can flourish
but for a time only.

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:50.020 align:middle line:10%
Sooner or later, it
becomes kind of a cancer

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:53.320 align:middle line:10%
because that system
begins to take

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:56.860 align:middle line:10%
the resources to use the
energy that would also

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.220 align:middle line:10%
be needed for others.

00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:03.030 align:middle line:10%
It becomes kind of a
blister, and then later

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:05.880 align:middle line:10%
on a dangerous cancer.

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:10.770 align:middle line:10%
We have to return to the view
that this system in which we

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:16.230 align:middle line:10%
live is a deeply, strongly
interconnected system that you

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:20.610 align:middle line:10%
cannot take apart and cannot use
only one part to the exclusion

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:22.060 align:middle line:10%
of the others.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.360 align:middle line:10%
It's not a simple bicycle.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.760 align:middle line:10%
It's a complex
computer, if you like,

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:29.920 align:middle line:10%
if you want to use
those metaphors for it.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.940 align:middle line:84%
So here we are in
a point in history

00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:37.230 align:middle line:84%
where we recognize that
the pursuit of material

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.840 align:middle line:84%
gains with the
material instruments

00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:43.680 align:middle line:84%
that we had can
provide well-being

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.130 align:middle line:84%
for a short period
for a small minority.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:51.360 align:middle line:84%
But it's dangerous in the longer
term for the great majority.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.310 align:middle line:90%
That's the point we are at.

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:56.760 align:middle line:84%
The sooner we realize
this, the sooner

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.700 align:middle line:84%
we start adapting
our ways of living.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.050 align:middle line:90%
We can do so.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:04.800 align:middle line:84%
We are now being forced to
adapt because it turns out

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:08.690 align:middle line:84%
that the whole system
is being shaken up.

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:13.420 align:middle line:84%
So let's use this not just
as a temporary interlude

00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.210 align:middle line:84%
and just recover everything
that has been before.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:17.910 align:middle line:90%
That would be very tragic.

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:18.910 align:middle line:90%
That would be dangerous.

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:21.054 align:middle line:90%
Let's use it to learn.

00:48:21.054 --> 00:48:23.710 align:middle line:90%
Learn from what is happening.

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Learn that we can be a
highly fragile system that

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:30.940 align:middle line:90%
can easily go extinct even.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:34.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's learn and do
something better.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.990 align:middle line:84%
Something better is something
what everything in the universe

00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:43.030 align:middle line:84%
is doing around us,
building coherent systems.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:46.420 align:middle line:10%
That's a very, very
important term, "coherence."

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.180 align:middle line:10%
It means that all
parts of a system

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:51.640 align:middle line:10%
are interacting with
all other parts.

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.590 align:middle line:10%
And together, they
maintain the system.

00:48:54.590 --> 00:48:56.380 align:middle line:10%
Let's look at the whole system.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:59.590 align:middle line:10%
What is the whole system for us?

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:01.660 align:middle line:10%
Obviously, the whole
system is a universe.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:06.100 align:middle line:10%
But what really concerns us
is what we call the biosphere.

00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:08.710 align:middle line:10%
The sphere of life on Earth.

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:10.660 align:middle line:10%
That's the system.

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:15.340 align:middle line:10%
If we can make that flourish,
if we can make it sustainable,

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.020 align:middle line:10%
then we can live in it.

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.750 align:middle line:10%
And we can flourish ourselves.

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:23.620 align:middle line:10%
If we try to flourish at
the expense of that system,

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:25.690 align:middle line:10%
then sooner or later,
it will break down.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.040 align:middle line:10%
And it makes us break down.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.000 align:middle line:10%
So here we are at a
historic turning point,

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.190 align:middle line:10%
a historic turning
point where we recognize

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:35.860 align:middle line:10%
some age-old insights.

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:39.610 align:middle line:10%
But we recognize that this is a
precondition of our existence.

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:42.445 align:middle line:10%


00:49:42.445 --> 00:49:47.110 align:middle line:10%
>> So, Ervin, I'd love for you
to say anything else knowing

00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:53.320 align:middle line:10%
that the film is about our
intuitive selves and the idea is

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:56.770 align:middle line:10%
for people to understand the
importance of connecting to that

00:49:56.770 --> 00:50:00.580 align:middle line:10%
intuitive self, to
connecting to the Akashic,

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:07.080 align:middle line:10%
to connecting to our collective,
instead of listening to these

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.150 align:middle line:10%
forces that are not helpful.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:13.555 align:middle line:84%
Could you in your own
words speak to that?

00:50:13.555 --> 00:50:17.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many words being
used today which are very

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:19.550 align:middle line:90%
significant.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And they are not only used
by hippies and by people

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:25.540 align:middle line:90%
who are on the margins.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:29.770 align:middle line:84%
They are becoming
common in business

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:33.640 align:middle line:84%
also, certainly in
the scientific world.

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:39.570 align:middle line:84%
And sooner or later, hopefully
it also moves into politics.

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:46.460 align:middle line:84%
These terms are
oneness, wholeness,

00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:51.310 align:middle line:84%
distributed wellness,
altogether health

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:55.540 align:middle line:84%
in all senses of the term,
physical health, organic health,

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.810 align:middle line:84%
biological health, but
also psychological health,

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:01.300 align:middle line:90%
being sane.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:07.610 align:middle line:84%
If we recognize each other as
being part of the same whole,

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:10.820 align:middle line:84%
then we can look at
each other with love

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:15.370 align:middle line:84%
because we know that the
other person is really us

00:51:15.370 --> 00:51:17.820 align:middle line:90%
and we are that other person.

00:51:17.820 --> 00:51:19.860 align:middle line:90%
We are waking up.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:24.240 align:middle line:84%
And that awakening is a
long-overdue phenomenon.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.000 align:middle line:84%
We reached a critical
point where if not a virus,

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.140 align:middle line:84%
it could have been a dryness
catastrophe, a sea rise

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:33.990 align:middle line:84%
catastrophe, could
have been any one

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:39.030 align:middle line:84%
of a number of ecological
and migrant catastrophes

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:41.250 align:middle line:84%
happening to us if we
continue like that.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:43.380 align:middle line:84%
We are now waking
up because we have

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.350 align:middle line:84%
been pushed to the point
of having to change.

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:49.560 align:middle line:90%
So the great danger to my mind--

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.110 align:middle line:84%
this is the message
that I want to leave.

00:51:52.110 --> 00:51:57.610 align:middle line:84%
The grave danger is to do
what is known as a reset.

00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:59.410 align:middle line:90%
Don't reset it.

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:02.860 align:middle line:90%
Don't go back to what there was.

00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.570 align:middle line:84%
The opportunity is
there to go forward,

00:52:05.570 --> 00:52:09.030 align:middle line:84%
so we have to create
the world, not just

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:11.820 align:middle line:90%
try to redo where we have been.

00:52:11.820 --> 00:52:14.020 align:middle line:84%
Hopefully we can do
something better.

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:15.180 align:middle line:90%
We can do it.

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:16.660 align:middle line:90%
Will we do it?

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.240 align:middle line:90%
That's a big question.

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.550 align:middle line:84%
But the more we
raise this question,

00:52:20.550 --> 00:52:23.250 align:middle line:84%
raise awareness,
raise our creativity,

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.780 align:middle line:90%
the better our chances are.

00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:29.100 align:middle line:84%
Young people have the
energy, have the spirit,

00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:34.770 align:middle line:84%
have the motivation if they
are allowed to live it,

00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:40.580 align:middle line:84%
to make it work, instead of
being forced into a mold.

00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:41.990 align:middle line:90%
Let it be freer.

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:44.930 align:middle line:84%
Education is a dangerous
process because it

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:47.750 align:middle line:84%
can be education
out of something,

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:50.720 align:middle line:90%
as well as education into.

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Let's not educate ourselves
out of our native creativity

00:52:55.490 --> 00:52:56.840 align:middle line:90%
or native wholeness.

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Let's remember what we
always knew as a child.

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:03.510 align:middle line:84%
We are living in
a wondrous world.

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:05.870 align:middle line:84%
We're living it and
sharing it together.

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.940 align:middle line:90%
Every day is a miracle.

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Every day is something we
can create ourselves together

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.640 align:middle line:90%
with all people around us.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.830 align:middle line:90%
That is a real possibility.

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:17.210 align:middle line:90%
That is our chance.

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:19.160 align:middle line:90%
That is our opportunity.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is why I'm
always happy and feel

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.210 align:middle line:84%
honored and responsible
for talking about it,

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:28.466 align:middle line:90%
like I do today.

00:53:28.466 --> 00:53:29.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:31.078 align:middle line:90%
I think that's a wrap.

00:53:31.078 --> 00:53:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Was there something
else you wanted to say?

00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:35.660 align:middle line:84%
>> I said who we are,
what the world is,

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and what our future is,
so what else can I say?
