00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>> My name is Dr. Jude Currivan.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.660 align:middle line:84%
I'm a cosmologist, a planetary
healer, a futurist, an author,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.760 align:middle line:84%
most recently of "The
Cosmic Hologram,"

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.700 align:middle line:84%
and an ex-international
businesswoman.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.650 align:middle line:84%
So I've tried a very
scenic route to this point.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.840 align:middle line:84%
I've also researched the nature
of reality and consciousness

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.710 align:middle line:84%
literally since I was a little
girl, both experientially

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.270 align:middle line:90%
and from research.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.640 align:middle line:90%
So here I am.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:84%
>> That was a very
quick summary.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So I understand you've had a
unique background and childhood

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.400 align:middle line:90%
to get us to this point.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.930 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't know
how unique it is.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.880 align:middle line:84%
I suspect actually
it's fairly common.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.010 align:middle line:84%
It's just I think most kids,
if they have my experiences,

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.140 align:middle line:84%
might have shared them with
other people and been told,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.060 align:middle line:90%
don't be silly.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.300 align:middle line:90%
It's just your imagination.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.130 align:middle line:90%
It's nonsense.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.460 align:middle line:84%
I had the great benefit of
not sharing my experiences

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.697 align:middle line:84%
with anybody else
until I was an adult.

00:01:16.697 --> 00:01:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And that wasn't because
I was scared of what

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.660 align:middle line:90%
people might actually say.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.090 align:middle line:84%
It was more I was
having such a good time.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.280 align:middle line:84%
And those experiences were
experiences of communication

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.110 align:middle line:84%
with beings from other realms,
multi-dimensional experiences.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.610 align:middle line:84%
So things like precognitive
dreams, telepathy,

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.620 align:middle line:84%
clairaudience, remote
viewing, many synchronicities,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:84%
and a lot of validation
of insight and information

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.830 align:middle line:84%
that came through
those experiences

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.020 align:middle line:84%
that really helped me keep
on that path of exploration

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and curiosity that's
continued to this day.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow, that's fascinating.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.030 align:middle line:84%
So cosmology, you mentioned--
what exactly is that?

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, cosmology means--

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:84%
in my terms, cosmology
and being a cosmologist

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.240 align:middle line:84%
means literally I'm curious
about the nature of reality

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.310 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.550 align:middle line:84%
Most scientists who describe
themselves as cosmologists

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.070 align:middle line:84%
would say that they
study the whole universe.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.370 align:middle line:84%
But, for me, we can't
understand the whole universe

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.820 align:middle line:84%
unless we understand
other non-physical realms

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.300 align:middle line:84%
from which the appearance
of our universe emerges.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So, for me, it's a bigger
quest to understand

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.160 align:middle line:84%
how what we call our
universe comes into being.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I look to understand
its deepest nature, which,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.040 align:middle line:84%
for me, is very much
embodied and embedded

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.130 align:middle line:84%
in the nature of
consciousness itself.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Could you define for
our viewers consciousness?

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.090 align:middle line:84%
>> No, I can't
define consciousness.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.920 align:middle line:84%
Really, if you ask cognitive
scientists and neuroscientists

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.570 align:middle line:84%
what is the nature
of consciousness,

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.280 align:middle line:84%
probably if you
asked two people,

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.230 align:middle line:90%
you'd get three definitions.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.590 align:middle line:90%
It's rather like that.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.170 align:middle line:84%
But, for me, consciousness is
awareness, and awareness playing

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.140 align:middle line:90%
out on many different levels.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:90%
So it's sentience.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:84%
It's a sense of a knowingness
and experience, an awareness

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.890 align:middle line:90%
that is self and individuated.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.890 align:middle line:84%
And that is
differentiated from mind

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:84%
because often the two are
brought together whereas mind

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.650 align:middle line:90%
is almost the foundation.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.730 align:middle line:84%
We talk about the infinite
and eternal cosmic mind

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.490 align:middle line:84%
as Einstein described and as all
spiritual traditions describe.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.550 align:middle line:84%
But consciousness is
almost like a great thought

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.640 align:middle line:90%
coming from the ocean of mind.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.860 align:middle line:84%
So consciousness is thoughts,
is individuation, is awareness.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you say
the ocean of mind,

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.840 align:middle line:84%
does that mean a
collective of some sort,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.690 align:middle line:90%
or is that all just internal?

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.520 align:middle line:84%
>> When I talk
about cosmic mind,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about the
biggest of big pictures.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about what
the ancients called

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.350 align:middle line:84%
the ocean, the
ground of all being,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:17.709 align:middle line:84%
a great mystery, God, cosmic
mind, infinite and eternal.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.240 align:middle line:84%
And with each, the
universes, we are

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.380 align:middle line:84%
becoming to understand more and
more, emerge as great thoughts

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.760 align:middle line:90%
from that ground of being.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.820 align:middle line:84%
>> So when you say it
emerges as great thoughts,

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.550 align:middle line:84%
it sounds like we're
tapping into it somehow.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.420 align:middle line:84%
>> We are because
we're part of it.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.840 align:middle line:84%
So if our universe
is a great thought

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.780 align:middle line:84%
in the mind of the
cosmos, then our universe

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.880 align:middle line:84%
as that great thought began
nearly 14 billion years ago.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.180 align:middle line:84%
And began not in
a big bang, which

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.950 align:middle line:84%
was neither big nor
a bang in the sense

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.350 align:middle line:84%
that it was tiny and exquisitely
fine-tuned and ordered.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Our universe began more as the
first moments of a big breath

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.310 align:middle line:90%
and has continued ever since.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So our universe and everything
in it is innately intelligent.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.070 align:middle line:84%
It is an aspect, a
thought of cosmic mind

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.640 align:middle line:84%
that has its own intelligence
and ever-evolving

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.670 align:middle line:90%
self-awareness, consciousness.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.720 align:middle line:84%
>> And, again, just to get
clarity for our viewers 101--

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> --that when we talk about
universal, are humans included?

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.225 align:middle line:90%
You say all living things.

00:05:32.225 --> 00:05:33.025 align:middle line:90%
>> For sure.

00:05:33.025 --> 00:05:36.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Is Earth, Mother Nature,
are other animals included?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything is included.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.740 align:middle line:90%
The entirety of our universe.

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Every-- from its first moments,
its most simple element

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.090 align:middle line:84%
of hydrogen that
was so perfectly

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.150 align:middle line:84%
expressed in the laws
of physics that hydrogen

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.710 align:middle line:90%
clustered into stars.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.050 align:middle line:84%
Stars burned that
fuel and, in doing so,

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.450 align:middle line:90%
created heavier elements.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.330 align:middle line:84%
Over billions of
years, all of that

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.270 align:middle line:84%
became these vast
interstellar dust clouds that

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.420 align:middle line:84%
birthed planets, that birthed
solar systems like ours,

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.450 align:middle line:84%
and they birthed water planets
like ours, which enable

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.520 align:middle line:90%
biological life to then evolve.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.970 align:middle line:84%
So the whole of our
universe is this journey

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.850 align:middle line:84%
from simplicity to complexity,
but it is innately intelligent.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.450 align:middle line:84%
And it became more
and more individuated.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So here we are, 14
billion years later.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Having a conversation as
individuated microcosmic

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:39.050 align:middle line:84%
co-creators of our universe's
journey of evolution.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.280 align:middle line:90%
It's cool, isn't it?

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So where did this innate
intelligence come from?

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.360 align:middle line:90%
Do we know yet?

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.810 align:middle line:84%
>> This really goes back to
ancient spiritual understandings

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:84%
because when we go back to
ancient India, which, for me,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.110 align:middle line:84%
is the most profoundly
insightful and wise perspective

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:02.000 align:middle line:84%
of writing, such as the Bhagavad
Gita and the Upanishads,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.380 align:middle line:90%
the Vedic tradition.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.130 align:middle line:84%
The Upanishads basically
say that everything

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.880 align:middle line:84%
is consciousness, that mind
and consciousness aren't

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.410 align:middle line:90%
something we have.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.920 align:middle line:84%
They are literally what we
and the whole world are.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And now we're discovering that
from a scientific perspective.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.740 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk
about great thoughts

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.510 align:middle line:84%
in the mind of the cosmos, the
cosmos itself is pure mind.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.740 align:middle line:90%
Pure mind.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.640 align:middle line:84%
And what we talk of as matter
actually seems very solid,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:90%
but it isn't.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.750 align:middle line:84%
It's very ephemeral
and foundationally it's

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.070 align:middle line:90%
mind and consciousness.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There are a number of
things that you mention.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.390 align:middle line:84%
One of them is
materialistic reductionism.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.240 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's been the
mainstream scientific worldview

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.000 align:middle line:84%
that this world,
this universe is

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.470 align:middle line:84%
the only reality, this
only material reality,

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.460 align:middle line:84%
and that the appearance of
separation is its true nature.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
And now that is being turned
completely on its head.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.660 align:middle line:84%
And so what we're realizing
now as cosmologists

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and as scientists across
many fields of research

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.740 align:middle line:84%
is coming to stand alongside
these ancient spiritual

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:20.300 align:middle line:84%
understandings that actually
the energy and matter and space

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and time of our universe are
expressions of a deeper reality.

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So they are the appearance
of our universe,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.580 align:middle line:84%
but they're not its
foundational truth.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.460 align:middle line:84%
And its foundational
truth is that our universe

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:84%
emerges from realms of
essentially cosmic causation,

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:90%
intention.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.750 align:middle line:84%
So our universe has meaning
and purpose and a journey.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And it's a journey
from simplicity

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.390 align:middle line:84%
to complexity and ever-greater
individuated consciousness.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:58.040 align:middle line:84%
>> And do we know what that
journey is about or what it is?

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.060 align:middle line:84%
>> We do because actually,
science with that materialistic

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:06.360 align:middle line:84%
reductionist worldview has
made incredible advances

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.350 align:middle line:90%
technologically.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.890 align:middle line:90%
I mean, amazing.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So we can look further out in
the universe than ever before.

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:15.510 align:middle line:84%
We look to tiny and tinier
scales than ever before.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:20.220 align:middle line:84%
And as we've done that, science
itself has come to realize that

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.360 align:middle line:84%
by taking everything apart
and trying to understand it

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.170 align:middle line:84%
from that taken-apart
stuff, it actually

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:31.210 align:middle line:84%
has to put it back together
again to really understand it.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's what's happening now.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.160 align:middle line:84%
When we put things
back, we realize

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.630 align:middle line:84%
that they are greater than
the sum of their parts.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So what we're
realizing is a universe

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.730 align:middle line:84%
that is so amazingly set
up from the beginning--

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.430 align:middle line:84%
literally, our universe
had instructions,

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:52.140 align:middle line:84%
cosmic instructions, that
we call the laws of physics.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.780 align:middle line:84%
Computer folks would
call them algorithms.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.940 align:middle line:84%
They're literally
the instructions

00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.230 align:middle line:84%
that enable our universe
to exist and vitally

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:04.290 align:middle line:90%
to evolve as a unified entity.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It's interesting how we have
actually picked up on those

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.310 align:middle line:84%
instructions, and we
can put them into work.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And how do you think we
got that information?

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we're
part of the whole.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.280 align:middle line:90%
We are part of our universe.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:25.230 align:middle line:84%
We're not somehow-- this is the
danger of material reductionism

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:26.310 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.790 align:middle line:84%
and because of its
authority, we've

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.520 align:middle line:84%
bought into its
myth of separation,

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.440 align:middle line:90%
its illusion of separation.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.300 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is our
beliefs drive our behaviors.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.280 align:middle line:84%
So what we-- the stories we
tell are the stories we live.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.800 align:middle line:84%
So this myth of
separation has brought us

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.690 align:middle line:90%
to the edge of catastrophe.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:49.260 align:middle line:84%
But literally, as
it's done so, we've

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.220 align:middle line:84%
also begun to wake up
and literally remember

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.300 align:middle line:84%
the wholeness of who we are,
the wholeness of reality.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:02.790 align:middle line:84%
So we are essentially now
accessing this information

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.290 align:middle line:90%
that's been there all along.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost as though
in our own evolution,

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.100 align:middle line:84%
we've finally come to a point
where we can access the deeper

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:84%
truth and the realization,
which mystics have accessed

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.400 align:middle line:90%
for thousands of years.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Vedic tradition
of ancient India

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:26.490 align:middle line:84%
is a hugely important
example of that.

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.370 align:middle line:84%
But modern science
has negated that.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.840 align:middle line:84%
It's peripheralized
that until now.

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.110 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
waking up itself

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:37.890 align:middle line:84%
to this realization
because of the evidence,

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.340 align:middle line:90%
because of the evidence.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:40.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Evidence.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.070 align:middle line:90%
>> What evidence?

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:43.200 align:middle line:90%
Evidence that's so compelling.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:46.980 align:middle line:84%
Evidence literally across
all scales of existence

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.740 align:middle line:84%
from the tiniest to
the whole universe.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:55.650 align:middle line:84%
We're finding that information
is more fundamental than energy

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:57.390 align:middle line:90%
and matter and space and time.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:84%
We realize now
experimentally that when

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.390 align:middle line:84%
we delete one bit
of information,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.900 align:middle line:84%
actual heat is released
and in line with theory.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:84%
So we're realizing through
those sorts of experiments.

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And when we actually
model complex systems,

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:19.440 align:middle line:84%
we realize that the
way they appear to be

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.810 align:middle line:84%
is made up of information,
relational dynamic interplay

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.380 align:middle line:84%
processes of information
that we can model

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:32.820 align:middle line:84%
and that we're now realizing
is that most fundamental stuff

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.480 align:middle line:90%
of reality itself.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.070 align:middle line:84%
So not just at all
scales of these patterns

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:43.060 align:middle line:84%
of information appearing but
across many fields of research.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.570 align:middle line:84%
So it's not just
cosmology, the very big,

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:50.490 align:middle line:84%
but it's biology, complex
systems, chemistry, meteorology.

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.810 align:middle line:84%
We're finding these same what's
called fractal patterns playing

00:12:54.810 --> 00:13:00.420 align:middle line:84%
out across all scales and not
just through the natural world

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:05.110 align:middle line:84%
but through human behaviors,
through collective human

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.910 align:middle line:90%
behaviors.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing this playing
out of a conscious cosmos.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Everywhere we look now,
at every scale we look,

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:20.580 align:middle line:84%
and every type of looking
that we do, it's there for us

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.240 align:middle line:90%
now to see.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And you mentioned
fractal patterns.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:26.100 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean?

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.142 align:middle line:90%
What does that look like?

00:13:27.142 --> 00:13:28.583 align:middle line:90%
>> The ancients were very smart.

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:30.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they were at
least as smart as we are.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.030 align:middle line:90%
They just had less stuff.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:36.360 align:middle line:84%
So in ancient Greece
about 2,500 years ago,

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.480 align:middle line:84%
there was a realization
that geometry,

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.340 align:middle line:84%
such as a triangle or a square,
is all about relationships.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.810 align:middle line:10%
So, for example, if you see a
triangle, it has three sides,

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.870 align:middle line:10%
and those sides are in a
relationship with each other.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.540 align:middle line:10%
And the angles, inner
angles of the triangle,

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.520 align:middle line:10%
are in a relationship
with each other.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.750 align:middle line:84%
You can scale that triangle
up or scale it down,

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.800 align:middle line:84%
and those relationships
stay the same, yeah?

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.960 align:middle line:84%
On the advent of
computers, a researcher

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.110 align:middle line:84%
called Benoit Mandelbrot
decided to look

00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:12.830 align:middle line:84%
at things that didn't look
geometric like coastlines

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:14.750 align:middle line:90%
and the outlines of clouds.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.470 align:middle line:84%
And with the ability to
analyze huge amounts of data,

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.980 align:middle line:84%
of information, he
actually found patterns,

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:24.590 align:middle line:84%
and he found
geometrical patterns.

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:28.020 align:middle line:84%
But I haven't yet seen
a triangular cloud.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.950 align:middle line:84%
But when you actually look
at the outline of a cloud,

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.620 align:middle line:84%
there are patterns
that are geometric,

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:84%
but they're fragmented
dimensional patterns.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very long
way of describing them.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So he came up with the word
"fractal" to describe them.

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:48.110 align:middle line:84%
And if you see a fractal pattern
in nature, leaves and ferns

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle line:84%
and shells and galaxies, they
all scale up and scale down.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.520 align:middle line:84%
So you see these
fractal patterns

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.800 align:middle line:90%
throughout complex systems.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.570 align:middle line:90%
You see them in ecosystems.

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
You see them in
weather patterns.

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:04.490 align:middle line:84%
You see them all through
the natural world.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:09.770 align:middle line:84%
These fractal patterns that
are all informational patterns

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.210 align:middle line:90%
of relationship.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:13.130 align:middle line:84%
>> How do they
become informational?

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Because everything is
information, literally.

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:19.190 align:middle line:84%
We need to go-- the
20th-century Scientific

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:90%
Revolution was amazing.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.800 align:middle line:84%
It took us from that old
Newtonian world of absolutes

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
and things, and it moved us
into relationships and fields,

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.500 align:middle line:90%
but it didn't go far enough.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.970 align:middle line:10%
So when we talk about energy
and matter of our universe,

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.900 align:middle line:10%
we talk about its space
and time, geeks like myself

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.920 align:middle line:10%
who spent a lifetime researching
the nature of reality

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:48.490 align:middle line:10%
are realizing that they are
the appearance of our universe.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:51.240 align:middle line:84%
But of themselves, they
are not fundamental.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.720 align:middle line:84%
The underpinning
them is information

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.020 align:middle line:84%
that expresses itself
as energy and matter

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.450 align:middle line:84%
and expresses itself
in a different way

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.810 align:middle line:84%
but complementary way
as space and time.

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:06.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's so beautifully
complementary

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.930 align:middle line:84%
that when you restate
the laws of physics

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
as laws of information, you can
see how our universe is made.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.490 align:middle line:84%
You can see how to
make a universe that

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:90%
exists and evolves.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:22.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Simply by
putting it that way.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.400 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.770 align:middle line:84%
There's a wonderful
quote, I think,

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
by Marcel Proust that said,
"The journey of discovery

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.560 align:middle line:84%
is not about
discovering new lands.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.990 align:middle line:90%
It's seeing with new eyes."

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.060 align:middle line:90%
So we don't need any more maths.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:38.440 align:middle line:84%
We don't need any
more equations.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.600 align:middle line:84%
We just need to
see with new eyes

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:47.140 align:middle line:84%
that we are innately these
amazing beings of information

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.542 align:middle line:84%
that are part of an information
and holographic universe.

00:16:51.542 --> 00:16:53.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, now we need to
talk about holographic.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>> We do.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.680 align:middle line:90%
We do.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.960 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that really struck me

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.820 align:middle line:84%
from when I was a
very little girl

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
and literally having
these experiences

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:07.540 align:middle line:84%
of multi-dimensionalities
and telepathy

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.640 align:middle line:84%
and all the rest of it--
was I experienced reality

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.960 align:middle line:90%
as a hologram.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.250 align:middle line:84%
And holograms hadn't
even been invented then.

00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:18.170 align:middle line:90%
I was-- I'm that old.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I'm that old, holograms
hadn't even been invented.

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:23.720 align:middle line:84%
But that-- when they
were, and I started

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.480 align:middle line:84%
to become aware of
their properties

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.910 align:middle line:84%
that you get the
whole in every part

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.380 align:middle line:90%
and every as part of the whole.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.540 align:middle line:84%
So they reflect-- the
parts reflect each other.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.360 align:middle line:84%
That was how I had
experienced reality

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:41.150 align:middle line:90%
since I was four years old.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.500 align:middle line:84%
So it was amazing
then when holography

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:84%
became not just the
technological holograms but also

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:56.060 align:middle line:84%
an understanding by cosmologists
that our entire universe is

00:17:56.060 --> 00:18:00.140 align:middle line:84%
essentially a holographic
projection of consciousness

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.270 align:middle line:84%
from its boundary of space
of what we call space.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:05.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It's funny.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:11.090 align:middle line:84%
I remember seeing the
hologram in our art studios.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.190 align:middle line:90%
This was the '70s.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:14.690 align:middle line:90%
When do we--

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.540 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking about
10 years before that.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:18.410 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And by the '70s,
it was very basic.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.900 align:middle line:84%
But what we're realizing
now is our best

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.070 align:middle line:84%
high-definition
holograms are pixelated.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Every-- all their information
that they're made up of

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:35.240 align:middle line:84%
is pixelated at a
certain very fine scale.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.830 align:middle line:84%
But our universe is
pixelated at a scale that

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:44.060 align:middle line:84%
is more than 100
trillion trillion times

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:49.740 align:middle line:84%
finer than our
best HD holograms.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> We try.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>> We try.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:90%
We do our best.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:53.210 align:middle line:90%
We try.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.850 align:middle line:84%
But literally, our
universe is pixelated

00:18:55.850 --> 00:19:00.200 align:middle line:84%
at that informational
level at a scale as tiny

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:05.160 align:middle line:84%
compared to an atom as an atom
is to the entire universe.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.240 align:middle line:90%
It's extraordinary.

00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:07.690 align:middle line:90%
But that's what we're finding.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:11.100 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
evidence is pointing to.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So let's back
up a little bit.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.310 align:middle line:84%
And you talked about
separatism a couple of times.

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.987 align:middle line:84%
So we should probably talk
more about what that is

00:19:18.987 --> 00:19:19.820 align:middle line:90%
and what that means.

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:25.270 align:middle line:84%
One of the ancient
texts as well is I Ching

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.560 align:middle line:90%
in China, Chinese tradition.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.100 align:middle line:84%
And that says in the
beginning is the one.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.970 align:middle line:90%
The one becomes two.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:33.740 align:middle line:90%
The two becomes three.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:37.020 align:middle line:84%
And from the three,
10,000 things are born.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:40.340 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
unity, wholeness,

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:46.070 align:middle line:84%
differentiates itself
into twonesses,

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:48.800 align:middle line:84%
and twonesses into
threenesses, and threenesses

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:54.110 align:middle line:84%
into a multitude of diversity
and differentiation.

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:56.570 align:middle line:90%
But it's not separation.

00:19:56.570 --> 00:20:00.860 align:middle line:84%
It's just a sense of
differentiating the wholeness so

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.930 align:middle line:90%
that it can experience itself.

00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:05.540 align:middle line:84%
If we weren't
differentiated, we couldn't

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.070 align:middle line:90%
be having this conversation.

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.890 align:middle line:84%
If we weren't differentiated,
the folks watching this film

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:84%
wouldn't be able to
differentiate and watch it.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:16.530 align:middle line:84%
The problem is
we've misunderstood

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.330 align:middle line:90%
differentiation for separation.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.750 align:middle line:90%
So we think that we're separate.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:26.490 align:middle line:84%
And yet as Nelson Mandela's
philosophy tells us--

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.070 align:middle line:90%
it's a philosophy called Ubuntu.

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.940 align:middle line:84%
It's a very profound African
philosophy that says,

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.940 align:middle line:90%
I need you to be me.

00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:38.280 align:middle line:90%
You need me to be you.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.570 align:middle line:84%
So there's this profound
sense of interconnectedness

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:46.020 align:middle line:84%
that all Indigenous
traditions have

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.140 align:middle line:84%
at their heart and
all ancient wisdoms

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
and universal spiritual
traditions have at their heart.

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:57.960 align:middle line:84%
And yet our modern science,
because of its very powerful

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:01.770 align:middle line:84%
methodology of materialist
reductionism and taking

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
stuff apart, has focused on
the appearance of separation

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:84%
rather than its deepest
nature of differentiation

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.420 align:middle line:90%
but no separation.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.380 align:middle line:84%
And unless we wake up from
this myth of separation,

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.260 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure we're going to
survive and thrive as a species.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think the scientists
confused it themselves?

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.200 align:middle line:84%
>> I think they did because one
of the great tenets of science

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.830 align:middle line:84%
is I am the observer, and
you are that that I observe,

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.010 align:middle line:90%
and we are separate.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And so I can do lots
of experiments on you.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:34.770 align:middle line:84%
And I can find lots of
information about you.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:39.300 align:middle line:84%
But we've known since the
advent of quantum physics

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:84%
that there is no separation
between the observer

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.300 align:middle line:84%
and the observed, and that when
we observe something, certainly

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.570 align:middle line:84%
the quantum scale, we
literally make it real.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And when we expand that
to the whole universe,

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:58.330 align:middle line:84%
our universe is
non-locally interconnected.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.010 align:middle line:84%
So it exists and evolves
as a unified entity.

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:07.230 align:middle line:84%
But the way it experiences
itself and evolves itself

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:12.560 align:middle line:84%
is into ever-greater
individuation, differentiation,

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.650 align:middle line:90%
simplicity to complexity.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.730 align:middle line:90%
But there is no separation.

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:23.130 align:middle line:90%


00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.890 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so profound.

00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:27.660 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So the unified field,
tapping into-- what is it?

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.300 align:middle line:84%
Tapping into it, how
does that happen?

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.820 align:middle line:84%
I'd love to get into
that more if we could.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:43.280 align:middle line:84%
>> It's very cool, and
it's actually very simple.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.080 align:middle line:90%
>> So it is.

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.300 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.120 align:middle line:84%
As I've said, what the
evidence is now showing

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.700 align:middle line:84%
and when we restate
the laws of physics

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.140 align:middle line:84%
as algorithms, instructions
of information,

00:22:56.140 --> 00:23:00.280 align:middle line:84%
we can see how our universe
can exist and evolve.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.520 align:middle line:84%
It exists because
information expresses itself

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:04.750 align:middle line:90%
as energy and matter.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:84%
It evolves because
information expresses itself

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.710 align:middle line:84%
in a different but
complementary as space and time.

00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So from that first moment
14 billion years ago,

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:21.070 align:middle line:84%
not as a big bang but as the
first moment of a big breath,

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:27.460 align:middle line:84%
ordered, coherent, the flow of
time and the expansion of space

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.910 align:middle line:84%
means that every moment
from that beginning

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:35.260 align:middle line:84%
till now, our universe has
added more and more and more

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.350 align:middle line:90%
informational content.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:90%
So it's literally grown up.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.860 align:middle line:84%
It's experienced and evolved
and grown up and become

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:90%
ever greater, self-aware.

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:54.370 align:middle line:84%
But that's what it is in terms
of spacetime and energy matter.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:24:00.610 align:middle line:84%
But our whole universe is what's
called non-locally connected.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:04.660 align:middle line:84%
And that means that it
knows itself at all times.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So think of ourselves
as a universe.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:08.560 align:middle line:90%
I'm a universe.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.010 align:middle line:90%
I was born 67 years ago, not--

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.380 align:middle line:84%
actually, I was born
14 billion years ago,

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.780 align:middle line:84%
but that's a whole
different story.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:84%
I was born 67 years
ago as a baby.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.530 align:middle line:84%
And as a baby, I had
all the DNA that was

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.110 align:middle line:90%
going to be me as I grew up.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:29.980 align:middle line:90%
I had all the recourse to that.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:34.100 align:middle line:84%
And yet as time went on, I moved
from being a baby to a toddler

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.840 align:middle line:84%
to a teenager to
an adult to me now.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.730 align:middle line:90%
As I did, I expanded.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.680 align:middle line:90%
Literally, my body expanded.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.560 align:middle line:90%
But my experience expanded too.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.330 align:middle line:90%
I experienced the world.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.390 align:middle line:84%
So think of our universe
as a universe soul

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.720 align:middle line:84%
as being born as a
baby universe 14--

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.390 align:middle line:84%
nearly 14-- 13.8
billion years ago

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and has been existing
and evolving ever since.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:04.350 align:middle line:84%
But just as I have
a coherent body,

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.020 align:middle line:84%
so when I grow up,
all my experience,

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.940 align:middle line:90%
I know as Jude, as a wholeness.

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:15.140 align:middle line:84%
So our universe is
connected coherently,

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.880 align:middle line:90%
what's called non-locally.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.370 align:middle line:84%
So our universe knows
all that is happening.

00:25:20.370 --> 00:25:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
the unified field

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.000 align:middle line:84%
or we could call what the
ancients call the Akashic

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.810 align:middle line:84%
Record, it's the same
sense of our universe

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:34.880 align:middle line:84%
existing and evolving as this
unified non-locally-connected

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.930 align:middle line:90%
entity.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.030 align:middle line:84%
And we've managed
to get the evidence

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:43.160 align:middle line:84%
for that now out to 12.2
billion light-years from Earth.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.030 align:middle line:84%
So we've got such great evidence
that all that I'm sharing

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:84%
is not just coming
from me but is

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:52.640 align:middle line:84%
coming from hugely compelling
evidence brought forward

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.130 align:middle line:90%
by many, many, many scientists.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:58.850 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you give us an idea
of what that evidence is?

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, let's talk two pieces
of evidence that have literally

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:04.680 align:middle line:84%
come forward in the
last couple of years.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.610 align:middle line:90%
The first was in 2017.

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.400 align:middle line:84%
And I was talking about
the fractal patterns

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.890 align:middle line:84%
that we're seeing underpinning
complex systems at all scales

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.740 align:middle line:84%
of existence from
individual atoms

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.070 align:middle line:84%
where electrons cluster
in fractal patterns,

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.220 align:middle line:84%
when an element changes from
being a metal to an insulator,

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:84%
through to vast
galactic clusters.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.340 align:middle line:84%
These fractal patterns
are information patterns.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:34.610 align:middle line:84%
They're the patterns--
they're the signature

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:36.860 align:middle line:90%
of the cosmic hologram.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:41.900 align:middle line:84%
In 2017, astronomers from five
universities looked at something

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.320 align:middle line:84%
called the Cosmic
Microwave Background.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:90%
Now, what that is--

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:47.270 align:middle line:90%
CMB.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:51.410 align:middle line:84%
What that is is the
relic radiation left over

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.420 align:middle line:84%
from the earliest
epoch of our universe.

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And as our universe
has expanded,

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.160 align:middle line:84%
this CMB radiation fills
the whole of space.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.940 align:middle line:84%
In 2017, astronomers,
cosmologists

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:10.040 align:middle line:84%
found the same fractal
patterns throughout the CMB.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:84%
So throughout the
whole of space,

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:18.680 align:middle line:84%
those radiation from the very
earliest times of our universe

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.650 align:middle line:84%
also show these fractal
patterns that we

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.590 align:middle line:84%
find in atoms, we
find in river systems,

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:29.060 align:middle line:84%
we find in the internet,
and we find in galaxies,

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.930 align:middle line:90%
we find in the whole of space.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's one piece of
information and evidence.

00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.930 align:middle line:84%
The other is this whole
premise of nonlocality

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.050 align:middle line:84%
that within spacetime,
nothing goes faster

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:43.610 align:middle line:90%
than the speed of light.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.510 align:middle line:84%
And yet for our universe
to exist and evolve

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:51.560 align:middle line:84%
as a unified entity, it has
to be non-locally connected.

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.690 align:middle line:90%
It has to know itself as a body.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And that came forward, that
nonlocality came forward

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.400 align:middle line:84%
as a phenomenon of
quantum physics.

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.680 align:middle line:84%
And Einstein called it
spooky action at a distance.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.950 align:middle line:90%
And he really did not like it.

00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:09.410 align:middle line:84%
But in the laboratory
since, we've

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:11.810 align:middle line:84%
shown time and time
again that nonlocality

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:13.580 align:middle line:90%
is a real phenomenon.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.340 align:middle line:84%
But for years,
physicists said, oh, it's

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.020 align:middle line:90%
only at the quantum scale.

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.740 align:middle line:84%
And then they started to
be able to non-locally

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:26.360 align:middle line:84%
connect or entangle organic
molecules, which are vast

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
compared to the quantum scale,
and even tiny diamonds, which

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.850 align:middle line:90%
are vast, but that's not enough.

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.480 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, there's
a law or a theorem

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.550 align:middle line:84%
that says quantum
physics can only

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:44.610 align:middle line:84%
work at all if our universe
is so non-locally connected.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Anyway in 2017 and
2018, researchers at MIT

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:90%
did something extraordinary.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.970 align:middle line:90%
They were able to non-locally--

00:28:53.970 --> 00:28:59.190 align:middle line:84%
in 2018, non-locally
entangle photons

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:05.010 align:middle line:84%
of light in the laboratory with
starlight from 600 light-years

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:09.840 align:middle line:84%
away to starlight or
quasar light-- and quasars

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.210 align:middle line:90%
are very bright galactic bodies.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:14.460 align:middle line:84%
So they're much, much,
much brighter than stars.

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So we can see them
a lot farther away.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:20.040 align:middle line:84%
So photons in the
laboratory, starlight

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:27.640 align:middle line:84%
600 light-years, light from a
quasar 12.2 billion light-years

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:28.440 align:middle line:90%
away.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:34.320 align:middle line:84%
That light left that quasar
12.2 billion years ago,

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.770 align:middle line:90%
and they're entangled.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:40.320 align:middle line:84%
So that's showing essentially
that our entire universe

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.720 align:middle line:90%
is non-locally connected.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is so powerful
because that's, for me--

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:54.153 align:middle line:84%
cosmological scales we're seeing
this wholeness of our universe.

00:29:54.153 --> 00:29:55.570 align:middle line:84%
And we're seeing
it at every scale

00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:59.170 align:middle line:84%
from that level of wholeness and
that level of entire universe

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:90%
down to the smallest scales.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.040 align:middle line:84%
>> What are those
smallest scales?

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.180 align:middle line:90%
>> It's called the Planck scale.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And when you put together
the laws of physics--

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.930 align:middle line:84%
and whether we were doing
it or whether scientists

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.290 align:middle line:84%
in a galaxy far, far away
in a long, long time ago

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.460 align:middle line:84%
were doing it, the laws of
physics are the laws of physics.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, we would not exist.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.940 align:middle line:84%
So the laws of physics
are what they are.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.060 align:middle line:84%
And when you bring the
laws of physics together,

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:31.690 align:middle line:84%
a natural scale of measures
for mass and energy and time

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:34.990 align:middle line:90%
and length and energy--

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.370 align:middle line:90%
and temperature emerge.

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.670 align:middle line:84%
And these are called
the Planck scale.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.690 align:middle line:84%
That's P-L-A-N-C-K. And they're
named after Max Planck who was

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:84%
one of the great pioneers
of quantum physics.

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And it was Max Planck that said
he believed that consciousness

00:30:50.830 --> 00:30:54.740 align:middle line:84%
is primary to the
appearance of our universe,

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.810 align:middle line:84%
as have many other
pioneering scientists.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.490 align:middle line:84%
So the digital
information that is

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:06.110 align:middle line:84%
the basic stuff of our universe
is literally pixelated.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.680 align:middle line:84%
The ones and the zeros
of that information

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.930 align:middle line:90%
are pixelated the Planck scale.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:17.810 align:middle line:84%
And the Planck scale in spatial
terms is as tiny compared to,

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:21.590 align:middle line:84%
as I mentioned, an atom as
an atom is to the universe.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:25.430 align:middle line:84%
And each moment,
each time moment

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:30.290 align:middle line:84%
is like a film of our universe
from its first beginning--

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:34.190 align:middle line:84%
its beginning to
now adds information

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:36.800 align:middle line:90%
at the scale of the Planck time.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.362 align:middle line:84%
And that is ridiculously,
ridiculously tiny.

00:31:41.362 --> 00:31:43.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Something that sounds like
we could barely even imagine,

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:44.620 align:middle line:90%
can we?

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:45.710 align:middle line:90%
>> It's so hard.

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think of-- if
you think of a normal film--

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:51.440 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not a
technologist on this.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.080 align:middle line:84%
But, say, going back to
when I was growing up,

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.070 align:middle line:84%
and instead of being digital,
films were on film slides.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:00.560 align:middle line:90%
And you turned the frame.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And each frame was
of itself static.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.540 align:middle line:84%
But when you ran
the frames together,

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.800 align:middle line:84%
you had the appearance
of continuity.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:13.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you have a film that,
say, has 100 frames per minute,

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.120 align:middle line:84%
100 frames per minute,
at the Planck scale,

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:23.050 align:middle line:84%
our universe adds a trillion
trillion trillion trillion

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:26.970 align:middle line:90%
frames every second.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:31.830 align:middle line:84%
It is tough, isn't it,
to see how tiny that is.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:36.000 align:middle line:84%
It literally is 10 to
the minus 44 seconds

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.650 align:middle line:90%
is the Planck scale of time.

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:42.190 align:middle line:90%


00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're talking about all
of this amazing stuff that's out

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.860 align:middle line:84%
there, the nature
of the universe.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And I'm wondering, how is
that connected to intuition?

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:59.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Intuition is natural because
it's when we open ourselves

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:02.460 align:middle line:84%
to that information
field that is reality.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, whether we're
conscious of it or not,

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.370 align:middle line:84%
we are transmitting and
receiving information.

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.370 align:middle line:84%
We are transceivers
of information.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:16.430 align:middle line:84%
We are dynamic-- we are
dynamic transceivers

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:20.580 align:middle line:84%
of our environment, of each
other, of the whole world.

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:24.950 align:middle line:84%
And so when we intuitively
have that insight,

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.080 align:middle line:84%
we're just tapping--
naturally tapping

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.740 align:middle line:84%
into the information that's
available for us all the time.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:34.610 align:middle line:84%
When we have telepathic
communications,

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.960 align:middle line:90%
again, that is a natural--

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.850 align:middle line:90%
supernormal phenomenon.

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:43.810 align:middle line:84%
Synchronicities, intuitive
insights, remote viewing,

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:49.720 align:middle line:84%
telepathy, precognitive
events are all examples

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.380 align:middle line:84%
of us tapping into that
non-local intelligence

00:33:53.380 --> 00:34:00.400 align:middle line:84%
of our universe and ourselves
as its microcosmic co-creators.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:03.280 align:middle line:10%
So supernormal
phenomena are natural

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:08.650 align:middle line:10%
within this whole worldview
of the cosmic hologram,

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:14.050 align:middle line:10%
but they never had a place in
the mainstream reductionist

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:17.900 align:middle line:10%
separatist view of science.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:23.000 align:middle line:84%
Only when science expands
to welcoming consciousness

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and mind, and mind and
consciousness expressed

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:31.250 align:middle line:84%
as meaningful information
does the understanding

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:36.030 align:middle line:84%
expand to naturally embody
all these phenomena.

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:38.480 align:middle line:90%
>> So it seems it's all there.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.600 align:middle line:10%
It's-- what's
standing in the way?

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.429 align:middle line:90%
>> Us.

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.080 align:middle line:84%
We're standing in
the way because

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.469 align:middle line:84%
of our fragmented perspectives
of the nature of reality.

00:34:48.469 --> 00:34:53.179 align:middle line:84%
And those fragmented views
have been given to us

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:56.870 align:middle line:84%
by our societies, by our
families, by our teachers,

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:59.510 align:middle line:90%
and by science up till now.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:03.620 align:middle line:84%
And in the West, science
has had this authority.

00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:06.590 align:middle line:84%
And science has done a
great job in many ways,

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.860 align:middle line:84%
but it really hasn't
served us well in this way

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.950 align:middle line:84%
because science,
in many examples,

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:16.460 align:middle line:84%
has not been prepared to
follow the evidence where

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.090 align:middle line:90%
the evidence has led.

00:35:18.090 --> 00:35:21.510 align:middle line:84%
So we have amazing scientists
like John Archibald Wheeler,

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.960 align:middle line:84%
like David Bohm, like Max
Planck, like Albert Einstein.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.190 align:middle line:90%
Giants.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Giants.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:31.320 align:middle line:84%
And Max Planck-- giants in
their field telling us actually

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.230 align:middle line:84%
the universe is
more a great thing--

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:37.050 align:middle line:84%
or sorry, the
universe is far more

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:38.970 align:middle line:84%
a great thought
than a great thing.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:43.260 align:middle line:84%
And that was first said by Sir
James Jeans over a century ago.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:46.550 align:middle line:84%
So we're now coming to a point
where the evidence is causing

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:49.490 align:middle line:84%
science to literally
turn upside down

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:53.960 align:middle line:84%
and to come to stand
alongside universal wisdom

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.190 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual teachings.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:02.430 align:middle line:84%
It's converging with them to
reveal a cosmology of wholeness,

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:06.970 align:middle line:84%
a cosmology of consciousness,
a science of love

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:08.830 align:middle line:84%
because if love
is about anything,

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:13.270 align:middle line:84%
it's about remembering
the interconnectedness

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and community and
wholeness of all that is.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.630 align:middle line:84%
So this literally is
a science of love.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.690 align:middle line:84%
>> So it seems like,
in your opinion--

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:24.460 align:middle line:90%
I'll leave this open.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:29.920 align:middle line:84%
What do we need to do about
this materialistic reductionism?

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, in my view--

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.160 align:middle line:90%
and it's not just my view.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.080 align:middle line:90%
It's about us waking up.

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:37.030 align:middle line:84%
It's about us waking
up and literally

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:39.670 align:middle line:84%
remembering who we
really are and the deeper

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:40.970 align:middle line:90%
nature of reality.

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:42.760 align:middle line:90%
So it's waking up.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:48.910 align:middle line:84%
It's growing up because this is
a very empowering understanding,

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:55.180 align:middle line:84%
but it calls us, it invites us
to step into that empowerment

00:36:55.180 --> 00:37:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and to accept our responsibility
joyously as co-creators

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.070 align:middle line:84%
of our realities and,
therefore, responsibility

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:09.840 align:middle line:84%
for how we are in the
world and with the world.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.720 align:middle line:90%
And then we can clean up.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.570 align:middle line:84%
We can clean up all
the traumas that

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:17.990 align:middle line:84%
have come alongside the
luggage, the baggage, that

00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:23.120 align:middle line:84%
have come alongside with this
misunderstanding and this buy-in

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:27.860 align:middle line:84%
to the myth of separation,
which is fairly modern.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It really has grown
to an extreme level

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.980 align:middle line:84%
in the last few hundred
and even the last 50 years.

00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So we haven't been having this
worldview, this fragmentation

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.180 align:middle line:90%
for the whole of humanity.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.280 align:middle line:90%
It's incredibly recent.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.940 align:middle line:84%
And in one sense, it's
helpful for the technology.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:49.880 align:middle line:84%
But in an infinitely
more profound way,

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:54.110 align:middle line:84%
it's been a huge disservice
for our evolution

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.110 align:middle line:84%
and for the evolution
of our relationship

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.780 align:middle line:84%
with Mother Earth
and the cosmos.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:04.046 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, if it's so recent,
at what point was it--

00:38:04.046 --> 00:38:05.210 align:middle line:90%
was it religion?

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:06.440 align:middle line:90%
Was it government?

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:10.550 align:middle line:84%
At what point did
it begin to emerge,

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:15.200 align:middle line:84%
this new concept, this
materialistic reductionism?

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, really, it probably
goes back about 300 years

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.880 align:middle line:90%
to the time of Isaac Newton.

00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:24.140 align:middle line:84%
And at that time, the
Church had huge authority.

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:26.270 align:middle line:84%
And there were a
number of what's

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:28.910 align:middle line:90%
called natural philosophers.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:30.410 align:middle line:84%
They weren't called
scientists then.

00:38:30.410 --> 00:38:31.952 align:middle line:84%
They were called
natural philosophers

00:38:31.952 --> 00:38:37.010 align:middle line:84%
who wanted to understand the
world not just through religion

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:39.870 align:middle line:84%
but through experiment
and testing.

00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:43.520 align:middle line:84%
And so the scientific
method was born of saying,

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:44.637 align:middle line:90%
I will research this.

00:38:44.637 --> 00:38:45.470 align:middle line:90%
I will look at this.

00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:48.150 align:middle line:84%
I will find out more about
it through experiment.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.060 align:middle line:90%
And so there came a deal.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.330 align:middle line:84%
There was a real deal between
the natural philosophers

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:55.490 align:middle line:90%
and the religious authorities.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.290 align:middle line:84%
The religious
authorities would look

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:00.620 align:middle line:84%
after the souls of everyone,
and the natural philosophers

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.490 align:middle line:84%
were OK as long as they just
looked at the physical world.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:07.940 align:middle line:84%
And that became very--
it was very sensible

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:12.230 align:middle line:84%
because if you weren't
willing to just research

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:14.390 align:middle line:84%
the physical world
as a scientist,

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:17.660 align:middle line:84%
you were potentially under house
arrest for the rest of your life

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.800 align:middle line:84%
as a heretic as Galileo was,
or you were burnt at the stake

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.450 align:middle line:90%
like Giordano Bruno was.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:26.000 align:middle line:84%
So it was a pretty
dangerous thing

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.300 align:middle line:84%
to not just keep to your
little bit of research.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.720 align:middle line:84%
But it creates a schism,
and that schism just grew.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And so scientists
began to denigrate

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:38.270 align:middle line:90%
religion and spirituality.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:41.330 align:middle line:84%
And spirituality
kept on its track.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So the two just separated
literally in their worldviews.

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:51.060 align:middle line:84%
And science was
very, very powerful.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.300 align:middle line:84%
It brought us the
Industrial Revolution.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.310 align:middle line:84%
It brought us--
well, first of all,

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.380 align:middle line:84%
the Enlightenment, the
Industrial Revolution,

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.190 align:middle line:90%
and on and on.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:00.590 align:middle line:84%
It brought us all
the technologies

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:03.200 align:middle line:84%
that make our lives
so much easier today.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:09.640 align:middle line:84%
But its basic premise was that
this material realm, this realm,

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.600 align:middle line:90%
this universe, is all there is.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:13.540 align:middle line:84%
There are no other
realms beyond it.

00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Its appearance of separation
is its true reality

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.980 align:middle line:84%
that our universe is
essentially an accident,

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:24.250 align:middle line:84%
that evolution
proceeds by accidents,

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that after a long, long, long
time, human beings emerged,

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.890 align:middle line:84%
evolved, and somehow
our consciousness

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:37.090 align:middle line:84%
arises from our
material brains somehow.

00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:38.800 align:middle line:90%
That was the story.

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:45.010 align:middle line:84%
So it's a story of separation,
of accident, of meaninglessness,

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:46.460 align:middle line:90%
and it's wrong.

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.780 align:middle line:90%
It's utterly wrong.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:51.280 align:middle line:84%
So we're now realizing through
the leading-edge science

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.400 align:middle line:84%
evidence that it is
fundamentally wrong

00:40:54.400 --> 00:41:00.040 align:middle line:84%
and that instead mind and
matter are essentially

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.280 align:middle line:84%
one, that mind expresses itself
as what we call energy, matter,

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and spacetime, and that mind
and consciousness are something

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.880 align:middle line:84%
we have, that what we
and the whole world are,

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and that our universe exists and
evolves both as a unified entity

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and with meaning
and with purpose

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:23.390 align:middle line:84%
because it's so
exquisitely set up.

00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It literally exists to
evolve from simplicity

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:32.870 align:middle line:84%
to complexity and
ever-greater levels

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:35.960 align:middle line:90%
of individuated self-awareness.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a universe that
is innately intelligent

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:42.860 align:middle line:84%
but, like a human
being growing up,

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:46.280 align:middle line:84%
learns to know
itself and experience

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:48.360 align:middle line:90%
the world in that way.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's a world
not of separation.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:56.400 align:middle line:84%
It's a world of unity
expressed in diversity.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.200 align:middle line:90%


00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:03.380 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it was interesting
that you said at one point,

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.050 align:middle line:84%
they were called
natural philosophers.

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:07.853 align:middle line:90%
And yet as that schism--

00:42:07.853 --> 00:42:08.770 align:middle line:90%
is that what you said?

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:10.240 align:middle line:90%
Schism.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:10.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Schism.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Schism.

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:12.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Trying to spell
it in my head.

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:19.390 align:middle line:84%
As the schism grew
wider, that no longer

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:21.110 align:middle line:90%
were they studying philosophy.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:21.910 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:24.700 align:middle line:84%
That's a really, really
important perspective

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.150 align:middle line:84%
because when quantum
physics came along,

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:31.750 align:middle line:84%
there were innately
some scientists who

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:33.280 align:middle line:90%
are natural philosophers.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:36.880 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to understand
not just the how but the why.

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.370 align:middle line:84%
They wanted to understand
the even bigger picture.

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:43.570 align:middle line:84%
And it may be apocryphal story,
but there is a story that

00:42:43.570 --> 00:42:46.480 align:middle line:90%
on one of the office doors--

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:49.480 align:middle line:84%
I think it was at Princeton--
it would say, philosophers,

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.320 align:middle line:90%
don't come in.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.500 align:middle line:90%
It's like, keep out.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.750 align:middle line:90%
We don't want this philosophy.

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:56.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't need to
understand this deeper--

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.630 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
was because if you

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.930 align:middle line:84%
are going to look at the deeper
meaning of what was coming

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:05.720 align:middle line:84%
forward in terms
of quantum physics

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.650 align:middle line:84%
and relativity physics as the
pioneering scientists themselves

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:12.710 align:middle line:84%
understood, you had to
ask the question, what

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:14.430 align:middle line:90%
is the nature of consciousness?

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:16.130 align:middle line:84%
What is the deeper
nature that this

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:19.250 align:middle line:90%
is beginning to reveal to us?

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And that was then
just put to one side.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:23.262 align:middle line:90%
We're not interested.

00:43:23.262 --> 00:43:24.470 align:middle line:90%
We don't want to get in con--

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And I think the reason
that they didn't

00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:29.990 align:middle line:84%
want to bring consciousness in,
which, of course, are now we

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:31.550 align:middle line:84%
having to because
the evidence is

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:35.990 align:middle line:84%
so powerful, is because there
was a concern that consciousness

00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:40.470 align:middle line:84%
and the meaning of
life was religious.

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So the way to keep religion and
spirituality out of the piece

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:48.890 align:middle line:84%
was to peripheralize
consciousness.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:51.800 align:middle line:84%
And that elephant in
the room has been there

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.370 align:middle line:90%
for almost 100 years.

00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And so consciousness
studies have tried so hard

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.390 align:middle line:84%
to figure out how
consciousness emerges

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.160 align:middle line:90%
from a materialistic brain.

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.060 align:middle line:90%
It's called the hard question.

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:10.391 align:middle line:84%
The reality is it's
the wrong question.

00:44:10.391 --> 00:44:12.830 align:middle line:84%
So only when we turn
everything on its head

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.980 align:middle line:84%
and realize that consciousness--
mind and consciousness

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.730 align:middle line:84%
expressed as
meaningful information

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:27.270 align:middle line:84%
is the fundamental
reality of our universe.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.840 align:middle line:84%
>> It's all making
more sense to me now.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.305 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm delighted.

00:44:31.305 --> 00:44:32.105 align:middle line:90%
>> Me too.

00:44:32.105 --> 00:44:34.800 align:middle line:90%


00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.600 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:36.920 align:middle line:90%
Let's just see.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.560 align:middle line:90%
I was curious.

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.570 align:middle line:84%
The question I have is,
what does the universe

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.820 align:middle line:84%
do with all of the information
that is transmitted?

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:45.140 align:middle line:90%
Where is the container?

00:44:45.140 --> 00:44:47.150 align:middle line:90%
Is it electric?

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.850 align:middle line:84%
>> It's holographic,
essentially.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:54.500 align:middle line:84%
I mean, what we call the
container of our universe

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:56.630 align:middle line:90%
is its holographic boundary.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:59.900 align:middle line:84%
And it of itself
is informational.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:03.950 align:middle line:84%
If you think of a balloon
blowing up from its beginning,

00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:07.250 align:middle line:84%
our universe has been
expanding spatially

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.860 align:middle line:90%
for nearly 14 billion years.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:10.980 align:middle line:90%
Time has flowed on.

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:16.770 align:middle line:84%
So if I was cosmic mind having
a thought that is our universe

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and I start that
universe in its tiniest

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:24.800 align:middle line:84%
way at the beginning of
spacetime as a big breath,

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:30.240 align:middle line:84%
so I'm essentially using my big
breath to blow up this universe.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So space expands and time
flows when I do that.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:36.750 align:middle line:84%
But the boundary
of that universe

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:39.180 align:middle line:90%
is the boundary of the balloon.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.690 align:middle line:84%
That boundary of the balloon
is that holographic boundary

00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:47.730 align:middle line:84%
on which all the information and
the accumulating information--

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:51.870 align:middle line:84%
as time flows and space
expands, more and more

00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:57.720 align:middle line:84%
and more information can
be experienced, explored,

00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.060 align:middle line:90%
evolved within our universe.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's like a human
having a lifetime.

00:46:04.350 --> 00:46:06.460 align:middle line:90%
Universes have a lifetime.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.640 align:middle line:84%
And they begin as
baby universes.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.970 align:middle line:84%
And they grow, and
time flows within them,

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:15.930 align:middle line:84%
and they accumulate experience
until they become an elder

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:16.890 align:middle line:90%
universe.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.140 align:middle line:10%
And then what we think
happens, we don't know,

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:23.250 align:middle line:10%
but it may be like a
balloon or a bubble

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:29.880 align:middle line:10%
bursting when it gets to
the end of its lifecycle.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:34.800 align:middle line:84%
And then in case of universes,
all that information, all

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.240 align:middle line:84%
that accumulated experience
and wisdom and knowledge

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:44.960 align:middle line:84%
just dissipates back into
the infinity of cosmic mind,

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:48.630 align:middle line:84%
and other great thoughts,
other universes arise.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:51.350 align:middle line:84%
So within that
infinity and eternity

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:56.360 align:middle line:84%
of cosmic mind,
thoughts, universes

00:46:56.360 --> 00:47:00.845 align:middle line:84%
arise and live and
grow and learn and die.

00:47:00.845 --> 00:47:04.600 align:middle line:90%


00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.340 align:middle line:90%
>> You're a great storyteller.

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:12.645 align:middle line:84%
I just-- I can just picture
us all going, please, more.

00:47:12.645 --> 00:47:15.940 align:middle line:90%


00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>> And by the way, the
scientific evidence is

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.602 align:middle line:90%
supporting this.

00:47:20.602 --> 00:47:21.685 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the whole point.

00:47:21.685 --> 00:47:24.420 align:middle line:90%


00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:26.810 align:middle line:90%
Oh, boy.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:27.610 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.550 align:middle line:90%
So I have a series of questions.

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:32.920 align:middle line:90%
How do we co-create?

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.690 align:middle line:90%
What power do we have with this?

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:37.990 align:middle line:84%
What do we need to do
to realize the ability?

00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:41.320 align:middle line:84%
Basically, how does every
thought, emotion, word,

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.230 align:middle line:84%
and action contribute to the
co-creation of the whole world?

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Those were your quotes.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.730 align:middle line:84%
Exactly, how does one
person affect one another

00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:51.070 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of the
planet without a computer,

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:54.970 align:middle line:84%
without a telephone, with
all of that-- without-- yeah.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:59.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, when we move into this
understanding that all we call

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:04.720 align:middle line:84%
reality is fundamentally
unified and we are part of that,

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.770 align:middle line:90%
there is no separation.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:10.450 align:middle line:84%
And yet there is differentiation
because otherwise, we'd

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:12.670 align:middle line:84%
be a gray gloop, and
we're not a gray gloop.

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:15.880 align:middle line:90%
We are people.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:20.920 align:middle line:84%
I have had stories
told to me of twins.

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's a lot of--
there's a lot of evidence

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:28.090 align:middle line:84%
and experimentation with twin
telepathy showing that twins

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:31.790 align:middle line:84%
are attuned to each
other at subconscious

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:32.940 align:middle line:90%
and conscious levels.

00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So when something
happens to one twin,

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:37.650 align:middle line:84%
the other is very
often aware of it.

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And that is because twins and
stars and people and trees

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.280 align:middle line:84%
and everything
within the universe

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:50.270 align:middle line:84%
is fundamentally
non-locally connected.

00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:55.620 align:middle line:84%
And yet, and yet to
be differentiated

00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:01.700 align:middle line:84%
and to experience and evolve,
within spacetime, there

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:05.900 align:middle line:84%
is a signaling cosmic
speed cop, and it's

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.680 align:middle line:90%
called the speed of light.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.310 align:middle line:84%
And if we didn't have
that, we wouldn't

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:15.260 align:middle line:84%
have the sort of appearance of
differentiation and difference

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:18.800 align:middle line:84%
that our universe is so
abundantly and gorgeously

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.940 align:middle line:90%
showing us.

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:24.650 align:middle line:84%
So our universe evolves
to both differentiate,

00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:27.540 align:middle line:84%
but it does so knowing
itself all the time.

00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:30.050 align:middle line:90%
So we affect each other.

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.730 align:middle line:90%
We affect our environment.

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:34.670 align:middle line:84%
Our environment affects
us all the time,

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:36.720 align:middle line:84%
whether we're
aware of it or not.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:40.160 align:middle line:84%
And our conscious
mind, our aware mind

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:45.980 align:middle line:84%
processes a tiny, tiny, tiny
proportion of the information

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.330 align:middle line:90%
that's always available to us.

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:50.640 align:middle line:84%
But when we're willing
to open ourselves--

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.420 align:middle line:84%
and it is literally
as simple as that,

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.700 align:middle line:84%
although there are various
modalities that have been

00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:00.150 align:middle line:84%
practiced for thousands of
years such as meditation--

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:03.590 align:middle line:84%
we can attune to
that information.

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:09.200 align:middle line:84%
We can actually deepen and
broaden our intuitive access

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:11.360 align:middle line:90%
to all of that information.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.020 align:middle line:84%
And there are so many ways that
are now open to us to do that.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:21.440 align:middle line:84%
We live in a generation which
is a global interconnectedness

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.990 align:middle line:84%
literally of information
technologically.

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:26.390 align:middle line:84%
So we can access
the way of yoga.

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:28.640 align:middle line:84%
We can access the
way of mindfulness.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:33.290 align:middle line:84%
We can actually learn how to,
in many, many different ways,

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:38.535 align:middle line:84%
tap into what is our
innate abilities.

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:40.660 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you say-- what
is our innate abilities?

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:43.630 align:middle line:84%
It sounds like maybe each of
us have different abilities.

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:46.390 align:middle line:90%
We don't all have everything.

00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:48.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I think we do
have the capacity,

00:50:48.370 --> 00:50:53.080 align:middle line:84%
but just as some people are more
gifted in art and others more

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:57.070 align:middle line:84%
gifted in music and others
more gifted in dancing to ABBA

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:59.300 align:middle line:84%
on a Friday night around
the kitchen table,

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:03.520 align:middle line:84%
which I'm really good at,
we have different abilities.

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.980 align:middle line:84%
This is the beauty
of differentiation.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:08.170 align:middle line:90%
Every one of us is unique.

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:12.580 align:middle line:84%
And yet there is a
fundamental commonality.

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:16.010 align:middle line:84%
We're all human in
a human community.

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:22.510 align:middle line:84%
So we're all co-creators of
our collective human psyche.

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:28.640 align:middle line:84%
We're all different notes in
this amazing cosmic symphony.

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:33.130 align:middle line:84%
We're all players in
an improv jazz session

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:34.630 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
know what's coming.

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So that symphony
is not yet written.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.970 align:middle line:84%
We're all showing up to
be improv jazz players.

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:46.130 align:middle line:84%
And improv jazz players, they
are great because what they do

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:47.930 align:middle line:90%
is they listen to each other.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:52.130 align:middle line:84%
They have to because otherwise,
the jazz just goes off.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:55.830 align:middle line:84%
To keep that coherence,
they need to hear and listen

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:56.630 align:middle line:90%
to each other.

00:51:56.630 --> 00:52:02.450 align:middle line:84%
They're literally playing
together into an adventure

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:04.880 align:middle line:84%
that they don't
know the future of.

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.140 align:middle line:90%
But they've shown up.

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.450 align:middle line:84%
They've been willing
to show up and play

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:09.970 align:middle line:90%
that adventure together.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:12.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I have a question is,
how do we turn around what we

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:15.950 align:middle line:84%
have already created into
something far better?

00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:19.800 align:middle line:84%
>> My sense is that
literally, we are waking up.

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:24.080 align:middle line:84%
Not everyone for sure, but there
are enough people waking up

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.500 align:middle line:84%
and then growing up
with this remembering

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and cleaning up to help sort out
our inner traumas and patterns

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:34.790 align:middle line:90%
that no longer serve us.

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:38.240 align:middle line:84%
Then we can show up,
not from our ego,

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.170 align:middle line:84%
but we can show up in
service as a world server,

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:45.380 align:middle line:84%
in service to something
that's greater than we are.

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:48.170 align:middle line:90%
And then we can link up.

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:50.120 align:middle line:90%
And then we can lift up.

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.950 align:middle line:90%
And I feel that's happening.

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:57.560 align:middle line:84%
And, for me, this is a
process of metamorphosis.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:01.970 align:middle line:84%
Metamorphosis is all
about a biological being

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:04.820 align:middle line:84%
such as a caterpillar
that has the potential

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.650 align:middle line:90%
to become a butterfly.

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And that caterpillar's
job is to eat.

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:12.470 align:middle line:84%
That caterpillar's
job is to go out

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:16.650 align:middle line:84%
there and eat as much as it can
regardless of the environment.

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:19.670 align:middle line:84%
So unless the environment's
in an ecosystem where there

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:21.740 align:middle line:84%
are enough birds to
eat the caterpillars,

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.280 align:middle line:90%
the caterpillar goes wild.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.720 align:middle line:84%
But in a healthy ecosystem,
there are enough caterpillars

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:30.200 align:middle line:84%
and enough birds to ensure that
the caterpillars go forward,

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.510 align:middle line:90%
but they don't eat everything.

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:34.670 align:middle line:90%
We're like the caterpillar.

00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:37.070 align:middle line:84%
With our fragmented
understanding

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:38.720 align:middle line:84%
of the nature of
reality, we've eaten

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.390 align:middle line:90%
as much as we possibly can.

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:43.450 align:middle line:84%
And because we are the dominant
species on this planet,

00:53:43.450 --> 00:53:45.980 align:middle line:84%
we have been able to
eat our environment.

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.730 align:middle line:84%
We've been able to
eat our fellow animals

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:51.970 align:middle line:84%
and other children of
Gaia because that's

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:57.340 align:middle line:84%
what our beingness, that's what
our awareness has taken us to.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But I think now
we're starting to go

00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:04.000 align:middle line:84%
into the chrysalis
of metamorphosis

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.980 align:middle line:90%
because it's not sustainable.

00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.350 align:middle line:84%
The way we are, there's
nothing more to eat.

00:54:08.350 --> 00:54:10.910 align:middle line:84%
We've eaten as much
as we possibly can.

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And when a caterpillar
gets to that point,

00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:15.550 align:middle line:84%
it naturally goes
into a chrysalis.

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:17.140 align:middle line:84%
And when it goes
into a chrysalis,

00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:19.000 align:middle line:90%
it starts to break down.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.160 align:middle line:90%
Its body breaks down.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.950 align:middle line:84%
It literally-- its immune
system starts to fail.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:26.830 align:middle line:84%
But what happens
within that chrysalis

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:29.110 align:middle line:90%
is something extraordinary.

00:54:29.110 --> 00:54:32.050 align:middle line:84%
The potential of the
butterfly starts to form,

00:54:32.050 --> 00:54:35.980 align:middle line:84%
and it begins to form in
what's called imaginal cells.

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:38.320 align:middle line:84%
The beginning of an antenna,
the beginning of an eye,

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.760 align:middle line:90%
the beginning of a wing.

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:45.470 align:middle line:84%
And as that butterfly starts
to create itself into being,

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:49.480 align:middle line:84%
the dying caterpillar
attacks it.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.000 align:middle line:84%
And that attack
strengthens the butterfly.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.520 align:middle line:84%
The butterfly needs
that dying caterpillar

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.740 align:middle line:90%
to attack it to strengthen it.

00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:00.460 align:middle line:84%
And inevitably, the
caterpillar dissolves away,

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.620 align:middle line:90%
and the butterfly strengthens.

00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:07.600 align:middle line:84%
And then a day comes when that
butterfly is ready to fly.

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:13.760 align:middle line:84%
And the chrysalis opens,
and the butterfly is free.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:16.800 align:middle line:90%
And that is our potential.

00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:19.860 align:middle line:84%
And to do that is
about remembering

00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.330 align:middle line:90%
the wholeness of all that is.

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:23.340 align:middle line:90%
And we may not make it.

00:55:23.340 --> 00:55:25.750 align:middle line:90%
We may not make it.

00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:30.420 align:middle line:84%
But, for me, if we are to make
it, that is the process for us

00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:34.860 align:middle line:84%
collectively to come
together, to go through.

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:39.660 align:middle line:84%
That is, for me, the next
step in the potential

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:43.980 align:middle line:84%
of our conscious evolution and
literally our cosmic destiny.

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:47.400 align:middle line:84%
This is, for me, what the
universe is calling to us,

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:52.050 align:middle line:90%
is inviting us to be and to do.

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:56.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I want to make sure
that I give you the opportunity

00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:00.030 align:middle line:84%
to say anything that we might
have left out that would be

00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:03.060 align:middle line:84%
related to what we're
doing here with intuition.

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.610 align:middle line:90%


00:56:05.610 --> 00:56:14.510 align:middle line:84%
>> For me, when we come into a
human form, a human beingness,

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:19.850 align:middle line:84%
our societies up till now
have taught us loneliness.

00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:25.060 align:middle line:84%
They have not nurtured
us in that wholeness.

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:28.150 align:middle line:84%
So they've taught
us to be lonely.

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And as we grow and as we have
the opportunity to remember,

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:35.860 align:middle line:84%
we can undertake a
journey from loneliness

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:41.830 align:middle line:84%
to a sense of aloneness,
to a sense of all oneness.

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:45.720 align:middle line:84%
And that is a journey
of intuitive wisdom.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:49.230 align:middle line:84%
That is a journey that
isn't about the knowingness

00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:50.350 align:middle line:90%
of our minds.

00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:52.260 align:middle line:90%
It's partly that.

00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:55.740 align:middle line:84%
But that journey from
loneliness to aloneness and then

00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:01.410 align:middle line:84%
to all oneness is ever more a
journey of intuitive knowing.

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:03.810 align:middle line:90%
It's an experiential knowing.

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:08.430 align:middle line:84%
It's literal re-membering
of ourselves.

00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:14.250 align:middle line:84%
And intuition is such an
incredible way-shower and guide.

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:18.360 align:middle line:84%
And the more we're open
to that intuitive knowing

00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:24.090 align:middle line:84%
rather than just the
knowing, here is wisdom,

00:57:24.090 --> 00:57:27.150 align:middle line:90%
here is knowledge.

00:57:27.150 --> 00:57:31.035 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge is great, but
wisdom is so much better.

00:57:31.035 --> 00:57:34.680 align:middle line:90%


00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
journey that intuition

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:41.850 align:middle line:84%
can open us to, be a guide
to, be a way-shower with.

00:57:41.850 --> 00:57:46.170 align:middle line:84%
And the fellow traveler of
intuition is synchronicity.

00:57:46.170 --> 00:57:49.380 align:middle line:84%
They play together
in my experience.

00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's a wonderful place,
a wonderful adventure.

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:59.100 align:middle line:84%
And I would invite anyone to
show up and be part of that.

00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:00.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:02.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Could I ask one question?

00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:03.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you were to be speaking
to somebody who was in a more

00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:11.090 align:middle line:84%
closed-off position, what is one
thing you would suggest for them

00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:14.540 align:middle line:84%
to try to get more in
touch with their intuition?

00:58:14.540 --> 00:58:16.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, first of all,
I'd give them a huge hug.

00:58:16.565 --> 00:58:19.280 align:middle line:90%


00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:23.510 align:middle line:84%
And I wouldn't necessarily
say much to them.

00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:28.490 align:middle line:84%
I would actually offer them an
experience, a simple experience.

00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:31.160 align:middle line:84%
And it can be as
simple as an experience

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:36.290 align:middle line:84%
of just being quiet
and taking some breath

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:39.650 align:middle line:84%
and allowing their
awareness on that breath

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:44.430 align:middle line:84%
to guide them within because
that's where intuition resides.

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:48.020 align:middle line:84%
So just being quiet,
sitting still, away

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:51.500 align:middle line:84%
from all the distractions
and the busyness of the day,

00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:55.790 align:middle line:84%
and just doing that every
day even if it's only

00:58:55.790 --> 00:58:57.380 align:middle line:84%
for a few minutes
in the morning,

00:58:57.380 --> 00:59:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and not trying to do
meditation or anything.

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:04.890 align:middle line:84%
Just be with the breath
and allow the breath

00:59:04.890 --> 00:59:06.450 align:middle line:90%
and the cycles of the breath.

00:59:06.450 --> 00:59:10.290 align:middle line:84%
So when you breathe out, let
go of any tension or anything

00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:12.420 align:middle line:84%
that's concerning
you or worrying you.

00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And then consciously, as
you breathe in, just breathe

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:21.680 align:middle line:84%
in this possibility, this
peace, this gentleness,

00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:27.230 align:middle line:84%
and just allow those
cycles to take you inward.

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And something's
waiting there for you.

00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:34.640 align:middle line:84%
Something's waiting there for
you, and it will welcome you.

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.200 align:middle line:84%
And it will welcome you
to this great adventure.

00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.000 align:middle line:90%
