00:00:10.714 --> 00:00:15.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So hi, I'm Dr.
Julia Mossbridge.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.830 align:middle line:84%
And I guess you could call me a
cognitive neuroscientist, that's

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.000 align:middle line:90%
my training.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.760 align:middle line:84%
Currently, I feel like
I'm more of a futurist

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.850 align:middle line:84%
and I'm studying some
kind of stuff in physics

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.780 align:middle line:84%
and I'm basically trying
to understand time.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:84%
So I don't like to put a
label on the fields I'm

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.430 align:middle line:90%
going to use to do that.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's multiple fields:
psychology, neuroscience,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.980 align:middle line:90%
physics.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm learning a little philosophy
but I'm not great at that.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.890 align:middle line:84%
So my training is in
cognitive neuroscience.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:84%
My background is,
if you want to know,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.070 align:middle line:90%
the institutions I've been at.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.240 align:middle line:84%
So Oberlin College, I
graduated with highest honors

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.030 align:middle line:84%
in neuroscience from there,
and minor in computer science.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And then went off
to UC San Francisco,

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.260 align:middle line:84%
studied neuroscience
in their PhD program

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.450 align:middle line:84%
but left with my
master's degree.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.150 align:middle line:84%
It's called a terminal master's
because I felt disillusioned

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:84%
and I wanted to go understand
something outside of what

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.900 align:middle line:84%
seemed to be the narrow
boundaries of academic science.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.740 align:middle line:84%
And I swore I would
never do science again,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.770 align:middle line:84%
and then I got super interested
in marine mammal communication

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.610 align:middle line:84%
and then I came back
to science and decided

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.150 align:middle line:84%
to get my PhD at Northwestern
University in communication

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.200 align:middle line:90%
sciences and disorders.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.010 align:middle line:84%
And I studied sound, I studied
the auditory system and learning

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:84%
in the auditory system,
specifically about timing.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.035 align:middle line:84%
So you hear a bleep,
and you hear a bloop,

00:01:31.035 --> 00:01:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and how did you figure
out the order of those

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.800 align:middle line:84%
and what does that have
to do with figuring out

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.810 align:middle line:84%
the synchrony or not of
those and what does that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.730 align:middle line:84%
have to do with
figuring out duration.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.460 align:middle line:84%
And from there, I did my
postdoc at Northwestern

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:84%
in the Psychology
Department looking

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.260 align:middle line:84%
at auditory visual
synchrony as well as

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.930 align:middle line:84%
looking at precognition
or presentiment, which

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.918 align:middle line:84%
is the physiological
version of precognition.

00:01:50.918 --> 00:01:52.710 align:middle line:10%
And if you don't know
what precognition is,

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.043 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to tell you right now.

00:01:54.043 --> 00:01:56.640 align:middle line:10%
It's getting information
about future events

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.400 align:middle line:10%
that you don't cause
and that you're not

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.200 align:middle line:10%
using logical inference to get.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.560 align:middle line:10%
So an example of causing would
be I dreamed that I woke up

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:10%
and I sang a song.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.680 align:middle line:10%
And then the next
morning, you go,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.090 align:middle line:10%
I had that dream I woke
up and sang a song.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.423 align:middle line:10%
So now I'm going to sing a song.

00:02:13.423 --> 00:02:15.000 align:middle line:10%
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.620 align:middle line:10%
That's not precognition.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.990 align:middle line:84%
Also an example
of inference would

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
be unconsciously I noticed
there was some thunder.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.455 align:middle line:84%
And so then consciously
I thought it might rain.

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:28.830 align:middle line:84%
And then I step outside my
door and I notice it's raining

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.600 align:middle line:84%
and I'm all proud
because I predicted it.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.150 align:middle line:84%
Well, that was subconscious
information you got

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.735 align:middle line:84%
and you processed it
and then you figured out

00:02:35.735 --> 00:02:36.610 align:middle line:90%
it was going to rain.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.130 align:middle line:90%
So that's also not precognition.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.000 align:middle line:84%
Precognition is generally
tested in the laboratory

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.258 align:middle line:84%
by actually creating a random
number generator that--

00:02:46.258 --> 00:02:48.300 align:middle line:84%
so no one on the planet
knows what the next thing

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.150 align:middle line:84%
is going to be, the event,
whatever event you're measuring.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use the
technical term thing.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And the random number generator
chooses the next thing.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.250 align:middle line:84%
And if you can, at
a rate above chance,

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.350 align:middle line:84%
figure out what that
thing is going to be,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
either consciously
or unconsciously,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.700 align:middle line:84%
and we can talk
about all of that,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
that would be an
example of precognition.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.970 align:middle line:10%
>> And how is that different
from a remote viewing?

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:10%
>> So precognition and remote
viewing are related in the sense

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.160 align:middle line:10%
that precognition is sort of
a larger umbrella term that

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.390 align:middle line:10%
includes multiple ways in which
you could be precognitive.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.387 align:middle line:10%
So one way is,
physiologically, your body

00:03:27.387 --> 00:03:29.970 align:middle line:10%
can predict future events that
you don't even consciously know

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:10%
it's predicting.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.338 align:middle line:10%
So for instance, before
an important event occurs,

00:03:35.338 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:10%
you might have had the
experience of a zing going

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.920 align:middle line:10%
through your body.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Like, wait,
something's going on.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.548 align:middle line:84%
That would be a
conscious awareness

00:03:40.548 --> 00:03:41.550 align:middle line:90%
of what your body knows.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.230 align:middle line:84%
But also, we can show
in the laboratory

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:84%
that your body
itself, on average--

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.580 align:middle line:84%
you take a bunch of humans,
stick them in a lab.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.380 align:middle line:84%
You record their
physiology, kind of

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.260 align:middle line:84%
don't care what system
you're looking at.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.080 align:middle line:84%
And you have a random number
generator producing events

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.000 align:middle line:84%
like showing a
picture of a plane

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.170 align:middle line:84%
crash versus a picture of a
pair of shoes, so something

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.010 align:middle line:90%
more neutral.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.860 align:middle line:10%
You can see beforehand,
when you analyze the data,

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.260 align:middle line:10%
the difference between
the physiology leading up

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.420 align:middle line:10%
to the randomly
selected emotional image

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.970 align:middle line:10%
versus the randomly
selected neutral image.

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.130 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
example of precognition.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.430 align:middle line:84%
Another example is
compulsive feeling.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.029 align:middle line:84%
I call it compulsion
precognition or compulsive

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
precognition where
you don't know

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.820 align:middle line:90%
why you have to do something.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:90%
You just have to do it.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.060 align:middle line:84%
And then once you
do it, you come back

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.885 align:middle line:84%
and you recognize, oh, if I had
been there during that time,

00:04:29.885 --> 00:04:31.510 align:middle line:84%
something horrible
would have happened.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.795 align:middle line:84%
So I would like to tell a story
about a general in the military.

00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:38.920 align:middle line:90%
I believe he was a general.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.750 align:middle line:90%
I'll have to go back and look.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.390 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, he's an officer in the
military, relatively high up.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.730 align:middle line:90%
And he's in Iraq, I believe.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's a really, really hot
at the point he was there.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.710 align:middle line:84%
And he was sitting in his van,
and he was just waiting around

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.010 align:middle line:90%
for the next thing to happen.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.230 align:middle line:90%
And it was really hot.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.870 align:middle line:84%
And he didn't want to go
outside, but he was thirsty.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.750 align:middle line:84%
Where he was sitting, he was
sitting on a cooler of water.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.720 align:middle line:84%
So he could absolutely have
had some water from the cooler.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.890 align:middle line:90%
But that's not what he did.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:08.820 align:middle line:90%
He felt compelled.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.780 align:middle line:90%
He said, no, I don't want water.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:84%
I want this kind of ice tea that
I have to get up out of here

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.010 align:middle line:90%
to go get.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.683 align:middle line:84%
And so he thought,
no, that's ridiculous.

00:05:15.683 --> 00:05:16.850 align:middle line:90%
I could just have the water.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:18.470 align:middle line:84%
He's like, nope, I'm
going to get the iced tea.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.270 align:middle line:90%
So he stands up.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.890 align:middle line:84%
He goes and gets the
iced tea, comes back.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
And he can't go back, because
a mortar had landed right

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:84%
near the van, and it
was now blocked off.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.212 align:middle line:84%
And so if he had been there,
he might have been right

00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:33.420 align:middle line:90%
in the way of this situation.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.440 align:middle line:84%
So that's an example of
compulsive precognition.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Another kind of precognition is
called controlled precognition.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's the
name, actually, I've

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
given to remote viewing
that is precognitive.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So remote viewing, which was
part of what many people think

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:90%
of as what is most sort of--

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.140 align:middle line:84%
I guess I should
be more precise--

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.150 align:middle line:84%
what many people think
of scientifically

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.265 align:middle line:84%
as one of the most validated
methods of precognition

00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:01.640 align:middle line:84%
and also just
getting information

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.560 align:middle line:84%
that's not in your temporal
or physical location.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.630 align:middle line:10%
Remote viewing is a technical
way to get that information

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.730 align:middle line:10%
and to get it down on the
page and query yourself

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:10%
of questions about
what this target is

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.350 align:middle line:10%
or objective is that
you're looking at.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.330 align:middle line:10%
Controlled precognition
is remote viewing

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.500 align:middle line:10%
that's precognitive.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.540 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of people
use remote viewing

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:10%
when other people might
know what the target is.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.250 align:middle line:10%
Other people in the room
might know what the target is.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.160 align:middle line:10%
So the problem with that is--

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.490 align:middle line:10%
not necessarily a problem.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.230 align:middle line:10%
But the problem with that is
if you want to know information

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.330 align:middle line:10%
about the future that's
independent of what anyone

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.600 align:middle line:10%
thinks, having someone in
the room that knows what

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.590 align:middle line:10%
the target is, is going
to make you potentially

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.470 align:middle line:10%
tune in to what they're
thinking about instead

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.850 align:middle line:10%
of the actual event.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So the nice thing about
precognitive remote viewing

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.020 align:middle line:84%
is you can use a
random number generator

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.220 align:middle line:90%
to determine the target.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:10%
And every session where you
sit down and consciously

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.803 align:middle line:10%
during the day or night but
you're awake, consciously

00:07:00.803 --> 00:07:02.220 align:middle line:10%
write down information
and act out

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.070 align:middle line:10%
information about the
target or the objective.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.070 align:middle line:84%
You can do it in a way
that no one on the planet

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.300 align:middle line:90%
knows what the target is.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And then after you're done,
you can use a random number

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.540 align:middle line:90%
generator to assign the target.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.248 align:middle line:84%
And then you can
actually get information

00:07:14.248 --> 00:07:18.710 align:middle line:84%
that you know is free of
anyone else's bias, at least

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.400 align:middle line:84%
those who can't travel in
time mentally, I guess.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's what I would
say the difference

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.170 align:middle line:84%
between remote viewing
and precognition is.

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.525 align:middle line:90%
>> And can anybody learn this?

00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:32.190 align:middle line:90%
Is this a natural ability, both?

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:32.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Which?

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Precognition.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, so precognition is, in
my view, a human birthright.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:42.110 align:middle line:10%
And actually, I think
there's evidence

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.520 align:middle line:10%
that other animals have it.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.940 align:middle line:10%
But certainly, among humans,
I think everyone has it.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.220 align:middle line:10%
And the question is, can
you get conscious of it?

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.920 align:middle line:10%
And what's your skill level
with communicating it to others?

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:54.290 align:middle line:10%
And so you can learn that.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:10%
You can learn to
get conscious of it,

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.080 align:middle line:10%
and you can learn to
communicate it to others.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.180 align:middle line:10%
And I also think there's
a level of talent.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.187 align:middle line:10%
So it's very much
like musical ability.

00:08:02.187 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:10%
I don't think it's
that hard to teach,

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:06.955 align:middle line:10%
most people know how to hum a
simple tune, which is, I think,

00:08:06.955 --> 00:08:08.330 align:middle line:10%
the equivalent of
teaching people

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:09.747 align:middle line:10%
how to do controlled
precognition.

00:08:09.747 --> 00:08:12.527 align:middle line:10%
Most people can do it.

00:08:12.527 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:10%
And they're actually impressed
with themselves when they do it

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:18.150 align:middle line:10%
because we don't usually think
we can predict the future.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.070 align:middle line:10%
But to get to the level
of skill so that it's

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:23.025 align:middle line:10%
operational and can
be used, there's

00:08:23.025 --> 00:08:24.150 align:middle line:10%
a lot of practice involved.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.420 align:middle line:10%
And there's some
natural talent involved.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.660 align:middle line:10%
To become an opera singer
or the first violinist

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.990 align:middle line:10%
in a symphony orchestra, there's
a lot of practice involved.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.909 align:middle line:10%
And you probably wouldn't
practice that much

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:39.470 align:middle line:10%
if you didn't have
that initial talent.

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So what do you do
right now in the world?

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:43.549 align:middle line:90%
Do you teach?

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.020 align:middle line:90%
Do you research?

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.550 align:middle line:84%
Tell us about what your
current endeavors are.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:48.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, what I do?

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, so my most recent
endeavor is I'm the executive

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.760 align:middle line:10%
director of a new nonprofit
called the Institute for Love

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.290 align:middle line:10%
and Time, TILT. And I created
that nonprofit to try to usher

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:04.250 align:middle line:10%
in technologies related to
mental and physical time travel

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.210 align:middle line:10%
and, at the same time, usher
in technologies related

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:10%
to unconditional love, because
there's this both a technical

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.640 align:middle line:10%
and practical relationship
between unconditional love

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.060 align:middle line:10%
and mental and
physical time travel.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.857 align:middle line:10%
And that's a whole
other conversation,

00:09:22.857 --> 00:09:23.690 align:middle line:10%
another ball of wax.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.065 align:middle line:10%
But if people are
interested, you

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:27.770 align:middle line:10%
can go check out the
website somewhere sometime.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:32.930 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of my newest
activities is that nonprofit.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it's really important,
as we start to understand how

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.580 align:middle line:84%
to travel in time mentally
and eventually physically,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.890 align:middle line:84%
that we also get in
touch with our capacity

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.850 align:middle line:90%
for unconditional love.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.980 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, like just
in a short story,

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.050 align:middle line:84%
what could happen is
you get into this place

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.140 align:middle line:84%
where you recognize, oh, what
can I change about myself about

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:50.940 align:middle line:90%
others?

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.557 align:middle line:90%
And that's kind of a disaster.

00:09:53.557 --> 00:09:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's, where can
we get to the point

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.320 align:middle line:84%
where that change isn't the
requirement for love, you see,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.080 align:middle line:84%
where there are no
strings attached to that?

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.740 align:middle line:90%
So there's something there.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.625 align:middle line:84%
And then the other thing is I've
been working on this physics

00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:06.750 align:middle line:90%
experiment I've been doing.

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.130 align:middle line:84%
This is my first
physics experiment.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:09.870 align:middle line:84%
I've been fascinated with
physics my whole life.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.203 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't trained in it, except
my father is a physicist.

00:10:12.203 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:84%
So I was trained by
him but not formally.

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.198 align:middle line:10%
And it's a super
fascinating experiment

00:10:18.198 --> 00:10:19.740 align:middle line:10%
having to do with
photons that seemed

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.970 align:middle line:10%
to travel in time in the sense
that we can get information

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:28.050 align:middle line:10%
about their future states
or their future quantity

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.930 align:middle line:10%
based on what's going on
in the present moment.

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.040 align:middle line:90%
And that's very exciting to me.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.316 align:middle line:90%
What else is going on for me?

00:10:35.316 --> 00:10:39.330 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I'm very excited
about future orientation.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.100 align:middle line:10%
So there's a
psychological construct

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:42.610 align:middle line:10%
called future orientation.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.730 align:middle line:10%
So that's the
extent to which you

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:10%
look toward the future
timeline or your future horizon

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.490 align:middle line:10%
in a positive way.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:56.220 align:middle line:10%
And it absolutely correlates
with education, health,

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.490 align:middle line:10%
well-being outcomes.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.060 align:middle line:10%
So to the extent that you
look toward the future

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.038 align:middle line:10%
with a positive
sense, you're going

00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:04.080 align:middle line:10%
to do better basically in
all areas of your life.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.420 align:middle line:10%
And not only that, you
can actually change it.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.680 align:middle line:10%
So there have been pretty cool
experiments with folks who

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.330 align:middle line:10%
live in dangerous conditions.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.050 align:middle line:10%
And if they get training
in future orientation,

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:17.545 align:middle line:10%
they do better.

00:11:17.545 --> 00:11:20.170 align:middle line:84%
They're more likely to graduate
from high school, for instance.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:84%
So I'm really into creating
technology that can help people,

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.240 align:middle line:84%
especially people who are at the
intersection of incarceration,

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:31.440 align:middle line:84%
poverty, addiction,
abuse, trauma.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.130 align:middle line:84%
People who don't necessarily--
you wouldn't think

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.680 align:middle line:84%
that the future orientation
would be positive because,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.050 align:middle line:90%
frankly, why would it be?

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:42.870 align:middle line:10%
But if you could build
technology or if I can build

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.580 align:middle line:10%
technology that can
help draw that out--

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.455 align:middle line:10%
I guess that's what I'm
doing with my hands--

00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:48.720 align:middle line:10%
draw out the future
orientation in a positive way,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.300 align:middle line:10%
then that could help people
live better, happier lives.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.660 align:middle line:10%
So that's something
I'm excited about too.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.210 align:middle line:90%
And you've written books.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.220 align:middle line:90%
>> I have.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:00.900 align:middle line:90%
>> On top of all of this.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.090 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:10.980 align:middle line:10%
And you've written a couple
similar but yet different,

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:16.020 align:middle line:10%
one of them being "The Calling,"
which I've actually read

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:10%
the "Transcendent Mind" as well.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:24.060 align:middle line:10%
And I'd love to, well,
first, open it up

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:27.360 align:middle line:10%
to see if you wanted to
specifically address something

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.710 align:middle line:10%
about each of those books.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.580 align:middle line:10%
And then I would like to
focus more on "The Calling"

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.800 align:middle line:10%
based on my own personal
experience with it.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.460 align:middle line:10%
>> I think it's smart to just
skip everything and go straight

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.640 align:middle line:10%
to "The Calling," just because
I've talked about those other

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.010 align:middle line:10%
books before, and who cares?

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.400 align:middle line:10%
This is just what
you're interested in.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.608 align:middle line:10%
That's what we're doing here.

00:12:45.608 --> 00:12:48.840 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I had such a profound
experience by following it

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.420 align:middle line:10%
to the T as T as I could get
and with really no compromise

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.430 align:middle line:10%
to what I was doing.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:10%
And I was so curious because it
was so unbelievably effective

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:10%
for me.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.610 align:middle line:10%
How on earth did
you get to the point

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:07.050 align:middle line:10%
to know to even write that which
was going to be so effective?

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.640 align:middle line:10%
>> No idea.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.200 align:middle line:10%
Can't help you there.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:13.110 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] Sorry.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.690 align:middle line:10%
So I am at this point-- so
here's what I've noticed.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:18.660 align:middle line:10%
The more effective I am--
as I get older and more

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.510 align:middle line:10%
experienced at doing this,
the more effective I am,

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.150 align:middle line:10%
the less I know how
I'm doing things.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.430 align:middle line:10%
People often say, how
do you get so much done?

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:29.005 align:middle line:10%
I do not actually know
the answer to that.

00:13:29.005 --> 00:13:30.630 align:middle line:84%
All I know is I wake
up in the morning,

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.920 align:middle line:84%
and I feel compelled to do
this thing and then that thing.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.962 align:middle line:84%
And I have this appointment
and that appointment.

00:13:34.962 --> 00:13:37.000 align:middle line:84%
And then at the end of
the day, I go to sleep

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.120 align:middle line:84%
and I'm tired because
I did a lot things.

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:38.970 align:middle line:90%
And then I wake up.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.900 align:middle line:84%
I think a lot of it happens
at night when I'm asleep.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.663 align:middle line:84%
I think there's
elves and brownies.

00:13:43.663 --> 00:13:45.080 align:middle line:84%
A friend of mine
used to call them

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.910 align:middle line:90%
elves and brownies in her head.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:49.550 align:middle line:84%
I do feel like there
might be another me.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.900 align:middle line:90%
Maybe there's another timeline.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:51.790 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.290 align:middle line:84%
I mean, these are all stories,
like science fiction stories.

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.970 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:57.870 align:middle line:10%
Why do I do things?

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.680 align:middle line:10%
And how do I figure out
what to put on the page?

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.390 align:middle line:10%
As a scientist and
as a writer, I've

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.640 align:middle line:10%
always been kind of an artist.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.190 align:middle line:10%
It's like I don't have
to worry about that.

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:10.410 align:middle line:10%
That's not my business.

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:15.670 align:middle line:10%
My business is feed the
mouth, nap the body.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:16.585 align:middle line:10%
You know what I mean?

00:14:16.585 --> 00:14:19.920 align:middle line:90%


00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.490 align:middle line:10%
It's not really up to me.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:22.680 align:middle line:10%
It really isn't my business.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.480 align:middle line:10%
It really isn't.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.580 align:middle line:10%
It's like the hose worrying
about, how do I get the water?

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:31.000 align:middle line:10%
Or the toaster being like,
how do I get the electricity?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.250 align:middle line:10%
That's also not your business.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.780 align:middle line:10%
You're either plugged
in, or you're not.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.580 align:middle line:10%
And when you're plugged
in, you can make toast.

00:14:35.580 --> 00:14:37.437 align:middle line:10%
And when you're not
plugged in, you can't.

00:14:37.437 --> 00:14:39.270 align:middle line:10%
And you're not in charge
of plugging you in.

00:14:39.270 --> 00:14:43.740 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, not my area,
above my pay grade.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.030 align:middle line:10%
>> What are you plugged into?

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.600 align:middle line:10%
>> What does a
toaster plug into?

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.680 align:middle line:10%
If I'm the toaster?

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.130 align:middle line:90%


00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:54.000 align:middle line:10%
>> I don't know.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.840 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] Scientifically,
I have to say

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.197 align:middle line:10%
there's a lot unknown here.

00:14:59.197 --> 00:15:00.780 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this is the
question of, where

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.653 align:middle line:84%
does creative impulse
come from, really?

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:05.070 align:middle line:84%
That's the question
you're asking.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:07.090 align:middle line:84%
Where does creative
impulse come from?

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:12.340 align:middle line:84%
And so it comes from
somewhere, but I don't

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.600 align:middle line:90%
think it's a spatial location.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.470 align:middle line:84%
I don't think we can think
about it in spacetime.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.320 align:middle line:84%
It might be from
the quantum vacuum

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.355 align:middle line:84%
if you want to think
about it scientifically.

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:24.730 align:middle line:84%
>> But what's the
quantum vacuum?

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.260 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.320 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like the void.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.120 align:middle line:90%
It's like the void.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.460 align:middle line:90%
There's no spacetime.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:34.840 align:middle line:90%
There's no nothing.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.790 align:middle line:84%
But that's where certain
quantum particles

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:41.620 align:middle line:84%
are before they're born here
or quantum fields or waves

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:44.500 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you want
to, possibilities.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Conscious collective,
the unified field?

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.350 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't know.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.311 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, so here's what--

00:15:50.311 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:10%
I'm an experimentalist.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.710 align:middle line:10%
So what I do is
I'm all empirical.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.552 align:middle line:10%
Theory is sort of boring to me.

00:15:58.552 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, maybe it's there.

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.400 align:middle line:10%
But if you can't test
it, could care less.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:10%
I could care less because
it's just masturbation.

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:06.910 align:middle line:10%
So it's just like--
which is fine.

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:10%
Masturbation is fine.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:13.090 align:middle line:10%
But what I love is
engaging the universe.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:90%
I have an idea.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.930 align:middle line:84%
Something comes into my
mind, basically, the universe

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:18.700 align:middle line:90%
or whatever.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.110 align:middle line:90%
Obviously, I'm in the universe.

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So something comes into my mind
that says, do this experiment.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:25.730 align:middle line:90%
And I'm like, OK.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And so then I do the
experiment because I

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.140 align:middle line:84%
feel compelled to
do the experiment,

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:90%
and then I find out something.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's different than
whatever my thoughts were.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.998 align:middle line:84%
But who cares about
what my thoughts are?

00:16:34.998 --> 00:16:37.640 align:middle line:84%
Because my whole goal is to
figure out this, this, this.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.867 align:middle line:90%
What's going on over there?

00:16:38.867 --> 00:16:39.950 align:middle line:90%
What is this nature thing?

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:41.300 align:middle line:90%
What is this engagement?

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.500 align:middle line:90%
I want to understand this.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.790 align:middle line:84%
That's my making toast
is to understand this.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:49.940 align:middle line:84%
And it's always going to be
more than what's in my head

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.710 align:middle line:84%
because my head is just
part of the universe.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:57.050 align:middle line:84%
So I have to, but I have to be
connecting with is something

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:90%
that's bigger than me.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.180 align:middle line:90%
I know that.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.210 align:middle line:90%
I can say that.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:02.360 align:middle line:84%
And I can also say
that it feels good.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.672 align:middle line:84%
I can say that it
feels positive.

00:17:05.672 --> 00:17:07.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't feel
like I'm connecting

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.849 align:middle line:90%
with something that's bad.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.800 align:middle line:90%
So there's that.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.920 align:middle line:90%
And those are the two facts.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.440 align:middle line:84%
It's a good thing
that's bigger than me.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.119 align:middle line:90%
Does that help you in any way?

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:21.095 align:middle line:84%
>> What compelled you
to write "The Calling"?

00:17:21.095 --> 00:17:22.440 align:middle line:90%
>> The same answer.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.869 align:middle line:84%
So what compels
anyone to do anything?

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:84%
>> There could be
various answers.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.937 align:middle line:84%
There could be
something they feel

00:17:27.937 --> 00:17:29.910 align:middle line:90%
that they could get out of it.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.200 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, but that's a story.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.340 align:middle line:10%
I just feel like we have these
stories about, oh, I did this.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.960 align:middle line:10%
Then I went to college
because I wanted to do this,

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.760 align:middle line:10%
and then I did it.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.930 align:middle line:10%
It's like that's a story.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.805 align:middle line:10%
But you have no idea
why you went to college.

00:17:41.805 --> 00:17:44.460 align:middle line:10%
There were a billion factors.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.810 align:middle line:10%
So I wrote "The Calling."

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like it's, to me,
that's a focus on the past.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.040 align:middle line:10%
And I'm so future focused.

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.760 align:middle line:10%
It's like I don't know.

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.660 align:middle line:10%
I did it because I did it.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.452 align:middle line:10%
But you want to talk
about what's happening

00:17:53.452 --> 00:17:55.830 align:middle line:10%
next because who cares?

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:56.730 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS]

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the reason is
because it was so effective.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:10%
And so I just was like,
how on earth did she ever

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.145 align:middle line:10%
know how to write this?

00:18:03.145 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:10%
And what I'm hearing
from you is really

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.320 align:middle line:10%
it was a higher source, that
it came from a higher source.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.570 align:middle line:10%
There was no agenda.

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:12.360 align:middle line:10%
There wasn't anything you
were looking to get out of it.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, although this
idea of a higher source--

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:10%
in the New Age world, people
talk about the higher self

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.420 align:middle line:10%
or whatever.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.870 align:middle line:10%
It, again, puts us on
this little hierarchy.

00:18:21.870 --> 00:18:24.120 align:middle line:10%
The electricity is not
higher than the toaster.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.020 align:middle line:10%
It's just different
from the toaster.

00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.540 align:middle line:10%
It's just not the toaster.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:32.875 align:middle line:10%
So it's just
something that's not--

00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:35.340 align:middle line:10%
I'm part of it, but
I'm not all of it.

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.090 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't have
to be higher or lower.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:41.080 align:middle line:90%


00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.750 align:middle line:84%
It's where the creative energy
comes from for any artist.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.315 align:middle line:84%
It's that same place,
wherever that is.

00:18:46.315 --> 00:18:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And most artists don't
care where that is.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.850 align:middle line:84%
They just want to ride that--
surf that wave because that's

00:18:51.850 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:90%
where the joy is.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.067 align:middle line:84%
And if you start worrying
about where it comes from,

00:18:55.067 --> 00:18:57.490 align:middle line:84%
then that gets boring, and
you're not in the wave.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:58.660 align:middle line:84%
You're like, where does
the wave come from?

00:18:58.660 --> 00:18:59.640 align:middle line:90%
Blah, blah, blah.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.280 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:84%
But thank you for saying it
was super effective because I

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.087 align:middle line:90%
think only when things--

00:19:06.087 --> 00:19:08.170 align:middle line:84%
at least from my experience,
only when things come

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.900 align:middle line:90%
from not my head but from--

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.030 align:middle line:90%
maybe through my head, right?

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.310 align:middle line:90%
One would hope.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:19.840 align:middle line:84%
But when things come from
this creative source,

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.310 align:middle line:90%
that's when they're juicy.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:23.050 align:middle line:90%
That's when they tend to work.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:84%
It's like people have this
idea, I think, sometimes.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.370 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if you
know Advaita, which is

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:31.850 align:middle line:90%
this kind of-- it means not to.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.240 align:middle line:90%
It's a nondual tradition.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.220 align:middle line:84%
And there's a wonderful
teacher of Advaita

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:36.720 align:middle line:90%
named Wayne Liquorman.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And three or five people
come to his house every day,

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:43.530 align:middle line:84%
and he's been
doing it for years.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.243 align:middle line:84%
And you don't become
famous teaching Advaita,

00:19:46.243 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:84%
because you're basically
teaching people

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
they have no control,
which basically doesn't

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.590 align:middle line:90%
get you any money or fame.

00:19:52.590 --> 00:20:00.240 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, he likes to say
people have this fantasy that

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.780 align:middle line:84%
with my brain and
with God's power,

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.110 align:middle line:84%
just think of what we could
do together, like a fantasy

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:09.870 align:middle line:84%
that we're big enough,
and we're smart enough

00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:11.610 align:middle line:90%
so that there's us and God.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:14.790 align:middle line:84%
And if we just combine and
cocreate, we can be amazing.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:84%
But it's very much like
the toaster thinking.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, if just the electricity
could use me to make toast,

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.700 align:middle line:90%
that's exactly what's going on.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.890 align:middle line:84%
The electricity is
using you to make toast.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:29.590 align:middle line:84%
You have no control over whether
it's plugged in or turned down

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.050 align:middle line:84%
or whether there's
toast in there.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:38.520 align:middle line:84%
Helplessness is very
powerful in creativity.

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.368 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a pretty
powerful statement.

00:20:40.368 --> 00:20:41.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, at the end
of "The Calling,"

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
there's a whole section-- have
you gone through the whole book?

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, I've gone through it.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.500 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't mean I remember it.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.000 align:middle line:10%
>> But at the end,
the last section,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000 align:middle line:10%
the last four chapters
are all about letting go--

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.250 align:middle line:10%
once I get you into, OK,
now you're in this place,

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:54.990 align:middle line:10%
you have this cognitive idea
of what you're calling is,

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:56.907 align:middle line:10%
just now you have to let
go of the whole thing

00:20:56.907 --> 00:20:58.530 align:middle line:10%
and let the universe take over.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:59.920 align:middle line:10%
That's where the power comes.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.590 align:middle line:90%
That's when it fully engages.

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.350 align:middle line:84%
That's when you can do things
is when you're not doing things.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:06.275 align:middle line:10%
>> We're just not worrying.

00:21:06.275 --> 00:21:08.458 align:middle line:10%
Or all of the things that
could get in the way of--

00:21:08.458 --> 00:21:09.750 align:middle line:10%
>> No, you could totally worry.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:11.250 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter
if you're worried.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:14.130 align:middle line:10%
The point is that the fantasy
is if I just don't worry

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.170 align:middle line:10%
or if I just have
this affirmation

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.660 align:middle line:10%
or if I just do this, it's
like you've got nothing.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:21.160 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter what you do.

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.210 align:middle line:90%
You're not in control.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:25.160 align:middle line:90%
You're not in control.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.550 align:middle line:10%
So it's not about whether you
worry or don't worry or let

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.220 align:middle line:10%
go or don't or surrender
or don't surrender.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.040 align:middle line:10%
>> Or being afraid.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.840 align:middle line:10%
Fear doesn't--

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:10%
>> Fear is awesome.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:37.360 align:middle line:10%
The point is if the person comes
along and plugs in the toaster

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:10%
and puts in the toast and puts
down the thing, the lever,

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:43.850 align:middle line:10%
the toast is going to get made.

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter if the toaster
is afraid, guilty, angry.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:50.350 align:middle line:10%
The point is it's
not in control.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, but you know what?

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.630 align:middle line:10%
Here's the thing.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.220 align:middle line:10%
People wonder how you get so
much done, and you're like,

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.020 align:middle line:10%
I don't know.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.270 align:middle line:10%
To me, what you're describing
is a day full of flow.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:59.900 align:middle line:10%
You're just flowing.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:10%
You're not allowing any
obstacles to get in the way.

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:02.410 align:middle line:10%
And--

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.360 align:middle line:10%
>> It's not that I'm
not allowing them.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.340 align:middle line:10%
It's that they're not
getting in the way.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.107 align:middle line:10%
And certain days
are not like that.

00:22:08.107 --> 00:22:09.940 align:middle line:10%
And I'm not in control
of whether the day is

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:11.080 align:middle line:10%
like that or not.

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.678 align:middle line:90%
I just have zero control.

00:22:13.678 --> 00:22:15.220 align:middle line:84%
It's really important
because there's

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.170 align:middle line:84%
this whole world
in which you think

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.290 align:middle line:84%
if I just do the thing right,
I'm going to be in control.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually a huge relief
and a huge anxiety reducer

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.850 align:middle line:90%
to just be like, oh, I get it.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.970 align:middle line:84%
My emotions and my state
is like the weather.

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:33.210 align:middle line:90%
I wake up and look outside.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:35.460 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's raining, I do
not have control over that.

00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.600 align:middle line:84%
Just like when I wake up
and I'm in a crappy mood,

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.820 align:middle line:84%
and I don't want to
do anything, I also

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:42.630 align:middle line:90%
don't have control over that.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's not like you
have to beat yourself up.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:45.290 align:middle line:90%
I'm doing something wrong.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm having negative
thoughts and da, da, da, da.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.800 align:middle line:84%
It's like that's
the weather today.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.100 align:middle line:84%
I wish for better
weather tomorrow.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:54.890 align:middle line:84%
I hope that there's some
way in which my wish can

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.170 align:middle line:90%
translate into reality.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:58.790 align:middle line:90%
I'll wake up tomorrow and see.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:84%
But it's a huge relief because
there's a lot of energy.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.610 align:middle line:84%
And I think that might be
one of the answers to how

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:08.287 align:middle line:84%
I get things done is I don't
have the opinion that I'm

00:23:08.287 --> 00:23:09.120 align:middle line:90%
getting things done.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.082 align:middle line:90%
So things get done.

00:23:10.082 --> 00:23:11.540 align:middle line:84%
But I think if you
have the opinion

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.930 align:middle line:84%
that you have to do all the
things, that's exhausting.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:17.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you have the opinion
that things happen to get done,

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.790 align:middle line:90%
that's much more relaxing.

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The things
happen to get done?

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:21.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.580 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And then still,
there seems to be--

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.850 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when we say
we don't have control,

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:33.990 align:middle line:84%
then I think of hopelessness,
people feeling hopelessness.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:38.040 align:middle line:84%
Well, if I don't have any
control, then why even live?

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.910 align:middle line:90%
Or I think of--

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.815 align:middle line:84%
yeah, can you address
the hopelessness?

00:23:43.815 --> 00:23:45.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, hopelessness.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.280 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, so you could think.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:90%
So--

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:50.067 align:middle line:90%
>> A responsibility.

00:23:50.067 --> 00:23:50.900 align:middle line:90%
>> A responsibility.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.860 align:middle line:84%
>> It's just like, oh, I guess
I'm not responsible for anything

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.900 align:middle line:84%
then if somebody else is
taking care of everything.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:55.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:90%
That's not how it is, though.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:90%
I get it.

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:00.880 align:middle line:84%
I get it that it
sounds like that.

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.020 align:middle line:84%
But the actual
experience is huge--

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:05.890 align:middle line:90%
so I get it.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:08.370 align:middle line:90%
So this is you.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.610 align:middle line:84%
Let's say this is me,
just because it's closer.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:11.410 align:middle line:90%
It's my hand.

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:14.700 align:middle line:90%
So this is me.

00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:16.290 align:middle line:84%
But you can imagine
it's you, right?

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And if it says, oh,
I can relax, I'm

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.863 align:middle line:84%
no longer responsible for moving
my fingers in a certain way

00:24:22.863 --> 00:24:24.780 align:middle line:84%
because there's something
else outside of me--

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it a brain--

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:29.650 align:middle line:84%
that is moving my
fingers in a certain way.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:84%
So I can just let
my fingers be moved.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.420 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out
that I don't even

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.753 align:middle line:90%
have to let my fingers be moved.

00:24:34.753 --> 00:24:36.840 align:middle line:84%
The brain is just going
to do this anyway.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And then it turns
out that I start

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:43.710 align:middle line:84%
to relax because I don't
have to do anything.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:45.900 align:middle line:90%
It just gets done through me.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So you could say, well, now the
hand isn't taking responsibility

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:49.673 align:middle line:90%
for itself.

00:24:49.673 --> 00:24:51.090 align:middle line:84%
So if the hand
punches someone, it

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.120 align:middle line:84%
could just be like the
brain made me do it.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.660 align:middle line:90%
It was the brain.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.030 align:middle line:84%
But then you have to
say, well, no, actually,

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.720 align:middle line:90%
you're connected to the brain.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.194 align:middle line:84%
So no, you're responsible, and
you're this individual unit.

00:25:03.194 --> 00:25:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Culturally, this is a unit
that has responsibility.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.290 align:middle line:84%
So culturally, you do
have responsibility.

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.910 align:middle line:84%
So sorry, that's the
way it works culturally.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.500 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't mean that's
actually what's happening.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.060 align:middle line:10%
So the way it
works culturally is

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.560 align:middle line:10%
we're responsible
for our behaviors.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:18.340 align:middle line:10%
And we can get put in jail if
we do something that's horrible

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.900 align:middle line:10%
or if we get caught.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.370 align:middle line:10%
It depends.

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:26.400 align:middle line:10%
But I'm not saying that you
should go do things and not

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.200 align:middle line:10%
get caught.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.220 align:middle line:10%
I'm just saying it depends
on what race you are

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.380 align:middle line:10%
and if you're rich and if
you get away with things.

00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:36.160 align:middle line:10%
It depends on that.

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.500 align:middle line:10%
But that's true culturally.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:40.730 align:middle line:10%
That's not necessarily
the true truth.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.700 align:middle line:10%
And so there's another
experience that

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:47.088 align:middle line:10%
happens when you have that true
truth feeling that I don't know

00:25:47.088 --> 00:25:49.130 align:middle line:10%
is true, but I have the
experience of being true.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.930 align:middle line:10%
So whatever.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:57.420 align:middle line:10%
This could all be BS, that the
universe is responsible for you

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:58.920 align:middle line:10%
because you're part
of the universe.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:25:59.720 align:middle line:90%
I'm the hand.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.698 align:middle line:90%
I'm part of this body.

00:26:00.698 --> 00:26:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So I'm responsible because
I'm part of this body.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:06.340 align:middle line:10%
I just don't have
control over what I do.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.140 align:middle line:10%
I don't have control over what
I do, but I'm part of this body.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.140 align:middle line:10%
So there's a feeling
of connection

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.770 align:middle line:10%
with the rest of the universe--

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:13.570 align:middle line:10%
oh, I get it.

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:16.840 align:middle line:10%
It's beyond me-- and a
feeling of relaxation.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.480 align:middle line:10%
And hopelessness actually
goes out the window.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.870 align:middle line:10%
I mean, this is the basis of
the first step of all 12-step

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.510 align:middle line:10%
groups.

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:28.510 align:middle line:10%
This is it is this
idea of powerlessness.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:33.376 align:middle line:10%
And that is where it all begins.

00:26:33.376 --> 00:26:35.020 align:middle line:10%
If you just do the
right thing, you're

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.860 align:middle line:10%
going to basically trick the
universe to go in your way.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.190 align:middle line:10%
That's not recognizing the
vastness of the universe

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.660 align:middle line:10%
and the smallness of you.

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:50.260 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] It's just a false
impression of the scale.

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:51.940 align:middle line:90%
And there's no tricking.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:52.990 align:middle line:90%
There's no tricking.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:54.602 align:middle line:84%
There's no special
dance you can do.

00:26:54.602 --> 00:26:57.340 align:middle line:90%


00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:59.420 align:middle line:84%
There's acknowledgment
of what's true,

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:01.630 align:middle line:84%
which is that you're
an instrument.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:84%
And you will either
get used or not.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.910 align:middle line:90%
And on one day, it will go well.

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:09.280 align:middle line:90%
And the next day, it won't.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.705 align:middle line:84%
And it's not up to you, and it's
the opposite of hopelessness.

00:27:12.705 --> 00:27:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I think hopelessness
happens when

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:17.380 align:middle line:84%
you think that in order to be
happy, you have to have control.

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.062 align:middle line:84%
And then all of a
sudden, someone says,

00:27:19.062 --> 00:27:20.020 align:middle line:90%
you don't have control.

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.700 align:middle line:84%
And you know secretly
you don't have control

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.440 align:middle line:84%
because all the time,
we have experiences

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.760 align:middle line:90%
of not being in control.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.760 align:middle line:84%
It's rare when we
actually feel in control.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.270 align:middle line:84%
And so hopelessness
comes when you

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:33.850 align:middle line:84%
think you have to be
in control to be happy,

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:37.900 align:middle line:84%
or you think you have to be in
control to change your existing

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.380 align:middle line:90%
circumstance.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Or you think you have to change
your existing circumstances

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:43.630 align:middle line:90%
to be happy.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.610 align:middle line:84%
All those things, that's
where hopelessness comes in.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But if you can say this
exactly what's happening

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:50.950 align:middle line:90%
right now is what is--

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:51.760 align:middle line:90%
if you can.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.773 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying you can, because
you don't have control over it.

00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But if you can get to the place
where sometimes you can do that,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.720 align:middle line:90%
you'll notice it feels better.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.220 align:middle line:84%
And you have no control over
whether you can do that or not,

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.430 align:middle line:84%
and neither do I have any
control over whether I

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.110 align:middle line:90%
can do that in this worldview.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:13.260 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems like this is a basic
principle for precognition.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.060 align:middle line:90%
There is no control.

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.510 align:middle line:84%
Let's not try to pretend we're
trying to control anything.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.500 align:middle line:90%
It happens.

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.500 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that's the ethical
way to do precognition.

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.010 align:middle line:10%
I think if you start to get
to this mastery approach

00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:28.740 align:middle line:10%
where you're like, I'm
going to do precognition

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:35.700 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to dictate what
kind of information I get,

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.365 align:middle line:10%
I think you're not doing--

00:28:37.365 --> 00:28:39.240 align:middle line:10%
first of all, I don't
think your precognition

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.060 align:middle line:10%
is going to be any good, because
you have to be a receiver, which

00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:43.800 align:middle line:10%
means you strictly receive.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.210 align:middle line:10%
You're not transmitting.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:10%
And I think you have
to have humility.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.750 align:middle line:10%
And I think if you start going
after the grabby approach,

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.850 align:middle line:10%
people fall off the ledge
all the time with that

00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:57.590 align:middle line:10%
because it's an egoic--

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.028 align:middle line:10%
I know what's best.

00:28:59.028 --> 00:29:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to go get this thing.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.520 align:middle line:90%
It's going to be the best.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.125 align:middle line:84%
No, you get what you get
because you're a receptor sheet.

00:29:05.125 --> 00:29:06.500 align:middle line:84%
You're just a
receptor sheet when

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.950 align:middle line:90%
you're doing that kind of work.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And so whatever it is or it
isn't-- if you've read Julia

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Cameron, "The Artist's Way,"
I modeled "The Calling"

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:18.710 align:middle line:90%
after her 12-week concept.

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.380 align:middle line:90%
And she's wonderful.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.590 align:middle line:84%
And in that book, she's
she says like, you're--

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:25.610 align:middle line:90%
she's absolutely right.

00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Your business is not
what goes on the page

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.530 align:middle line:90%
if you're an artist or a writer.

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:34.100 align:middle line:84%
Your business is
being at the page.

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Your business is
putting yourself

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.330 align:middle line:84%
in a position where that
can come through you.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.048 align:middle line:84%
The toaster's job
is to be a toaster.

00:29:40.048 --> 00:29:41.840 align:middle line:10%
If it all of a sudden
starts thinking like,

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.875 align:middle line:10%
no, I'm an oak tree,
that's not its job.

00:29:45.875 --> 00:29:47.750 align:middle line:84%
Also, it won't affect
whether it makes toast.

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:52.670 align:middle line:84%
But people as toasters,
that's my philosophy.

00:29:52.670 --> 00:29:53.700 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So we've talked
about precognition,

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:59.060 align:middle line:84%
but we really haven't talked
about where intuition fits

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:00.120 align:middle line:90%
in with all of this.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.090 align:middle line:84%
And if you could really
help us sort through that

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:05.130 align:middle line:90%
and all of the different--

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:08.400 align:middle line:84%
I remember you presenting
that answer to me before.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.700 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd love to
hear that explanation.

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:11.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, sure.

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.142 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's talk about
the relationship

00:30:13.142 --> 00:30:14.900 align:middle line:84%
between precognition
and intuition.

00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.648 align:middle line:84%
OK, yeah, so intuition is like a
big umbrella for lots of things.

00:30:19.648 --> 00:30:21.440 align:middle line:84%
The umbrella analogy
is always really good.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.680 align:middle line:84%
So intuition has
underneath it things

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.460 align:middle line:90%
like subconscious intuition.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.203 align:middle line:84%
I subconsciously
hear the thunder.

00:30:31.203 --> 00:30:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And I knew it was
raining, even though I

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:34.120 align:middle line:90%
didn't know that's how I knew.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.490 align:middle line:10%
So that's subconscious
intuition.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.980 align:middle line:10%
Most intuition is thought
of as subconscious

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.185 align:middle line:10%
in the sense of that's
why it's called intuition.

00:30:42.185 --> 00:30:44.060 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a story
about how we got there.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.550 align:middle line:84%
But we got to some kind of
a solution to something.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:50.370 align:middle line:84%
Then there's intuition
that's logical intuition.

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:53.340 align:middle line:10%
You work long enough in
mathematics or philosophy

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.580 align:middle line:10%
or science, and you end up
with this logical intuition

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:58.830 align:middle line:10%
that you don't have
to think about all

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:01.800 align:middle line:10%
the modus ponens or any
kind of logical structures.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.410 align:middle line:84%
You just have this logical--
oh, that makes logical sense.

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, that doesn't.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:06.810 align:middle line:90%
It just arises.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:08.700 align:middle line:10%
All the rest is
background information

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.100 align:middle line:10%
that you're not
really conscious of.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.650 align:middle line:10%
Then there's things
like precognition,

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:16.290 align:middle line:10%
which is not logical intuition.

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:17.730 align:middle line:90%
It's not sensory intuition.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:18.990 align:middle line:90%
It's not memory intuition.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.580 align:middle line:84%
It's not based on
anything that's

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.800 align:middle line:84%
available in the present
moment, as far as we know.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.320 align:middle line:84%
It's based on
information that seems

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.220 align:middle line:84%
to be coming from the future
if it's actual precognition.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's a subset of
intuition where the information

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:34.650 align:middle line:90%
is coming from the future.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, the interesting thing about
these things under this umbrella

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.470 align:middle line:84%
is they all are
separated out by, where

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:41.770 align:middle line:90%
is the information coming from?

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:42.630 align:middle line:90%
Is it coming from sense?

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:43.650 align:middle line:90%
Is it coming from logic?

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:45.733 align:middle line:84%
Is it coming from some
kind of sense of the future

00:31:45.733 --> 00:31:47.680 align:middle line:90%
that we don't understand?

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And so it presumes this
idea that this is all

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.225 align:middle line:84%
happening via exchange
of information

00:31:54.225 --> 00:31:58.080 align:middle line:84%
or reception of information
or processing of information.

00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.390 align:middle line:90%
And that doesn't mean it is.

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:03.310 align:middle line:84%
That's a way to think about
it that makes sense to people.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:05.950 align:middle line:84%
So I just want to
make that caveat.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:11.830 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and also, seems to be
some trigger words out there

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:16.690 align:middle line:84%
in this community and other
communities about intuition,

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:21.580 align:middle line:84%
the word "intuition" and psychic
abilities and a lot of people

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.390 align:middle line:84%
who are like, oh, we don't say
psychic abilities, or oh, no,

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:29.630 align:middle line:84%
intuitions, that New Agey thing,
even within this community.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:37.090 align:middle line:84%
So I would love to
know maybe why that is.

00:32:37.090 --> 00:32:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:43.343 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so there's
sort of multiple--

00:32:43.343 --> 00:32:45.010 align:middle line:84%
do you want me to
rephrase the question?

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:46.302 align:middle line:90%
Or are we going to be able to--

00:32:46.302 --> 00:32:47.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely rephrase, yeah.

00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:50.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.920 align:middle line:10%
So yeah, sometimes
psychics have a bad name

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.440 align:middle line:10%
or the name psychic
ability has a bad name.

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:00.740 align:middle line:10%
Some organizations or
groups of people, intuition

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.400 align:middle line:10%
has a bad name.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.955 align:middle line:10%
I tend not to care so much
about that, because who cares?

00:33:06.955 --> 00:33:09.080 align:middle line:10%
That's a cultural thing
that's happening right now,

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:10.610 align:middle line:10%
and it won't always
happen or whatever.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:12.950 align:middle line:10%
But I do think it's interesting
to sociologically look

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:14.000 align:middle line:10%
into why that is.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.650 align:middle line:10%
And I think that has to do
with a couple of things.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:20.420 align:middle line:10%
So one is there are street
psychics or psychics who

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.582 align:middle line:10%
take money to do their work,
and they're basically frauds.

00:33:23.582 --> 00:33:25.040 align:middle line:10%
I mean, they're
doing cold reading.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So they're checking into your
response, and they're like,

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:31.760 align:middle line:84%
oh, you're going to meet a
tall, dark, no, light stranger.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.328 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHS] Let's just
tailor whatever

00:33:34.328 --> 00:33:36.120 align:middle line:10%
I'm going to say to
whatever it looks like.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.240 align:middle line:10%
And if you can read
people, you can do this.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.383 align:middle line:10%
And a good teacher can do this
because they're always reading

00:33:42.383 --> 00:33:43.550 align:middle line:10%
the faces of their students.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:44.960 align:middle line:10%
And they're responding,
oh, we're not

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.130 align:middle line:10%
going to discuss that topic.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:47.580 align:middle line:10%
They're nowhere near that topic.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.900 align:middle line:10%
We're going to do this topic.

00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.680 align:middle line:10%
So that's just reading faces.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:54.050 align:middle line:10%
And it might have some
psychic ability too.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.000 align:middle line:10%
But it's largely
about telling someone

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.160 align:middle line:10%
what they want to hear, which is
not the same thing as actually

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.660 align:middle line:10%
giving someone information that
they might not want to hear,

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:04.490 align:middle line:10%
which oftentimes psychic
information is more akin to

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:06.630 align:middle line:10%
or surprising information.

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:11.900 align:middle line:10%
So there's that, and that has
given psychics a bad name.

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.491 align:middle line:10%
So that's one good
reason to say, OK, well,

00:34:14.491 --> 00:34:15.949 align:middle line:10%
maybe that's why
the word "psychic"

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.210 align:middle line:10%
is not appealing to people.

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.570 align:middle line:84%
But there's a deeper
reason because there's also

00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:22.340 align:middle line:90%
frauds in every field.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.500 align:middle line:84%
So there's fraudulent
scientists.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:84%
There's fraudulent
technologists.

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:29.339 align:middle line:84%
There's fraudulent financiers,
financier, financier?

00:34:29.339 --> 00:34:30.139 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:33.380 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:35.250 align:middle line:90%
So what is it really?

00:34:35.250 --> 00:34:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And what I think it might really
be is a fear of losing the self,

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.770 align:middle line:90%
so losing your ego.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.679 align:middle line:10%
So if we're all
connected in this way

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:49.190 align:middle line:10%
where someone can actually get
a sense of the probabilities

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.085 align:middle line:10%
of your future or
what's important to you

00:34:52.085 --> 00:34:53.460 align:middle line:10%
or what you're
thinking about now

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.010 align:middle line:10%
and what you're concerned
about and what would help you

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.532 align:middle line:10%
in some kind of way in terms
of psychic healing work,

00:34:59.532 --> 00:35:01.740 align:middle line:10%
it means we're all connected
at a really basic level.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.580 align:middle line:10%
And my opinion
that I have control

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:10.320 align:middle line:10%
over this or anything in my
head or anything that I do

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.170 align:middle line:10%
starts to waver because
there's these strings that

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:15.450 align:middle line:10%
can be tugged at
across a distance,

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:20.100 align:middle line:10%
across time and space, which
is terrifying to most people.

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.350 align:middle line:90%
So I think it's that.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:24.420 align:middle line:10%
I think it's like
as long as we can--

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.720 align:middle line:10%
the materialistic worldview that
scientists have been trained in

00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:33.240 align:middle line:10%
and I was certainly trained
in, that this thing is here.

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.580 align:middle line:10%
And it's not this thing, and
there's little relationship

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:37.910 align:middle line:10%
between them, except
whatever the nerves are

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:39.660 align:middle line:10%
doing that can relate
them and the muscles

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.610 align:middle line:10%
and the fascia, et cetera.

00:35:41.610 --> 00:35:44.490 align:middle line:10%
There can't be any other
relationship that is nonvisual

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.520 align:middle line:10%
or that's nontactile
that we don't understand.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.410 align:middle line:84%
It can't be any kind of
mysterious connection

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.020 align:middle line:84%
between things, whether
in space or time.

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.200 align:middle line:10%
That worldview,
which doesn't match

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.790 align:middle line:10%
with any of the
mystical worldviews

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:59.100 align:middle line:10%
or, frankly, of the
scientific worldviews

00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.300 align:middle line:10%
before the Enlightenment.

00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:07.440 align:middle line:10%
But that worldview puts us in a
position where we get terrified

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.608 align:middle line:10%
of connection because
almost, I think,

00:36:10.608 --> 00:36:12.150 align:middle line:10%
the reason that
worldview was adopted

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:14.130 align:middle line:10%
was because it was comforting.

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:16.947 align:middle line:90%
So it is scary.

00:36:16.947 --> 00:36:18.780 align:middle line:84%
I think that's part of
why we have religion.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:21.120 align:middle line:84%
It is scary to think we have
this connection over time

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:21.580 align:middle line:90%
and space.

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:22.470 align:middle line:90%
So what do we do with that?

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:24.210 align:middle line:10%
If that's really
real, which we sense

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:27.428 align:middle line:10%
that it is, which is why
we're scared of it, then

00:36:27.428 --> 00:36:28.470 align:middle line:10%
what do we do about that?

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Jeez, anyone could affect me.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.675 align:middle line:90%
I don't have control.

00:36:30.675 --> 00:36:31.485 align:middle line:90%
Oh, no, oh, no.

00:36:31.485 --> 00:36:34.310 align:middle line:90%


00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:35.710 align:middle line:90%
It's terrifying.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:36.990 align:middle line:90%
So I think that's why.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:39.900 align:middle line:84%
I think the longer people can
say, no, that doesn't exist,

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.270 align:middle line:84%
it's not scientific or
whatever, even though the data--

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.057 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's plenty
of data out there.

00:36:44.057 --> 00:36:45.390 align:middle line:90%
I don't want to talk about data.

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:49.440 align:middle line:84%
But there's plenty of data
that I talk about other times

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.720 align:middle line:84%
out there that this stuff
is scientifically valid.

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.390 align:middle line:84%
But the longer you
can say it's not real,

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:57.377 align:middle line:84%
the more you cannot
get in touch with, boy,

00:36:57.377 --> 00:36:58.710 align:middle line:90%
we're in a precarious situation.

00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.740 align:middle line:84%
I have a thought, and my thought
can affect you without me even

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:02.790 align:middle line:90%
stating my thought.

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Or I'm in a
precarious situation.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:07.965 align:middle line:84%
My story about who I am as an
independent being is false.

00:37:07.965 --> 00:37:10.720 align:middle line:90%


00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.330 align:middle line:10%
So it's the existential.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.195 align:middle line:10%
I think it's the existential
angst that comes up when--

00:37:15.195 --> 00:37:17.070 align:middle line:10%
and that's why it would
be better if psychics

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.620 align:middle line:10%
weren't real for people.

00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.700 align:middle line:10%
>> That's true.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.977 align:middle line:10%
And you talked about the
data, and I thought, well,

00:37:24.977 --> 00:37:27.560 align:middle line:10%
we do need to visit because we
need to talk about the science.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.790 align:middle line:10%
And we need to talk
about the data.

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:30.590 align:middle line:10%
>> Sure, but not in
that sentence, yeah.

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:31.390 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:32.340 align:middle line:10%
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.140 align:middle line:90%


00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.250 align:middle line:10%
So let's go there.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:35.930 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, you want to
talk about the data?

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.263 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, what's out there,
because everybody says, yeah,

00:37:38.263 --> 00:37:39.410 align:middle line:10%
there's plenty of evidence.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:43.838 align:middle line:10%
And yet it's not so obvious
or out there for the average--

00:37:43.838 --> 00:37:45.380 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, actually,
let's talk about--

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.900 align:middle line:10%
so there's multiple ways to--

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:50.513 align:middle line:10%
if you wanted to understand the
data, underlying precognition,

00:37:50.513 --> 00:37:52.430 align:middle line:10%
you could read my book
"The Premonition Code."

00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:54.030 align:middle line:10%
You could read a
bunch of other books.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.880 align:middle line:10%
So there's a bunch of
information out there.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:57.338 align:middle line:10%
You could also go
to Google Scholar

00:37:57.338 --> 00:37:59.420 align:middle line:10%
and just look up
precognitive abilities.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:02.930 align:middle line:10%
You could also look up
predictive anticipatory activity

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:06.470 align:middle line:10%
to find any of that
information, so go have at it.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:09.380 align:middle line:10%
But I think the more
interesting question

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:17.180 align:middle line:10%
is there's enough data there so
that if what the data were about

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.030 align:middle line:10%
were about some kind of new
drug for some kind of disease,

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.930 align:middle line:10%
people would be taking
the drug for that disease.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:25.810 align:middle line:10%
And so the question is,
why do people not get it?

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:32.400 align:middle line:10%
And I think one of the
answers is that these

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.930 align:middle line:10%
are small statistical effects.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.930 align:middle line:84%
And people who are
really talented

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:39.210 align:middle line:84%
would have larger effects
and do have larger effects

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:40.020 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.238 align:middle line:84%
But on average, there's
small statistical effects,

00:38:42.238 --> 00:38:43.780 align:middle line:84%
so it's not obvious
in everyday life.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:45.370 align:middle line:90%
So that's one piece of it.

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:48.900 align:middle line:84%
Another piece of it is that
people who are talented

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.250 align:middle line:90%
are often scared.

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.890 align:middle line:10%
So I get emails from
people who say, well,

00:38:52.890 --> 00:38:54.843 align:middle line:10%
ever since I had my
accident, now I know

00:38:54.843 --> 00:38:56.010 align:middle line:10%
what someone's about to say.

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.870 align:middle line:10%
Or I watched a movie,
but then I know

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.328 align:middle line:10%
exactly what the next frame is
going to reveal or whatever.

00:39:00.328 --> 00:39:01.380 align:middle line:10%
That's their experience.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:02.820 align:middle line:84%
I haven't tested
them, so I don't know

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:04.028 align:middle line:90%
if that's actually happening.

00:39:04.028 --> 00:39:05.980 align:middle line:90%
But that's their experience.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:09.270 align:middle line:84%
And they're scared to tell
anyone because it's taboo.

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So it creates this cycle where
the people who are talented

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.430 align:middle line:84%
aren't going to
develop it any further

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:16.530 align:middle line:84%
or are going to be scared
of it and push it away

00:39:16.530 --> 00:39:20.130 align:middle line:84%
because of this cycle of
taboo, or oh, people will

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:21.730 align:middle line:90%
think I'm crazy or whatever.

00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:25.080 align:middle line:84%
And so I feel like that
is the first thing that

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:26.140 align:middle line:90%
needs to be changed.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So to me, I'm all
about let's change

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:31.350 align:middle line:84%
the culture that looks at it
as some kind of a problem.

00:39:31.350 --> 00:39:32.640 align:middle line:90%
Instead, get out there.

00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.650 align:middle line:84%
Look, this is
scientifically validated.

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.038 align:middle line:90%
It's a small effect on average.

00:39:36.038 --> 00:39:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Some people are talented,
but almost anyone

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.280 align:middle line:90%
can improve their abilities.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.170 align:middle line:84%
So I created a website and an
app to do that people can use.

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.080 align:middle line:10%
So the website is
thepremonitioncode.com,

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.230 align:middle line:10%
and the app is called Psi3,
which I worked with the folks

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:51.268 align:middle line:10%
at the Institute of
Noetic Sciences to build.

00:39:51.268 --> 00:39:53.310 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, my website,
The Premonition Code,

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.790 align:middle line:84%
I worked with the folks at
Windbridge Institute to build.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:00.818 align:middle line:84%
And I just think
it's really important

00:40:00.818 --> 00:40:03.360 align:middle line:84%
to get the scale of this, to
get people from around the world

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:05.640 align:middle line:84%
understanding that this is
a normal human birthright.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.760 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, it's not only
just cool to get information

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.170 align:middle line:90%
about the future.

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:12.820 align:middle line:10%
It's two other things that
are important about it.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:15.468 align:middle line:90%
One is it's like a practice.

00:40:15.468 --> 00:40:17.760 align:middle line:84%
You could sit down when you
do controlled precognition,

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.600 align:middle line:90%
and it feels good.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.040 align:middle line:10%
It feels good because you're
getting in touch with your mind,

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.970 align:middle line:10%
and you're literally
being a receptor.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:28.230 align:middle line:10%
So you're ignoring your
opinions about what's going on,

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:30.540 align:middle line:10%
and you're just
receiving information.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.530 align:middle line:90%
So that feels good.

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.680 align:middle line:84%
But the other piece
of it is to the extent

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.910 align:middle line:84%
that we can develop
this as humanity

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:84%
and get more
operational about it,

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:43.410 align:middle line:84%
we can actually shift our
understanding of the future

00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:45.790 align:middle line:84%
and navigate the future
more effectively.

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So for instance, I'm working
with climate scientists

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:53.640 align:middle line:84%
now on looking at precognition,
how it can support understanding

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:56.250 align:middle line:84%
climate change and what we
could potentially do about it.

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.707 align:middle line:84%
So these kind of applications, I
think, will get us to the point

00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:02.040 align:middle line:84%
where people are starting to
realize the reality of this

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.460 align:middle line:84%
and the usefulness of this when
you use skilled practitioners.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:07.470 align:middle line:84%
And people are well
trained, and you're

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:08.790 align:middle line:90%
using it for a good cause.

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:11.580 align:middle line:10%
And so I think that's what
it's actually going to take.

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:15.720 align:middle line:10%
No amount of scientific papers,
no amount of the people involved

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.240 align:middle line:10%
in Stargate-- that was a largely
precognitive remote viewing

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:18.780 align:middle line:10%
program--

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:20.280 align:middle line:10%
going around the
country and talking

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.010 align:middle line:10%
about look at the success
and the success and the--

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.810 align:middle line:10%
no amount of that is going
to change people's minds.

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:26.910 align:middle line:10%
You have to make money.

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:29.170 align:middle line:10%
You have to help people
with their lives,

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:32.100 align:middle line:10%
and you have to help save the
world or something to get people

00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.430 align:middle line:10%
to realize that this is useful.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:34.230 align:middle line:10%
And that's fine.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.500 align:middle line:10%
Great.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:35.620 align:middle line:10%
Let's do those things.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:36.995 align:middle line:10%
So that's where
I'm at with that.

00:41:36.995 --> 00:41:39.450 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, the message is
huge, and it's a huge piece

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:40.920 align:middle line:10%
of the film as well.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:42.030 align:middle line:10%
>> Cool.

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:43.110 align:middle line:10%
>> I know.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:50.100 align:middle line:84%
And so taboo, where is
this taboo stemming from?

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.160 align:middle line:90%
>> I like your shoulder move.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:53.560 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.040 align:middle line:90%


00:41:56.040 --> 00:42:01.117 align:middle line:90%
>> And what's in it for them?

00:42:01.117 --> 00:42:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Or for us because we
participated in it, right?

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:07.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, all of the above.

00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:10.370 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, where is the taboo
from about intuition?

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:11.395 align:middle line:90%
>> Where did it start?

00:42:11.395 --> 00:42:12.270 align:middle line:90%
>> When did it start?

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:13.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Why did it start?

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:15.100 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.810 align:middle line:90%


00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.330 align:middle line:84%
>> We talk about
academia science.

00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:22.567 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it matter-- again,
I'm so not past focused.

00:42:22.567 --> 00:42:23.900 align:middle line:90%
Does it matter where it started?

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.070 align:middle line:90%
Can't we just make--

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:27.523 align:middle line:84%
>> It does for viewers to
understand the history.

00:42:27.523 --> 00:42:29.940 align:middle line:84%
When we understand the history
of things, all of a sudden,

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.930 align:middle line:84%
it becomes like, oh,
well, if I knew that,

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:36.607 align:middle line:84%
then I probably wouldn't
be feeling this way.

00:42:36.607 --> 00:42:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Now I'm going to
feel a different way.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:40.580 align:middle line:84%
So I think, yeah, history
is important for people.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:48.140 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah, OK, so I think the
taboo against intuition,

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.528 align:middle line:10%
I think it might have started--

00:42:49.528 --> 00:42:50.570 align:middle line:10%
I mean, it's interesting.

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:53.000 align:middle line:10%
I think it might have
started with the church,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.730 align:middle line:10%
with religion, which says like,
you don't get to have insights

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:57.800 align:middle line:10%
about God or the universe.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.940 align:middle line:10%
A priest or someone else is
going to have those for you.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.580 align:middle line:10%
I think that's a piece of it.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.520 align:middle line:10%
But that's not totally accurate,
because there were always

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.500 align:middle line:10%
mystics or priests
or nuns who would go

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:13.500 align:middle line:10%
have their own insights.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.450 align:middle line:10%
And the church wasn't really
against that either and would

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:16.990 align:middle line:10%
end up making them
saints and stuff.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:22.440 align:middle line:10%
So I feel like that's a black
and white sort of designation.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.240 align:middle line:90%
That's not totally accurate.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:30.540 align:middle line:84%
But I do think there's a
misunderstanding of femininity

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.800 align:middle line:84%
here that has to do
with what's going on.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.910 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's
a belief that--

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:40.490 align:middle line:90%


00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:42.710 align:middle line:84%
I think there has been
a belief for a long time

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:44.930 align:middle line:84%
that the feminine, which
has largely been expressed

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:48.770 align:middle line:84%
through women, is
dangerous because it's

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:52.610 align:middle line:84%
hidden and mysterious,
and it creates life.

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:58.640 align:middle line:84%
Human women's female
bodies create babies,

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.390 align:middle line:90%
which is pretty powerful.

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:02.150 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there's
something about it

00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:03.942 align:middle line:84%
that there's something
mysterious going on.

00:44:03.942 --> 00:44:05.187 align:middle line:90%
That's witchy.

00:44:05.187 --> 00:44:06.020 align:middle line:90%
You can create life.

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:09.170 align:middle line:90%
That's pretty witchy.

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:12.290 align:middle line:84%
That feels like
a lot of control.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:15.900 align:middle line:84%
And so I think there's
something about that.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:16.820 align:middle line:90%
In fact, Ruth--

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I think her name is Ruth
Rosenbaum, Rosenblum maybe--

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:22.340 align:middle line:84%
who's a psychoanalyst
in New York,

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.890 align:middle line:84%
who wrote this great
paper about this

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:27.320 align:middle line:84%
called the psi as
the dark continent,

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:29.480 align:middle line:90%
psi being psychic abilities.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.540 align:middle line:10%
And so I think it's
a Freudian idea

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:36.830 align:middle line:10%
that women are called the dark
continent because, first of all,

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:37.940 align:middle line:10%
our genitals are hidden.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:42.360 align:middle line:10%
But second of all, it's
very powerful and unknown.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.180 align:middle line:10%
And men have that in them,
too, that femininity,

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.190 align:middle line:10%
that powerful and unknown piece.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:48.970 align:middle line:10%
I mean, we associate
it with women.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:50.460 align:middle line:84%
That's why it's
called femininity,

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.200 align:middle line:90%
but it's within everyone.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.960 align:middle line:10%
And there's this idea of
it being scary and unknown.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think we're coming into
a time when that's coming out,

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:00.900 align:middle line:84%
when people are starting
to say, wait a minute,

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.300 align:middle line:84%
what's that thing that's
hidden and that's taboo?

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:04.410 align:middle line:90%
What's that thing?

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And everyone, men and
women, dogs and cats,

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:11.880 align:middle line:84%
I think we're starting
to reveal that

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.800 align:middle line:84%
to ourselves because there's
this powerful thing there

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.210 align:middle line:90%
that is--

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:19.200 align:middle line:84%
if we're going to
leave it taboo,

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:20.340 align:middle line:90%
we're not going to survive.

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:23.180 align:middle line:84%
So it has to come
out, and I think

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.080 align:middle line:90%
that's related to this process.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:29.480 align:middle line:10%
So I think it's a powerful,
indwelling, mysterious sort

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:33.710 align:middle line:10%
of peace that is traditionally
related to the feminine,

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:36.050 align:middle line:10%
and that is in everyone.

00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:39.840 align:middle line:10%
And the taboo is the
fear of the power of it.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:44.140 align:middle line:84%
So it's related to that power of
creating life, the power of it.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.280 align:middle line:90%
It is powerful.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.530 align:middle line:90%
So I talk about powerlessness.

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:48.970 align:middle line:90%
I don't feel powerless at all.

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.010 align:middle line:10%
I feel very powerful.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:52.810 align:middle line:10%
And that's partly
because I'm in touch

00:45:52.810 --> 00:45:56.230 align:middle line:10%
with that peace that's
very powerful that is not

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:57.910 align:middle line:10%
mine to own or wield.

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:01.460 align:middle line:10%
And that's why it's so powerful.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:06.737 align:middle line:10%
So it's that peace connected
to unconditional love.

00:46:06.737 --> 00:46:09.320 align:middle line:10%
It's that peace connected to the
ultimate-- unconditional love

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.880 align:middle line:10%
is the ultimate weapon in a way.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.530 align:middle line:10%
It's so powerful because
nothing can defeat it,

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.072 align:middle line:10%
because it has no conditions.

00:46:16.072 --> 00:46:19.180 align:middle line:90%


00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.730 align:middle line:90%
So I forget the question.

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.410 align:middle line:90%
But did I answer it?

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:24.310 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:25.910 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, in a very different--

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:28.160 align:middle line:84%
I didn't think you were going
to go in that direction.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.600 align:middle line:84%
I think what inspired me was
I remember in class again,

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:35.530 align:middle line:84%
you were talking
about academia science

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:39.880 align:middle line:84%
and feeling like there were some
concerns that you had when you

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.330 align:middle line:84%
would visit the institutions
again to talk about precognition

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:46.150 align:middle line:84%
and how it didn't feel good,
and it didn't feel comfortable.

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:47.083 align:middle line:90%
And--

00:46:47.083 --> 00:46:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you want me to
talk about that a little?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah, if you would.

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:56.350 align:middle line:84%
And I remember it was so
profound when you said women

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:58.650 align:middle line:90%
and intuition and science.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.390 align:middle line:84%
And the reason that there's
so few women in science

00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:05.290 align:middle line:84%
is because it's
so closed minded.

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't seem
like the very thing

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.070 align:middle line:90%
that should be leading science.

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:12.040 align:middle line:90%
Intuition is not allowed.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.093 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:47:13.093 --> 00:47:14.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Talk about that a little.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:15.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, OK, so my experience--
so let me talk a little about

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:22.730 align:middle line:84%
my academic experience
talking with other academics,

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:25.120 align:middle line:84%
especially scientists,
about precognition,

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.950 align:middle line:90%
which is totally controversial.

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:28.360 align:middle line:90%
I say it's scientifically valid.

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.310 align:middle line:10%
What I mean is
it's been validated

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.533 align:middle line:10%
by scientists who study this.

00:47:31.533 --> 00:47:33.700 align:middle line:10%
But there's plenty of
scientists who don't know that

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:37.030 align:middle line:10%
and who also would be very
skeptical that it was validated,

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:40.480 align:middle line:10%
and I have met many of them.

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.530 align:middle line:10%
And that's great.

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.270 align:middle line:10%
They should be skeptical
because if they haven't

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:44.890 align:middle line:10%
read the literature,
if they haven't asked

00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:46.570 align:middle line:10%
the proper questions
about the methodologies,

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:48.570 align:middle line:10%
they're going to think
it's poorly done because,

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:51.610 align:middle line:10%
intuitively, you just don't feel
like you can sense the future.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:53.152 align:middle line:10%
Right now, I'm
sitting in this chair.

00:47:53.152 --> 00:47:55.443 align:middle line:10%
I feel like I'm sitting in
this chair talking with you.

00:47:55.443 --> 00:47:57.700 align:middle line:10%
I don't have the experience
of the next five years

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.290 align:middle line:10%
unfolding before me.

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.022 align:middle line:84%
It's just not my
experience right now.

00:48:01.022 --> 00:48:02.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's not most
people's experience either.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.470 align:middle line:84%
So of course, they
should be skeptical,

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:06.970 align:middle line:84%
until they look at
the data and then

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:08.678 align:middle line:84%
talk to scientists
about the methodology.

00:48:08.678 --> 00:48:11.650 align:middle line:84%
And then they should have
perhaps some second thoughts.

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:14.290 align:middle line:84%
But my experience going
into the academic world

00:48:14.290 --> 00:48:15.880 align:middle line:84%
and giving talks
about this stuff

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:20.720 align:middle line:84%
to basically people who are
largely interested but skeptical

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.040 align:middle line:90%
is that--

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.400 align:middle line:90%
so first of all, it's a paradox.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.048 align:middle line:84%
So first of all,
they'll ask questions.

00:48:27.048 --> 00:48:28.340 align:middle line:90%
Well, have you thought of this?

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:29.630 align:middle line:84%
And often, the "have
you thought of this"

00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:31.190 align:middle line:84%
will be like the most basic
thing that, of course,

00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.850 align:middle line:90%
you thought of.

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:33.767 align:middle line:84%
But they're just learning
to think about this.

00:48:33.767 --> 00:48:36.680 align:middle line:90%
So they should ask.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:42.270 align:middle line:10%
But after the talk, they'll come
up to you and one by one say,

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:44.550 align:middle line:10%
can I talk to you afterwards?

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:47.330 align:middle line:10%
Can we just talk privately?

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:49.070 align:middle line:10%
I just want to tell
you my experience

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:51.660 align:middle line:10%
I had about this dream
that was so real,

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.100 align:middle line:10%
and then it happened
the next day.

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.977 align:middle line:10%
And then the next
person will send you--

00:48:54.977 --> 00:48:56.060 align:middle line:10%
can I just have your card?

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.310 align:middle line:10%
And then you get an email.

00:48:57.310 --> 00:48:59.310 align:middle line:10%
I didn't want to say it
in front of anyone else.

00:48:59.310 --> 00:49:00.893 align:middle line:10%
But I had this
experience of the night

00:49:00.893 --> 00:49:02.710 align:middle line:10%
before my aunt died,
and she wasn't sick

00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:05.210 align:middle line:10%
and da, da, da and then the
next person and the next person.

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:07.700 align:middle line:10%
And at some point,
I started saying--

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.830 align:middle line:10%
when I would talk to
academics, I'm like, look,

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:11.210 align:middle line:10%
this is my experience.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:14.720 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like you to
know is talk to each other.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:17.300 align:middle line:10%
You're all having
this experience.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:18.480 align:middle line:10%
Talk to each other.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.490 align:middle line:10%
It's OK.

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:22.130 align:middle line:10%
You're not going to shame
each other, because you've all

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:23.870 align:middle line:10%
had this experience.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:26.960 align:middle line:10%
And what I notice
is that academia--

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.670 align:middle line:10%
I love the life of the mind.

00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:30.065 align:middle line:10%
I love academics.

00:49:30.065 --> 00:49:32.390 align:middle line:10%
I've always loved academics.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:35.480 align:middle line:10%
And myself, I'm clearly an
academic, the way I think

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.760 align:middle line:10%
and talk and yada, yada, right?

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.720 align:middle line:84%
But what I notice is
there's a fear often that

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.755 align:middle line:90%
can constrain you in academia.

00:49:44.755 --> 00:49:46.130 align:middle line:84%
If you don't have
tenure, there's

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:47.480 align:middle line:90%
a fear of not getting tenure.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.688 align:middle line:84%
But even if you have tenure,
there's the bigger fear.

00:49:49.688 --> 00:49:52.460 align:middle line:84%
The underlying fear is the
fear of being shamed for not

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.563 align:middle line:90%
being right, for being a fool.

00:49:54.563 --> 00:49:55.730 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be a fool.

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:56.870 align:middle line:84%
The whole point of
academia is we're

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:58.730 align:middle line:84%
going to figure out
what's really going on,

00:49:58.730 --> 00:50:00.272 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to
be right about it.

00:50:00.272 --> 00:50:01.650 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't
understand this,

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.110 align:middle line:84%
you don't really understand
what's really going on.

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:04.027 align:middle line:90%
You're kind of a fool.

00:50:04.027 --> 00:50:06.027 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to be on
the outside of the cult,

00:50:06.027 --> 00:50:07.820 align:middle line:84%
because you're a fool,
and you don't really

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:08.945 align:middle line:90%
understand what's going on.

00:50:08.945 --> 00:50:10.655 align:middle line:90%
So it's kind of culty.

00:50:10.655 --> 00:50:13.640 align:middle line:90%


00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.470 align:middle line:84%
But the thing is
that organizations

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:18.230 align:middle line:84%
where shame is the only thing
that keeps you in or out,

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:19.550 align:middle line:90%
that can be very powerful.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:21.740 align:middle line:84%
But also, once you
recognize that that's

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:25.800 align:middle line:84%
the force that's manipulating
thought in a certain direction,

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.700 align:middle line:84%
it's very freeing because you're
like, oh, all I have to do

00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.440 align:middle line:84%
is not be afraid
of being ashamed.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.750 align:middle line:84%
All I have to do is
not be afraid of being

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.180 align:middle line:90%
wrong and then voila.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.490 align:middle line:84%
And I'm saying this as if
I had any control over it.

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:39.198 align:middle line:84%
Actually, what happened
to me is one day,

00:50:39.198 --> 00:50:41.000 align:middle line:90%
I was just like, screw it.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.070 align:middle line:84%
I want to ask whatever
question I want to ask.

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:44.390 align:middle line:90%
I have good methods.

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:47.430 align:middle line:84%
I have been well trained at
tier-one research institutions.

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:49.130 align:middle line:90%
I know how to do science.

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:52.680 align:middle line:84%
I know how to think about
stuff, and here I go.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.960 align:middle line:90%
So that's what happened to me.

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:55.760 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.720 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't happen to everyone.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.845 align:middle line:90%
That's what happened to me.

00:50:57.845 --> 00:51:01.260 align:middle line:90%
So I could be totally wrong.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.597 align:middle line:84%
I could be fooling myself
about precognition.

00:51:03.597 --> 00:51:05.180 align:middle line:84%
I could be somehow
looking at the data

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.650 align:middle line:90%
and not thinking about--

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:09.150 align:middle line:84%
there could always be
some kind of artifact

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:11.150 align:middle line:84%
that I'm not thinking
about that explains it all

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:12.650 align:middle line:84%
and has nothing to do
about getting information

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:13.380 align:middle line:90%
from the future.

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.720 align:middle line:84%
Same with my
physics experiments.

00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Those photons really aren't
giving me information.

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:18.573 align:middle line:84%
I'm not thinking about it
the right way, whatever.

00:51:18.573 --> 00:51:22.300 align:middle line:84%
That could always be the
case with any experiment.

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.300 align:middle line:10%
So I have to just move forward
and do the experiments I'm

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.340 align:middle line:10%
compelled to do, analyze
them the best I can,

00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:29.673 align:middle line:10%
try to publish them when I
feel like they're ready to be

00:51:29.673 --> 00:51:30.920 align:middle line:10%
published, and move on.

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:33.400 align:middle line:10%
That's the deal.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:37.090 align:middle line:10%
But the shame piece, it's
such a beautiful thing

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:40.940 align:middle line:10%
to recognize it because
then you ask yourself,

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.235 align:middle line:10%
is this a good argument?

00:51:42.235 --> 00:51:45.340 align:middle line:10%
When I would give a talk
about precognition and someone

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.030 align:middle line:10%
would say, well,
you're now assuming

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:51.790 align:middle line:10%
that mental things are somehow
different than physical things

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:54.400 align:middle line:10%
and mental things have
to behave differently

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.530 align:middle line:10%
than the rules we expect
for physical things

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:59.760 align:middle line:10%
where causality is a certain
way, that's a common discussion.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.510 align:middle line:10%
And I'd say, yeah, so
what's your evidence

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:03.885 align:middle line:10%
that mental things aren't
different from physical things?

00:52:03.885 --> 00:52:06.040 align:middle line:10%
They sure seem
different in every way.

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:09.970 align:middle line:10%
Having a thought sure seems like
something that isn't physical.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:12.580 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't have any physical
properties, like location.

00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:15.940 align:middle line:10%
The thought of the color green
has no location, has no mass.

00:52:15.940 --> 00:52:20.650 align:middle line:10%
It has no frequency, no
spin, no phase, no charge.

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:23.920 align:middle line:10%
How is it in any way like
anything else that's physical?

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.250 align:middle line:10%
And they'll say,
well, but then that's

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:31.132 align:middle line:10%
dualism, which is
just a bludgeon.

00:52:31.132 --> 00:52:32.590 align:middle line:10%
And I say, of
course, it's dualism.

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:34.760 align:middle line:10%
I'm saying mental, physical
things are two different things.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:35.560 align:middle line:90%
That's two.

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:36.448 align:middle line:90%
That's dualism.

00:52:36.448 --> 00:52:37.490 align:middle line:90%
And then there's nothing.

00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:38.510 align:middle line:90%
There's no argument.

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:40.970 align:middle line:10%
So the argument is
just you can't possibly

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:46.970 align:middle line:10%
be a dualist, because that's not
allowed in the world of science,

00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:49.370 align:middle line:10%
you see, because mental
things don't really exist,

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:50.990 align:middle line:10%
but physical things do.

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:56.090 align:middle line:84%
And the history of that has
a lot to do with behaviorism.

00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:57.590 align:middle line:84%
At least in psychology,
it has a lot

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:59.007 align:middle line:84%
to do with behaviorism
coming out,

00:52:59.007 --> 00:53:00.420 align:middle line:90%
what behaviorism was all about.

00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:01.490 align:middle line:84%
We're going to figure
out what's going on

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:03.590 align:middle line:84%
in people's minds, which
don't really exist,

00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:05.780 align:middle line:84%
by looking at the input
and output relationships

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.400 align:middle line:90%
because that's what we can see.

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.108 align:middle line:84%
In other words, we're
going to figure out

00:53:09.108 --> 00:53:11.690 align:middle line:84%
what's in the black box, the
dark continent, the hidden

00:53:11.690 --> 00:53:12.620 align:middle line:90%
genitals.

00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:15.080 align:middle line:84%
We're going to figure that
out by doing the in and out.

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.840 align:middle line:90%


00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:20.330 align:middle line:84%
I'm trying to be
very polite here.

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:24.740 align:middle line:84%
If we screw with nature, we can
figure out what's inside there.

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.560 align:middle line:84%
That's really the algorithm
that we're talking about.

00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:30.200 align:middle line:10%
And what if we
actually went inside?

00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:33.050 align:middle line:10%
The thing about mental things
rather than physical things

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:36.410 align:middle line:10%
is you can actually go inside
experiences because you're

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:39.260 align:middle line:10%
having an experience, and
you can discover things.

00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:40.190 align:middle line:90%
That's different.

00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:43.640 align:middle line:84%
That's a different tool, but
it's still a scientific tool.

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:46.170 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:49.500 align:middle line:10%
If I were going to make
an experiment related

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:53.220 align:middle line:10%
to controlled precognition, I
would take people who are gifted

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.650 align:middle line:10%
and trained in
controlled precognition.

00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:57.450 align:middle line:10%
So precognitive remote viewing.

00:53:57.450 --> 00:53:58.590 align:middle line:10%
That's all that is.

00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:01.860 align:middle line:10%
And I would have them
do their sessions,

00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:04.470 align:middle line:10%
and I'll show you an example
of a session in a few minutes.

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:07.590 align:middle line:10%
And I would have them
record their sessions,

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:09.910 align:middle line:10%
either on paper
or video or both.

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:12.918 align:middle line:10%
And then I would have
them say goodbye,

00:54:12.918 --> 00:54:14.460 align:middle line:10%
and then I would
have a random number

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:17.370 align:middle line:10%
generator choose a target.

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:20.490 align:middle line:10%
And that target could
be a video or a picture

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:22.240 align:middle line:10%
or a quote from a book.

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.040 align:middle line:10%
It doesn't matter.

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:26.610 align:middle line:10%
This is like how The
Premonition Code website works.

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:29.220 align:middle line:10%
And then I would get
a bunch of people

00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:31.630 align:middle line:10%
to do that and then
get a bunch of data.

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:34.210 align:middle line:10%
So now I have all their sessions
recorded and everything.

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:36.750 align:middle line:10%
And then I would find
a group of judges.

00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:39.240 align:middle line:10%
So these are
independent judges who

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:41.910 align:middle line:10%
don't know what the
targets were and who

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:43.883 align:middle line:10%
don't know who the people
were and don't have

00:54:43.883 --> 00:54:45.300 align:middle line:10%
any contact with
them, so usually,

00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:48.730 align:middle line:10%
hopefully, around the
world or somewhere else.

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:53.090 align:middle line:10%
And I don't give them access,
obviously, to that information.

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:55.808 align:middle line:84%
But what I do give them
is a stack of data.

00:54:55.808 --> 00:54:57.850 align:middle line:84%
So here are all the
sessions, or these could also

00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:00.050 align:middle line:84%
be video recordings
stacked up digitally.

00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:04.580 align:middle line:84%
And I ask them, for
each one, watch it.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Read it.

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:06.180 align:middle line:90%
Look at it.

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.070 align:middle line:90%
Get a sense of it.

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:11.050 align:middle line:84%
And then of these four
different targets,

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:13.570 align:middle line:84%
which do you think this
session is most like?

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:16.930 align:middle line:84%
And their job is to just
rank them in order of 1 to 4.

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:17.860 align:middle line:90%
1 is most liked.

00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:19.120 align:middle line:90%
4 is least liked.

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.805 align:middle line:84%
And so then you get a
bunch of judges doing this

00:55:21.805 --> 00:55:22.930 align:middle line:90%
for each of these sessions.

00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And then you see, how many of
the sessions were ranked number

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:31.420 align:middle line:84%
one or number two towards
the top of the actual target,

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:32.840 align:middle line:90%
and how many weren't?

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.360 align:middle line:84%
And that's how you
can objectively

00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:38.500 align:middle line:84%
determine if you've actually
got something in terms

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.112 align:middle line:90%
of your group of precogs.

00:55:40.112 --> 00:55:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And actually, that's
how it's done.

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:42.700 align:middle line:90%
This is not my methodology.

00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:44.440 align:middle line:84%
This is the
methodology that I've

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:48.490 align:middle line:84%
inherited through the last
30 years of doing this.

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:51.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's clear that
gifted and trained people

00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:54.620 align:middle line:90%
can do this, so not a problem.

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:56.620 align:middle line:84%
But let me show you
an example of the kind

00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.830 align:middle line:84%
of controlled precognition that
I do and the kind that I teach.

00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:03.700 align:middle line:84%
I love teaching it, partially
because I love doing it,

00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:05.470 align:middle line:84%
and it forces me
to do it some more.

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:10.210 align:middle line:84%
But the caveat is when I'm ever
doing this as a performance,

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:12.580 align:middle line:84%
I just have to say like,
I could be totally wrong.

00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:14.013 align:middle line:90%
This thing is not 100%.

00:56:14.013 --> 00:56:15.430 align:middle line:84%
And you should
never trust someone

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:18.460 align:middle line:84%
who says they are working
at 100%, because I

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:21.490 align:middle line:84%
think what we're looking at is
probabilities, not actualities.

00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:25.120 align:middle line:84%
And I think that makes it much
more difficult to be at 100%

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.040 align:middle line:84%
because if the
probability is somewhere

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:30.850 align:middle line:84%
but the actuality is different,
you'll end up splitting off.

00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:34.790 align:middle line:10%
So I'll just do the
non-writing-down method.

00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:37.940 align:middle line:10%
So this is more of a method
where you use your body.

00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:40.270 align:middle line:10%
This is part of controlled
precognition the way

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:41.200 align:middle line:10%
I like to teach it.

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.700 align:middle line:10%
I like to teach it
with my colleague

00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:47.340 align:middle line:10%
John Vivanco, who learned it
in the military tradition,

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.380 align:middle line:10%
coordinate remote viewing.

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:51.810 align:middle line:10%
And he learned it
from the lineage

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:54.280 align:middle line:10%
all the way up to Ingo Swann,
who basically invented it.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:57.210 align:middle line:10%
And so this is I'm way down the
line in terms of skill and way

00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:58.703 align:middle line:10%
down the line in
terms of lineage,

00:56:58.703 --> 00:57:00.120 align:middle line:10%
if you want to
talk about lineage.

00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.370 align:middle line:84%
So those are all the
caveats about how

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:04.770 align:middle line:84%
you're seeing someone who
is a scientist who decided

00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to train herself
in this as opposed

00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:11.520 align:middle line:84%
to someone who woke up one
day and was totally gifted.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.980 align:middle line:84%
So it can be done,
but I could suck.

00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:14.910 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is what I do is
I'm going to close my eyes

00:57:17.550 --> 00:57:21.570 align:middle line:90%
and uncross my arms and my legs.

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:24.240 align:middle line:84%
Normally, I would stand
because then I can be moving.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:26.970 align:middle line:84%
But right now, I have this
constraint of this recording

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:28.600 align:middle line:84%
studio, so I'm not
going to do that.

00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:32.160 align:middle line:84%
So instead, I'm going to sit and
try to sit up straight at least

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.780 align:middle line:90%
to get my spine going.

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:36.002 align:middle line:84%
And I'd like to start
with acknowledging.

00:57:36.002 --> 00:57:38.460 align:middle line:84%
I'll just do everything that
I would normally do in my head

00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:38.970 align:middle line:90%
or write down.

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:40.660 align:middle line:84%
I'll do it out loud
so you can hear it.

00:57:40.660 --> 00:57:42.450 align:middle line:10%
So I like to start
with acknowledging

00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:44.340 align:middle line:10%
my emotional state.

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.860 align:middle line:84%
So I'm excited to do
this in front of you.

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:48.600 align:middle line:90%
I hope I do well.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:54.990 align:middle line:10%
I hope if I do well,
it's not intimidating.

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:57.060 align:middle line:10%
Yeah, so I can just let that go.

00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:59.010 align:middle line:10%
Physical state is good.

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:02.760 align:middle line:10%
I feel I had some
water, so I feel good.

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:04.170 align:middle line:10%
I had some food, so I feel good.

00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:06.210 align:middle line:10%
So I can let that go.

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:08.250 align:middle line:10%
And my intention-- I
like to do my intention--

00:58:08.250 --> 00:58:11.850 align:middle line:10%
is to focus on reversing
the polarity of receiving

00:58:11.850 --> 00:58:14.820 align:middle line:10%
information rather than
the usual grabby, grabby.

00:58:14.820 --> 00:58:18.450 align:middle line:10%
So my intention is to
receive information that's

00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:23.190 align:middle line:10%
directly related to the target
and enjoy myself and love myself

00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:24.280 align:middle line:10%
as I do it.

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.650 align:middle line:10%
So that's my intention.

00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:27.600 align:middle line:10%
And now I'm just
having the intention

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:30.180 align:middle line:10%
of connecting to whatever
the target ends up being.

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.320 align:middle line:10%
No one on the planet knows
what that is right now.

00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:36.480 align:middle line:10%
So it's very relieving
because I could be wrong,

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.835 align:middle line:10%
but everyone else is wrong
with me, so that's nice.

00:58:39.835 --> 00:58:40.635 align:middle line:10%
Taking a breath.

00:58:40.635 --> 00:58:44.920 align:middle line:90%


00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.555 align:middle line:10%
And I'm realizing
the need for a tag

00:58:46.555 --> 00:58:47.930 align:middle line:10%
because I'm used
to having a tag.

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:50.890 align:middle line:10%
So I'm going to give myself an
eight-digit number to associate

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:51.740 align:middle line:10%
with this target.

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:56.690 align:middle line:10%
So if you think of spacetime,
fabric of spacetime like fabric,

00:58:56.690 --> 00:58:59.890 align:middle line:10%
I think of it like
actual material.

00:58:59.890 --> 00:59:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Here's a flag, and
this flag is right now.

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.090 align:middle line:90%
Put that in right now.

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to put
another flag here.

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:06.620 align:middle line:90%
This is the target.

00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:07.910 align:middle line:90%
This is in the future.

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:11.680 align:middle line:84%
And on the flag, it's going to
have written 29841038, which

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.940 align:middle line:90%
is the number I just made up.

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.590 align:middle line:10%
And that's going to be my tag.

00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:17.380 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to focus here in the now,

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:19.420 align:middle line:84%
and I'm going to receive
this coming towards me.

00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:20.830 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to try
to go out and get it.

00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:22.570 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to have
this flag come here.

00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:25.480 align:middle line:90%


00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.370 align:middle line:90%
And I sense a whiteness.

00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:29.830 align:middle line:10%
So now I'm just going to
tell you what I sense.

00:59:29.830 --> 00:59:31.285 align:middle line:84%
I want to put my
hands like this.

00:59:31.285 --> 00:59:36.320 align:middle line:90%


00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:38.707 align:middle line:90%
I want to say puffball.

00:59:38.707 --> 00:59:40.040 align:middle line:10%
And again, there's a part of me.

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.623 align:middle line:10%
I can feel my ego saying, oh,
god, what if this is just wrong?

00:59:42.623 --> 00:59:44.007 align:middle line:90%
What the hell is a puffball?

00:59:44.007 --> 00:59:44.840 align:middle line:90%
And it's like, yeah.

00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.838 align:middle line:84%
And then my other
part that you can

00:59:46.838 --> 00:59:49.130 align:middle line:84%
call superconscious or higher
self says, you know what?

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:51.860 align:middle line:84%
You get what you get, and
I'm getting puffballs.

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:54.260 align:middle line:10%
I'm getting little
white puffballs.

00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:58.580 align:middle line:90%
And I'm almost like--

00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:04.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying it's the same as
but when you blow a dandelion.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.745 align:middle line:84%
There's little
dandelion seedlings.

01:00:08.745 --> 01:00:10.830 align:middle line:90%
I feel an outdoors.

01:00:10.830 --> 01:00:16.920 align:middle line:84%
It's an outdoor space
and almost cafe seating.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.830 align:middle line:10%
Again, I'm very skeptical
of this as I'm doing it.

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:21.130 align:middle line:10%
Who knows what the target is?

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:21.990 align:middle line:10%
So I can shut up.

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:25.170 align:middle line:90%


01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:27.270 align:middle line:10%
I want these metal things.

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:29.703 align:middle line:10%
There's metal tubular
things like chairs that

01:00:29.703 --> 01:00:30.870 align:middle line:10%
are made out of metal maybe.

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:33.330 align:middle line:10%
I don't know if they're chairs.

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.970 align:middle line:10%
I want them.

01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:37.320 align:middle line:10%
They're making sounds.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:40.830 align:middle line:10%
I want them out of the way
kind of to the side a little

01:00:40.830 --> 01:00:43.110 align:middle line:10%
because I want to
go down a path.

01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:45.428 align:middle line:10%
So I'm pushing them aside.

01:00:45.428 --> 01:00:46.470 align:middle line:10%
I'm going down this path.

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:52.380 align:middle line:10%
It's almost like a brick
path, and I like it.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.445 align:middle line:10%
It feels European.

01:00:53.445 --> 01:00:56.250 align:middle line:90%


01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:57.710 align:middle line:90%
It's a nice scene.

01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:58.860 align:middle line:90%
It's like a street.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:02.858 align:middle line:84%
It feels like a street
European scenes with puffballs.

01:01:02.858 --> 01:01:04.650 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what the
puff balls are about.

01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:07.440 align:middle line:84%
But maybe that's an emotional
thing, or maybe that's--

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:08.275 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

01:01:08.275 --> 01:01:09.900 align:middle line:84%
A lot of the time,
when I'm doing this,

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.970 align:middle line:90%
it's the raw feeling.

01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Really, it's the raw
data that I'm looking at,

01:01:14.740 --> 01:01:15.990 align:middle line:90%
trying to get the raw feeling.

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:18.963 align:middle line:84%
So the raw feelings
are puffballs.

01:01:18.963 --> 01:01:20.130 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean by puffballs?

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:23.310 align:middle line:84%
Let's get to even rawer thing
and not label it as a puffball.

01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:27.870 align:middle line:84%
What I mean is a
light-colored burst of energy

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:30.060 align:middle line:90%
here, here, here, here, here.

01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:34.890 align:middle line:84%
And what do I mean
by the cafe seating?

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:40.650 align:middle line:10%
I mean metallic, tubular,
something human made--

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:44.550 align:middle line:10%
something human made that
has been sculpted for use

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:48.180 align:middle line:10%
and can make a clanging sound.

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.460 align:middle line:84%
And that's the really
more basic level,

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.575 align:middle line:84%
so without deciding
it's a street

01:01:52.575 --> 01:01:54.450 align:middle line:84%
scene, without deciding
all that stuff, which

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:55.920 align:middle line:90%
is usually wrong anyway.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.420 align:middle line:84%
What's the more
basic information?

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.100 align:middle line:84%
That was the more
basic information.

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And then I sort of
intentionally-- not sort of,

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.740 align:middle line:84%
but I intentionally just
get out of there mentally.

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.860 align:middle line:90%
It's all a mental thing.

01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:07.120 align:middle line:90%
It's all mental time travel.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:12.600 align:middle line:84%
So just get out of there,
unmerge and morph, unblend.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.250 align:middle line:90%
You can use any of those words.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:15.310 align:middle line:90%
You get out of there.

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:17.980 align:middle line:84%
And now we're here,
and that was it.

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:19.890 align:middle line:84%
So let's take a
look at the target.

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:21.690 align:middle line:84%
And then if we
have time, maybe I

01:02:21.690 --> 01:02:25.500 align:middle line:84%
can talk a little bit about
how to use that kind of thing

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:28.200 align:middle line:90%
for healing.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.330 align:middle line:90%
So yeah.

01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:31.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's take a
look at the target now.

01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so I hit the
random number generator.

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:37.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:42.220 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, and then I pick a--

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.630 align:middle line:90%
>> So you take that number.

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:44.642 align:middle line:90%
What number did you get?

01:02:44.642 --> 01:02:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Your precog, I have three.

01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:46.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Three.

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:48.340 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so go to the
third one, sorry.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.030 align:middle line:90%
>> So I'm on Upsplash.

01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Unsplash, yeah.

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:51.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Unsplash.

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:53.650 align:middle line:90%
And 1--

01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>> 2 and then 3.

01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:57.085 align:middle line:84%
And then hand that
to our friend Danny.

01:02:57.085 --> 01:02:59.800 align:middle line:90%


01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:03.910 align:middle line:84%
And then I'd love to
see it if you let me.

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you want me to explain
it or show it to you?

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:07.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's see.

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Here, your puffballs.

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:10.900 align:middle line:90%
>> But there's no tubular.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.550 align:middle line:84%
See, I put those
things to the side.

01:03:12.550 --> 01:03:15.040 align:middle line:84%
So I wonder if there's some
bells or something making

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.080 align:middle line:90%
a clanging sound.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:17.455 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's all
photos of clouds.

01:03:17.455 --> 01:03:18.620 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:18.970 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:20.262 align:middle line:90%
It's just a bunch of puffballs.

01:03:20.262 --> 01:03:22.030 align:middle line:84%
>> Puffballs, very
first thing you said.

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:22.830 align:middle line:90%
Yep.

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:23.780 align:middle line:90%
>> That's pretty cool.

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:24.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, yeah.

01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:27.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Yep, I mean, because that
was strong, and it was there.

01:03:27.610 --> 01:03:31.462 align:middle line:10%
And when you said I put
that stuff off to the side--

01:03:31.462 --> 01:03:33.670 align:middle line:10%
OK, so let's talk about the
relationship between what

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:36.370 align:middle line:10%
I experienced and the
target, so puffballs, clouds.

01:03:36.370 --> 01:03:40.600 align:middle line:10%
OK, first thing that
came is often the thing.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.300 align:middle line:10%
And I also had these
clanging things.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:46.580 align:middle line:10%
I was talking about cafe
seating and like a European--

01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:48.250 align:middle line:10%
it's in Brazil, by
the way, the picture.

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:53.200 align:middle line:10%
But Brazil and Europe
are not the same place.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.500 align:middle line:10%
And there were no cafe chairs,
and there's no cobblestone.

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:57.770 align:middle line:10%
So why did that come in?

01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:59.320 align:middle line:10%
So one answer is noise.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320 align:middle line:10%
I'm getting information.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:02.030 align:middle line:10%
I'm starting to make a story.

01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:05.360 align:middle line:10%
Puffballs don't make sense, so
I'm making up this other story.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.880 align:middle line:84%
Another explanation is I'm
telling a story about how

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.850 align:middle line:90%
I'm actually doing it.

01:04:08.850 --> 01:04:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So I have noticed that I often
get to the place where there's--

01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:13.970 align:middle line:90%
I want to go down a path.

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:17.060 align:middle line:84%
That's actually a story about me
trying to get to this location

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.610 align:middle line:84%
instead of having this
future location come to me.

01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:21.500 align:middle line:10%
The third thing that's
really interesting

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.590 align:middle line:10%
is when I created the website
for The Premonition Code,

01:04:24.590 --> 01:04:26.820 align:middle line:10%
I used a bunch of pictures
that I have taken myself.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:28.237 align:middle line:10%
So I knew the
stories behind them.

01:04:28.237 --> 01:04:31.190 align:middle line:10%
I knew what was behind
me and out of the scene

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:32.370 align:middle line:10%
when I took the picture.

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:34.730 align:middle line:84%
So now when I do
controlled precognition

01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.280 align:middle line:84%
for those pictures, the
ones that I've taken,

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:39.290 align:middle line:84%
and I get something that
isn't in the picture,

01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:41.240 align:middle line:84%
I can ask myself, is
this something that

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.850 align:middle line:90%
was off to the side or behind?

01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:51.120 align:middle line:10%
>> So I clicked on the photo,
the Praia da Tombo photo.

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.980 align:middle line:90%
And it's from a collection.

01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And the photo is the
fluffy white clouds.

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:59.086 align:middle line:84%
The next photo is iron
rails on a pathway.

01:04:59.086 --> 01:05:03.662 align:middle line:84%
And the third photo
is cobblestones.

01:05:03.662 --> 01:05:04.620 align:middle line:90%
>> This is the problem.

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:07.070 align:middle line:84%
So actually, we have
to talk about this.

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.030 align:middle line:90%
So can you--

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:11.950 align:middle line:84%
>> And the fourth
photo is power lines--

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:12.750 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHS]

01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:14.210 align:middle line:90%
>> So if you could put those--

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:14.750 align:middle line:90%
>> These are fluffy clouds.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:15.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:05:15.550 --> 01:05:17.432 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:17.432 --> 01:05:18.437 align:middle line:90%


01:05:18.437 --> 01:05:19.520 align:middle line:90%
>> --pictures of all that?

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>> If you could put those in
the thing-- yeah, OK, good.

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:24.140 align:middle line:84%
So if you could put
those in the documentary.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.000 align:middle line:90%
So we could talk about--

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:26.990 align:middle line:90%
it's not crazy, though.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
It's a total skill,
totally possible.

01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And totally, people are
using it all the time.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:38.330 align:middle line:84%
And so the thing I want to
say about that is that when--

01:05:38.330 --> 01:05:43.130 align:middle line:84%
so what happened here is that
the director of photography,

01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:46.670 align:middle line:84%
when he saw the other possible--
so we used a random number

01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:48.560 align:middle line:84%
generator to choose
which was the target.

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:50.332 align:middle line:84%
When he saw the other
possible targets

01:05:50.332 --> 01:05:52.040 align:middle line:84%
and realized they
lined up with this idea

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:56.810 align:middle line:84%
of the cobblestone street
and the tubular metal things,

01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:58.590 align:middle line:90%
he showed me those targets.

01:05:58.590 --> 01:06:01.290 align:middle line:10%
So the problem with that is
then they become the target,

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:05.160 align:middle line:10%
and I get muddled because
now the target is basically

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.990 align:middle line:10%
whatever's on his phone, and now
there's three or four targets.

01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:10.710 align:middle line:84%
So that was exactly the third
thing I was going to say,

01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:12.480 align:middle line:84%
the third reason why
there's something

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:17.310 align:middle line:84%
called displacement, where
if you see the target that's

01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:18.960 align:middle line:84%
not the target but
is a lot like it

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's on the computer
screen or on someone's phone,

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:23.370 align:middle line:84%
in your mind, it
becomes the target.

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:25.290 align:middle line:84%
And you displace from
the actual target,

01:06:25.290 --> 01:06:28.170 align:middle line:84%
which was meant to be
that scene in Brazil

01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:29.940 align:middle line:90%
with the sunset and the clouds.

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.810 align:middle line:84%
You start thinking
it's all the target.

01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:34.380 align:middle line:84%
So this is further evidence
that this is a real skill.

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:37.410 align:middle line:84%
Just like if tomorrow,
if you asked me

01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:38.987 align:middle line:84%
which was the target
of those things,

01:06:38.987 --> 01:06:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I would have to use my
memory to try to figure out

01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:41.910 align:middle line:90%
which was the target.

01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:43.110 align:middle line:84%
And they would be
difficult to separate,

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:44.520 align:middle line:84%
because they were all
on someone else's phone.

01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And I'd never met this guy,
and so whatever is on his phone

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:47.880 align:middle line:90%
is the target.

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.320 align:middle line:84%
So our memory of the past and of
the future work very similarly.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:53.520 align:middle line:90%
There's confusion.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.890 align:middle line:84%
There's attraction to
interesting things.

01:06:55.890 --> 01:06:58.118 align:middle line:84%
There's fun and
games, just like there

01:06:58.118 --> 01:06:59.410 align:middle line:90%
is with our memory of the past.

01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:01.317 align:middle line:84%
And so I'm really
glad that happened.

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:03.150 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know that that
was going to happen.

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:05.970 align:middle line:84%
But that's a really
great piece of this.

01:07:05.970 --> 01:07:08.430 align:middle line:84%
So do we have a chance
to talk about healing?

01:07:08.430 --> 01:07:09.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, we do.

01:07:09.660 --> 01:07:10.465 align:middle line:90%
Yeah, absolutely.

01:07:10.465 --> 01:07:11.590 align:middle line:90%
>> I know it's my timeline.

01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:12.290 align:middle line:84%
But now I'm all
obsessed with it.

01:07:12.290 --> 01:07:12.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:13.310 align:middle line:90%
It's all up to you.

01:07:13.310 --> 01:07:14.587 align:middle line:90%
It's all you, Baby.

01:07:14.587 --> 01:07:15.420 align:middle line:90%
This is your-- yeah.

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:15.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.650 align:middle line:90%
So we can keep going?

01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:17.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.470 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, so here's the thing.

01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:21.900 align:middle line:84%
Once you start to recognize
that this skill is being

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.280 align:middle line:90%
used by people just quietly--

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.953 align:middle line:84%
corporations are
using this skill.

01:07:24.953 --> 01:07:26.370 align:middle line:84%
The government's
using this skill.

01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Different governments
are using this skill.

01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:30.570 align:middle line:84%
Law enforcement agencies
are using this skill.

01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:33.000 align:middle line:84%
A bunch of different people
are using this skill quietly

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.730 align:middle line:84%
on the down low
because of the taboo

01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:37.500 align:middle line:84%
but also because you
don't want people

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:40.118 align:middle line:84%
who are-- there's also people
who claim they have this skill

01:07:40.118 --> 01:07:41.160 align:middle line:90%
but don't have the skill.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.600 align:middle line:10%
There's all sorts
of things going

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:46.900 align:middle line:10%
on just like with everything,
and so you have to be careful.

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.240 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things
everyone can do--

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.590 align:middle line:84%
and I think it might be easier
than being a skilled precog--

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:55.410 align:middle line:84%
is to use this as
a healing modality.

01:07:55.410 --> 01:07:59.010 align:middle line:84%
So for example, when
I was a little girl,

01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:02.070 align:middle line:84%
my family was a great
family, unconditionally

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:06.414 align:middle line:84%
loving, wonderful, but
also really messed up.

01:08:06.414 --> 01:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
And I had a borderline,
I would say,

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:12.900 align:middle line:84%
abusive situation going
on when I was a girl,

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.070 align:middle line:90%
and I've since healed it.

01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:16.910 align:middle line:10%
But when this was
happening at nighttime--

01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:19.410 align:middle line:10%
and I'm not going to go into
it just to not trigger anyone--

01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:22.200 align:middle line:10%
but I would notice that
off to my right-hand side--

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.130 align:middle line:10%
here's my bed.

01:08:23.130 --> 01:08:25.770 align:middle line:10%
And off to my right-hand side,
there was a rocking chair.

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:27.060 align:middle line:10%
It was empty, usually.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:35.460 align:middle line:10%
And I saw with my mind's eye
an older woman who at the time

01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:37.180 align:middle line:10%
I didn't recognize was myself.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:39.060 align:middle line:84%
But now that I know
what I look like,

01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:41.340 align:middle line:84%
I see that that was
probably my self.

01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.880 align:middle line:10%
And she would just
be there with me.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:45.819 align:middle line:10%
And she would just be kind, and
she would say, you know what?

01:08:45.819 --> 01:08:47.688 align:middle line:10%
He loves you.

01:08:47.688 --> 01:08:49.377 align:middle line:10%
It's a frustrating situation.

01:08:49.377 --> 01:08:50.710 align:middle line:10%
You're going to be angry at him.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:51.510 align:middle line:10%
It's OK.

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:53.500 align:middle line:10%
You should be angry, and
you're going to be OK.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.750 align:middle line:10%
It's all going to turn out OK.

01:08:54.750 --> 01:08:57.130 align:middle line:10%
Again and again, she would
just say that kind of stuff.

01:08:57.130 --> 01:08:59.890 align:middle line:10%
And I felt it was
very comforting.

01:08:59.890 --> 01:09:02.753 align:middle line:10%
And as I got older and I
started to go into meditation

01:09:02.753 --> 01:09:05.170 align:middle line:10%
and start to think about this
kind of fabric of time stuff

01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:07.142 align:middle line:10%
with the move the flag
and stuff, I thought,

01:09:07.142 --> 01:09:09.100 align:middle line:10%
well, I'm going to take
the flag from the past,

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:09.880 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to move it here.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.172 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to have a
conversation with my past self,

01:09:12.172 --> 01:09:14.252 align:middle line:10%
and I'm going to sit in
that room with that girl.

01:09:14.252 --> 01:09:16.210 align:middle line:10%
And I'm going to tell
her, it's going to be OK,

01:09:16.210 --> 01:09:19.240 align:middle line:10%
and that it's OK to be
angry, and that she's

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.790 align:middle line:10%
got the right bead
on what's going on,

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:23.885 align:middle line:10%
and that she's going
to turn out fine.

01:09:23.885 --> 01:09:25.510 align:middle line:10%
And I would do that
over and over again

01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:26.770 align:middle line:10%
when I had the resources.

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:33.580 align:middle line:10%
And I swear that
was me in that room.

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.710 align:middle line:84%
And there's this kind
of temporal loop.

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:38.620 align:middle line:84%
There's a guy named
Eric Wargo, W-A-R-G-O,

01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:40.720 align:middle line:84%
who wrote this great
book called "Time Loops,"

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.266 align:middle line:84%
this idea of the causality
going in both directions.

01:09:44.266 --> 01:09:49.700 align:middle line:84%
So now you could use as a
mental time travel healing tool

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.040 align:middle line:90%
this idea that any time--

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.240 align:middle line:90%
I call it love banking.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.740 align:middle line:84%
And I'm actually writing a book
about time travel therapies.

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:58.760 align:middle line:84%
But any time you feel you have
an excess experience of love

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.830 align:middle line:84%
and you're just
feeling so resourced

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and good in
everything, so mentally

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:08.210 align:middle line:84%
go back and find a time when
you're not and love that self.

01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:11.930 align:middle line:84%
Or alternatively, the
checkbook works the other way.

01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:15.192 align:middle line:90%
It's like a savings account.

01:10:15.192 --> 01:10:17.150 align:middle line:84%
You can deposit love when
you're feeling great,

01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:19.080 align:middle line:84%
and you can withdraw
love when you need it.

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:22.050 align:middle line:84%
So when you're not feeling
well, wait, future self,

01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:24.590 align:middle line:84%
this is one of those times
when I'm going to need you.

01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So I'm putting a
marker right here.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And you can come back, and
you can feed me good love

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.980 align:middle line:90%
at that time.

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:35.060 align:middle line:90%
So it feels very healing to me.

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:41.420 align:middle line:84%
I had this experience with
possible cervical cancer

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:43.940 align:middle line:84%
where I went to my GP,
my General Practitioner.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:47.330 align:middle line:84%
And she looked at my cervix
just as a general checkup

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:49.310 align:middle line:84%
because I hadn't had a
pap smear in a while.

01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:52.010 align:middle line:90%
And she said, oh my god--

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:54.110 align:middle line:90%
she had no poker face.

01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:56.480 align:middle line:84%
She said, oh my god,
there's blood and stuff.

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.670 align:middle line:90%
What's going on there?

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.120 align:middle line:90%
And that scared me.

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:03.638 align:middle line:84%
And so I said, so I'm going
to go see an OB/GYN who

01:11:03.638 --> 01:11:04.680 align:middle line:90%
knows what they're doing.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.960 align:middle line:90%
So I went to go see an OB/GYN.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.293 align:middle line:10%
And then the OB/GYN was like,
well, it doesn't look good

01:11:08.293 --> 01:11:11.420 align:middle line:10%
and got some pathology samples.

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:12.270 align:middle line:90%
And I was scared.

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:13.910 align:middle line:84%
I thought, well, it
doesn't look good.

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:16.040 align:middle line:84%
And everyone doesn't
like how my cervix looks.

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And I can't see my cervix,
so I'm going to trust them.

01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:22.460 align:middle line:10%
So I had 10 days between
the pathology samples

01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:25.590 align:middle line:10%
and when I would find out
whether I had cervical cancer.

01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:28.320 align:middle line:10%
And I knew my cervix was in pain
and had been in pain for months.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.540 align:middle line:10%
I had cervical pain
for months, which

01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:32.000 align:middle line:10%
is part of why I asked my
general practitioner to look.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:36.050 align:middle line:10%
So I had those 10 days,
and I thought, oh, time

01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:37.190 align:middle line:10%
travel experiment.

01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:40.010 align:middle line:10%
I have 10 days when
something's not decided yet.

01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:42.140 align:middle line:10%
I have the time when
we don't yet know,

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:43.730 align:middle line:10%
and it's not basically settled.

01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:46.640 align:middle line:10%
So this is the time to do
some time travel experiments.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.850 align:middle line:10%
So mentally, I thought, what's
the most efficient thing to do?

01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:53.150 align:middle line:10%
The most efficient thing to
do, because I am lazy as hell,

01:11:53.150 --> 01:11:56.840 align:middle line:10%
is to go back to the
very first cancer cell,

01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:00.230 align:middle line:10%
the very first normal cell in my
cervix that might have decided--

01:12:00.230 --> 01:12:01.670 align:middle line:10%
let's assume that
I have cancer--

01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:03.800 align:middle line:10%
that might have decided
to give me cancer,

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.590 align:middle line:10%
to go back and talk to that one
cell because from that cell,

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:07.660 align:middle line:10%
everything else comes.

01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:08.660 align:middle line:90%
That's how cancer works.

01:12:08.660 --> 01:12:11.480 align:middle line:84%
One cell decides to flip, and
it flips the ones around it.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.510 align:middle line:84%
So go back to talk to that one
cell because that's the source.

01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:16.640 align:middle line:84%
So every night before
I would go to bed,

01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.770 align:middle line:84%
I would talk to that cell,
and I got to know it.

01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:20.690 align:middle line:84%
And I would be
like, so why do you

01:12:20.690 --> 01:12:23.870 align:middle line:84%
think you might be about
to flip to go be cancerous?

01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:25.460 align:middle line:84%
And I finally got
clear that it was

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:28.370 align:middle line:84%
wanting me to feel my
sadness about not having

01:12:28.370 --> 01:12:29.220 align:middle line:90%
any more children.

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.710 align:middle line:90%
I had one child.

01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:34.160 align:middle line:84%
I wanted another child,
but I was menopausal.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't going to have any
more children, not biologically.

01:12:39.330 --> 01:12:40.800 align:middle line:90%
And I got it.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.840 align:middle line:84%
I said, OK, I'm going to
have to feel sad about that.

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:44.640 align:middle line:90%
So we got into--

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.960 align:middle line:90%
I was very connected.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.610 align:middle line:90%
I love that cell.

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And I was like, look, it's OK
with me if you decide to flip.

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:53.592 align:middle line:84%
But also, I would love
it if you didn't, but I

01:12:53.592 --> 01:12:55.300 align:middle line:84%
know that I don't have
control over that.

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:57.240 align:middle line:10%
So I just want you to know
I love you no matter what.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:57.900 align:middle line:90%
You can flip.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:58.830 align:middle line:90%
You can not flip.

01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:59.970 align:middle line:90%
Maybe you need to flip.

01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:01.560 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what the thing is.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.520 align:middle line:90%
That's the right thing.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.937 align:middle line:84%
Who knows what the
right thing is?

01:13:03.937 --> 01:13:05.670 align:middle line:84%
So I just want you
to know I love you.

01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:08.550 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so my pain
started going away.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:12.720 align:middle line:10%
And I was negative
for cervical cancer.

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:15.270 align:middle line:10%
And then everything that
was in my cervix that

01:13:15.270 --> 01:13:16.470 align:middle line:10%
looked bad went away.

01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:19.410 align:middle line:10%
I didn't have any more pain, and
there was no reason to worry.

01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:20.790 align:middle line:10%
So now it's all good.

01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:25.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, I don't know if that was
just some kind of remission.

01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:middle line:90%
I mean, who knows just what?

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Or if I ever had cervical
cancer and it went away.

01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:32.520 align:middle line:84%
Or that's the whole point
is that I didn't know.

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.980 align:middle line:84%
And that's when the
flexibility was about how

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:36.280 align:middle line:90%
to play with this stuff.

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.770 align:middle line:90%
So great.

01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:39.755 align:middle line:84%
I don't have to
worry about that now.

01:13:39.755 --> 01:13:41.880 align:middle line:84%
So I think there's some
really powerful experiments

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.500 align:middle line:90%
to be done in that field.

01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:46.350 align:middle line:84%
And really, I think there's
some rigorous-- that's

01:13:46.350 --> 01:13:47.400 align:middle line:90%
an anecdotal story.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.535 align:middle line:90%
That's not an experiment.

01:13:50.535 --> 01:13:52.410 align:middle line:84%
But I think there's some
rigorous experiments

01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:56.190 align:middle line:84%
to be done because I think
that the basic message is

01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:58.470 align:middle line:84%
time doesn't work the
way we think it does.

01:13:58.470 --> 01:14:01.740 align:middle line:10%
And you can get
information through time

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:04.560 align:middle line:10%
and use that information
if you're compelled to

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:06.060 align:middle line:10%
and if you feel you
have the talent,

01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:07.480 align:middle line:10%
and you want to develop it.

01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:13.510 align:middle line:84%
And so given that, how are
you going to use it for good?

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:16.360 align:middle line:84%
How are you not going to be all
caught up in the power of it?

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.068 align:middle line:84%
How are you going to
use it for something

01:14:18.068 --> 01:14:23.020 align:middle line:84%
that informs or connects
or loves or creates

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.642 align:middle line:84%
a positive outcome
for the world?

01:14:24.642 --> 01:14:25.850 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to do that?

01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:27.050 align:middle line:90%
And that's really the question.

01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:28.592 align:middle line:84%
And avoiding that
question by saying,

01:14:28.592 --> 01:14:31.360 align:middle line:84%
we're not sure it's real,
we don't know if it exists.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:33.580 align:middle line:84%
These talents are whatever,
which is all false

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:34.880 align:middle line:90%
because we know it's real.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:35.680 align:middle line:90%
It exists.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:37.210 align:middle line:90%
Those talents are real.

01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:39.100 align:middle line:10%
Avoiding that question
by doing that,

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.590 align:middle line:10%
instead of really asking how
are we going to use this,

01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:43.330 align:middle line:10%
just allows people
who are currently

01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:45.070 align:middle line:10%
developing the
talent and quietly

01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:48.790 align:middle line:10%
and using it to use it in ways
that maybe aren't so great.

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:53.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's do this
other thing if we can.

01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:55.000 align:middle line:90%
