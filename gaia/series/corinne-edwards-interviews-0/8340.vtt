00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.610 align:middle line:10%
>> The spiritual reawakening,
which is going on in the West--

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.800 align:middle line:10%
shamanism is a
major thrust of it

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.950 align:middle line:10%
because of the ease
with which the method is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.840 align:middle line:10%
learned and practiced.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.930 align:middle line:10%
And many of us in the West
are learning the ancient time

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:10%
tested ways of the shaman.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.480 align:middle line:10%
>> We have an interesting
introduction for you today.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.240 align:middle line:10%
I want you to meet
an archaeologist who

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.570 align:middle line:10%
is also a shaman.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And his name is
Dr. Hank Wesselman.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.850 align:middle line:84%
He's the author of two
fascinating, spellbinding

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:00.650 align:middle line:90%
books--

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.350 align:middle line:84%
"Spiritwalker" and
"Medicinemaker."

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.150 align:middle line:90%
Welcome, Hank.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.335 align:middle line:90%
>> You're an archaeologist.

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, I would call
myself a paleoanthropologist.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.700 align:middle line:84%
I work mainly on
bones, as opposed

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.390 align:middle line:84%
to the archaeologist who works
on stone tools, primarily.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.940 align:middle line:84%
>> But how does
the archaeologist

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.650 align:middle line:84%
or an anthropologist
become a shaman?

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.900 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.090 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I don't
call myself a shaman.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:10%
I wouldn't call myself
a student of shamanism.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.950 align:middle line:10%
There is a reason for this.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.130 align:middle line:10%
know Let's talk a little
bit about the shaman.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.340 align:middle line:84%
The shaman is a man
or a woman, usually

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.200 align:middle line:84%
in a traditional society, who
discovers rather early in life,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.930 align:middle line:84%
as a rule, that they can induce
expanded states of awareness

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.350 align:middle line:90%
in themselves.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.440 align:middle line:90%
We might use the word trance.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.540 align:middle line:84%
Some of us avoid
using the word trance

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:84%
because it sounds like
we're going unconscious

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
when you go into trance,
when, in fact, it's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.270 align:middle line:90%
exactly the opposite.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:84%
Your consciousness expands
instead of shutting down.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.720 align:middle line:84%
In these trance
states, the shaman

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.610 align:middle line:84%
is typically able to journey, to
have a classic out of the body

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.360 align:middle line:84%
experience in which their
conscious awareness drifts

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.900 align:middle line:84%
into an alternate reality,
which traditional people call

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.580 align:middle line:90%
the spirit world.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.160 align:middle line:84%
Jung might call it the
level of archetypes.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:84%
The Kahuna mystics of Hawaii
you might call it [NON-ENGLISH],,

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.120 align:middle line:90%
the knowledge of level three.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.700 align:middle line:84%
But the spirit world is a place
of information and action,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
to some extent, where the shaman
can do various things on behalf

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.440 align:middle line:90%
of their people.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.900 align:middle line:84%
The shaman is an
individual who is

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.910 align:middle line:84%
the master of the
trance experience, who

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.070 align:middle line:84%
can go into this
alternate reality,

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.890 align:middle line:84%
and who typically interacts with
the entities that reside there.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Who are they?

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, traditional
people call them spirits.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.660 align:middle line:84%
We might call them energies
or powers or awarenesses.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.760 align:middle line:84%
There are different terms for
them in different cultures.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.520 align:middle line:84%
In my own case, I discovered
I had this ability

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.180 align:middle line:84%
quite by accident, in a very
spontaneous way documented

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.730 align:middle line:84%
in this strange
book, "Spiritwalker."

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.710 align:middle line:84%
And I find my interests being
drawn in this direction.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, many of your listeners
may be aware of the fact

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.710 align:middle line:84%
that there is a spiritual
reawakening going on

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.560 align:middle line:84%
in the West today,
in the Western world.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.440 align:middle line:84%
And shamanism is a major
thrust of this movement,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.050 align:middle line:84%
I think, because of the ease
with which these methods

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.960 align:middle line:90%
are learned and practiced.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.510 align:middle line:84%
In my own personal
psychosymbology,

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.240 align:middle line:84%
I have come to
conceptualize the existence

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.850 align:middle line:90%
of some sort of inner doorway.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.450 align:middle line:84%
For most of our lives
it remains closed.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.230 align:middle line:84%
But for some of us, it opens,
sometimes spontaneously,

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.360 align:middle line:84%
allowing us glimpses into this
land of visions and spirits

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.090 align:middle line:84%
that traditional shamans
talk about and have

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.940 align:middle line:90%
talked about for millennia.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.858 align:middle line:84%
Now, this gets us into
sticky areas as Westerners

00:04:02.858 --> 00:04:04.400 align:middle line:84%
because we want to
grow up in a sense

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.830 align:middle line:84%
in a society in which
spirits are part

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.020 align:middle line:90%
of our experienced reality.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Nevertheless, some
of us find ourselves

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.030 align:middle line:90%
drawn in this direction.

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.120 align:middle line:84%
And I've come to believe
that each one of us

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.750 align:middle line:84%
has an inner hard drive,
very much like a computer.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.012 align:middle line:84%
And there there's a program
on this inner hard drive.

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But you know what happens
when you buy a new computer

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.827 align:middle line:84%
and you've got all this
stuff on your main menu--

00:04:27.827 --> 00:04:29.660 align:middle line:84%
you have no idea what
all these programs do.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.785 align:middle line:84%
What you really want to do
is get to Microsoft Word

00:04:31.785 --> 00:04:33.055 align:middle line:90%
so you can write a letter.

00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:35.180 align:middle line:84%
So you bring up Microsoft
Word, and you go to work.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.740 align:middle line:84%
And maybe years go by with all
this stuff on your hard drive

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.167 align:middle line:90%
and you never bring it up.

00:04:41.167 --> 00:04:43.250 align:middle line:84%
But then, one morning at
4 o'clock in the morning,

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.390 align:middle line:90%
you can't sleep.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And something comes
up on the screen.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.390 align:middle line:84%
And you think, where
did that come from?

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.330 align:middle line:84%
See, I think there's a program
on our inner hard drive, which

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.030 align:middle line:84%
was programmed into us through
the evolutionary process

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.160 align:middle line:90%
over immense amounts of time.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.770 align:middle line:84%
I think virtually all
of us have this program.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And this program allows
us to spiritwalk,

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.810 align:middle line:84%
like the traditional
tribal shaman.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.910 align:middle line:84%
But most of us don't
know we can do it.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.630 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a wonderful
word, spiritwalk.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it very accurately
describes what I experience.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.840 align:middle line:84%
Because my spirit, soul,
complex, if you will,

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.400 align:middle line:90%
literally walks out of my body.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.176 align:middle line:84%
And it's like going on
a spiritual walkabout.

00:05:23.176 --> 00:05:25.550 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, in your
book "Spiritwalker"

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and in "Medicinemaker," you
do something a little bit more

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
than just communicating with
spirits on the other side

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.110 align:middle line:90%
of the veil.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.100 align:middle line:84%
You actually time
travel into an entity

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.720 align:middle line:84%
5,000 years later
than we are today.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.828 align:middle line:84%
>> This is pretty
sticky stuff, here.

00:05:45.828 --> 00:05:47.870 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I've
tried to do in these books

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.320 align:middle line:84%
is explain how such a
phenomenon is even possible.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.780 align:middle line:84%
And I've been particularly
drawn to the body of knowledge,

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.505 align:middle line:84%
which was possessed by the
Kahuna mystics of old Hawaii.

00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:00.380 align:middle line:84%
The Kahuna mystics had
a very interesting way

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.620 align:middle line:84%
of looking at the self
and looking at reality,

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.160 align:middle line:84%
and understanding how these
different levels of the self

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.100 align:middle line:84%
actually function,
and how they dovetail

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
with the way in which
reality is put together.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.020 align:middle line:84%
It is the key to understanding
how such a phenomenon is

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.550 align:middle line:90%
even possible.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.240 align:middle line:84%
For example, in this level of
reality, in the physical world,

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.360 align:middle line:84%
there are certain assumptions
that we just take on

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.610 align:middle line:84%
as givens, that allow
us to experience

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.800 align:middle line:84%
the physical plane
the way we do--

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.910 align:middle line:84%
that everything is separate
from everything else.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.170 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.150 align:middle line:84%
You're sitting over there,
I'm sitting over here.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.950 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.030 align:middle line:84%
That everything has a
beginning in an ending--

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.440 align:middle line:84%
your life begins
at the beginning

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and it ends when
we make transition.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.030 align:middle line:90%
And every effect has a cause.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, these are the
assumptions that

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.295 align:middle line:84%
allow for the classical
laws of physics to operate,

00:06:46.295 --> 00:06:47.670 align:middle line:84%
and the laws of
cause and effect,

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.470 align:middle line:90%
and so forth, and so on.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:84%
But this is only a level
of partial understanding

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:90%
or partial awareness.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.730 align:middle line:84%
A Kahuna mystic would say
that the level of thoughts,

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:84%
and emotions, and feelings,
and psychic awareness

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.470 align:middle line:90%
is the second level of reality.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And in this level of
reality, everything's

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.710 align:middle line:90%
connected to everything else.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.070 align:middle line:84%
It's connected through
an energetic matrix,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.680 align:middle line:90%
which they call the aka field.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.930 align:middle line:84%
And many of us, in
our moments of vision,

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.330 align:middle line:90%
have glimpses of a great grid--

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.680 align:middle line:84%
a great grid or a web or
a net, a glittering net.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.050 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's lazy
and diaphanous.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.603 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes it's very
rigid and geometric.

00:07:30.603 --> 00:07:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And this is the grid through
which everything is connected

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:90%
to everything everywhere.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.070 align:middle line:84%
This is how all
psychic phenomena work.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.490 align:middle line:84%
Telepathy involves perceiving
through the connections

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.120 align:middle line:84%
that you have with other
people or other places.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this level of reality,
time doesn't work the same way.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.680 align:middle line:84%
You could say that everything
that ever happened in the past

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.020 align:middle line:84%
and everything that will
ever happen in the future

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.980 align:middle line:84%
are all going on at once
in some sort of vast cosmic

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.480 align:middle line:84%
now, connected through
this aka field.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.780 align:middle line:84%
So, in my own case, how such
a phenomenon was possible

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:09.660 align:middle line:84%
was that I was shifting into
this second level of awareness.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.750 align:middle line:84%
I was going through
this connection,

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.120 align:middle line:84%
this etheric
energetic connection,

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.620 align:middle line:84%
and I was actually
making connection

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.560 align:middle line:84%
with one of my
descendant selves.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.250 align:middle line:90%
>> 5,000 years in advance.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:21.850 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.170 align:middle line:84%
And the curious thing
is that I wasn't--

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.730 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't anticipating this.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:29.270 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't looking for it, which
meant that somebody else was

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:90%
involved in the dynamic.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.679 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, this takes
us into the third level

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.610 align:middle line:84%
of reality, which traditional
people call the spirit world.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:40.549 align:middle line:84%
And, in my own case,
I believe that there

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:44.420 align:middle line:84%
is a spiritual entity
who is in relationship

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.750 align:middle line:84%
both with me and with
my descendant, who

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:52.670 align:middle line:84%
is very important in bringing
the two of us together.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.860 align:middle line:90%
And this happened for a reason.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.210 align:middle line:84%
There is a hidden agenda
in these strange books.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.050 align:middle line:84%
And one of those agendas
is to give people

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:05.180 align:middle line:84%
permission to think in new ways,
to think in new directions.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.120 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual reawakening
which is going on in the West--

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.310 align:middle line:84%
shamanism is a
major thrust of it

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.460 align:middle line:84%
because of the ease
with which the method is

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.350 align:middle line:90%
learned and practiced.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:18.440 align:middle line:84%
And many of us in the West
are learning the ancient time

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.930 align:middle line:84%
tested ways of the
shaman in order

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:23.150 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do
various things, usually

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.300 align:middle line:84%
on behalf of other
members of our community.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's interesting that
if you're in any group and any

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:33.080 align:middle line:84%
one has the nerve to come up
with a mystical experience that

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:35.150 align:middle line:90%
they've had--

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.610 align:middle line:84%
they have received
some sort of contact

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:42.390 align:middle line:84%
from the departed one or
some kind of a contact--

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.870 align:middle line:84%
it gives the other
people in the room

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:49.150 align:middle line:84%
courage to say what
has happened to them.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:50.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Indeed.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:56.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And I think that your books
are doing this for people.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:84%
The fact that you come from
such a scientific background

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.160 align:middle line:84%
and with credentials
that are so impeccable,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.850 align:middle line:84%
and someone like you has the
nerve to come out and write

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:84%
about time travel and
occupying a defendant's body

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.740 align:middle line:90%
5,000 years from now--

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.510 align:middle line:90%
I think there's a reason for it.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:22.720 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, I have a
growing file of correspondence,

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.120 align:middle line:90%
and these fill many boxes now.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.120 align:middle line:84%
They fall into two
categories-- people praising me

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.650 align:middle line:90%
for having written the book.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:84%
And, interestingly,
I have not received

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.280 align:middle line:84%
a single negative
letter, not one.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Really?

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.000 align:middle line:84%
>> I consider that
some sort of record.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.420 align:middle line:84%
But then there's the
much smaller file.

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:10%
And the small file
contains letters

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:45.910 align:middle line:10%
from people who vision like I
do, people who actually have

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:49.390 align:middle line:10%
connected with descendant
selves and we've had glimpses

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.220 align:middle line:10%
of the future, the way I have.

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.780 align:middle line:84%
And, like me, most
of them were not

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.370 align:middle line:90%
looking for this experience.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Like me, there was
usually something--

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.920 align:middle line:84%
there was some mouse that
double clicked the program.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:02.590 align:middle line:10%
And in my own case, as
you're very much aware,

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.370 align:middle line:10%
that mouse was joyous
marital encounters,

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:07.525 align:middle line:10%
for lack of a better term.

00:11:07.525 --> 00:11:08.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, hold that thought.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:09.940 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.400 align:middle line:84%

Hank Wesselman here,

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:15.770 align:middle line:90%
and "Spiritwalker."

Stay with us.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:17.774 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:11:17.774 --> 00:11:20.678 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:11:20.678 --> 00:11:31.820 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.720 align:middle line:10%
I'm talking to Dr.
Hank Wesselman,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
with the author
of "Spiritwalker"

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.540 align:middle line:90%
and "Medicinemaker."

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking about his
books and about shamanism.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.600 align:middle line:90%
Hank, can anybody be a shaman?

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that
shamans, first of all,

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.620 align:middle line:90%
tend to run in families.

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.000 align:middle line:84%
There are certain
individuals who

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.220 align:middle line:84%
have a genetic
predisposition towards having

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.020 align:middle line:90%
visionary experience.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.590 align:middle line:10%
But, as we've just said, I
believe that this program

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.930 align:middle line:10%
exists on our inner hard drive.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.720 align:middle line:10%
And I think that most of
us have it, only most of us

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.240 align:middle line:10%
are unaware of it until
suddenly something

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.990 align:middle line:10%
happens and the program is
brought up for the first time.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.880 align:middle line:84%
And, unfortunately in
the West, most of us

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.797 align:middle line:90%
don't know what it is.

00:12:13.797 --> 00:12:15.670 align:middle line:90%
So many of us shut it down.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.290 align:middle line:84%
It happens to many
of us as children

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:20.890 align:middle line:84%
where we start to spontaneously
vision as children.

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And what we get from our
teachers and our parents are,

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.195 align:middle line:90%
pay attention.

00:12:26.195 --> 00:12:27.320 align:middle line:90%
You're supposed to be here.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.902 align:middle line:84%
This isn't a time to be playing
with your imaginary friends.

00:12:29.902 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:84%
Those imaginary
friends over here--

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you said you had an
imaginary friend for a long

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:90%
time.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:90%
>> I did.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.390 align:middle line:84%
When I was a child,
living in New York,

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:40.990 align:middle line:84%
I wasn't allowed to have pets in
the apartment where I grew up.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.180 align:middle line:90%
And so I had imaginary pets.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Now, I just did this
quite spontaneously.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:48.880 align:middle line:84%
I would go to the zoo and admire
various creatures, and then

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.270 align:middle line:84%
kind of like, have
imaginary friends.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, one day one
of these creatures

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:56.260 align:middle line:84%
picked me rather
than me picking it.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.960 align:middle line:84%
And it sort of followed
me home from the zoo.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.220 align:middle line:84%
This was the one that appeared
to me in a combination

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:90%
animal-human form.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:84%
And I've actually got
permission to write

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.250 align:middle line:84%
about this particular
entity, and I've

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.550 align:middle line:84%
called it the Leopard Man
because the Leopard Man looks

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.250 align:middle line:90%
very much like a Leopard Man.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.580 align:middle line:84%
Many years later this entity
reappeared in my life,

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:19.750 align:middle line:90%
in my 40s.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.980 align:middle line:90%
And I think that this--

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.200 align:middle line:84%
what traditional
shamans would call

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.230 align:middle line:84%
a power animal or
a helping spirit,

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.740 align:middle line:84%
was the one that brought me and
Nainoa, my esteemed descendant,

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:90%
together.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.778 align:middle line:84%
It seems to be in
relationship with both of us.

00:13:33.778 --> 00:13:35.320 align:middle line:84%
There's a chapter
in the second book,

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.430 align:middle line:84%
"Medicinemaker,"
about the Leopard Man,

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.600 align:middle line:90%
and who the Leopard Man is.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.328 align:middle line:84%
Carl Jung would
find this chapter

00:13:42.328 --> 00:13:43.370 align:middle line:90%
absolutely extraordinary.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:90%
>> It's fierce.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:44.905 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:13:44.905 --> 00:13:45.190 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:45.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Very fierce.

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:49.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Very fierce because this
is not some projected aspect

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.300 align:middle line:90%
of myself.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.070 align:middle line:84%
This is the group soul, if
you will, of a large species

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:90%
of cat, jungle cat.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.288 align:middle line:84%
And there's nothing human
about this particular entity.

00:14:00.288 --> 00:14:02.080 align:middle line:84%
But it's been in
relationship with humanity

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.240 align:middle line:90%
for a long period of time.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, we have
the fossils of leopards

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and the fossils of humans
in the same early deposits

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:14.140 align:middle line:84%
in Africa, which means
that we co-evolved together

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.490 align:middle line:90%
in the same environment.

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.870 align:middle line:84%
We were both born
in the same place.

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Hank, you think that
a child who is having--

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:26.260 align:middle line:84%
has imaginary friends-- is
this a sign of that child

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.390 align:middle line:90%
being a visionary?

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:32.260 align:middle line:84%
>> In a traditional society,
the elder visionaries--

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:84%
the elder holy beings,
if you will, holy people,

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.990 align:middle line:90%
keep an eye on the children.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And they see those
children who spontaneously

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.650 align:middle line:84%
talk to individuals that
nobody else can see.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.650 align:middle line:84%
They see the signs in
children that children's have

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.480 align:middle line:90%
the ability to vision.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.910 align:middle line:84%
And they begin their
training very early.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.470 align:middle line:84%
They take them on
and begin to give

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:57.010 align:middle line:84%
them exercises to begin
to foster this ability.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:00.790 align:middle line:84%
Because the ability to vision
is simply a learned skill.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:05.243 align:middle line:84%
Once we learn that we have that
capacity, it can be learned.

00:15:05.243 --> 00:15:07.660 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of the training that
I've done in the last three

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.870 align:middle line:84%
years, for example, with
Michael Harner's foundation,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:14.290 align:middle line:84%
has been devoted towards
sharpening this ability

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:18.220 align:middle line:84%
and bringing it under a good
degree of conscious control

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:19.990 align:middle line:90%
so that you--

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:22.810 align:middle line:84%
first of all, you begin to
get these glimpses, as a rule,

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.660 align:middle line:84%
as children or as adolescents
or as young adults.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:84%
You begin to get glimpses
through this visionary window.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And once you see what
you're going for,

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.910 align:middle line:84%
the job of the shaman is
to deepen and stabilize

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
that glimpse into a
permanent visionary

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.010 align:middle line:84%
capacity in which these
spirits or these entities

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.880 align:middle line:84%
or this non-ordinary reality
can be seen and experienced

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:90%
at will.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.750 align:middle line:84%
But beyond this,
there lies still

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.500 align:middle line:84%
another level of expertise,
I guess you could say,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.890 align:middle line:84%
in which a lot of the
abilities and qualities which

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:57.160 align:middle line:84%
are available only in the
altered state, at first,

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.280 align:middle line:84%
become increasingly available
in your everyday waking

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:02.230 align:middle line:90%
consciousness.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:84%
The experienced
meditator, for example,

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.790 align:middle line:84%
who is able to induce a state
of deep calm and concentration

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:12.400 align:middle line:84%
in themselves during
meditation practice--

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.160 align:middle line:84%
they find over time
that these same states

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.550 align:middle line:84%
have come and focused
concentration become

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.800 align:middle line:84%
available to them in
their everyday life,

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.960 align:middle line:84%
on an ongoing
moment-to-moment basis.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
The same thing is true
of visionary experience.

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.430 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like toning a muscle.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:29.140 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like toning a muscle.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
I think it reveals
something very

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:35.240 align:middle line:84%
interesting about who we
are, and about the next stage

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:37.320 align:middle line:90%
of human evolution.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.470 align:middle line:10%
After millions of
years of evolution

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:43.910 align:middle line:10%
of brain and body and
nervous systems, so to speak,

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.800 align:middle line:10%
I believe the next
stage of human evolution

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:10%
involves the evolution
of consciousness.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.030 align:middle line:90%
This is where--

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Happening now.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.440 align:middle line:90%
>> It's happening now.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.260 align:middle line:90%
It's happening now.

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.343 align:middle line:90%
It's a very exciting time.

00:16:53.343 --> 00:16:57.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You had this amazing little
statistic that said that 25%

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:02.840 align:middle line:84%
of people admit to having
a great interest and belief

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.099 align:middle line:90%
in the mystical.

00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:08.060 align:middle line:84%
Not religion, so much, but the
mystical and the spiritual.

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.880 align:middle line:84%
>> Well there was a survey that
was done by Paul Ray in San

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.430 align:middle line:84%
Francisco, that was funded
by the Fetzer Institute

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:84%
and the Institute
of Noetic Sciences.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.569 align:middle line:84%
This was called the
American Live Survey,

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:19.790 align:middle line:84%
and it took place over
a number of years.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.829 align:middle line:84%
It was published
several years ago.

00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:26.030 align:middle line:84%
And it revealed that 44 million
people in the United States

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:28.640 align:middle line:84%
are deeply interested in the
things we're talking about.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.680 align:middle line:84%
These are folks with a
very highly evolved sense

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:90%
of social justice.

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.090 align:middle line:84%
They're very concerned
with environmental issues.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:37.400 align:middle line:84%
They're very
environmentally savvy, very

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.140 align:middle line:84%
concerned with the
monumental waste which

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.540 align:middle line:84%
is being generated by every
level of the world capitalist

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.420 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.200 align:middle line:84%
But there are also people
who are mystical seekers.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.690 align:middle line:84%
They are seekers of
visionary experience.

00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:49.730 align:middle line:84%
They believe in
alternate realities.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:53.000 align:middle line:84%
They believe in the existence
of spirits, spirit helpers,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.560 align:middle line:90%
and spirit teachers.

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:84%
They believe in the
existence of power,

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.780 align:middle line:84%
what the Polynesians called
mana and the Chinese called chi.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:90%
And in yoga, it's called prana.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
The [CLICKS] bushman--
remember the [CLICKS] bushmen,

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:90%
from "The Gods Must Be Crazy?"

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:09.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>> They call it n'um.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.000 align:middle line:84%
Virtually everyone has
a sense of this power.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.120 align:middle line:84%
These are folks who believe
in the existence of an energy

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.960 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.140 align:middle line:84%
And, of course, the
energy body is vital

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.530 align:middle line:84%
in the healing process, knowing
how the energy body actually

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.885 align:middle line:84%
functions in its relationship
with the physical body.

00:18:27.885 --> 00:18:29.510 align:middle line:84%
These are folks who
are very interested

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:30.860 align:middle line:90%
in alternative healing.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.770 align:middle line:90%
>> These are not weirdo people.

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:35.540 align:middle line:90%
These are professional people.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Highly educated people.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:39.470 align:middle line:84%
Many of them are in
positions of power--

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:44.240 align:middle line:84%
social, professional, political,
economic positions of power

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.970 align:middle line:84%
from which they can influence
the ideas and trends

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:48.590 align:middle line:90%
of the greater society.

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:84%
There is literally a
spiritual reawakening,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.430 align:middle line:90%
which is going on in the West.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:55.850 align:middle line:84%
And shamanism, amazingly,
is one of the major thrusts

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.410 align:middle line:90%
of this movement.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>> Shamanism talks about going
back and picking up pieces

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
of your soul that you seem to
have dropped along the way.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You want to talk
about soul loss--

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:11.765 align:middle line:84%
this is a very, very
interesting topic.

00:19:11.765 --> 00:19:14.630 align:middle line:90%


00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
In looking at the whole issue of
health and illness in healing,

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:20.360 align:middle line:84%
traditional people
have always recognized

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.180 align:middle line:84%
there are three classic
causes of illness.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.442 align:middle line:84%
The first of these
is disharmony.

00:19:25.442 --> 00:19:26.900 align:middle line:84%
Disharmony is what
happens when you

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.260 align:middle line:84%
lose your sense of connection
with or belonging to.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.500 align:middle line:90%
The second is fear.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.460 align:middle line:84%
It is not good for
you to walk around

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:84%
with a chronic sense of
fear gnawing away at you.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.310 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:40.640 align:middle line:84%
It depresses your immune
system and ability to function.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.030 align:middle line:84%
But the third, and most serious
diagnosis, is soul loss.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.520 align:middle line:90%
And here's something curious--

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.080 align:middle line:84%
soul loss is not
even mentioned in

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.780 align:middle line:90%
our Western medical textbooks.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.230 align:middle line:84%
In our society, soul loss
might be most easily understood

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.780 align:middle line:84%
in association
with trauma, where

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.595 align:middle line:84%
you have a traumatic experience,
where you fall off your bicycle

00:19:59.595 --> 00:20:02.180 align:middle line:84%
and you knock your front teeth
out or you break your arm

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.790 align:middle line:84%
or you have a
serious car accident

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:07.040 align:middle line:84%
or you have a very
abusive experience

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.000 align:middle line:84%
like a rape experience or
a molestation experience

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.980 align:middle line:84%
or some sort of emotional
or physical abuse.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:21.500 align:middle line:84%
The Vietnam War vets, the
Post Combat Traumatic Stress

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Syndrome is a
symptom of soul loss.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.870 align:middle line:84%
Soul loss is what happens
when the soul actually

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:31.100 align:middle line:84%
fragments and parts of
it dissociate and leave.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.570 align:middle line:84%
And they take the memory or the
pain of a traumatic experience

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:37.760 align:middle line:90%
with them when they leave.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, we might say,
where did they go?

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:90%
Good question.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.730 align:middle line:84%
This falls within the realm
of the traditional shaman.

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Who goes and gets it.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.833 align:middle line:84%
>> Traditional
Sherman's have always--

00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:49.250 align:middle line:84%
there have always
been individuals

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
in traditional societies
who were specialized

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:55.430 align:middle line:84%
in being able to track
those lost soul parts,

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.160 align:middle line:84%
find them, convince
them to return,

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.380 align:middle line:84%
and then bring them back to
the person who has lost them.

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Hank, can
anybody be a shaman?

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:84%
>> I've come to believe that
most of us have the ability,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.000 align:middle line:90%
at least to some extent.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But about 50% of us are
real naturals at it.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:17.740 align:middle line:10%
The value of a training program,
such as the workshops that I do

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.620 align:middle line:10%
or foundation programs
like Michael Harner does--

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.300 align:middle line:10%
the value of these
training programs

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.920 align:middle line:10%
is to get you in touch--

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.200 align:middle line:10%
to give you the method
of getting in touch

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.930 align:middle line:10%
with your spirits, your spirit
helpers, and your spirit

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.110 align:middle line:10%
teachers.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:10%
These are these inner
resources of wisdom and power

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.380 align:middle line:10%
that have always been there
for us ever since we were born.

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:37.390 align:middle line:10%
And they are ultimately
linked to our destiny

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.460 align:middle line:10%
and our personal life goals.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Once you're in touch with them,
they become your teachers.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And your training really
begins at that point.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Are they guardian angels?

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Are they the guardian angels
we heard about as a child?

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:49.510 align:middle line:90%
>> They can be.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.450 align:middle line:90%
They take that form.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Unbelievable.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:56.800 align:middle line:84%
Well, it has been a real
treat to have Dr. Hank
