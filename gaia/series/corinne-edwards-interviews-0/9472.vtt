[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.958 --> 00:00:31.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.775 align:middle line:10%
>> And I know my dreams.

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:34.400 align:middle line:10%
You could ask me any
one of those areas

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.440 align:middle line:10%
and I can rattle off the dreams.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.357 align:middle line:10%
Because I've not only
defined them in writing,

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:39.732 align:middle line:10%
I've really thought about
it, I've created my roadmaps,

00:00:39.732 --> 00:00:41.440 align:middle line:10%
and I'm on my way to
get to those dreams.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.540 align:middle line:10%
And it doesn't take
hours and hours a week.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.490 align:middle line:10%
It takes just a
little bit of time.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you really have
the impossible dream?

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.290 align:middle line:10%
One of my favorite authors
is here with us today,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.090 align:middle line:10%
and he says you can.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.700 align:middle line:10%
Steven Scott has
written a new book,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.450 align:middle line:10%
which is called simple "Simple
Steps to Impossible Dreams."

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:10%
He's the author of "The
Millionaire's Notebook."

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980 align:middle line:84%
And I'm dying for
you to meet him.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.658 align:middle line:84%
Steven, so happy to have
you back on the show.

00:01:09.658 --> 00:01:10.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I am happy to be back.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.200 align:middle line:90%
Thanks for having me.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Looking at you, you don't
look like a millionaire.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Good.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:90%
I hope not.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.370 align:middle line:84%
>> What does a
millionaire look like?

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.740 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't know, but I--

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.090 align:middle line:90%
this is very dressy for me.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.950 align:middle line:90%
Most of the time, I'm in jeans.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.700 align:middle line:90%
But I dress up for interviews.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that
impressed me the most when I

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.232 align:middle line:90%
first met you--

00:01:31.232 --> 00:01:32.690 align:middle line:84%
I interviewed you
a couple of years

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.590 align:middle line:84%
to go with your wonderful book
"The Millionaire's Notebook."

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.050 align:middle line:84%
>> And one of the things is
that you weren't left any money.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.050 align:middle line:10%
As a matter of fact, before
you were a millionaire,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.770 align:middle line:10%
you were a complete failure.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Exactly.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.240 align:middle line:10%
>> You want to tell people
about some of the jobs you had

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.220 align:middle line:10%
in case anyone out there is
worried about being a failure?

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.148 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't so much
a particular job,

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.440 align:middle line:90%
it was how many I went through.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
I went through nine
jobs in six years.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.630 align:middle line:84%
When I was in my
third job, which

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.320 align:middle line:84%
was working for an insurance
company, my boss-- a Harvard

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.952 align:middle line:84%
MBA-- called me into his
office and said, Steve,

00:02:08.952 --> 00:02:10.660 align:middle line:84%
you're the single
greatest disappointment

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.290 align:middle line:90%
in my entire career.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.350 align:middle line:84%
You will never
succeed in marketing.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.210 align:middle line:84%
You have 20 minutes to
clean out your desk.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.620 align:middle line:90%
And that was job number three.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.650 align:middle line:84%
I had six more jobs to lose
in the next four years.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.570 align:middle line:84%
And at 23, I really
believed him.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.040 align:middle line:84%
I thought, I'm
destined to failure.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.200 align:middle line:84%
I can't keep a job for
more than a few months.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.420 align:middle line:84%
I was earning less than
half the national average,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.760 align:middle line:90%
as far as income goes.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.720 align:middle line:84%
Yet on job number 10, we
started a company from scratch--

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.010 align:middle line:90%
myself and one other partner.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.980 align:middle line:90%
He had $5,000, I had an idea.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.460 align:middle line:84%
And we've turned it into 14
multimillion-dollar companies

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.490 align:middle line:84%
with over $1 billion
and a half in sales.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.430 align:middle line:84%
And looking back-- that
was over 20 years ago.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.270 align:middle line:84%
Looking back, I
began to explore what

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.790 align:middle line:84%
made the difference
between the first nine jobs

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and job number 10.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was basically 15
particular strategies

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.870 align:middle line:84%
that began to take
hold in my life

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.510 align:middle line:84%
and really have hold
on that 10th job,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.630 align:middle line:84%
and enabled me and my
partners to achieve

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
every one of our impossible
dreams professionally.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.060 align:middle line:84%
And at first I
thought, well, I'm

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.820 align:middle line:84%
probably the only one in the
world that's discovered this.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.940 align:middle line:84%
And then I met up with
a high school classmate.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.408 align:middle line:84%
I went to school with a kid
who was a D minus student.

00:03:22.408 --> 00:03:24.700 align:middle line:84%
He and I sat next to each
other at every football game,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.500 align:middle line:90%
as you know.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.640 align:middle line:90%
And he was in the band.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.590 align:middle line:90%
I was in the color guard.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.938 align:middle line:84%
Our combined weight was
about 220 pounds, most of--

00:03:31.938 --> 00:03:32.980 align:middle line:90%
>> You were nerds, right?

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.880 align:middle line:90%
>> We were nerds.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.777 align:middle line:90%
Most of our weight was acne.

00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:37.360 align:middle line:84%
The whole time we
were in high school,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.030 align:middle line:84%
we never asked a single girl
out from our high school,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:90%
because we were so shy.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.160 align:middle line:90%
And nobody knew who we were.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And yet 20 years later, when
I met up with Steven Spielberg

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.610 align:middle line:84%
at a restaurant, we
began to compare notes.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:84%
And we found out we did
the exact same things.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.560 align:middle line:84%
He did them in film, I
did them in business.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.020 align:middle line:84%
Later, I met a guy who became
one of my closest friends,

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.850 align:middle line:90%
a guy named Gene.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Gene graduated 299 out
of a class of 301--

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.460 align:middle line:84%
said the only people
that were lower than him

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.040 align:middle line:84%
on the totem pole couldn't
write their own names.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.110 align:middle line:84%
But got a track
scholarship to SC.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:90%
Lost it his freshman year.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Flunked out of college
his freshman year.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.840 align:middle line:84%
Was sleeping on park
benches in Santa Monica.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.878 align:middle line:84%
His first job was selling
blankets door to door.

00:04:16.878 --> 00:04:18.670 align:middle line:84%
Most of us don't buy
our blankets that way,

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.142 align:middle line:90%
so he failed at that one.

00:04:20.142 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:84%
But he went on to become the
single most successful writer,

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.120 align:middle line:84%
director, producer in
television history,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.110 align:middle line:84%
because he had a batting
average of 1,000.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.350 align:middle line:90%
100% of his shows were big hits.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:90%
His name became Michael Landon.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.460 align:middle line:84%
And as we compared
notes again, Mike

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.380 align:middle line:84%
did the same thing
Steve and I did.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:90%
Then I met Lee Iacocca.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:90%
Same thing.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.770 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you do?

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we began
using these strategies.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.070 align:middle line:84%
Basically, I compare
people to a rocket.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.672 align:middle line:84%
We're like the Saturn
V rocket, which

00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:47.380 align:middle line:84%
has these five massive
engines, but we've

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.630 align:middle line:90%
got seven massive engines.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.820 align:middle line:84%
But we're all held down
to the launching pad

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.623 align:middle line:90%
by six giant chains.

00:04:53.623 --> 00:04:55.540 align:middle line:84%
And what all of us had
done-- those of us that

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.123 align:middle line:84%
were achieving our
impossible dreams--

00:04:57.123 --> 00:04:59.050 align:middle line:84%
is we learned what
those chains were, we

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.760 align:middle line:84%
cut every one of
those chains, and then

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.050 align:middle line:90%
we simply ignited the engines.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.570 align:middle line:84%
We learned what the engines
were and ignited them.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.950 align:middle line:84%
And as I began to study
people throughout history--

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.230 align:middle line:84%
people like Clara Barton,
who created the American Red

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Cross, Helen Keller, even Mother
Teresa, who had some impossible

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.570 align:middle line:84%
dreams that she achieved,
Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Bill

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.150 align:middle line:90%
Gates, Sam Walton.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
They all had these
impossible dreams,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.250 align:middle line:84%
and like everybody else, were
held down to their launching

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.330 align:middle line:90%
pad by these six chains.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.400 align:middle line:84%
But they learned how
to cut the chains.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.340 align:middle line:84%
They learned how to ignite
these seven massive engines.

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:84%
And then achieving
their impossible dreams

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.370 align:middle line:84%
became almost a routine rather
than an exception for them.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
book focuses on.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.623 align:middle line:84%
>> But the one thing-- again,
there were many different.

00:05:43.623 --> 00:05:46.300 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to go through
some of the changes here.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.850 align:middle line:84%
But the first one that
comes to my mind--

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.720 align:middle line:84%
although there are
quite a few of them--

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.990 align:middle line:84%
is that we're afraid
we're going to fail.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.255 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:55.255 --> 00:05:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Fear of failure is
actually the second chain.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:84%
The first chain that
a person has to cut

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.500 align:middle line:84%
is, we've been programmed
for mediocrity.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:84%
We graduate from high
school, and if we

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.360 align:middle line:84%
weren't the homecoming king,
straight-A student, or the star

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
quarterback, we think
of ourselves as average,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.710 align:middle line:84%
a little bit above,
or a little bit below.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.350 align:middle line:84%
And from that point on,
we only set average goals,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:90%
because we don't want to fail.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.622 align:middle line:84%
>> And we hear this
programming as we grow up.

00:06:18.622 --> 00:06:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Like, "Who do you
think you are?"--

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.830 align:middle line:90%
We hear--

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:21.170 align:middle line:90%
>> --type of things.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.860 align:middle line:90%
But look at how we're judged.

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:90%
We're not popular.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.312 align:middle line:84%
So we're not only
judged by our peers

00:06:25.312 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and our teachers and our
parents by these three false

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.710 align:middle line:84%
standards-- grades,
athletics, and popularity--

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.790 align:middle line:90%
but we judge ourselves that way.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.930 align:middle line:84%
And so we really think that
the people who achieve--

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.790 align:middle line:90%
like Spielberg or Iacocca--

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:84%
or Oprah Winfrey is
another one that I studied.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.830 align:middle line:84%
We think that they're
exceptional people,

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:43.540 align:middle line:90%
that they're extraordinary.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Well, they achieve
extraordinary outcomes,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.690 align:middle line:84%
but their IQs aren't
off the charts.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.980 align:middle line:90%
They're not Einsteins.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:52.438 align:middle line:84%
Their family
backgrounds-- they all

00:06:52.438 --> 00:06:54.522 align:middle line:84%
didn't grow up with a
silver spoon in their mouth.

00:06:54.522 --> 00:06:56.860 align:middle line:84%
In fact, usually, they've
had pretty hard circumstances

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:57.700 align:middle line:90%
growing up.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.160 align:middle line:84%
But they learned some
very specific strategies

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.930 align:middle line:84%
and techniques and
begin to implement

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:90%
those in their daily lives.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.840 align:middle line:90%
Fear of failure is a huge chain.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.985 align:middle line:84%
We learn real early in
life that failure hurts,

00:07:10.985 --> 00:07:12.610 align:middle line:84%
so we do everything
we can to avoid it,

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.820 align:middle line:84%
including setting very
achievable, reachable goals.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the world
tells us that.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.330 align:middle line:84%
Even motivational
speakers say, only

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:21.307 align:middle line:84%
set achievable, reachable
goals, otherwise

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:90%
you'll frustrate yourself.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.530 align:middle line:90%
>> But you don't say that.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.010 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.000 align:middle line:90%
>> You say shoot for the moon.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:26.350 align:middle line:90%
You set impossible goals.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Every single dream that I
have is an impossible dream.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Same with Steven Spielberg.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.030 align:middle line:84%
Steve does not know how to
create a model of a dinosaur.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
If you put a gun to his head
and say, give me a dinosaur,

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.915 align:middle line:84%
and you've got 10 years
to build a good one,

00:07:39.915 --> 00:07:41.540 align:middle line:84%
you'd have to shoot
him after 10 years.

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:42.460 align:middle line:90%
He couldn't do it.

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.680 align:middle line:84%
If you put a gun to his
head and say, give me

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.920 align:middle line:84%
two great computerized special
effects, he couldn't do it.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.810 align:middle line:84%
Couldn't give you two,
much less hundreds

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.310 align:middle line:90%
that he needs in a film.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.650 align:middle line:84%
And yet he has an
impossible dream

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.810 align:middle line:84%
of creating a film that
is so realistic that, when

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.890 align:middle line:84%
you see those dinosaurs, and you
hear their feet hit the ground,

00:07:58.890 --> 00:07:59.690 align:middle line:90%
and--

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.448 align:middle line:90%
I mean, they'll terrify you.

00:08:01.448 --> 00:08:02.740 align:middle line:90%
Because it's really believable.

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:04.780 align:middle line:84%
And you worry about
the kids about

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.840 align:middle line:84%
to be caught in the
kitchen, and all that stuff.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.640 align:middle line:84%
How did he achieve
that impossible dream?

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, he ignited
engine number three,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.300 align:middle line:84%
which we'll get into
on the next show.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.920 align:middle line:84%
But engine number
three allowed him

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.805 align:middle line:84%
to recruit Stan Winston to make
his models and industrial light

00:08:18.805 --> 00:08:20.362 align:middle line:90%
and magic to make his effects.

00:08:20.362 --> 00:08:21.820 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
that, he gave us

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.730 align:middle line:84%
a film that was very
believable, that we really

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.950 align:middle line:84%
got into once we
were in the theater.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.710 align:middle line:10%
And that's how it is in
life, whether your dreams are

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.070 align:middle line:10%
to have a great marriage,
to be a great parent,

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.759 align:middle line:10%
or to achieve phenomenal
outcomes in business

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:10%
or in your career.

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:39.789 align:middle line:10%
Wherever those
dreams lie, you can

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.822 align:middle line:10%
achieve those dreams
when you cut the chains

00:08:42.822 --> 00:08:43.780 align:middle line:10%
and ignite the engines.

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:46.045 align:middle line:84%
And fear of failure
is one of the ones

00:08:46.045 --> 00:08:47.170 align:middle line:90%
you have to cut real early.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.240 align:middle line:90%
We give two techniques.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.240 align:middle line:10%
If you use those techniques,
you will cut it every time

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.145 align:middle line:10%
it raises its head,
and fear of failure

00:08:55.145 --> 00:08:56.770 align:middle line:10%
will never again have
to hold you down.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:57.830 align:middle line:10%
>> What are they?

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:58.630 align:middle line:10%
>> OK.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:02.080 align:middle line:10%
Well, number one, you
have to understand fear.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.610 align:middle line:90%
There's good fear and bad fear.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.250 align:middle line:90%
Most fear is bad fear.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.710 align:middle line:84%
Good fear keeps you
alive on the freeway--

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.510 align:middle line:90%
keeps you alert.

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.920 align:middle line:90%
It keeps pilots alive.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.290 align:middle line:84%
It keeps doctors from
making major mistakes.

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:16.560 align:middle line:90%
Bad fear paralyzes you.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:90%
It keeps you from taking action.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And throughout life, we
have a lot of this bad fear,

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:84%
so we don't take the
action we need to take.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:26.470 align:middle line:84%
So the first thing we do is, we
show a technique that shows you

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:30.290 align:middle line:84%
how to assess the true
perspective of something you

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.090 align:middle line:90%
fear.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:33.160 align:middle line:84%
What's the absolute
worst that can happen?

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:90%
And you write that down--

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.743 align:middle line:90%
if you fail.

00:09:35.743 --> 00:09:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Then we have you write
down, on the other side

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.300 align:middle line:84%
of the table, what's the best
thing that's going to happen

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.510 align:middle line:90%
if there is no failure?

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.927 align:middle line:84%
What's the best
thing you're going

00:09:42.927 --> 00:09:44.410 align:middle line:90%
to achieve in that situation?

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.180 align:middle line:10%
You go, wow, look at what
I can do if I don't fail.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.572 align:middle line:84%
Then we say, OK, what's
the likely scenario?

00:09:49.572 --> 00:09:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, the likely
scenario is, there might

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.405 align:middle line:90%
be a little bit of failure.

00:09:52.405 --> 00:09:54.000 align:middle line:84%
Here are some
consequences of that.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.290 align:middle line:84%
And I might not hit
this kind of success,

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.640 align:middle line:90%
but I'm going to hit in between.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.723 align:middle line:84%
Well, even when you look
at that, all of a sudden,

00:09:59.723 --> 00:10:01.480 align:middle line:90%
the failure isn't that big.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.200 align:middle line:84%
It used to be great
big in your mind.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.117 align:middle line:84%
Now, you've brought it
right into perspective.

00:10:05.117 --> 00:10:06.075 align:middle line:90%
You say, you know what?

00:10:06.075 --> 00:10:07.670 align:middle line:84%
That's a risk I'm
willing to take.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.170 align:middle line:84%
And that's in my
marriage, whatever.

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:12.460 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, women
will be afraid to confront

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.710 align:middle line:84%
their husbands on something
that's really hurting them

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:16.668 align:middle line:84%
because they think, oh,
he'll just ridicule me.

00:10:16.668 --> 00:10:17.500 align:middle line:90%
He'll say no.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:17.680 align:middle line:90%
This--

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:18.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Or he'll leave.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:19.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Well-- or he'll leave.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.550 align:middle line:90%
That's a really big one, but--

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Or he'll get mad.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:22.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Get mad.

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.000 align:middle line:90%
That's enough.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.600 align:middle line:84%
Rejection, criticism,
withdrawal.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.820 align:middle line:10%
Those are all scary things.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.570 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm afraid you're
not going to like me.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:28.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:29.520 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.590 align:middle line:84%
So what they do is,
they don't communicate.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.610 align:middle line:84%
And so what they have to do
is, we put that in perspective.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.788 align:middle line:90%
And we show that fear.

00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:40.580 align:middle line:84%
And then they're not
afraid to communicate.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:43.163 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's the worst thing-- you
think of the worst thing that

00:10:43.163 --> 00:10:47.080 align:middle line:84%
can happen as a result of
whatever you're going to do.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.740 align:middle line:10%
And then you say,
I can handle that.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:49.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.028 align:middle line:10%
Once you've balanced it out
with what the opportunity is.

00:10:52.028 --> 00:10:53.320 align:middle line:10%
But that's the first technique.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.945 align:middle line:84%
There's a second
technique we get into.

00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:56.450 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, we'll be right back.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.240 align:middle line:84%
We're talking to
Steven Scott here

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.120 align:middle line:84%
about his wonderful new book
about impossible dreams.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.160 align:middle line:90%
You can get them for yourself.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.460 align:middle line:84%
The name of the book is "Simple
Steps to Impossible Dreams."

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.260 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.760 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
miss a word of it.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.875 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:10.875 --> 00:11:22.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.300 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to
Steven Scott here

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.535 align:middle line:10%
about his wonderful book "Simple
Steps to Impossible Dreams."

00:11:28.535 --> 00:11:31.620 align:middle line:10%
And we're talking about a
topic that affects most of us,

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.010 align:middle line:10%
and that is fear of failure.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.310 align:middle line:90%
Steven, welcome back.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:40.860 align:middle line:84%
>> When you talk about fear,
you said there were two steps.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And the first one was
facing the inevitable.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.540 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it was--

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:45.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Can I handle it?

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:45.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.667 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was putting fear
in its proper perspective.

00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:10%
Because a lot of times,
fear is magnified to us.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So we have to balance that
against the opportunity

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:56.300 align:middle line:84%
and the likelihood of
what mixture of that fear

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.202 align:middle line:84%
and opportunity the true
likelihood is going to be.

00:11:59.202 --> 00:12:00.410 align:middle line:90%
And we show you how to do it.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Once you do it, it takes
away fear 90% of the time.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:06.140 align:middle line:90%
The other thing that we do--

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.143 align:middle line:84%
nobody fears a
wonderful teacher.

00:12:08.143 --> 00:12:10.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if you think back
to your high school years,

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.470 align:middle line:84%
or college years,
even grade school,

00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.900 align:middle line:84%
we all had at least one
teacher that was really good.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.180 align:middle line:90%
And we didn't fear that teacher.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:19.100 align:middle line:84%
The key of getting
over fear of failure

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.140 align:middle line:84%
is learning how
to make failure--

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:23.360 align:middle line:90%
your past failures-- a teacher.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is, we
have people revisit some

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.260 align:middle line:90%
of their most hurtful failures.

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.600 align:middle line:84%
With me, I had a
failed first marriage.

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And as I was getting
ready to get married

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.477 align:middle line:84%
for the second time,
eight years ago,

00:12:34.477 --> 00:12:36.810 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to make sure I didn't
repeat the same mistakes.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.120 align:middle line:90%
So I revisited that marriage.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.620 align:middle line:84%
I looked at all of
the reasons it failed.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I applied those
reasons to the new marriage

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.182 align:middle line:90%
that was about to happen.

00:12:44.182 --> 00:12:45.140 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK, I did this.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:45.530 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.340 align:middle line:90%
I did that.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:90%
Now, I don't want to repeat it.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.210 align:middle line:90%
Failure became a teacher.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.430 align:middle line:84%
The more we do that with
some of our major failures

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.590 align:middle line:84%
that we've had in life,
then all of a sudden,

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.860 align:middle line:84%
it becomes a teacher rather
than a dreaded enemy.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.810 align:middle line:90%
And then we no longer fear it.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.440 align:middle line:84%
And failure, as it turns out, is
one of the most critical steps

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.610 align:middle line:90%
to extraordinary success.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.105 align:middle line:84%
And one of the reasons that
Spielberg and Steve Scott,

00:13:08.105 --> 00:13:10.550 align:middle line:84%
and Lee Iacocca, and
some of the other--

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.140 align:middle line:90%
Sam Walton, who created Walmart.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.780 align:middle line:84%
The reason we achieved
the kind of success

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:16.430 align:middle line:84%
in pursuing our
dreams is because we

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.900 align:middle line:84%
went through lots of
failures and learned

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.810 align:middle line:90%
how to deal with it.

00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:20.060 align:middle line:84%
So that's just one
of the chains we have

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:20.660 align:middle line:90%
to cut-- one of the six chains.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.420 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's really true, because
I think most people do not

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.080 align:middle line:90%
learn from their successes.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.880 align:middle line:10%
>> No.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Success teaches
you almost nothing.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.040 align:middle line:84%
It builds your
arrogance and pride,

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.080 align:middle line:84%
and makes you almost
blind to truth, sometimes.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:35.270 align:middle line:10%
But failure, if
you won't run away

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.620 align:middle line:10%
from it-- which most people do.

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:37.210 align:middle line:90%
If you really--

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Say, where is
the lesson here.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:38.795 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:13:38.795 --> 00:13:39.320 align:middle line:90%
And write it down.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.550 align:middle line:90%
>> Why was this in my life?

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.515 align:middle line:90%
>> Write it down.

00:13:41.515 --> 00:13:42.890 align:middle line:84%
And the people
that were involved

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.420 align:middle line:84%
in that failure
with you oftentimes

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.837 align:middle line:84%
will have insights
you don't have.

00:13:45.837 --> 00:13:48.173 align:middle line:84%
So you can't just say, OK,
why do I think it failed?

00:13:48.173 --> 00:13:50.090 align:middle line:84%
You go back to other
people that were involved

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.590 align:middle line:84%
and say, why do
you think I failed?

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.132 align:middle line:84%
And they'll come up with ideas
that you didn't even think of.

00:13:54.132 --> 00:13:55.280 align:middle line:90%
And you write those down.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden,
wisdom begins to build.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.780 align:middle line:84%
And that wisdom ensures
your success in the future,

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.005 align:middle line:84%
and really counteracts the
possibility of future failure.

00:14:05.005 --> 00:14:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>> You say--
speaking of failure,

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.580 align:middle line:84%
one of the things we hate
most in life is criticism.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:09.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.760 align:middle line:84%
That's another
one of the chains.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.560 align:middle line:90%
>> And-- I know.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.500 align:middle line:90%
And you said, welcome it.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.258 align:middle line:90%
But it's hard to do it.

00:14:15.258 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:90%
It's one thing to say it.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.517 align:middle line:90%
It's another thing to do it.

00:14:17.517 --> 00:14:19.538 align:middle line:10%
Because criticism
always hurts, even--

00:14:19.538 --> 00:14:21.080 align:middle line:10%
I mentioned in the
book that it never

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.290 align:middle line:10%
ceases to amaze me,
the power of mothers

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.390 align:middle line:10%
over their adult
daughters, even.

00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:28.025 align:middle line:84%
They'll say a simple
criticism and it

00:14:28.025 --> 00:14:29.600 align:middle line:90%
will wipe the daughter out.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, we teach a technique that
takes the power of criticism

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:34.933 align:middle line:90%
to hurt you away forever.

00:14:34.933 --> 00:14:36.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Stephen
Covey-- who wrote

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.570 align:middle line:84%
"7 Habits of Highly
Successful People,"

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle line:84%
when he endorsed the
book, he made the comment

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.590 align:middle line:84%
that the insights
on criticism alone

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.210 align:middle line:90%
made the book worth the read.

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.220 align:middle line:84%
And we show you one
technique that, when

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
you begin to use that
technique, it not only

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.740 align:middle line:84%
takes all the pain of
criticism away forever--

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:84%
you never have to be
hurt by criticism again--

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:57.620 align:middle line:84%
but it also shows you how to
mine that criticism for gold.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.420 align:middle line:84%
So instead of being
a dreaded enemy,

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.880 align:middle line:90%
it becomes a real valued ally.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.800 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real
simple technique.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.320 align:middle line:84%
You can use it with
criticism from your spouse,

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.000 align:middle line:84%
from your friends,
from your boss.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Doesn't matter
where it comes from.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:84%
You can all of a
sudden turn criticism

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.100 align:middle line:90%
into a wonderful friend.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.900 align:middle line:90%
>> So?

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:14.180 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:15.200 align:middle line:90%
What is that technique?

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, I'll tell you a story
that I tell in the book.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.077 align:middle line:84%
A man and woman walked
into a pet shop one day,

00:15:21.077 --> 00:15:22.160 align:middle line:90%
and they were all excited.

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:24.870 align:middle line:84%
It's Saturday morning, they were
going to go look for a new dog.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.200 align:middle line:84%
And as they walk
into the pet store,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.552 align:middle line:84%
there's a parrot
sitting on a perch.

00:15:29.552 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And this parrot
goes, "Hey, buddy!"

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.650 align:middle line:90%
The guy goes, "Yeah?"

00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:35.810 align:middle line:84%
And the parrot goes, "You're
stupid and your wife's ugly!"

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.670 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, "Excuse me?"

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:39.560 align:middle line:84%
I said, "You're stupid
and your wife's ugly!"

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the wife, she's
a little overweight.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.517 align:middle line:90%
She instantly starts crying.

00:15:42.517 --> 00:15:43.500 align:middle line:90%
The man's furious.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.342 align:middle line:84%
He finds the manager of
the store and he said,

00:15:46.342 --> 00:15:48.050 align:middle line:84%
I can't believe what
your bird just said.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:49.967 align:middle line:84%
He called my wife ugly
and he said I'm stupid.

00:15:49.967 --> 00:15:52.520 align:middle line:84%
And he goes, the manager says,
oh, did he do that again?

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.502 align:middle line:90%
And he goes, yeah.

00:15:53.502 --> 00:15:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Well, the manager puts
on this big, long glove,

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.380 align:middle line:90%
goes over, grabs the parrot.

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.460 align:middle line:90%
Bam, bam, bam.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.577 align:middle line:90%
Just slaps it silly.

00:16:00.577 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:84%
And the man and his wife
feel a little vindicated.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.480 align:middle line:84%
So they look around for
their dog and don't find it.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.850 align:middle line:84%
They started to walk
out of the door.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:10.520 align:middle line:84%
And on their way out, the
parrot goes, "Hey, buddy."

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:11.960 align:middle line:90%
And the guy goes, "Yeah?"

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.410 align:middle line:10%
He goes, "You know."

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.110 align:middle line:90%
Now, the point of the story.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:19.023 align:middle line:84%
Well, the parrot was
smarter than the people.

00:16:19.023 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:84%
You see, the parrot had given
them a criticism-- actually,

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.970 align:middle line:90%
two criticisms.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And what they didn't do is,
they didn't respond correctly.

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.303 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we teach
is, consider the source.

00:16:30.303 --> 00:16:31.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, in this case,
it was only a parrot.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.320 align:middle line:84%
What does a parrot know
about intelligence or beauty?

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.830 align:middle line:90%
Nothing.

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:35.630 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So the criticism
was totally invalid.

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
We say, when you
consider the source,

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.838 align:middle line:84%
you also consider
the motivation.

00:16:41.838 --> 00:16:43.380 align:middle line:84%
What's their expertise
or motivation?

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.810 align:middle line:84%
When that former boss might--
even though he was a Harvard

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:49.200 align:middle line:84%
MBA, even though he was a senior
vice president of marketing,

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.560 align:middle line:84%
when he told me, you will
never succeed in marketing,

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.960 align:middle line:90%
he didn't have a crystal ball.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.088 align:middle line:90%
He wasn't a good source.

00:16:56.088 --> 00:16:58.380 align:middle line:84%
There's no way he could be
accurate on that projection.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.440 align:middle line:84%
I ended up making
literally hundreds

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.440 align:middle line:90%
of millions of dollars--

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:04.410 align:middle line:84%
and, in fact, billions
of dollars in sales--

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.963 align:middle line:84%
based on my talents
in marketing,

00:17:05.963 --> 00:17:07.380 align:middle line:84%
and he said I would
never succeed.

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:08.180 align:middle line:90%
So he was wrong.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.763 align:middle line:84%
Because he didn't
have a crystal ball.

00:17:09.763 --> 00:17:11.910 align:middle line:84%
So first thing you do is,
you consider the source.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.020 align:middle line:90%
You consider their motivation.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, his motivation was,
he just wanted to hurt me.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.220 align:middle line:84%
He knew he was going
to fire me, and it

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.470 align:middle line:90%
wasn't good enough to fire me.

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:20.430 align:middle line:90%
He wanted to hurt me.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.151 align:middle line:90%


00:17:23.151 --> 00:17:25.109 align:middle line:84%
A lot of times, though,
the motivation is love.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:27.569 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes people will criticize
us because they really love us.

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:28.369 align:middle line:90%
They care about us.

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:30.497 align:middle line:90%
They want us to succeed.

00:17:30.497 --> 00:17:31.830 align:middle line:90%
But we consider that motivation.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:36.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, criticism is like a bucket
of water that's thrown on you.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:37.145 align:middle line:90%
It's mainly water.

00:17:37.145 --> 00:17:39.270 align:middle line:84%
Water can't kill you when
it's thrown in your face,

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.633 align:middle line:90%
but it's shocking, it's cold.

00:17:40.633 --> 00:17:43.050 align:middle line:84%
You want to dry it off and get
it off as quick as you can,

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:44.710 align:middle line:90%
because it's uncomfortable.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:47.203 align:middle line:84%
That's the exaggeration
in criticism.

00:17:47.203 --> 00:17:48.870 align:middle line:84%
You're the single
biggest disappointment

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.700 align:middle line:90%
in my entire career.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.220 align:middle line:90%
That's exaggeration.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.520 align:middle line:90%
I was only 23 years old.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.358 align:middle line:84%
He was a huge boss
in this big company.

00:17:56.358 --> 00:17:57.900 align:middle line:84%
There's no way I
could be the biggest

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.395 align:middle line:90%
disappointment in his career.

00:17:59.395 --> 00:18:00.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's the exaggeration.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:90%
That's the water.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.940 align:middle line:84%
Next we have the sand-- a little
bit of sand in that bucket.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:05.533 align:middle line:90%
That's the stinging part.

00:18:05.533 --> 00:18:06.450 align:middle line:90%
That gets in our eyes.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:11.880 align:middle line:10%
That's basically the intent
to hurt that sometimes

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.520 align:middle line:10%
goes with the
criticism, or the part

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:17.005 align:middle line:10%
that just-- if a person
says-- if a husband says,

00:18:17.005 --> 00:18:18.630 align:middle line:10%
you've got to watch
what you're eating.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.940 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if we should
be having those desserts

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:21.780 align:middle line:90%
right now.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.703 align:middle line:90%
That stings.

00:18:22.703 --> 00:18:23.870 align:middle line:90%
Because he's-- it's saying--

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.960 align:middle line:90%
>> He's calling you fat.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:26.860 align:middle line:90%
I don't like the way you look.

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:27.100 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.260 align:middle line:90%
And that stings?

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:29.100 align:middle line:90%
But it's only sand.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.390 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't kill you.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:32.340 align:middle line:90%
Now comes the good part.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.820 align:middle line:84%
In every bucket of
water of criticism,

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:38.130 align:middle line:84%
there is anything from a
little tiny flake of gold

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.470 align:middle line:84%
to sometimes giant
golden nuggets.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.200 align:middle line:84%
So we have to mine that
criticism for gold.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.822 align:middle line:84%
Now, in the case of my
boss, I thought, OK,

00:18:45.822 --> 00:18:47.280 align:middle line:84%
why does he want
to hurt me so bad?

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.785 align:middle line:84%
Number one, he sensed
disloyalty on my part

00:18:49.785 --> 00:18:50.910 align:middle line:90%
for some things I had done.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.577 align:middle line:84%
Number two, he sensed
I had never really

00:18:52.577 --> 00:18:54.660 align:middle line:90%
been focused on my job.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.770 align:middle line:10%
Those were the gold nuggets
I took out of the criticism,

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.340 align:middle line:10%
applied them to the next
job, and did a lot better

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.140 align:middle line:10%
in the next job.

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.750 align:middle line:10%
Because I was more loyal and
I focused on the job better.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.460 align:middle line:10%
In the case of the
woman who's been told,

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:08.110 align:middle line:10%
we'd better not eat
desserts, the gold is, hey,

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.910 align:middle line:10%
you know what?

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.600 align:middle line:90%
I know I'm a little overweight.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.790 align:middle line:90%
I do need to do something.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:84%
I need to start taking it
seriously-- for my health,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
not just because I
want to look better.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.930 align:middle line:84%
But I do want that too, but
I want to be in better shape.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.950 align:middle line:84%
So that's a little bit
of the gold we can take.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:25.530 align:middle line:84%
And when we focus on the
gold and we convert that gold

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.435 align:middle line:84%
into specific goals,
then all of a sudden

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:30.060 align:middle line:84%
that criticism becomes
our best friend,

00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and becomes a springboard
into achieving something

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.747 align:middle line:90%
we really want to achieve.

00:19:33.747 --> 00:19:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>> So look for the nugget.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Look for the nugget.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.910 align:middle line:84%
And if you do that exercise on
every criticism you have that

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.680 align:middle line:84%
hurts you, you'll
find those nuggets.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.650 align:middle line:84%
And then you're no
longer in the sand,

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:45.960 align:middle line:84%
and the sand doesn't
sting anymore,

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.490 align:middle line:84%
and the water isn't
uncomfortable anymore.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:49.290 align:middle line:90%
Those are gone.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Talking about goals here,
I always thought, well,

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.630 align:middle line:90%
you just meditate on your goal.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.060 align:middle line:90%
You say, no.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.310 align:middle line:90%
You have got to write it down.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:57.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.200 align:middle line:90%
>> Why?

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.075 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, because you
don't really believe it.

00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
If I said, I want you to
take a trip from Chicago

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:04.800 align:middle line:90%
to Los Angeles.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And I say, in fact, I want you
to go to Dick Clark's house.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.780 align:middle line:90%
He's a good friend of mine.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.580 align:middle line:90%
And you say, great.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:12.038 align:middle line:84%
And I say, hey,
when you get there,

00:20:12.038 --> 00:20:13.860 align:middle line:84%
Dick will hand you a
check for $100,000.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:15.390 align:middle line:84%
You've got to be
there in a week--

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.960 align:middle line:90%
or two weeks.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.920 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you two
weeks to get there.

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.190 align:middle line:90%
And say, great.

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:20.820 align:middle line:84%
I say, but you can't
have any atlas.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.120 align:middle line:90%
You can't have a road map.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.813 align:middle line:84%
You can't have Dick's
street address.

00:20:24.813 --> 00:20:25.980 align:middle line:90%
But you've got to get there.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:28.080 align:middle line:84%
And you can't ask
anybody for directions.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
Now, all of a sudden,
hey, it's nice.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.920 align:middle line:84%
You know he's in
California somewhere,

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.840 align:middle line:84%
but LA alone has 3,500
square miles of houses.

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:36.090 align:middle line:90%
How are you going to find him?

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.620 align:middle line:84%
How are you even going to
get there in the first place

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.640 align:middle line:90%
without a map?

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.810 align:middle line:90%
With some nice feeling?

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.940 align:middle line:84%
Well, I know it's that way, so
I'll just work my way there.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.250 align:middle line:90%
It will never happen.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.920 align:middle line:84%
You've got to have your
destination defined.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.490 align:middle line:10%
So we teach you a process called
the dream conversion process,

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.200 align:middle line:10%
where you define each
dream in writing.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.280 align:middle line:90%
And it's not pages.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.520 align:middle line:84%
It's simply-- a sentence or
a single paragraph will do.

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.510 align:middle line:90%
But you define that in writing.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:84%
And then, when you convert that
dream, through this process,

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.060 align:middle line:90%
into specific goals--

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.630 align:middle line:84%
each goal in the steps,
each step in the tasks,

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.010 align:middle line:84%
and you put a target
date for each task--

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.052 align:middle line:84%
you now have a detailed
roadmap to get to that dream.

00:21:11.052 --> 00:21:13.260 align:middle line:84%
So instead of just being
something that floats around

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:17.010 align:middle line:84%
up there that you're meditating
on, you have a destination,

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.530 align:middle line:84%
you have a map, you
have a schedule.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:21.720 align:middle line:84%
Now you just start to
click off the miles.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.180 align:middle line:84%
And instead of achieving 1
out of 1,000 dreams that you

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.960 align:middle line:84%
have in your lifetime, you end
up achieving 900 out of 1,000,

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.790 align:middle line:84%
no matter how
impossible they are.

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:31.298 align:middle line:84%
But that's just
engine number one.

00:21:31.298 --> 00:21:33.090 align:middle line:84%
There are six engines
you've got to ignite.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.733 align:middle line:84%
But that's a really
important one.

00:21:34.733 --> 00:21:36.150 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an important
one, I think,

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:41.820 align:middle line:84%
because I think that the
universe gets confused about

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.467 align:middle line:84%
what we want unless
we get very clear.

00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:46.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, one of the
things that I do--

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:52.290 align:middle line:84%
when I speak to big audiences,
I'll say, what are your dreams?

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.930 align:middle line:84%
And do you know, if I talk to
an audience of 1,000 people,

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.170 align:middle line:90%
I'll get 999 blank looks.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:00.630 align:middle line:10%
They all have dreams, but
they haven't defined them.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.030 align:middle line:84%
If you were to ask me,
what are my dreams?

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.160 align:middle line:84%
I would say, OK, in
which area of my life?

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.230 align:middle line:90%
My relationship with my wife?

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.630 align:middle line:84%
My relationship with
my six children?

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:90%
My job?

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:90%
Particular projects on my job?

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:15.600 align:middle line:84%
Because I have my dreams
defined in all of those areas.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.570 align:middle line:84%
>> The nice thing about
your book is that it's not--

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:84%
when you talk about
successful people here,

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.600 align:middle line:84%
you're not talking
about business only.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.400 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.310 align:middle line:84%
>> You're saying, define
your dreams in every area

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:28.180 align:middle line:84%
of your life, and then
you can have them.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:28.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.200 align:middle line:10%
For me, my most important
areas in life-- number one

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.310 align:middle line:10%
is my relationship with God.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.977 align:middle line:10%
Number two is my
relationship with wife.

00:22:33.977 --> 00:22:36.910 align:middle line:10%
Business is number four, even
though it's important to me.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.750 align:middle line:84%
So if I succeed in my
dreams in my business

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:84%
and I fail in those first two
areas, then I fail in life.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we've had a
wonderful time here.
