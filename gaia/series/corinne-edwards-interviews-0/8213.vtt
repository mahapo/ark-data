00:00:01.992 --> 00:00:28.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.190 align:middle line:84%
>> There is a new species of
human that's being birthed

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.330 align:middle line:90%
at this time.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.730 align:middle line:10%
We might look the
same on the outside.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.400 align:middle line:10%
The DNA is changing
on the inside.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.820 align:middle line:10%
And with that change, we
have tremendously enhanced

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.270 align:middle line:10%
immune systems.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.300 align:middle line:10%
We have cells that
regenerate over 100 times

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.120 align:middle line:10%
faster than we've
ever seen before.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.570 align:middle line:10%
And it appears that
this change of DNA

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.300 align:middle line:10%
is in response to
the great challenges

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.820 align:middle line:10%
that this time in
history is offering us.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.270 align:middle line:10%
>> If you're like me, you've
been very confused lately

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.599 align:middle line:10%
because you look at
programs about UFOs,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:10%
you hear predictions from all
kinds of psychics that are

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.720 align:middle line:10%
in the papers that say the world
is going to change dramatically

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:10%
and it could happen
like any minute.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.270 align:middle line:84%
We've heard that Denver
may be a beach town.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:90%
And we're all scared.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.000 align:middle line:90%
But we have help for you today.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.820 align:middle line:84%
We have a very important
author by the name

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.780 align:middle line:84%
of Gregg Braden, who has
written a book called

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.960 align:middle line:90%
"Walking Between the Worlds."

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.760 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.468 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a pleasure to
be here, thank you.

00:01:36.468 --> 00:01:42.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Greg, I think the subtitle
of your book is an interesting

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.400 align:middle line:90%
subtitle.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.580 align:middle line:84%
You say it is the
science of compassion.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.970 align:middle line:84%
As I began developing
this information,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.290 align:middle line:90%
I had a lot of questions.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.210 align:middle line:84%
People and audiences
would ask me,

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.420 align:middle line:84%
how can you use the words
science and compassion

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.860 align:middle line:90%
in the same sentence?

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.460 align:middle line:10%
Because for so many people
in recent times in the west,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.840 align:middle line:10%
compassion is this
nebulous concept that

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.870 align:middle line:10%
sometimes eludes our grasp.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:84%
And what I've found, this book,
"The Science of Compassion"

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.255 align:middle line:84%
is a very small piece of a much
broader body of information

00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:21.350 align:middle line:84%
that apparently was very
well known until about 1,700

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
years ago, when tremendous
amounts of information

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.390 align:middle line:90%
were lost in the west.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And prior to 1,700
years ago, compassion

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.270 align:middle line:84%
was considered what
today we call a science.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.450 align:middle line:90%
>> So it's not pity.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.260 align:middle line:90%
>> It is not pity.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:10%
Webster's dictionary today,
this is very interesting for me,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.970 align:middle line:10%
as I was pulling this
information together,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.240 align:middle line:10%
defines compassion as
a quality of sympathy

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:10%
that we offer to others
in times of need.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.830 align:middle line:90%
That's a present day definition.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.550 align:middle line:84%
That is very, very
different than the kinds

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.850 align:middle line:84%
of compassion that were
demonstrated by the ancients,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.360 align:middle line:84%
such as the ancient Essenes, the
authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.490 align:middle line:90%
and the shores of the Dead Sea.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:07.290 align:middle line:84%
For them, compassion was
a much broader concept.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Rather than something
that you do upon occasion,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.300 align:middle line:84%
such as having this
pity, it was something

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.860 align:middle line:90%
that one would become.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Rather than doing
the compassion,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.460 align:middle line:84%
they would live the
compassion day in and day

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.810 align:middle line:90%
out in their lives.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this just like the
Buddhists that talk about

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.210 align:middle line:90%
compassion?

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:84%
>> This is, what a
beautiful question.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.390 align:middle line:10%
It's very interesting,
because there are certainly

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.590 align:middle line:10%
Buddhist sounding concepts
of the many different ways

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.300 align:middle line:10%
that we may define compassion.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.110 align:middle line:84%
One way derived through
these ancient texts

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.050 align:middle line:84%
is that compassion is a union
of thought, feeling and emotion.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.273 align:middle line:84%
These are the three
qualities identified

00:03:47.273 --> 00:03:48.315 align:middle line:90%
in the ancient tradition.

00:03:48.315 --> 00:03:49.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Say that again.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Allow us.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.012 align:middle line:84%
Well, they allow us this
experience in our world.

00:03:52.012 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:90%
Thought, feeling and emotion.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:55.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Emotion.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.550 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, and from the
perspective of the ancients,

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.150 align:middle line:84%
pre 1,700 years ago, it's
through these qualities

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.990 align:middle line:84%
of thought, feeling and emotion
that we experience this waking

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:90%
dream that we call life.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.760 align:middle line:84%
In the presence of one another,
we share this time together.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Seems very real to us.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:13.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it is very real.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.519 align:middle line:84%
And from their
perspective, and compassion

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.630 align:middle line:84%
was a quality of each of those,
a thought without attachment

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.460 align:middle line:90%
to the outcome of the thought.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.230 align:middle line:84%
It is a very Buddhist concept,
it sounds very Buddhist.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
In other words, trusting
in the process of life

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.360 align:middle line:84%
with discernment as we move
through the process of life.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Feeling without
distorted feeling.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.918 align:middle line:84%
So many of our
feelings, the question

00:04:39.918 --> 00:04:42.460 align:middle line:84%
is do we even really know what
our feelings are saying to us.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.560 align:middle line:84%
Are we so conditioned through
the filters of the experiences

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.418 align:middle line:84%
in our lives that
our feelings become,

00:04:51.418 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:84%
begun to say something
very different to us

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:84%
today than they
have in the past.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Greg, what have you
got to do here now,

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.300 align:middle line:90%
the science of compassion?

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.240 align:middle line:84%
What has this got to do
with our being frightened

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
about the whole state of
California being swept

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.220 align:middle line:84%
into the ocean and Denver
being, Montana being a boundary

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.510 align:middle line:90%
of some of the predictions?

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.270 align:middle line:84%
What does that
got to do with it?

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, from the perspective
of the ancients, and again,

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.630 align:middle line:84%
context is so
important, Corinne,

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.840 align:middle line:84%
those who are hearing those
predictions in a void,

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.700 align:middle line:84%
without a broader context
within which to understand them,

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.060 align:middle line:84%
certainly there's
fear and uncertainty.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.820 align:middle line:84%
Within a broader
perspective, almost

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.740 align:middle line:84%
universally, ancient
traditions remind us

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.190 align:middle line:84%
that this is a unique,
rare, precious moment

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.570 align:middle line:84%
in human history where
something unprecedented is

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.570 align:middle line:84%
about to unfold within the
lives of every human living

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:90%
in this world.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.970 align:middle line:84%
And in that something,
we have this opportunity

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.130 align:middle line:84%
to redefine the
parameters of our lives

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.430 align:middle line:84%
and how we respond to the
great challenges of life.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
So for so many people, I'm
sure you see them on your show

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:84%
and I see them in
my programs, they're

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.730 align:middle line:84%
experiencing the
greatest challenges

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.880 align:middle line:84%
that they've ever experienced of
health and emotion and finance.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.620 align:middle line:84%
And statistics tell
us precisely that.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.260 align:middle line:84%
That we are experiencing
the greatest challenges ever

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.880 align:middle line:90%
of human history.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.490 align:middle line:84%
Compassion, the
science of compassion,

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.640 align:middle line:84%
is an opportunity
to redefine what

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:84%
those parameters, what those
challenges in our lives

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.660 align:middle line:90%
mean to us.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.910 align:middle line:84%
On the one hand, now to
answer your question,

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.810 align:middle line:84%
on the other hand, new
research is demonstrating

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.890 align:middle line:84%
that the way that we you think,
feel and emote in here actually

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.700 align:middle line:84%
has an impact on the way
the world unfolds out there.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.070 align:middle line:84%
And that is an awesome, awesome
statement to able to make.

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:48.930 align:middle line:84%
>> So my girlfriend,
for example,

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.110 align:middle line:84%
sold everything
she had in Chicago,

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.310 align:middle line:84%
because this is one of the
areas she said is at great risk.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.917 align:middle line:84%
She moved to New Mexico, bought
100 acres up in the mountains,

00:06:59.917 --> 00:07:01.250 align:middle line:90%
so she's not going to die there.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.270 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.148 align:middle line:84%
It's also inspiring
a lot of fear.

00:07:07.148 --> 00:07:08.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The question is,
it's a very good point.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The question is, what is
the intent of the move?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.965 align:middle line:84%
And I'll share with
you an example.

00:07:12.965 --> 00:07:14.840 align:middle line:84%
In the early '90s there
were many predictions

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.230 align:middle line:84%
that northern California,
San Francisco, for example,

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.900 align:middle line:84%
would see some great Earth
changes with a lot of water

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.920 align:middle line:90%
inundating the landmass.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.670 align:middle line:84%
There's a gentleman
in one of our programs

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:84%
that was afraid of
dying in a flood

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.270 align:middle line:90%
and losing everything he owned.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:84%
So he moved that year, 1993,
he moved to northern Missouri

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.730 align:middle line:84%
very close to the shores,
the Missouri River.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.200 align:middle line:84%
In 1993 the Midwest
saw the worst floods

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.550 align:middle line:90%
that they've ever seen.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.160 align:middle line:84%
He lost everything
he had to a flood.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.500 align:middle line:84%
And it reminds us of the tenant
that we all already understand,

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.540 align:middle line:84%
that the patterns follow
us wherever we go.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Certainly different
ways they play out,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.680 align:middle line:84%
different people,
different circumstances.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.580 align:middle line:90%
And the same patterns play out.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.590 align:middle line:84%
So the fear that the
gentleman that I'm

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.870 align:middle line:84%
referencing that he
felt in California,

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.370 align:middle line:90%
that same fear followed him.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.650 align:middle line:84%
He made the move out
of fear rather than out

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.050 align:middle line:84%
of the discernment
of where he really

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.403 align:middle line:90%
is at his best in this world.

00:08:10.403 --> 00:08:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And I believe that's the
guideline that's key.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.120 align:middle line:90%
Where do you feel your best?

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.860 align:middle line:90%
Where are you most vital?

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.590 align:middle line:84%
That tells you
where in this world

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.990 align:middle line:84%
maybe to geographically
place your body,

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.115 align:middle line:84%
rather than moving from
the fear and the fear

00:08:23.115 --> 00:08:24.740 align:middle line:84%
mirrored in many
other people of what's

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:29.010 align:middle line:84%
about to unfold in this
world, on the one hand.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And on the other hand
is the new research

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.140 align:middle line:84%
that is showing that
thought, feeling

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.990 align:middle line:84%
and emotion within
our bodies actually

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:84%
have a linear, digitally
measurable impact

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.120 align:middle line:84%
on the quality of our life
outside of our bodies.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts, feelings and emotions
affect weather patterns.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.190 align:middle line:90%
The implications are awesome.

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:54.260 align:middle line:84%
Now they're related to
actual geological phenomenon.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.810 align:middle line:84%
Seismic phenomenon
are actually related

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:02.420 align:middle line:84%
to the patterning of thoughts,
feelings and emotions.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.640 align:middle line:84%
I have this conversation
with my mom all the time.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.330 align:middle line:90%
Where does she live?

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.980 align:middle line:84%
>> My mother lives
in northern Missouri.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And I live in northern
New Mexico, by the way.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.090 align:middle line:84%
Your friend might
be my neighbor.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:10.790 align:middle line:90%
>> She probably is.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> For all we know.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:11.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.970 align:middle line:90%
>> And mom said, she asked me.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.520 align:middle line:84%
She goes, how can thought,
feeling and emotion,

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.902 align:middle line:84%
how can they affect our
world, our world's a thing,

00:09:18.902 --> 00:09:20.360 align:middle line:84%
and thoughts,
feelings and emotions

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:90%
are this nebulous concept.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.210 align:middle line:84%
In the West, we've been
conditioned to believe that

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:28.200 align:middle line:90%
until very recently.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.380 align:middle line:84%
We now know that thoughts,
feelings and emotions create

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.520 align:middle line:90%
a chemistry in our bodies.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.000 align:middle line:84%
They create a
vibratory template,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.790 align:middle line:84%
a pattern that can be measured
outside of our bodies that

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:43.290 align:middle line:84%
has a direct effect on plants,
trees, rocks, weather patterns.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.930 align:middle line:84%
In the laboratory now,
this has been demonstrated,

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.780 align:middle line:84%
the implications for six
billion people on the planet

00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.260 align:middle line:84%
are certainly staggering
and vast, to say the least.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.650 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're saying if I
get myself in a good mood,

00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:84%
where my thoughts, feelings
and emotions are very benign,

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:84%
that I can stop
the Earth changes,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.115 align:middle line:84%
that I can stop the ice cap and
the North Pole from melting?

00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:10.780 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.850 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm not saying that we can
necessarily stop any changes

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:14.650 align:middle line:90%
from unfolding.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:19.000 align:middle line:84%
What I am saying is, that if we
believe, as the ancients remind

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.883 align:middle line:84%
us, of the six billion or so
people, bodies in this world,

00:10:21.883 --> 00:10:23.050 align:middle line:90%
there's only one of us here.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:90%
There's a single consciousness.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:28.360 align:middle line:84%
And that consciousness
is very closely related

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.460 align:middle line:84%
to the consciousness
of our Earth.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.860 align:middle line:10%
From that perspective,
Earth is a barometer,

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:36.043 align:middle line:10%
it's a feedback mechanism
indicating to us what's

00:10:36.043 --> 00:10:37.210 align:middle line:10%
happening within our bodies.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.370 align:middle line:10%
And within our bodies,
we're mirroring what's

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.160 align:middle line:10%
happening upon the Earth.

00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And as we choose to redefine
our patterns through compassion,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.932 align:middle line:84%
then those changes are mirrored
in the world around us.

00:10:48.932 --> 00:10:50.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's quite a
responsibility we have,

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.840 align:middle line:84%
to feel good about ourselves and
feel good about everybody else,

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.640 align:middle line:90%
isn't it?

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.870 align:middle line:84%
>> It's an opportunity,
tremendous opportunity, it is.

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:02.400 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking here to
Gregg Braden about his book,

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.060 align:middle line:90%
"Walking Between the Worlds."

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:04.860 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.090 align:middle line:90%
Fascinating topic.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.063 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to
miss one word of it.

00:11:08.063 --> 00:11:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Stay with us, we'll
be right back.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.404 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:18.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:20.300 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to
Gregg Braden here,

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.700 align:middle line:10%
about his book "Walking
Between the Worlds."

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.170 align:middle line:90%
Interesting topic.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And the subtitle, called
"The Science of Compassion."

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.490 align:middle line:90%
Gregg, welcome back.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.490 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a pleasure to be here.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:32.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Corinne.

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I want to go back to
something you said a little

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:36.680 align:middle line:84%
earlier that we kind
of just let go by.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.220 align:middle line:84%
>> And that was, you said that
all kinds of information was

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.310 align:middle line:90%
lost 1,700 years ago.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:46.510 align:middle line:90%
What was lost?

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:52.060 align:middle line:10%
>> 1,700 years ago, what we
know is that huge elements

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:10%
of our most sacred texts, text
detailing our heritage in this

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.810 align:middle line:10%
world, our relationship
to one another,

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:10%
our history to the cosmos, were
taken out of a very loosely

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.270 align:middle line:10%
based body of information that
later led into the development

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.220 align:middle line:10%
of what we call
the biblical texts.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
We know at least 25 books
were removed from those texts

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.280 align:middle line:90%
in the year 325 AD.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Who remove them?

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was in
Constantinople during the time

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.360 align:middle line:90%
the Emperor Constantine.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.580 align:middle line:84%
And I get a lot of
questions about this.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And to make a long story
very short, what I'll say

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.880 align:middle line:84%
is, I believe it was
well-intentioned.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.950 align:middle line:84%
At that time, many of
the texts were confusing,

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:34.570 align:middle line:90%
they were redundant.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:36.610 align:middle line:84%
They were, some so
mystical, that it

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:40.280 align:middle line:84%
was felt that the common man
could not understand them.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.040 align:middle line:84%
So at least 25 biblical texts,
20 supporting documents,

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.590 align:middle line:90%
so 45 altogether, were removed.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Those that were left were
condensed, rearranged

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.240 align:middle line:84%
into the texts
that we see today,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:57.292 align:middle line:84%
which many people will say is
a little confusing in places

00:12:57.292 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:84%
or looks like
something is missing.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:02.230 align:middle line:84%
And maybe this is some
insight into the reason why.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> So does this have anything
to do with the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:08.350 align:middle line:90%
that have been?

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.670 align:middle line:90%
>> Certainly, certainly.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:11.950 align:middle line:84%
One of the reasons
I believe some

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.450 align:middle line:84%
of the great libraries
of our history,

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.260 align:middle line:84%
the Dead Sea Scrolls,
the Nag Hammadi library,

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:84%
also discovered in 1947 at
the same time as the Dead Sea

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Scrolls, they were authored by
kind of a mysterious elusive

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:27.460 align:middle line:84%
sect known as the Essenes
today, of whom we know

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.510 align:middle line:84%
Jesus of Nazareth was an
Essenes master, as well

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.380 align:middle line:84%
as Moses and many other
of the ancient prophets.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:84%
And these texts, at
very best, Corinne, this

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:43.240 align:middle line:84%
is so fascinating, at best,
and I ask this question,

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
is it possible that our view
of history and technology,

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.560 align:middle line:84%
the way we developed our
science and our interpersonal

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.018 align:middle line:84%
relationships, even
the way we love

00:13:52.018 --> 00:13:56.600 align:middle line:84%
one another could be based on an
incomplete body of information?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.540 align:middle line:84%
And it appears
the answer is yes.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:01.060 align:middle line:84%
As well as we've done
with what we have,

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.920 align:middle line:84%
now by going back
into these texts,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.060 align:middle line:84%
we're able to fill
in the missing pieces

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:84%
and develop a much broader
view of this time in history,

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:84%
the outrageous phenomenon that
are unfolding in our world,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.000 align:middle line:84%
and our role in what we may
do within these phenomenon.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So is this thought that
you're bringing us today,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:27.490 align:middle line:84%
that thought, feeling and
emotion can literally change

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:28.770 align:middle line:90%
the outside.

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:29.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Environment.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:31.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:35.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you saying that that
is coming from these forgotten

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.370 align:middle line:90%
texts?

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of the texts,
if I could again,

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.690 align:middle line:84%
make a long story very
short, across all the texts,

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.610 align:middle line:84%
all the interpretations,
all the translations,

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.130 align:middle line:84%
if we condensed them down
into some key concepts,

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.170 align:middle line:84%
there are four main tenets
that were lost to the West.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:56.308 align:middle line:84%
And in that losing,
we lost the context

00:14:56.308 --> 00:14:57.850 align:middle line:84%
within which to view
our world today.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And those four are simply that
this is a unique time in Earth,

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:04.240 align:middle line:90%
in human history.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.510 align:middle line:84%
Something very
unusual, very rare

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.020 align:middle line:90%
is occurring on Earth right now.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.890 align:middle line:84%
It's an opportunity to
redefine the very parameters

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:13.690 align:middle line:90%
of our lives.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.740 align:middle line:90%
It's the first tenant.

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.010 align:middle line:90%
>> It says that in the text?

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.620 align:middle line:84%
>> It says that this time,
at this time in history,

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.290 align:middle line:84%
we will go through
a cyclic change.

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And the cycles are
so far apart, that we

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.450 align:middle line:84%
don't have a conscious
recollection of the last time

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:26.950 align:middle line:90%
the cycle occurred.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:29.410 align:middle line:84%
So almost universally, ancient
traditions point to this.

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:32.740 align:middle line:84%
The Indigenous North American,
South American ancient texts,

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.680 align:middle line:84%
calendars, they remind
us that the six billion

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.990 align:middle line:84%
or so people in the world,
there's only one of us here.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.720 align:middle line:84%
That one of us is
barreling down this road

00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.610 align:middle line:84%
toward the time the
ancients called the shift

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.710 align:middle line:90%
of the ages, this change.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.290 align:middle line:84%
They remind us that there
is an ancient science,

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.450 align:middle line:84%
perhaps one of the
oldest sciences, that we

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:51.070 align:middle line:90%
call compassion.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:54.880 align:middle line:84%
And compassion is what
allows us to gracefully move

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.680 align:middle line:84%
through the changes
that are being offered

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:90%
to us at this time in history.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:00.250 align:middle line:84%
And the last of
the four tenants,

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:03.580 align:middle line:84%
is that we have had
always, and have

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.350 align:middle line:84%
today, direct access
to the creative forces

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.670 align:middle line:84%
within our world and
within our bodies.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And it is a highly
sophisticated technology

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.000 align:middle line:84%
that was lost to the West,
and inner technology,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.150 align:middle line:84%
if I may use that
term, 1,700 years ago.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.330 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that's
kind of mind-boggling I think

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:25.450 align:middle line:84%
for me, and for most of us
who are watching this show,

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:30.370 align:middle line:84%
to think that perhaps we can
change on an individual basis

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:32.620 align:middle line:90%
the environment around us.

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But let's go to something
that's more individualized here.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:41.350 align:middle line:84%
In your book, you say that
there is scientific evidence now

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:46.920 align:middle line:84%
that we can actually
change our own DNA

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.100 align:middle line:90%
by these feelings of love.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:48.900 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.220 align:middle line:90%
>> And compassion.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, this is what, this
statement now that you've just

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.770 align:middle line:84%
shared to lead us into this,
that mirrors this Western

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:57.900 align:middle line:84%
belief that there is a
difference between us

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.190 align:middle line:90%
and our outer world.

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's why it is hard
for us to understand that.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:05.339 align:middle line:84%
The ancients saw no
separation between our inner

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:06.690 align:middle line:90%
and outer worlds.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:09.089 align:middle line:84%
What happens in here
is mirrored out here.

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:12.089 align:middle line:84%
What happens in our outer
world is mirrored in here.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:14.079 align:middle line:84%
By virtue of that,
they understood

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:20.369 align:middle line:84%
that as we refine, as we hone
our purity, the purest nature

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:23.160 align:middle line:84%
of who we are in this
world from within,

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:26.609 align:middle line:84%
that our outer world then
mirrors that back to us.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And as we are
turbulent from within,

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.700 align:middle line:84%
then that turbulence is
also mirrored back to us.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Many will attest that that
tendency is playing out

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.130 align:middle line:90%
in our world today.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:84%
So the new research, yes,
it's bearing this out.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:84%
And what I can say is, it's
an outrageous statement,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.560 align:middle line:84%
and my training as a scientist
and as an engineer, what

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.160 align:middle line:84%
I'm about to say to
you is outrageous,

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.690 align:middle line:84%
and it feels very
good at the same time.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:53.010 align:middle line:84%
And that is, if we define human
the way that we always have

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:57.210 align:middle line:84%
since we discovered the genetic
code in the early 1950s,

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:02.400 align:middle line:84%
then within our communities
and our families and our homes,

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
perhaps within our bodies
as we're sitting here

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.540 align:middle line:84%
having this
conversation, there is

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:11.630 align:middle line:84%
a new species of human that's
being birthed at this time.

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.920 align:middle line:84%
We might look the
same on the outside.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.590 align:middle line:84%
The DNA is changing
on the inside.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:20.010 align:middle line:84%
And with that change, we
have tremendously enhanced

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:21.460 align:middle line:90%
immune systems.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.490 align:middle line:84%
We have cells that
regenerate over 100 times

00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:26.310 align:middle line:84%
faster than we've
ever seen before.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:29.760 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that
this change of DNA

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.490 align:middle line:84%
is in response to
the great challenges

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
that this time in
history is offering us.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.490 align:middle line:84%
So what scientists, the big
mystery, great mystery of life

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.650 align:middle line:84%
science is, why
so much of our DNA

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:44.550 align:middle line:84%
appears to be unused, almost
2/3 of it technically.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Now we're finding rather
than being unused,

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.680 align:middle line:84%
perhaps it's dormant
until we achieve

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:53.190 align:middle line:84%
a level of quality of
thought, feeling and emotion.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:54.690 align:middle line:84%
And now researchers
have digitally

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.340 align:middle line:84%
measured that emotion
is the trigger,

00:18:56.340 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:84%
it's the switch that turns these
codes off and on in our bodies,

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.380 align:middle line:84%
allowing us tremendous
levels of vitality

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:09.060 align:middle line:84%
and the opportunity to
love on levels deeper,

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.400 align:middle line:84%
perhaps, we've
ever loved before.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.830 align:middle line:84%
In the broader
context, now here we

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:16.950 align:middle line:84%
are barreling down this road
toward the shift of the ages,

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:84%
we're experiencing these
tremendous challenges

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:22.740 align:middle line:84%
in our personal lives,
as well as collectively

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.840 align:middle line:90%
in our global life.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.120 align:middle line:84%
In response to
that, we are being

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.280 align:middle line:84%
pushed to the very
edge of who we

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.410 align:middle line:84%
believe we are, and sometimes
right over that edge.

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll say.

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>> As many will attest to.

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:37.650 align:middle line:84%
And that appears to
be sometimes what

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.120 align:middle line:84%
it takes for us to reach within
to this ancient technology,

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.540 align:middle line:84%
this ancient
memory, this wisdom,

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:49.800 align:middle line:84%
to become the greatest
expression of humankind,

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.020 align:middle line:84%
and to love on levels
deeper than perhaps we've

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.540 align:middle line:90%
ever loved before.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:56.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Many of the people
in this audience have,

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:59.160 align:middle line:84%
are familiar with the idea that
when you've had a terrible loss

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.670 align:middle line:84%
in your life, it lowers
your immune system.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And many people get
sick or die after losing

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.770 align:middle line:84%
a spouse or a child or
some kind of terrible loss.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:12.570 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:16.290 align:middle line:84%
>> What you're saying here,
is that by controlling

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:20.700 align:middle line:84%
your thoughts and your
emotions and your feelings,

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:25.940 align:middle line:84%
you can actually prevent your
immune system from breaking

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.070 align:middle line:90%
down.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.350 align:middle line:84%
>> What the ancients
say to us very clearly,

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.610 align:middle line:84%
is that our bodies are a
mirror of six parameters.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Thoughts, feeling, emotion,
breath, nutrient and movement.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.580 align:middle line:84%
Thought, feeling
and emotion combine.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.400 align:middle line:84%
Rather than control
them, we're invited

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.350 align:middle line:84%
to redefine the quality
of thoughts, feelings

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:48.230 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.180 align:middle line:84%
And in doing so, to redefine
the experience of our lives.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:10%
So the loss that
you're speaking about,

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:57.350 align:middle line:10%
that loss in redefining
what it means to us,

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:01.220 align:middle line:10%
our body chemistry then
mirrors that change back to us

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.320 align:middle line:10%
through the science
of compassion

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.130 align:middle line:10%
as we witness the
loss, as a greater

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:10.550 align:middle line:10%
possibility in our lives and the
lives of those who have left.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:14.240 align:middle line:90%
Literally, our body pH changes.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.880 align:middle line:90%
Our immunity responds to that.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.222 align:middle line:90%
And this is, we all know this.

00:21:19.222 --> 00:21:21.070 align:middle line:84%
This is being said in
many different ways.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.800 align:middle line:84%
For perhaps the first time now,
it's being digitally measured.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.790 align:middle line:84%
The first place I saw it
measured was in HIV patients

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:33.860 align:middle line:84%
and in the global blood study
that was done in the mid 1990s.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:90%
It was the first time.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:40.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Gregg, this this is
the most amazing book.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.490 align:middle line:84%
There is so much in
here, that we can barely

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.410 align:middle line:90%
touch the whole thing.

00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:49.280 align:middle line:84%
I really have to encourage
people here to read this book,

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.600 align:middle line:84%
because it is so
deep and so detailed.

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:57.110 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking here
to a brilliant man,

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:58.850 align:middle line:90%
as you probably have noticed.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.620 align:middle line:90%
His name is Gregg Braden.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:04.310 align:middle line:84%
He has written a book called
"Walking Between the Worlds,

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.812 align:middle line:90%
The Science of Compassion."

00:22:06.812 --> 00:22:08.270 align:middle line:84%
Like I always tell
you around here,

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
we bring you miracle
on this show.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:12.410 align:middle line:90%
Keep coming back.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.860 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.000 align:middle line:90%
