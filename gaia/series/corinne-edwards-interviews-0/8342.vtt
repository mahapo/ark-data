00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have
stress in your life?

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.980 align:middle line:84%
I bet you do, because
most of us do.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.330 align:middle line:84%
As a matter of fact, stress
is the number one killer

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.890 align:middle line:90%
in the United States today.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.580 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to talk
to a motivational speaker

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.830 align:middle line:84%
and a trainer today who
had some of the answers

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.590 align:middle line:84%
on how we can deal with
the stress in our life.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.610 align:middle line:84%
I'd like to introduce
you to Celeste Johnson.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Hi.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Glad to have you here.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.800 align:middle line:84%
Your program is called
"The Balancing Act."

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.760 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a very
interesting term, the balancing

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.900 align:middle line:90%
act.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.520 align:middle line:90%
What does that mean to you?

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, it means being able to
juggle the myriad of demands

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.650 align:middle line:84%
that we have, and the
desires that we have.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.730 align:middle line:84%
And how do you juggle those
things and not drop the ball,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.160 align:middle line:84%
or have some balance
in your life?

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.630 align:middle line:84%
And it's so
important to do that.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.450 align:middle line:90%
And I think it's really an art.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.600 align:middle line:90%
It's an art.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.300 align:middle line:84%
It's a skill that
you have to develop.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.840 align:middle line:90%
And we all are facing it.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.510 align:middle line:84%
We're all facing
the situations where

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.610 align:middle line:90%
we have too much on our plate.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.260 align:middle line:90%
Things are changing so fast.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.300 align:middle line:10%
We're all feeling
remnants of Stress--

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.950 align:middle line:10%
in capital letters.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.570 align:middle line:10%
And what we have
to do is to learn

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.080 align:middle line:10%
how to take those components--

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.080 align:middle line:10%
those components are
important, those components

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:10%
that are not important, decipher
which they are, and then

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.150 align:middle line:10%
have some balance.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.442 align:middle line:84%
And have some enjoyment, so
we're enjoying life and not

00:01:50.442 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
just going through life on what
I call the proverbial treadmill

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.670 align:middle line:90%
of life.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you think women are more
apt to have stress and balance

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.720 align:middle line:84%
in their life, and trouble with
balancing their life, than men?

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.010 align:middle line:84%
And I think it
really goes back to,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.110 align:middle line:84%
I guess, the stereotypes
in some of the systems

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.882 align:middle line:84%
that we had of old,
where women were

00:02:09.882 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:84%
expected to do the things in
the home-- the typical things.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're in the '90s
and we do have a lot of women

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.520 align:middle line:84%
out there in the workforce,
still, a lot of people

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.190 align:middle line:84%
expect women to continue to
do all of the same things they

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.450 align:middle line:90%
did before in the home.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Take care of the children,
do the grocery shopping,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.490 align:middle line:84%
et cetera, and work a full-time
job and do all of the things

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.440 align:middle line:84%
that, typically, the
male would do so.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.038 align:middle line:84%
And I think women themselves
still feel that responsibility.

00:02:34.038 --> 00:02:36.580 align:middle line:84%
And occasionally, you'll have
a spouse, or friend, or someone

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.020 align:middle line:90%
else that will help you there.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:84%
But I think that women
still internalize the fact

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.940 align:middle line:84%
that I should be the caretaker,
and I've got to do it all.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.260 align:middle line:84%
And our society tells
us, you can have it all.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.060 align:middle line:90%
You can do it all.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.580 align:middle line:90%
And we believe it.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.210 align:middle line:84%
And we're out there
trying to do it.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.510 align:middle line:84%
And we find ourselves
just feeling burnt out,

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.352 align:middle line:84%
which is where I say is
the ultimate stress--

00:02:55.352 --> 00:02:56.560 align:middle line:90%
is really getting burned out.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And you said "a lot
of people" seem to think.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.990 align:middle line:90%
Are you talking about men?

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Actually, I think
it's across the board.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.790 align:middle line:90%
I think men a lot--

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:05.590 align:middle line:90%
more so than women.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.790 align:middle line:84%
>> You think men expect women
to be the caretakers in the home

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:90%
and work a full-time job?

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.120 align:middle line:90%
Most of them.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.280 align:middle line:84%
I do have some friends
in mind that I've

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.800 align:middle line:84%
experienced a little
different, but that's a rarity.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I usually don't find
a lot of men who--

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.860 align:middle line:84%
wife may be involved with the
workforce in whatever degree,

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.870 align:middle line:90%
some more involved in others.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.420 align:middle line:84%
But they still expect
her to come home

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.950 align:middle line:84%
and do some of the
domestic things--

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.180 align:middle line:90%
many of the domestic things.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.320 align:middle line:84%
Or at least arrange
to get them done.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.320 align:middle line:84%
Even if she's not the one
that actually does it,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.612 align:middle line:90%
she would just take care of it.

00:03:36.612 --> 00:03:38.350 align:middle line:84%
It's not even part of
their consciousness

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:90%
to have to deal with that.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.470 align:middle line:90%
>> So we have a second shift.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.668 align:middle line:90%
>> And the first shift.

00:03:42.668 --> 00:03:43.535 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:43.535 --> 00:03:44.410 align:middle line:90%
First, second, third.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.000 align:middle line:84%
>> What got you
interested in this?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
>> In the balancing
act in particular?

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.800 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I tell you, I lived it.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.320 align:middle line:84%
I tell you, I used to
work very closely--

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.680 align:middle line:84%
I still do-- with a
motivational speaker, Les Brown.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.050 align:middle line:90%
And I love this industry.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.250 align:middle line:90%
I love what we do.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.770 align:middle line:84%
And we got together
to do some projects.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, I always have
this attitude--

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.140 align:middle line:84%
this can-do attitude,
and "I can do this."

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.060 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't control
that very well.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
So as different projects and
responsibilities would come up,

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:84%
I would say, oh,
yes, I can do that.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:90%
No problem.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:84%
I'll just cut back
on my sleep, right?

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.600 align:middle line:84%
And another project or
another problem will come up.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.740 align:middle line:90%
Oh, I can handle that too.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:84%
The can-do attitude
can get you in trouble.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So I just kept on taking
on other responsibilities,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.030 align:middle line:84%
and more and more, until
it was a point where

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.470 align:middle line:84%
either your body shuts down
or you just get so exhausted.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.210 align:middle line:90%
And that's what I experienced--

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.487 align:middle line:84%
that I wasn't
having fun anymore.

00:04:36.487 --> 00:04:37.570 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't enjoying my life.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.765 align:middle line:84%
Before I knew it, years
was passing-- literally.

00:04:40.765 --> 00:04:42.640 align:middle line:84%
And I wasn't keeping in
touch with my family.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I know many of our
viewers have forgotten

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.930 align:middle line:84%
to send birthday
cards, greeting cards,

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.550 align:middle line:90%
to your family and friends.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.240 align:middle line:84%
I had Christmas cards
that I still have.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.120 align:middle line:90%
>> From years ago.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Years ago.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.160 align:middle line:84%
And just never got around to
those things that connect you

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.040 align:middle line:84%
to people, connect you to the
things that are important.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.500 align:middle line:84%
And I think you just kind of
get going, and you get going.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.850 align:middle line:90%
And I felt very burnt out.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.170 align:middle line:84%
And I got to the point
for me where it really

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.030 align:middle line:90%
didn't matter what happened.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.350 align:middle line:90%
If I took off--

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.290 align:middle line:90%
I had to take off.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.420 align:middle line:90%
I had to get away.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.095 align:middle line:90%
Because I knew I was losing me.

00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:16.970 align:middle line:84%
I couldn't see me in
the midst of it anymore.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.445 align:middle line:90%
I only saw work.

00:05:18.445 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:84%
Even though it was good,
and it was fruitful,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.090 align:middle line:84%
and it was helping
others, there is

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.070 align:middle line:84%
a point when you have
to make sure you're

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.630 align:middle line:90%
being true to yourself.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And we are so busy,
we don't have time

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:84%
to enjoy what we're
saying we're busy for.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.560 align:middle line:84%
And I see a of people
who say, I want

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.260 align:middle line:84%
to work a little harder so
my kids can have the better

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.450 align:middle line:84%
things, and they can go
to the better schools,

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.880 align:middle line:84%
and we can wear the clothes--
and again, our society

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:90%
feeds into that.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:90%
We say, you can have it all.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.220 align:middle line:84%
You can-- sure, just charge
it, or whatever it is.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.660 align:middle line:90%
Just work an extra weekend.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.850 align:middle line:84%
But we have the children--
they have the gym

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:84%
shoes, the wonderful
ones that cost $150 plus,

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.090 align:middle line:84%
but we don't have time to
watch them play in them.

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.020 align:middle line:90%
And then-- so what is it for?

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And my question always
is, have we given up

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.060 align:middle line:90%
too much to have it all?

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, your tape
program and your--

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I think it's quite
interesting, because you also

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.980 align:middle line:90%
have a workbook.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.640 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.440 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.600 align:middle line:84%
>> So that people can actually
do the exercises that you give

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.460 align:middle line:90%
them on the tape.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:84%
But some of these suggestions
you're giving are so basic,

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.050 align:middle line:90%
but we tend to forget them.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.420 align:middle line:90%
And I think that's what we do.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Like the one.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.200 align:middle line:90%
The one.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.770 align:middle line:84%
That it's so basic that
we forget about is,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.270 align:middle line:90%
learn how to say no.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.740 align:middle line:90%
That's me.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Didn't do it.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.130 align:middle line:84%
I know, we don't--
they are so basic.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.670 align:middle line:90%
You mentioned that it is simple.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.990 align:middle line:84%
The real nuggets of
wisdom is simple.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.240 align:middle line:90%
They're simple.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.270 align:middle line:90%
Yet we can't do them.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.560 align:middle line:84%
We find them difficult.
We are looking

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.790 align:middle line:90%
for the complicated answer.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.870 align:middle line:90%
It's like, just be quiet.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.487 align:middle line:90%
Just say no.

00:06:46.487 --> 00:06:47.320 align:middle line:90%
The whole campaign--

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.170 align:middle line:90%
>> And you said, say it early.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Say it very early.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:90%
Say it early, say it firmly.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.050 align:middle line:90%
And just--

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.920 align:middle line:90%
>> And don't say maybe.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.600 align:middle line:84%
Because you build
up their hopes.

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.800 align:middle line:84%
And people think that maybe
they're going to come.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.770 align:middle line:84%
And then it's harder later
on to come back and say no,

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.890 align:middle line:84%
whereas if you say no
and you're able to do it,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.960 align:middle line:84%
it would be a nice surprise,
and they'll be happy.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.755 align:middle line:84%
But I think that it's real
important that we just--

00:07:06.755 --> 00:07:07.880 align:middle line:90%
absolutely doesn't do that.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.160 align:middle line:84%
But let me tell you what
I think really works best,

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.740 align:middle line:84%
and how you can get to the
point where you can say no

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.080 align:middle line:84%
and it feels OK, or a
little bit more comfortable.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.170 align:middle line:84%
If we are clear of
what our goals are,

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.430 align:middle line:84%
and what our values
are, and our purpose,

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.490 align:middle line:84%
I think that's really
the root of getting away

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:90%
from some of the stresses.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.750 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're clear what's
important, who's important,

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.180 align:middle line:84%
where you're headed, then
it's like a framework

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.940 align:middle line:84%
that gives you something
to say yes or no,

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.295 align:middle line:90%
if it fits or doesn't fit.

00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not
clear of that--

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.262 align:middle line:90%
which most people are not--

00:07:36.262 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:84%
then it's easy to take
on something else,

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:39.080 align:middle line:90%
because we don't know.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.980 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't fit.

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Or it might fit.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.485 align:middle line:84%
Or we just do it because
we have no system.

00:07:42.485 --> 00:07:43.550 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't know how to say no.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:44.480 align:middle line:90%
We're afraid to say no.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.140 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.100 align:middle line:84%
That's true,
because-- That's true.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.450 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to let them down.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.280 align:middle line:84%
We feel like we have
to try to do this.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.777 align:middle line:84%
But if we continue
to do that, we

00:07:50.777 --> 00:07:52.610 align:middle line:84%
get to that point where
we're talking about,

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.510 align:middle line:90%
getting burnt out.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And then you have to say no.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.770 align:middle line:90%
We talked about--

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Les and I, many
times, talk about how,

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:84%
unfortunately, people wait
until they either get sick--

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:03.990 align:middle line:90%
you get the flu.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.390 align:middle line:84%
You know how you work,
and you work, and then

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.432 align:middle line:90%
suddenly you're laid out?

00:08:06.432 --> 00:08:07.568 align:middle line:90%
You can't do anything else?

00:08:07.568 --> 00:08:09.110 align:middle line:84%
Because we've
overextended ourselves.

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.568 align:middle line:84%
We haven't taken
care of ourselves.

00:08:10.568 --> 00:08:14.570 align:middle line:84%
Or some medical condition
that just shakes us up.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we start looking
at the things that

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.040 align:middle line:84%
will keep us in balance
and keep us in order.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.500 align:middle line:84%
But we shouldn't have
to wait to that point.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's unfortunate,
what most people do.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The other very simple
thing that you say here,

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.670 align:middle line:90%
which is very, very shocking--

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.510 align:middle line:90%
>> What?

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> Don't answer the phone.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.610 align:middle line:84%
>> It's so simple,
and it's so hard.

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:36.132 align:middle line:84%
The phone rings,
and the first thing

00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:38.090 align:middle line:84%
you do-- you could be in
a meeting or whatever.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:90%
And you pick it up.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.590 align:middle line:84%
The phone takes priority already
over everything, it seems.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I say,
don't answer the phone.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:48.358 align:middle line:84%
It is so efficient
to just let it ring.

00:08:48.358 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:90%
Get an answering service.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.442 align:middle line:84%
Everybody has some kind
of voicemail or whatever.

00:08:51.442 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:90%
Let that work for you.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Use that.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.030 align:middle line:84%
Let it work for you,
and call back when

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.870 align:middle line:90%
you're ready to talk to them.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.670 align:middle line:90%
Set aside a time--

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.308 align:middle line:84%
>> Or call back when they're
not home and you can talk

00:09:00.308 --> 00:09:00.350 align:middle line:90%
to their voicemail.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.350 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why you can
leave the -- that's right.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.650 align:middle line:90%
That's really an efficient way.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:04.695 align:middle line:90%
I use that all the time.

00:09:04.695 --> 00:09:06.320 align:middle line:84%
Because sometimes I
call intentionally,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.360 align:middle line:84%
like you said, knowing
they're probably not there.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.350 align:middle line:90%
But I can leave the answer.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.308 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have to
have a long conversation.

00:09:11.308 --> 00:09:13.010 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to say
no on the phone.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to talk to
them directly, that's OK.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.350 align:middle line:84%
But absolutely
use the technology

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:90%
to help you to manage your time.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Time management is so important
to eliminating that stress,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:24.620 align:middle line:90%
that factor there.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:84%
If you understand some of the
tips that are really simple,

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.990 align:middle line:84%
like not answering the
phone, like closing your door

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.310 align:middle line:84%
if you're at work and you
don't want to deal with it--

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:33.560 align:middle line:90%
there's so many little things.

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.113 align:middle line:84%
You can do put a sign
up-- "work in progress."

00:09:36.113 --> 00:09:38.030 align:middle line:84%
Or "I'll take appointments
at a certain time."

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.683 align:middle line:90%
You control your life.

00:09:39.683 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:90%
See, that's the thing.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, the telephone is
a very insistent thing.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.580 align:middle line:84%
One of my pet peeves has always
been in a department store--

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.700 align:middle line:84%
when someone is waiting
on me and the phone rings,

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:90%
they will answer the phone be--

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.280 align:middle line:90%
>> While-- right.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.080 align:middle line:90%
And you're there.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.180 align:middle line:90%
>> And I'm here.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:54.980 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:55.780 align:middle line:90%
It does bother me.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.280 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, the
phone is a tyrant.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.080 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.950 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.100 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it's a blessing, but
it's also almost a curse,

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.900 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.870 align:middle line:90%
You're exactly right.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.453 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we
have to get control.

00:10:04.453 --> 00:10:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Turn off the ringer.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.630 align:middle line:84%
We don't want-- we're so
fearful, I guess, I don't know,

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.010 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to miss
something important?

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:10.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Are we going
to miss something?

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:10.250 align:middle line:90%
>> I know.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.020 align:middle line:90%
We're going to miss something.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.600 align:middle line:84%
But without that, if
we just continually--

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.813 align:middle line:90%
the crisis comes up.

00:10:15.813 --> 00:10:17.480 align:middle line:84%
And what I remember--
a phrase, I think.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.190 align:middle line:84%
It was something like, why
make your emergency my crisis?

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:23.095 align:middle line:90%
It's not my issue.

00:10:23.095 --> 00:10:25.220 align:middle line:84%
If you don't pick up the
phone, it's not your issue

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.762 align:middle line:84%
until you know what
the situation is.

00:10:26.762 --> 00:10:29.310 align:middle line:84%
So it's so important
to just try it.

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:30.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Say that again?

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.370 align:middle line:90%
Don't make what?

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Your emergency, my crisis.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:37.160 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, whatever your
demands are becomes my crisis.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.010 align:middle line:84%
But I don't have to pick up the
phone, and it won't be mine.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:40.810 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.100 align:middle line:84%
>> At least you can delay
it until you're better able

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:90%
to handle--

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.270 align:middle line:90%
>> To handle it.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.080 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.320 align:middle line:90%
>> Sometimes, right?

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:45.400 align:middle line:90%
To--

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.430 align:middle line:90%
>> In the time that you want to.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:47.230 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.520 align:middle line:84%
>> These are all such
practical things.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.000 align:middle line:84%
I was really
impressed with them.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:51.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.250 align:middle line:90%
And they're very simple.

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Very simple.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.040 align:middle line:84%
But I think everything
that's good is simple.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:56.840 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.350 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.183 align:middle line:90%
>> It's really good.

00:10:58.183 --> 00:10:59.330 align:middle line:90%

Celeste Johnson here

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:84%
about her tape program
and her work program

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.530 align:middle line:84%
on The Balancing Act,
something we're all

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.710 align:middle line:90%
trying to do all the time.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:08.510 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.343 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:11:09.343 --> 00:11:14.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:19.610 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to Celeste
Johnson, a motivational

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:24.230 align:middle line:10%
and career and an
efficiency counselor who

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.070 align:middle line:10%
had a wonderful tape program
called "The Balancing Act,"

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.450 align:middle line:10%
and a workbook to match.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.250 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.200 align:middle line:90%
>> You talk here about--

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.170 align:middle line:90%
I got an awful lot out of this.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Because I said to myself,
I know all of this stuff.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.420 align:middle line:90%
Why am I not doing it?

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Because we need someone
like you to remind us.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.480 align:middle line:90%
That's why.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.280 align:middle line:90%
>> I think that's so true.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.070 align:middle line:10%
Most people that
are doing anything

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:51.380 align:middle line:10%
have heard the
fundamental principles

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:54.170 align:middle line:10%
of how you can be successful,
how you can manage your time.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.820 align:middle line:10%
We've heard it at
one time or another.

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.195 align:middle line:84%
But I think what's
real important

00:11:57.195 --> 00:12:00.080 align:middle line:84%
for me is that people
have to hear it

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:90%
when they're ready for it.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.178 align:middle line:84%
Because we're in different
stages all the time.

00:12:03.178 --> 00:12:04.700 align:middle line:90%
We're in different situations.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.650 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes I may
hear it at a point

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.480 align:middle line:84%
where it just really
doesn't apply.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.120 align:middle line:84%
Or later, I'll hear the same
thing and it's like, oh,

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:90%
you hear it.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.963 align:middle line:90%
You finally really hear it.

00:12:13.963 --> 00:12:15.005 align:middle line:90%
And so I think it's that.

00:12:15.005 --> 00:12:17.110 align:middle line:84%
It's that you need
to be reminded.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.110 align:middle line:90%
It's just like exercise.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.490 align:middle line:84%
You get up and you
get into the groove,

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.990 align:middle line:84%
and you do it really
well for a while,

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.130 align:middle line:90%
and then you kind of slack off.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:23.000 align:middle line:84%
And you need somebody
to come back--

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.690 align:middle line:90%
"Come on.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:24.490 align:middle line:90%
Get up."

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:25.858 align:middle line:90%
Here's really how you do it.

00:12:25.858 --> 00:12:27.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's a reminder to
get you going again.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:28.450 align:middle line:90%
So we need that.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.343 align:middle line:90%
We all need that.

00:12:29.343 --> 00:12:31.760 align:middle line:84%
>> That's our job, to remind
each other of what we already

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.270 align:middle line:90%
know, right?

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:32.600 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.040 align:middle line:84%
Gently and lovingly,
but remind us.

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:90%


00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You go and speak
to huge corporations,

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.990 align:middle line:84%
and you're a keynote speaker
at many organizations.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
>> What do they ask you
to speak about, mostly?

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.930 align:middle line:84%
>> Mostly, it's
dealing with balance--

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:50.570 align:middle line:84%
trying to get the balance
in the order in their lives,

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:51.650 align:middle line:90%
more than anything.

00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.718 align:middle line:90%
I mean, and then--

00:12:52.718 --> 00:12:55.010 align:middle line:84%
they do indicate they're
interested in time management,

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.093 align:middle line:84%
and managing the different
things that are coming.

00:12:57.093 --> 00:12:59.670 align:middle line:84%
But the key is juggling all
of these different things.

00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:01.670 align:middle line:84%
Especially with the
downsizing and right-sizing,

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.670 align:middle line:84%
all the trend that's going on
with companies and mergers,

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:07.460 align:middle line:84%
different mindsets coming
together with corporations.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:90%
How do you mesh these things?

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And different responsibilities,
more responsibilities,

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.507 align:middle line:84%
less employees-- how do
you handle all of that?

00:13:14.507 --> 00:13:15.840 align:middle line:90%
How do you balance those things?

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.632 align:middle line:84%
And that's really what
the demand has been,

00:13:17.632 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:90%
overwhelmingly.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.160 align:middle line:84%
And it comes back to those
fundamental pieces again--

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.040 align:middle line:84%
the ones that we've heard
but we haven't done.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.770 align:middle line:84%
Is understanding, even in the
midst of the work environment,

00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:31.340 align:middle line:84%
where you have some limitation
on choosing certain things,

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:84%
but understanding what's
the most important thing?

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.060 align:middle line:84%
You have to have some-- make
a list of the many things you

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:37.130 align:middle line:90%
have.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:39.320 align:middle line:84%
>> That, I think, is a very,
very good point that you make

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:42.170 align:middle line:84%
You say, "Take time
every day to plan.

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:46.107 align:middle line:84%
And Robert Schuller once said,
'People don't plan to fail.

00:13:46.107 --> 00:13:46.940 align:middle line:90%
They fail to plan.'"

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:47.285 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:48.340 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> You actually
make a list, right?

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Every day.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.920 align:middle line:84%
I do it on my
computer, actually.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.003 align:middle line:90%
I have a computer program.

00:13:53.003 --> 00:13:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And again, you need
to use technology

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.320 align:middle line:84%
as much as you can
to shorten your time.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.910 align:middle line:90%
But every morning--

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:01.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, maybe on Saturdays
and Sundays I might slack off.

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:04.770 align:middle line:84%
But I have a list of
everything that I need to do.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.170 align:middle line:90%
And then-- here's the key part.

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:08.030 align:middle line:84%
Because a lot of people make
the list-- and that's good.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.200 align:middle line:90%
That's the first step.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.440 align:middle line:84%
But the second is critical--
is to prioritize it.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Because you can
have a whole list,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.273 align:middle line:84%
and you put the fun things,
the easy things, at the top.

00:14:16.273 --> 00:14:17.738 align:middle line:84%
And the most
critical component--

00:14:17.738 --> 00:14:19.780 align:middle line:84%
maybe it's something you
really don't want to do.

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.610 align:middle line:84%
It's challenging, it takes more
time, or whatever it might be.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.020 align:middle line:84%
But it's the most
essential thing

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.520 align:middle line:84%
to get done-- could
be further down.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.510 align:middle line:84%
If it's not at the
top of the list,

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:84%
that's when you're
going to get in trouble.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the stress comes.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.430 align:middle line:90%
That's when the concern comes.

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.110 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
the panic sets in.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.790 align:middle line:90%
Because at the end of the day--

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
and you've got many things done,
perhaps, but the most important

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.510 align:middle line:90%
is not.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.770 align:middle line:90%
Real fundamental.

00:14:39.770 --> 00:14:40.940 align:middle line:90%
And people don't do that.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.460 align:middle line:84%
I remember a story I
heard a long time ago,

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.470 align:middle line:90%
and it's so fitting.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.270 align:middle line:90%
I guess it happened in the '30s.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And it was a consultant that
was brought into a company

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.710 align:middle line:90%
to look at the operations.

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:53.600 align:middle line:84%
They weren't producing
as much as they could,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.220 align:middle line:90%
or as efficiently as they could.

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So they brought in
this consultant.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.400 align:middle line:84%
Consultant came and observed
for a couple of days.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And at the end of that, he
sat down with the executive

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.570 align:middle line:90%
and said, it's real simple.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:07.370 align:middle line:84%
You need to just make a
list, prioritize it, start

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.500 align:middle line:84%
at the top, and
unless you absolutely

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:84%
have to go to the next thing,
do not move from that first task

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.930 align:middle line:84%
until you can get--
it's completed.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, the manager
or the executive

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.278 align:middle line:84%
said, I'm not going to pay you
what we talked about for this--

00:15:20.278 --> 00:15:22.070 align:middle line:84%
for you to come and
tell me to make a list,

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.660 align:middle line:90%
prioritize it, and follow it?

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.820 align:middle line:90%
So the consultant said, fine.

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.680 align:middle line:90%
Tear up the old agreement.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.530 align:middle line:84%
Just use this simple
idea for 30 days.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:84%
At the end of that
period, send me a check

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.460 align:middle line:90%
for what you think it's worth.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Executive said,
OK, we'll do that.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.400 align:middle line:90%
So he did that.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.330 align:middle line:84%
At the end of the 30 days, he
sent this consultant $25,000--

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:42.860 align:middle line:90%
now, this is back in the '30s--

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:44.720 align:middle line:90%
just for that one idea.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.710 align:middle line:90%
Because it really is powerful.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:49.963 align:middle line:84%
It's simple, but that's what
we need to do to get some order

00:15:49.963 --> 00:15:51.380 align:middle line:84%
and get rid of
some of the stress.

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.797 align:middle line:84%
Because if you
don't get something

00:15:52.797 --> 00:15:54.560 align:middle line:84%
else done that's
not as important,

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.120 align:middle line:90%
you don't feel as bad.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.260 align:middle line:90%
So it's really simple.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:84%
I think what we do is, we tend
to do the easy stuff first.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.323 align:middle line:90%
>> The fun things.

00:16:02.323 --> 00:16:03.240 align:middle line:90%
You call your friends.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.880 align:middle line:84%
I've got to call my
friend, but you're

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.360 align:middle line:90%
on the phone for 20 minutes.

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.160 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.360 align:middle line:84%
>> So you could
write this-- really,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.600 align:middle line:84%
you don't have to be so
sophisticated as to put it

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.400 align:middle line:90%
on a computer.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.710 align:middle line:84%
You could put it on the
back of an envelope.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:13.752 align:middle line:90%
>> A piece of-- whatever.

00:16:13.752 --> 00:16:14.700 align:middle line:90%
>> And just put--

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.910 align:middle line:84%
next to what's most
important, put an A or a 1.

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:19.710 align:middle line:90%
>> A or 1.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:20.817 align:middle line:90%
A, B, C. 1, 2, 3.

00:16:20.817 --> 00:16:21.900 align:middle line:90%
There's different systems.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.170 align:middle line:90%
Whatever works for the person.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.900 align:middle line:84%
But there's got to
be some semblance of,

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.950 align:middle line:90%
what's a priority?

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:28.510 align:middle line:84%
Number one, A, has
to be essential.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.340 align:middle line:90%
It has to get done.

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:29.910 align:middle line:90%
Absolutely.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:90%
It's fundamental-- critical.

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:31.820 align:middle line:90%
>> And you start.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.700 align:middle line:90%
>> You start there.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.240 align:middle line:84%
And then, after you do
that-- because you're

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:90%
going to have several things.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.200 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to have
a long laundry list.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:38.527 align:middle line:90%
You need to make it realistic.

00:16:38.527 --> 00:16:40.860 align:middle line:84%
But after you've done that,
you're going to have several

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.780 align:middle line:90%
A's, several B's, several C's.

00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Then you need to go back,
even within that category.

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:48.340 align:middle line:84%
What's the most fundamental
thing that has to be done?

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>> You know what I
found when I do this?

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.040 align:middle line:84%
And I do this every
once in a while.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.748 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to start
doing it tomorrow.

00:16:52.748 --> 00:16:53.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Good, good.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.470 align:middle line:84%
>> By the time you
get around to the C,

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.430 align:middle line:84%
sometimes the people
have forgotten about it,

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.900 align:middle line:84%
and you don't have
to do it at all.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.300 align:middle line:90%
That is very true.

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.640 align:middle line:90%
And here's another secret.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.750 align:middle line:90%
Here's a really good one.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.917 align:middle line:90%
And I don't do this as well.

00:17:03.917 --> 00:17:05.460 align:middle line:90%
And I'm getting better.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.390 align:middle line:84%
Is, those C's, or
mini-things, delegate.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.550 align:middle line:90%
Delegate, delegate, delegate.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:12.920 align:middle line:90%
You have this long list.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.503 align:middle line:84%
There's certain
things you have to do.

00:17:14.503 --> 00:17:18.060 align:middle line:84%
There's many things you really
don't have to do yourself.

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.839 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, I don't give them
out to other people too well.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.430 align:middle line:90%
But that's what we need to do.

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.160 align:middle line:84%
If there's someone else-- if
you're not the only one that

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:28.230 align:middle line:90%
has to do it, delegate it.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the rule of
thumb to start with.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.170 align:middle line:84%
There are some times
you still can do it--

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.440 align:middle line:84%
some things that you could
have someone else do.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.140 align:middle line:84%
But if you're not the
one that has to do this,

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.000 align:middle line:84%
try to find someone
else to do it.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.870 align:middle line:90%
That's a really good--

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Find somebody who hasn't
learned yet to say no.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:44.700 align:middle line:90%
>> That's true.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:84%
That's pretty bad,
but that's true.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.530 align:middle line:90%
And then the other thing--

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:48.330 align:middle line:90%
think of this.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.310 align:middle line:84%
You're really giving
them an opportunity

00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to expand their horizons,
to experience this activity.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.650 align:middle line:84%
Because, truly, they
could be at a point--

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.067 align:middle line:84%
it could be someone
that's working

00:17:57.067 --> 00:17:59.610 align:middle line:84%
for you that you're going to
delegate a responsibility to.

00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:00.300 align:middle line:90%
And they're growing.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.320 align:middle line:84%
They're learning
from doing this.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.540 align:middle line:84%
You still have responsibility
when you delegate,

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.090 align:middle line:84%
but you don't actually
devote the time, necessarily,

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:06.490 align:middle line:90%
to do it.

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Phone call.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.120 align:middle line:90%
Have someone else to do that.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:90%
And that's so important.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.783 align:middle line:84%
And you could say--
you can look at it

00:18:11.783 --> 00:18:14.550 align:middle line:84%
as a way of helping other
people grow, which is true.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:16.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's another
really strong tip.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.340 align:middle line:84%
>> I think that it comes down--
especially for women, I think.

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:22.620 align:middle line:84%
We feel we have to do
everything so perfectly.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, that's a good one.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Getting in the car and
driving 6 miles to get

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.690 align:middle line:84%
something that's on sale that
you can buy in your corner

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:38.140 align:middle line:84%
grocery for $1 more is something
we feel obligated to do when

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:38.940 align:middle line:90%
we--

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.160 align:middle line:84%
why are we spending
all of that time?

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.175 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't really know.

00:18:42.175 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>> It's about being
a superwoman again.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:44.355 align:middle line:90%
>> It is.

00:18:44.355 --> 00:18:44.970 align:middle line:90%
It is.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:47.520 align:middle line:84%
And here's another piece that
goes right along with that--

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:52.860 align:middle line:84%
is that we don't either feel we
can, or whatever the reason is,

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.990 align:middle line:84%
to bring people--
help into the house--

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:55.950 align:middle line:90%
to the household.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, some people say, well,
I really can't afford this.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.840 align:middle line:84%
But it's almost-- if you're
working and trying to run

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.140 align:middle line:84%
a household, you almost
cannot afford to do this.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Or a simple thing like taking
the shirts out of the laundry,

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.370 align:middle line:84%
and paying $1 apiece
to have them done.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.170 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:10.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Instead of you trying to--

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:10.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Instead of--

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.450 align:middle line:90%
>> --sit there and iron them.

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>> --figuring you've
got to iron them.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:13.230 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.770 align:middle line:90%
That's correct.

00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:13.890 align:middle line:90%
That's--

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.500 align:middle line:84%
>> Or even wash them
and shake them out.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Mhm.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.393 align:middle line:90%
That is so true.

00:19:17.393 --> 00:19:18.810 align:middle line:84%
And you need to
free up yourself--

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.712 align:middle line:84%
there's some things you need
to do, and you want to do.

00:19:21.712 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:84%
That you want to have a
connection with the children.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:24.870 align:middle line:90%
You want to do certain things.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:27.287 align:middle line:84%
You don't necessarily want to
give up all of those things.

00:19:27.287 --> 00:19:28.460 align:middle line:90%
But there are some things--

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.502 align:middle line:84%
and I remember someone--
distinctly-- telling me,

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:33.210 align:middle line:84%
Celeste, with the kind
of schedule you have,

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.700 align:middle line:84%
and the running around, you
cannot afford to be doing

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.580 align:middle line:84%
housecleaning all
day long on Saturday.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:41.340 align:middle line:84%
You need to have a point where
you can rest and rejuvenate.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And you can't do that if you're
always working, or always doing

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:45.240 align:middle line:90%
something.

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:90%
Then some people you can hire.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:48.330 align:middle line:90%
It's worth it.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:49.740 align:middle line:90%
Turn down that dinner.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:53.010 align:middle line:84%
Instead of spending $25
there, or $50 that week--

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.140 align:middle line:84%
and pay someone to come
and do something for you.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:56.560 align:middle line:90%
It's invaluable.

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.360 align:middle line:90%
It really is.

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.530 align:middle line:90%
>> We feel guilty.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, that's true.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to have
to deal with our guilt,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.190 align:middle line:84%
or we're going to
deal with the stress--

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:03.065 align:middle line:90%
the remnants of that.

00:20:03.065 --> 00:20:04.560 align:middle line:90%
And that's really not healthy.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.817 align:middle line:84%
Because ultimately, if we get
burnt out, as we said before,

00:20:07.817 --> 00:20:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and you get to the point
where you can't function,

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.270 align:middle line:84%
that's worse than having someone
else to come in and do it.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:13.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Somebody cleans every day.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:13.800 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.600 align:middle line:90%
That's right.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.260 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want
to go out that way.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, I've seen many
people that I know,

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.690 align:middle line:84%
or people I've heard
of, that wait until they

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.140 align:middle line:84%
get some terminal illness,
or some crisis that they've

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.440 align:middle line:84%
heard about, or that they're
experiencing indirectly,

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.100 align:middle line:84%
or something comes up before
they pay attention, and realize

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:84%
that they must take
this time along the way

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:36.970 align:middle line:90%
to have-- to reduce the stress.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:37.770 align:middle line:90%
Stress is a killer.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Do you know, we have incredible
heart attack rate-- just

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.170 align:middle line:90%
continues to go up every year.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:84%
The drugs, and amphetamines, and
the different barbiturates that

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:49.560 align:middle line:90%
are prescribed are incredible--

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.600 align:middle line:84%
that we continue
to do these things,

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.160 align:middle line:84%
just pacifying ourselves,
when in essence,

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.460 align:middle line:84%
if we just did the fundamental
things of taking time

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.230 align:middle line:84%
to rejuvenate, taking
time to be quiet.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.340 align:middle line:90%
Don't answer that phone.

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.863 align:middle line:90%
Take that hour for yourself.

00:21:00.863 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Make an appointment
with yourself.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.992 align:middle line:90%
Put it in the date book.

00:21:03.992 --> 00:21:06.450 align:middle line:84%
>> There's so many things in
here that we could talk about,

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:08.940 align:middle line:84%
but that was a very
good suggestion, too--

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.240 align:middle line:84%
when you make out your
calendar for the month,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:14.330 align:middle line:84%
to actually put some
time in for yourself,

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:90%
say, from 2:00 to 4:00.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.060 align:middle line:90%
And make up somebody's name.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Whoever you want.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:20.720 align:middle line:90%
And keep that appointment.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And do not-- treat it
like an appointment.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:23.810 align:middle line:90%
Because it is.

00:21:23.810 --> 00:21:24.680 align:middle line:90%
And it's so important.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.170 align:middle line:84%
You're as important as any
other appointment that you have.

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:29.090 align:middle line:90%
You're more important, actually.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:30.560 align:middle line:90%
And so without that--

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:31.827 align:middle line:90%
go to the movies.

00:21:31.827 --> 00:21:32.660 align:middle line:90%
Do the things that--

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.702 align:middle line:90%
I mean, I didn't do that.

00:21:33.702 --> 00:21:35.450 align:middle line:90%
I had gotten so away from that.

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the things
that I really enjoyed.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:38.600 align:middle line:90%
And I worked in--

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.800 align:middle line:90%
I'm in business for myself.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.900 align:middle line:90%
And people often want to do.

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:43.640 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able
to have our own time.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, you get into working
for yourself and you realize,

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.480 align:middle line:84%
you really don't
have a lot of time,

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.188 align:middle line:84%
because everything is
dependent upon you.

00:21:49.188 --> 00:21:53.470 align:middle line:84%
But you must build in
that time to remember

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:56.360 align:middle line:84%
why you did this in the
beginning, and to enjoy life--

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.810 align:middle line:90%
to really make a difference.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.440 align:middle line:84%
And so I really urge
people to put them

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.910 align:middle line:90%
in their schedule-- at the top.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.123 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:03.123 --> 00:22:05.539 align:middle line:84%
>> What about putting in your
schedule to go into business

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:06.340 align:middle line:90%
for yourself?

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Do you recommend it
to somebody out there?

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:08.950 align:middle line:90%
Do you like it?

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:09.750 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, I love it.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:10.260 align:middle line:90%
I love it.

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:11.510 align:middle line:84%
And it's a lot of
responsibility.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.070 align:middle line:84%
It's not as easy as
many people think.

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.540 align:middle line:90%
But--

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.480 align:middle line:84%
>> You're the worst boss
you ever had, I bet.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:16.435 align:middle line:90%
>> I am.

00:22:16.435 --> 00:22:18.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm harder on myself
because it's my passion.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.288 align:middle line:90%
It's what I want to do.

00:22:19.288 --> 00:22:21.080 align:middle line:84%
And I think most people
that go in business

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:22.625 align:middle line:84%
for themselves do
what they really

00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:23.750 align:middle line:90%
want to do-- their purpose.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:25.850 align:middle line:84%
And that's really
key for me, as well.

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.370 align:middle line:84%
I think if we do
that, it's worth it.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:29.170 align:middle line:90%
It's worth it.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Golly, you've been
a real joy to have on.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
You look wonderful, so you
must be doing something right.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.922 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been talking
with Celeste Johnson,

00:22:35.922 --> 00:22:39.890 align:middle line:84%

and her workbook called "The

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:41.090 align:middle line:90%
Balancing Act."

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:43.190 align:middle line:84%
We bring you only
miracles on this show.

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.220 align:middle line:90%
