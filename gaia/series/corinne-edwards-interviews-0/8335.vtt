00:00:01.488 --> 00:00:04.960 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:31.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.250 align:middle line:10%
>> When I see patients
going through it,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:10%
and I see them healing.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.117 align:middle line:10%
So I feel like there
must be something to it.

00:00:39.117 --> 00:00:41.200 align:middle line:10%
But I don't know whether
to believe it right away,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.990 align:middle line:10%
and that person or not.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.000 align:middle line:10%
So I leave my mind open.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.380 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most bewildering
illnesses to you or anybody

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.290 align:middle line:10%
in your family, or people
you know, is mental illness.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Somehow, if you
have a broken bone,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:90%
you can find somebody to set it.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.730 align:middle line:84%
But this is elusive
to many, many families

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.459 align:middle line:90%
and to many, many people.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.820 align:middle line:84%
We have a board certified
psychiatrist with us

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.650 align:middle line:84%
today by the name
of Dr. Shakuntala

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Modi, who has written a
very controversial book.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.360 align:middle line:90%
No one else is helping.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.960 align:middle line:84%
Her book is called
"Remarkable Healings."

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.030 align:middle line:84%
And I think-- I'd like to ask
you to keep an open mind when

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.420 align:middle line:84%
you watch this show because
it's going to be different

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:90%
than you imagined.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.800 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Modi, thank
you very, very much

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.270 align:middle line:84%
for coming on
"Wisdom" television.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.690 align:middle line:84%
And I want to thank you
very much for writing

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.580 align:middle line:84%
such a remarkable book
called "Remarkable Healings,"

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.370 align:middle line:84%
because it's very different than
anything I've ever read before.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.810 align:middle line:84%
>> You are a board
certified psychiatrist,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:90%
a medical doctor--

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.945 align:middle line:90%
with classical training?

00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:03.542 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:03.542 --> 00:02:10.880 align:middle line:90%
>> What happened in your life?

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:10%
>> See, when I was doing
my psychiatric residency,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.150 align:middle line:10%
I at times felt very discouraged
because all the treatment

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.850 align:middle line:10%
methods which were available
to us didn't work on every

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.110 align:middle line:10%
patient.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:90%
Medicine works on some people.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.160 align:middle line:84%
It does correct the
chemical imbalance,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.470 align:middle line:90%
but then it doesn't really cure.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.750 align:middle line:90%
It just colors up the problem.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.432 align:middle line:84%
And people keep on--
continue to have symptoms.

00:02:34.432 --> 00:02:35.890 align:middle line:84%
As soon as they
start the medicine,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.410 align:middle line:84%
they continue to
have the problems.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.170 align:middle line:84%
Psychotherapy works but
not in every patient.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.530 align:middle line:84%
And also, with psychotherapy,
when we do the psychotherapy,

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.070 align:middle line:84%
patients are dealing with their
conscious mind, with what they

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.620 align:middle line:84%
know and understand
their problems

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.590 align:middle line:84%
consciously and
intellectually and rationally.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.670 align:middle line:84%
So they are dealing with
the conscious mind only.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.100 align:middle line:84%
What I'm understanding
is the reasons

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.150 align:middle line:84%
for our problems are in
our subconscious mind.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.290 align:middle line:84%
We may not know it
consciously, but it's there.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.410 align:middle line:84%
And I learned that
with hypnotherapy,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.850 align:middle line:84%
if I allow a patient to tap
into their subconscious mind,

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.580 align:middle line:84%
they can find the source
of their problems.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And the subconscious
mind can also

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.920 align:middle line:84%
provide the solution
and even the healing.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.670 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.640 align:middle line:84%
I prescribed the medicine,
very little medicine, only

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.750 align:middle line:84%
in psychotic patients or when
people are severely depressed.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Just with these therapies,
without much medication,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.710 align:middle line:90%
people heal from head to toe.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.800 align:middle line:90%
Any symptoms can go away.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.880 align:middle line:90%
What Is hypnotherapy?

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Hypnotherapy is--
hypnosis is a tool,

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.360 align:middle line:84%
and we use hypnosis
as a tool in therapy.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:90%
And it is called hypnotherapy.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And people have a lot of
misconceptions about hypnosis.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.750 align:middle line:84%
All hypnosis is is a state
of focus concentration.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.960 align:middle line:84%
We use this state of hypnosis
every day, several times a day

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.150 align:middle line:90%
in our life, every day.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.000 align:middle line:84%
Some of the examples
of day-to-day hypnosis

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.940 align:middle line:84%
is like when we are
driving on a highway,

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.269 align:middle line:90%
and we're driving and driving.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.540 align:middle line:84%
We're so focused
on the road, and we

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.360 align:middle line:84%
forget how many
streets we have crossed

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.460 align:middle line:90%
or how long we have driven.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.060 align:middle line:90%
And that is a state of hypnosis.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.907 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes we get
someplace, and we don't

00:04:26.907 --> 00:04:27.990 align:middle line:90%
remember how we got there.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Exactly, and we reach
to our destination and say,

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.650 align:middle line:90%
how did I get here?

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.213 align:middle line:90%
I forgot.

00:04:33.213 --> 00:04:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Other times, when we are
watching a television

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.603 align:middle line:84%
show, and we are so
absorbed in the story

00:04:38.603 --> 00:04:40.520 align:middle line:84%
that there may be a group
of people behind us,

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.630 align:middle line:90%
around us talking out loud.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.930 align:middle line:84%
We know they're there, but we
haven't heard a single word.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.270 align:middle line:90%
That is a state of hypnosis.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.190 align:middle line:84%
Similarly, when we are reading
a book or listening to music,

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.510 align:middle line:84%
we are absorbed in it, and
we are not paying attention

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.070 align:middle line:90%
to anything else.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Another example is when
people are fantasizing,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:84%
they are not asleep,
not unconscious,

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.190 align:middle line:84%
but they are focusing on
whatever they're fantasizing.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.660 align:middle line:90%
That is a state of hypnosis.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.310 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you do this?

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.700 align:middle line:90%
>> How do I do what?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.500 align:middle line:90%
Do what?

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:90%
>> Hypnosis.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, OK.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.240 align:middle line:90%
There are different ways.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.410 align:middle line:84%
That are many
hypnosis techniques

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.120 align:middle line:90%
which therapists can use.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.780 align:middle line:84%
Personally, I like to use--
when people come to my office,

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.390 align:middle line:84%
often they are
feeling or sensing

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.657 align:middle line:84%
some emotional feelings,
some physical symptoms.

00:05:27.657 --> 00:05:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Or they, sometimes,
when I do the interview,

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.860 align:middle line:84%
they repeat certain
phrases over and over,

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.070 align:middle line:90%
certain words, certain phrases.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.240 align:middle line:84%
And all I ask them
during the session

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.190 align:middle line:90%
is focus on your thoughts.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Focus on those words.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:90%
Repeat those words.

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Like what words?

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.650 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's say, oh, when
I'm in his presence,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.660 align:middle line:84%
he makes me feel
like I'm nothing.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.437 align:middle line:84%
I feel like a prisoner
in his presence,

00:05:47.437 --> 00:05:49.270 align:middle line:84%
or whatever the issues
they're dealing with.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.540 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like a circular--

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:90%
Or I'm too fat.

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.700 align:middle line:90%
I can never look good again.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm just not good enough.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm hopeless.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.520 align:middle line:84%
I'm not good enough for him,
or I cannot do anything right

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.320 align:middle line:90%
for him.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're going over and
over with the same feelings.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.570 align:middle line:84%
Or sometimes if they're having
some physical symptoms--

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.030 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling kind of dizzy,
I'm having palpitations.

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.210 align:middle line:84%
or I'm feeling chest
pain, having a headache.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.100 align:middle line:84%
Or I feel like I'm
being tied down,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.050 align:middle line:84%
or I'm feeling
numbness in my hand,

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.660 align:middle line:84%
and I just ask them,
focus on those feelings.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Let those feelings take you back
to the source of the problem.

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Ah, this is different.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> And see, what it is is, when
people are in hypnosis are when

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.670 align:middle line:84%
we ask them to focus
on the feelings.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.768 align:middle line:84%
And as they are focusing,
they're already in hypnosis.

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:90%
>> So you don't have to be out.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.350 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And see, the misconception
about hypnosis

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.410 align:middle line:84%
is people think in hypnosis
people are out of control,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.060 align:middle line:90%
unconscious, or they're asleep.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Now the states I described
to you, day-to-day hypnosis,

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.660 align:middle line:84%
we are not unconscious
when we are driving.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:53.780 align:middle line:84%
We are not unconscious when we
are watching a television show

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.980 align:middle line:90%
or reading a book.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But we are in a
state of hypnosis.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Are people afraid of this?

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because of
the misconceptions.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.490 align:middle line:84%
So first thing I do, the second
session after the history

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.800 align:middle line:84%
and all that, is we talk about
hypnosis, the misconception.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.180 align:middle line:84%
What is their idea
about hypnosis?

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And then I help them in
understanding what it really is

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.840 align:middle line:84%
and what they will experience
here, that I don't do--

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.430 align:middle line:84%
I don't give them
any suggestions

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.500 align:middle line:90%
during the sessions.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.690 align:middle line:84%
I ask them to focus
on their feelings.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.608 align:middle line:84%
Let those feelings take you back
to the source of the problem.

00:07:26.608 --> 00:07:27.650 align:middle line:90%
>> When it first started?

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Now this is the
interesting part.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.705 align:middle line:90%
What have you found, then?

00:07:32.705 --> 00:07:34.490 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing things.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.090 align:middle line:84%
For a long time, I did
psychotherapy, a combination

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:40.850 align:middle line:84%
of therapies, because
I learned everything,

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.410 align:middle line:84%
because not every patient
is good for psychotherapy.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:84%
You cannot do traditional
psychotherapy with them.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.140 align:middle line:84%
You cannot use medication
with every patient,

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.600 align:middle line:84%
so we have to use
combination of therapies.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.220 align:middle line:84%
And hypnotherapy
is one technique

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.370 align:middle line:84%
I used often,
because we can really

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.620 align:middle line:90%
find the source of the problem.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.520 align:middle line:84%
But till about 13
years ago, I had

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.340 align:middle line:84%
one patient who came with
severe claustrophobia.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.380 align:middle line:84%
She had depression
for a long time.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And she also described having
some severe panic attacks

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:15.350 align:middle line:90%
several times a day.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And during these
panic attacks, she

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:84%
described having shortness of
breath, palpitation, dizziness,

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:23.870 align:middle line:90%
and fear of dying.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.100 align:middle line:84%
But at the same time, she
said, I know it sounds funny.

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.220 align:middle line:84%
I'm afraid of dying, but
I'm afraid I cannot die--

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.299 align:middle line:90%
I will not be able to die.

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.080 align:middle line:84%
And she said, I know
it sounds crazy,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.159 align:middle line:90%
but that's the way I feel.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And I am the kind
of psychiatrist

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:42.260 align:middle line:84%
who doesn't like to put her
interpretation on the patients,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.580 align:middle line:90%
what they are saying.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.260 align:middle line:84%
It's like, who am I to tell this
patient what they are feeling.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.000 align:middle line:90%
So I just ask.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.010 align:middle line:84%
And one session,
I was asking her,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.620 align:middle line:84%
I said, when was the last
time you had panic attack?

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.022 align:middle line:84%
And all of a sudden, she
started gasping for breath.

00:08:57.022 --> 00:08:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Doctor,
I'm having one now,

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.650 align:middle line:84%
and she was having
full-blown panic attack.

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.530 align:middle line:84%
So I said, good,
close your eyes.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.840 align:middle line:84%
Feel the full-blown
panic attack.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Feel every feeling, and let
those feelings take you back

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.950 align:middle line:90%
to the source of the problem.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And as I was asking
her, I was in my mind

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.990 align:middle line:84%
thinking maybe she'll go back
to the younger age, when she was

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.840 align:middle line:84%
locked in the attic
or basement or closet,

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
because these are the
stories which came before.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.050 align:middle line:84%
But instead, she instantly
said, Doctor, I'm

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.430 align:middle line:90%
in another time, another life.

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.360 align:middle line:90%
I'm a different person.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:34.800 align:middle line:84%
I'm a little girl-- a young
girl, and I'm in a coffin.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.270 align:middle line:84%
People think I'm dead,
but I'm still alive,

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.030 align:middle line:84%
and what if they close
the lid, and I cannot die?

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:90%
[GASPS] What am I going to do?

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.570 align:middle line:90%
Can you understand the symptoms?

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.873 align:middle line:84%
The fear of closing the lid
and not being able to breathe.

00:09:48.873 --> 00:09:50.790 align:middle line:84%
>> That must've been a
pretty big shock to you

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.242 align:middle line:84%
as a classically
trained psychiatrist,

00:09:53.242 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:84%
to have somebody
go to a past life.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, none of my patients
before went in a past life--

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Did you believe
in past lives?

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:02.880 align:middle line:84%
>> My religion believes in it,
but I am the kind of person--

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.830 align:middle line:90%
it's like beliefs are beliefs.

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.720 align:middle line:84%
I don't know whether
it is real or not.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.360 align:middle line:84%
So I don't dismiss them, but I
don't live with that every day,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.160 align:middle line:90%
day by day.

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>> But you certainly didn't
expect a patient to go

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:14.630 align:middle line:90%
to a past life?

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:15.990 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.930 align:middle line:84%
And when this one went,
I didn't know what to do.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So like a good psychiatrist,
I let her continue the story.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.500 align:middle line:84%
Who am I to question
her story right now?

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.740 align:middle line:84%
So I let her describe me,
tell me what happens next.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:10%
And she said they did close
the lid of the coffin,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.120 align:middle line:10%
and she died feeling short
of breath, fear of dying,

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:10%
but at the same time had
the fear that you will not

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.860 align:middle line:10%
be able to die.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.410 align:middle line:10%
So same feelings, symptoms
which she was describing before

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.770 align:middle line:10%
during the first interview,
she was feeling at that moment.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.170 align:middle line:84%
We're talking to Dr. Modi, who
has written a remarkable book.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:57.070 align:middle line:84%
And oddly enough, it's
called "Remarkable Healings--

00:10:57.070 --> 00:11:01.530 align:middle line:84%
A Psychiatrist Discovers
Unsuspected Roots

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.020 align:middle line:90%
of Mental and Physical Illness.

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.437 align:middle line:84%
We have much more to tell
you about, so stay with us.

00:11:07.437 --> 00:11:08.270 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:17.880 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:23.180 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to Dr.
Shakuntala Modi, who is

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.280 align:middle line:90%
a board certified psychiatrist.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.640 align:middle line:84%
And she has written a book
called "Remarkable Healings,"

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:34.000 align:middle line:90%
and it's pretty remarkable.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.150 align:middle line:84%
To read this book, you would
think that you were part

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.760 align:middle line:84%
of what a lot of people call
the "woo-woo consciousness

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.560 align:middle line:90%
movement."

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.220 align:middle line:84%
But this is not
true at all is it?

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.300 align:middle line:84%
It is accidentally
I discovered this.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.620 align:middle line:90%
It has nothing to do with that.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Do you believe it?

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.580 align:middle line:10%
>> When I see patients
going through it,

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.150 align:middle line:10%
and I see them healing.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.477 align:middle line:10%
So I feel like there
must be something to it.

00:11:57.477 --> 00:11:59.560 align:middle line:84%
But I don't know whether
to believe it right away,

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.430 align:middle line:90%
and that person or not.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.460 align:middle line:90%
So I leave my mind open.

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.960 align:middle line:84%
>> But at the
beginning of the show,

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.260 align:middle line:84%
I asked the audience to
please keep their mind open

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.760 align:middle line:84%
because there are some startling
things that you have to say

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.710 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:15.370 align:middle line:84%
When they get back
to the place where

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:19.990 align:middle line:84%
she has now somehow flipped
back into another life,

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:24.020 align:middle line:84%
and she's in this
coffin, how does that

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.232 align:middle line:90%
cure her in the present?

00:12:26.232 --> 00:12:27.700 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:29.470 align:middle line:84%
When she described
the feelings when

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:33.610 align:middle line:84%
they closed the lid and
her last thoughts-- the way

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:35.530 align:middle line:84%
it works with the
past life trauma

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:40.150 align:middle line:84%
is what people describe is that
we have a soul within us, which

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:90%
is a piece of God.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And when the body dies,
the soul doesn't die.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.930 align:middle line:90%
It survives.

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.840 align:middle line:84%
It has all the memories,
feelings, and experiences.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.070 align:middle line:84%
So let's say somebody died in
a past life, like this lady.

00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And she died with
coffin being closed,

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:59.650 align:middle line:84%
is still alive, and is
struggling with her breathing

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:01.420 align:middle line:90%
and other things.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.840 align:middle line:84%
So the last thoughts,
I cannot breathe.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.150 align:middle line:84%
At the same time, the fear,
what if they close the lid?

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:10.370 align:middle line:90%
I cannot die.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.370 align:middle line:84%
Our last thoughts, promises,
unresolved promises,

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:84%
unresolved physical
symptoms, mental symptoms,

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.560 align:middle line:84%
emotional symptoms,
they come back

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.000 align:middle line:90%
with the soul in this life.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.420 align:middle line:84%
And those feelings
are never resolved,

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:28.880 align:middle line:84%
so people start feeling
that in their physical body.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.880 align:middle line:84%
And I think this patient
must have seen somebody

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.840 align:middle line:84%
in a coffin in a funeral home,
and it triggers the memories

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.370 align:middle line:90%
of that experience.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:41.730 align:middle line:84%
Now unless we resolve those
feelings, medicine cannot help,

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:45.680 align:middle line:84%
just at this conscious level,
psychotherapy cannot help.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:48.080 align:middle line:90%
The trauma has to be resolved.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.520 align:middle line:84%
>> But do you do dissolve the
trauma by talking about it

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.900 align:middle line:90%
as though it's happening now?

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, by recalling, going back
to the source, recalling it,

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:03.240 align:middle line:84%
reliving it, releasing it,
and resolving the issue.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.090 align:middle line:84%
And if there is somebody
that did harm to the person,

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:07.910 align:middle line:90%
they have to forgive the person.

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.650 align:middle line:84%
And then there is lot
more things happen,

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.530 align:middle line:84%
like missing the soul
parts, that the trauma will

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.903 align:middle line:90%
lose pieces of our soul.

00:14:14.903 --> 00:14:16.320 align:middle line:84%
And so we have to
bring that back.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.820 align:middle line:90%
It's very extensive area.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.300 align:middle line:84%
>> What do you mean, we
lose pieces of our soul?

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, what patients under
hypnosis describe is that,

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:28.700 align:middle line:84%
as I described the soul within
us, piece of God within us.

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And with trauma, whether it is
physical, emotional, mental,

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.920 align:middle line:84%
or spiritual, our
soul fragments,

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.870 align:middle line:90%
and the pieces come out.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:42.840 align:middle line:84%
Now some of the soul parts
can remain in the body.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.240 align:middle line:84%
And these are the
ones people see

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:84%
as the little one,
themselves at that age,

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:49.310 align:middle line:84%
at the age when the
trauma occurred.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.470 align:middle line:90%
They look exactly the same.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.690 align:middle line:84%
They feel the same as
they felt at that time.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:57.380 align:middle line:84%
Other times, they can go
to outside of her body.

00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.090 align:middle line:90%
They can go to a loved one.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.550 align:middle line:90%
They can go to friend.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.590 align:middle line:84%
They can go to abuser,
in case of abuse.

00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:06.993 align:middle line:84%
>> When people talk about
giving themselves away?

00:15:06.993 --> 00:15:07.910 align:middle line:90%
Is that what it means?

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.640 align:middle line:84%
>> See how many times
we talk emotionally.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.450 align:middle line:84%
Like when my daughter left, I
felt she took a piece of me.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Or, when my husband died, I
felt like I died with him,

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.080 align:middle line:90%
or so many--

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:22.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Or you hear people say,
something just went out of me.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.460 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.252 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, I've heard
many people say that.

00:15:25.252 --> 00:15:26.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I feel like I'm empty inside.

00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.170 align:middle line:84%
I feel like something
is missing from me.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:32.880 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we are
talking at subconscious level

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:36.380 align:middle line:90%
is it's my piece is missing.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:38.680 align:middle line:90%
>> And does that make us sick?

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.930 align:middle line:90%
>> Does that make them sick?

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:40.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.470 align:middle line:84%
See, what happens is,
let's say, somebody

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.870 align:middle line:84%
was sexually abused
in this lifetime

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and gone through
tremendous trauma.

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.350 align:middle line:84%
Every time the abuse
happens, the little one's--

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.680 align:middle line:84%
the soul fragments separates
and stays in the body.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:00.190 align:middle line:84%
They're still suffering
with those emotions.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But they are separate, so the
main soul, or main personality,

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.570 align:middle line:84%
may not remember the trauma
because that emotional part is

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:10.980 align:middle line:84%
separated from the main
soul, or main personality.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.810 align:middle line:84%
So they may not have any
effect all their life.

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:15.670 align:middle line:84%
Or maybe occasionally,
the things

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:19.210 align:middle line:84%
pop up in the mind, the
memories, the trauma.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:21.250 align:middle line:90%
Or they may not remember at all.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:22.940 align:middle line:84%
But oftentimes, it
does affect them,

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.940 align:middle line:84%
because the part is
separated from the main part

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.000 align:middle line:90%
of your soul.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.756 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you get it back?

00:16:26.756 --> 00:16:29.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Usually, people can see
when we do the therapy.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.210 align:middle line:90%
I ask them to look inside.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:84%
And after a while, they
are able to see their soul.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.470 align:middle line:84%
They're able to see
those little ones.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:90%
And we talk to them.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.310 align:middle line:84%
No matter what I do, whether
it's a past life regression

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.610 align:middle line:90%
therapy, or the soul fragment.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:42.580 align:middle line:90%
We work with that.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:45.640 align:middle line:84%
We have to do psychotherapy
with those little ones,

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:90%
the inner child, which we call.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.190 align:middle line:84%
>> But the people
who have the pieces?

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.857 align:middle line:84%
>> You would have to actually
deal with that trauma.

00:16:52.857 --> 00:16:53.940 align:middle line:90%
These are the little ones.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:57.380 align:middle line:84%
They look like little
kids at that age

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.840 align:middle line:90%
when the trauma happened.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.520 align:middle line:90%
So we have to talk to them.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.800 align:middle line:84%
We have to do therapy
with them, help them

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:07.420 align:middle line:84%
in resolving their trauma,
cleanse them, heal them,

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.069 align:middle line:90%
fill them with light.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:10.960 align:middle line:90%
>> You're like an Indian shaman.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.214 align:middle line:84%
>> [CHUCKLES] I don't
know what they do, but--

00:17:13.214 --> 00:17:14.589 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, they do
soul retrievals.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Shamans do soul
retrievals, right.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.319 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the type of thing.

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:22.420 align:middle line:84%
So it's very surprising to see
a board certified psychiatrist

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.390 align:middle line:90%
talking about--

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.723 align:middle line:84%
what you're really doing is
soul retrievals, aren't you?

00:17:25.723 --> 00:17:26.900 align:middle line:90%
>> In a way, yes.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.070 align:middle line:84%
But see, I learn just
by asking questions.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.600 align:middle line:90%
As I good psychiatrist, all--

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.370 align:middle line:84%
>> This was not your
mindset at all before.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.170 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.060 align:middle line:90%
It is not part of my training.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.840 align:middle line:84%
It's not part of my-- except
the past life in reincarnation,

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.740 align:middle line:84%
nothing is part of my
religious belief system.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.160 align:middle line:84%
This is all just by asking
questions to the patients

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.600 align:middle line:90%
under hypnosis.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:84%
And the information came
through their subconscious mind,

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.100 align:middle line:84%
and just dealing with
it, and learning from it.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.120 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that you
keep saying in the book is,

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.990 align:middle line:84%
don't ask me whether
I even believe this.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.180 align:middle line:84%
The only thing you should
ask me is, does this work?

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:06.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:08.240 align:middle line:90%
>> And the answer is yes.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.340 align:middle line:90%
It works.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.360 align:middle line:84%
So when somebody's heart
has been given away,

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.340 align:middle line:90%
and I can see--

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.230 align:middle line:84%
I think anyone who is
watching this program

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.900 align:middle line:84%
has had that experience
of feeling they have

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:90%
lost something of themselves.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.150 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you get it back?

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Usually, I use angelic help.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Under hypnosis,
people often describe

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:36.720 align:middle line:84%
having angels, especially
when I work with the spirits.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:42.030 align:middle line:84%
And they describe the
light coming from heaven,

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.460 align:middle line:84%
and they describe angelic
beings in the heaven.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.110 align:middle line:84%
And a lot of information
and knowledge

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.110 align:middle line:84%
which I have written in
the book, it came directly

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:84%
by asking these beings,
what is the reality?

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.510 align:middle line:90%
What do we need to do?

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:84%
And they say, we are
always here to help you,

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.760 align:middle line:90%
but you have to ask.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.110 align:middle line:84%
And so what I ask is I ask the
angelic beings to take this--

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.160 align:middle line:84%
or if my part is with
somebody, bring my part back.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.530 align:middle line:84%
Then after they
did find the part,

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:12.530 align:middle line:84%
we have to cleanse it, heal it,
fill it with love and light.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:84%
That does the healing
of the soul part,

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.280 align:middle line:84%
and then integrate
it with the ---

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.165 align:middle line:84%
>> Are angels part
of your heritage?

00:19:19.165 --> 00:19:21.050 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:21.050 --> 00:19:25.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, you're a strange
character for a board certified

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.290 align:middle line:84%
psychiatrist, also who comes
from an Indian background.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.810 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I mean, none of these things
are in your consciousness

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:90%
to start with at all.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:34.750 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.760 align:middle line:84%
>> So everything is what
you've discovered through

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.560 align:middle line:90%
your patients.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.523 align:middle line:84%
And it felt right,
for some reason.

00:19:40.523 --> 00:19:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, truth is
truth, isn't it?

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.040 align:middle line:84%
And because people
healed, and nothing

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:84%
we have so far heals
people like that.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.440 align:middle line:84%
>> How did you happen
to talk to the angels?

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.180 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, after I discovered
about the past life traumas,

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.520 align:middle line:84%
how they cause the
problem for people,

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.440 align:middle line:90%
I started using this technique.

00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.020 align:middle line:84%
And I found out many
people across the country

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.890 align:middle line:84%
are doing what they call "past
life regression therapy."

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So I started doing
this therapy and people

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.940 align:middle line:84%
started healing--
anything from head to toe,

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.690 align:middle line:84%
they started healing
with it, whether it's

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.820 align:middle line:90%
physical, emotional, or mental.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.610 align:middle line:84%
So one day, I saw a patient
who had severe depression

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.080 align:middle line:90%
for several months.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And she also had abdominal pain,
and she had all the tests done.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.320 align:middle line:90%
They were all negative.

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.240 align:middle line:84%
She was taking medicine, but
nothing was helping at all.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.310 align:middle line:90%
So one day, she asked--

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:90%
she knew that I do hypnotherapy.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So she said, Doctor, would you
like to try hypnotherapy on me

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.120 align:middle line:90%
to find out what's the cause?

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:40.930 align:middle line:90%
So I said, OK.

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.560 align:middle line:84%
And I asked her again to
focus on her symptoms.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.920 align:middle line:84%
Let those feelings take you back
to the source of the problem.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.740 align:middle line:10%
Now when I ask people to go
to the source of the problem,

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:51.797 align:middle line:10%
they can go anywhere.

00:20:51.797 --> 00:20:53.380 align:middle line:10%
I have no idea what
they will tell me.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.440 align:middle line:84%
>> You don't know
where they're going.

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.830 align:middle line:84%
>> They can go to the trauma
at this time in the younger age

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:90%
in this life.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.560 align:middle line:90%
They can go to the birth trauma.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.870 align:middle line:84%
They can go to the
trauma in the womb.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:05.980 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is fetuses
have conscious awareness.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.960 align:middle line:84%
They're aware of the
mother's feeling.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.510 align:middle line:84%
And everything Mother is
feeling and experiencing,

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.566 align:middle line:84%
they absorb it as
their own feelings.

00:21:12.566 --> 00:21:14.983 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the most fascinating
thing in the entire world.

00:21:14.983 --> 00:21:17.530 align:middle line:90%
>> We are shifting from the ---

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We've been talking here
to Dr. Shakuntala Modi,

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:26.300 align:middle line:84%
who has written a book
called "Remarkable Healings."

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.270 align:middle line:84%
It's very different than
any book I have ever

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
read on psychological healing,
and especially by a classically

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.840 align:middle line:90%
trained psychiatrist.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll find
it very interesting.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.850 align:middle line:84%
But as I always tell
you on this show,

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:84%
we bring you
miracles around here.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.820 align:middle line:90%
Keep coming back.
