00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.470 align:middle line:10%
>> The dark knight of the soul
is defined as a time that comes

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.760 align:middle line:10%
in almost everyone's life--
unless you're very fortunate--

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.630 align:middle line:10%
when everything that you've
ever loved or held dear is gone.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.970 align:middle line:10%
You might come home someday
and your family, your job,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.740 align:middle line:10%
your house, your car,
everything is gone.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.590 align:middle line:10%
And in that moment, we're
pushed to the very edge

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.730 align:middle line:10%
of who we believe we are.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.640 align:middle line:10%
>> Is it possible that you and
I are praying the wrong way?

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.390 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, sometimes
I wonder because I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.280 align:middle line:90%
don't get my prayers answered.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.860 align:middle line:84%
We're going to find out
more about that today.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.280 align:middle line:84%
We have Gregg Braden who
is the author of "Walking

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.800 align:middle line:84%
Between The Worlds,"
and we're going

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.867 align:middle line:90%
to talk about prayer today.

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:11.700 align:middle line:90%
Welcome to the show.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.730 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.290 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Corinne.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.082 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, before
we get into prayer,

00:01:15.082 --> 00:01:17.790 align:middle line:84%
I just wanted to get everybody's
attention there because we all

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.500 align:middle line:84%
worry about whether
we're doing it right.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.500 align:middle line:90%
>> You got my attention.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.170 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.690 align:middle line:84%
Tell us a little bit about
yourself and your work,

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.005 align:middle line:84%
and what you're particularly
interested in now.

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:32.730 align:middle line:10%
>> My passion in this moment
is finding the language

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.590 align:middle line:10%
and the means to share what I
believe is a very relevant body

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.400 align:middle line:10%
of information, although it is
very ancient at the same time,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.760 align:middle line:10%
some of the information was lost
to the west over 1,700 years

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.600 align:middle line:10%
ago.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.430 align:middle line:84%
Bringing this body
of information

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.360 align:middle line:84%
to bear, to provide a context
and framework within which

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.440 align:middle line:84%
to view all of the outrageous
social, political, economic,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
natural phenomenon that we're
seeing in our world today.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And to move through
those changes with grace.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.102 align:middle line:90%
>> What was lost, Gregg?

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:84%
>> 1,700 years ago,
in the year 325 AD,

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
there were tremendous pieces of
our most sacred heritage that

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.120 align:middle line:90%
were taken from our texts.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.880 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, this
transcends religion.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.520 align:middle line:84%
This is historical information,
although much of it

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:84%
was recorded in what later
became biblical texts.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.320 align:middle line:84%
We know that at
least 25 books were

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.910 align:middle line:84%
lost from our biblical text, at
least 20 additional documents.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.830 align:middle line:84%
And the ones that
were left were poorly

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.380 align:middle line:84%
translated into the
languages of the west.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.180 align:middle line:84%
At later time, I
like to call it maybe

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
we got the Reader's
Digest condensed version

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.710 align:middle line:84%
because you can literally
take the ancient texts

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and our modern version,
place them side by side,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.330 align:middle line:84%
and see what we may have the
first, the last sentence,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.230 align:middle line:84%
and the good stuff in between
in many cases is missing.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.373 align:middle line:90%
>> So where is it?

00:02:49.373 --> 00:02:50.290 align:middle line:90%
Is it being found now?

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's interesting.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.697 align:middle line:84%
It's the basis of
the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:02:53.697 --> 00:02:55.280 align:middle line:84%
maybe one of the
reasons why we're not

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.610 align:middle line:84%
being allowed to see the
scrolls, the translations,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:59.900 align:middle line:90%
and their entirety.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.080 align:middle line:84%
Some of them were
copyrighted in 1993.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:90%
It is also found--

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.050 align:middle line:84%
a body of information this
solid and this relevant,

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I knew would never be
left to a single people

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.040 align:middle line:90%
in the single text.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.438 align:middle line:84%
I expected to see it in
many different places.

00:03:15.438 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:90%
And as we've searched, we have.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.070 align:middle line:84%
We've found that in the great
libraries of St. Catherine's

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.940 align:middle line:90%
Monastery in Mt.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:20.900 align:middle line:90%
Sinai.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.100 align:middle line:90%
We've found it in Ethiopia.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:84%
We've found it certainly
in the Nag Hammadi Library.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.370 align:middle line:84%
We've found it in indigenous
North and South American

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:84%
traditions, as well as in some
of the great libraries of what

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.170 align:middle line:90%
today are Central Tibet.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us about your
recent trip to Tibet.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.870 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it was an
amazing journey.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.490 align:middle line:84%
In April of this year, of '98,
I had the opportunity to journey

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.060 align:middle line:84%
with a small group
into Central Tibet

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.250 align:middle line:84%
for the purpose
of what I believed

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.080 align:middle line:84%
would be to identify fragments
of this ancient wisdom that

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.240 align:middle line:84%
had been carried in
the Tibetan traditions

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and preserved through
their isolation.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.010 align:middle line:84%
The Ancient Essenes,
the authors of Dead Sea

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.430 align:middle line:84%
Scrolls in the
Qumran Area, we know

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.940 align:middle line:84%
dispersed 500 years
after the crucifixion

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.160 align:middle line:84%
into many parts of the world,
and Tibet was certainly

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.870 align:middle line:90%
one of those.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.050 align:middle line:84%
The intent was rather than
speculating through a written

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.670 align:middle line:84%
text what may be inferred
was to actually speak

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.670 align:middle line:84%
to those people who were
living those traditions

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.330 align:middle line:84%
and saying to them in the
matter of prayer, for example.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.780 align:middle line:84%
Now that we have seen your
tones, and your chants,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.335 align:middle line:84%
and your mudras that you're
doing on the outside,

00:04:35.335 --> 00:04:37.420 align:middle line:84%
what happened to
you on the inside?

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.030 align:middle line:84%
What were you doing
when we witnessed those?

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.100 align:middle line:84%
And through our guides
and our interpreters,

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.320 align:middle line:84%
there were 15 monasteries
and nunneries.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.070 align:middle line:84%
We had the opportunity to
interact with these people.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And lo and behold, they
validated my suspicion

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.820 align:middle line:84%
that they were actually
living fragments

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.210 align:middle line:84%
of these Ancient Essene
traditions, this wisdom that

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.830 align:middle line:90%
was lost 1,700 years ago.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.855 align:middle line:90%
>> Were there any texts there?

00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:05.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, yes, there
were many texts.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.025 align:middle line:84%
We were there three weeks,
altitudes over 17,500 feet

00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:10.825 align:middle line:90%
in the Himalayas.

00:05:10.825 --> 00:05:11.770 align:middle line:90%
>> Slept a lot.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.960 align:middle line:84%
>> I live 8,000 feet in
the northern New Mexico

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.760 align:middle line:90%
in the mountains.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.680 align:middle line:84%
And this 17,000 feet,
it's a different world.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.340 align:middle line:84%
What we discovered,
some of the highest,

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.970 align:middle line:84%
least disturbed monasteries
through a series of very

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.670 align:middle line:84%
heartfelt interactions with
the monks that were there,

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.550 align:middle line:84%
they shared with
us their libraries

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.820 align:middle line:84%
that actually of all the
things that Tibetans represent

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.140 align:middle line:84%
to us as anchors of
compassion, love, and wisdom,

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.620 align:middle line:84%
they're tremendous
record keepers.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.330 align:middle line:84%
And they don't
judge the records.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.180 align:middle line:84%
They have Christian records
as well as Buddhist records

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.960 align:middle line:84%
as well as the records of
their ancient traditions.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.330 align:middle line:84%
They didn't lose that
information 1,700 years ago.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.960 align:middle line:84%
So from their
perspective, they know

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.480 align:middle line:84%
that this is a rare precious
moment in human history

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.150 align:middle line:90%
and that compassion is so key.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And that there is an
ancient technology that

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.240 align:middle line:84%
lives within each of us
that has a direct impact,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.550 align:middle line:84%
a direct linear
measurable impact

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.580 align:middle line:84%
on the outcome of the events
in the world around us.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.740 align:middle line:84%
Today, we call that
technology prayer.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.140 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is what was
in the text that we lost?

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.470 align:middle line:90%
>> Many of the texts.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:21.832 align:middle line:90%
And when I speak about prayer.

00:06:21.832 --> 00:06:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Prayer, it's a very
personal thing.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.207 align:middle line:84%
It means different things
to different people.

00:06:25.207 --> 00:06:29.230 align:middle line:84%
Western researchers today
identify four modes of prayer

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that we use either alone or
in some combination with one

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.550 align:middle line:90%
another.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.530 align:middle line:84%
Ancient traditions
have always described

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.340 align:middle line:84%
another mode that didn't seem
to fit into any of those.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And it led me to
ask the question,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.870 align:middle line:90%
is there another mode?

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Is there a fifth mode
or lost mode of prayer?

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.060 align:middle line:84%
From our time in
Tibetan from these texts

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.360 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient scholars, what
we know as the answer to that

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.635 align:middle line:90%
is yes.

00:06:50.635 --> 00:06:51.820 align:middle line:90%
>> But the way--

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.400 align:middle line:84%
we found that the
way I pray if I say,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:90%
God, I know you're very busy.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.930 align:middle line:90%
So I know this is the problem.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.320 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, God,
this is the answer.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.180 align:middle line:90%
>> [LAUGHS]

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> [LAUGHS] And by the way, I
don't want to bother you with.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.990 align:middle line:90%
Just get it for me.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.060 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that's the
way most of us pray.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.170 align:middle line:90%
We tell God what to do.

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.230 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Western traditions,
many of our prayers are prayers

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:17.380 align:middle line:84%
of asking where we are
conditioned to feel powerless

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:24.800 align:middle line:84%
in a situation or helpless and
we ask for divine intervention

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.990 align:middle line:84%
or we petition that
something come to pass.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.340 align:middle line:84%
The four modes of prayer
is the colloquial prayer,

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.190 align:middle line:84%
a petitionary prayer,
a ritualistic prayer,

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.050 align:middle line:90%
and meditative prayer.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:40.510 align:middle line:84%
And this mode of prayer is so
clearly different than those.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a prayer that is based
in the emotion and the feeling

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.660 align:middle line:84%
that the prayer has already
come to pass rather than asking

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.640 align:middle line:90%
that something happen.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.220 align:middle line:84%
I'll back up just a little
bit and give some examples.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.210 align:middle line:84%
When we're asking that something
come to pass, please God,

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:00.760 align:middle line:84%
let my car get to the
Texaco station at 2 o'clock

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.070 align:middle line:84%
in the morning before
it runs out of gas.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.840 align:middle line:84%
This once, I'll
never do this again.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.210 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's an asking.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:11.530 align:middle line:84%
We're implying that it
doesn't have gas in the tank.

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:13.570 align:middle line:84%
So in our asking, our
prayers for global peace,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:16.720 align:middle line:84%
we're saying maybe that
peace doesn't exist right now

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.870 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps unknowingly
perpetuating that state

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.710 align:middle line:90%
of affairs on the one hand.

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:24.550 align:middle line:84%
The lost mode of prayer,
rather than using the logic

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:27.895 align:middle line:84%
in the thought, invites us to
come from a place of emotion

00:08:27.895 --> 00:08:29.770 align:middle line:84%
that our prayers have
already been fulfilled,

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.840 align:middle line:84%
that peace already
exists in the world,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.985 align:middle line:84%
that gas is already
in that tank.

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:36.789 align:middle line:84%
>> This is interesting because
what you're saying is that

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:84%
the universe is pretty
neutral, that it will answer us

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.480 align:middle line:84%
according to the vibration
that we put out there.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.690 align:middle line:84%
>> This is the beginning
of an ancient technology.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.480 align:middle line:84%
It was relegated to priesthood
into the mystery schools

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.778 align:middle line:90%
1,700 years ago.

00:08:52.778 --> 00:08:55.320 align:middle line:84%
Prior to that time, apparently,
the average man in the street

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.990 align:middle line:90%
knew this.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.280 align:middle line:84%
And for whatever
reason, the year 325 AD,

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.960 align:middle line:90%
we began to forget.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And my question is
when did we begin

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.930 align:middle line:84%
to believe that to
create in this world,

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:09.420 align:middle line:84%
that we would have to ask that
come to pass on the one hand

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.690 align:middle line:84%
rather than having the thoughts,
feelings, and the emotions

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:18.320 align:middle line:84%
to allow creation to
build our hearts desire?

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.720 align:middle line:84%
And clearly, this
mode of prayer,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.610 align:middle line:84%
it's not a wish machine,
it's not a mind control,

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:25.860 align:middle line:84%
it's not leaving our
will on anything else.

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:84%
It simply creates the pattern,
the template of a possibility

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.180 align:middle line:84%
and allows that possibility
then to come to fruition.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.095 align:middle line:84%
>> So you really have to back
up when you say something like

00:09:38.095 --> 00:09:38.895 align:middle line:90%
this--

00:09:38.895 --> 00:09:39.695 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:43.740 align:middle line:84%
>> --to the point that we are
actually part of the creative

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:44.882 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:09:44.882 --> 00:09:48.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We have, had, always,
and have today direct access

00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:51.830 align:middle line:84%
to the creative forces of our
world through a language that

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.080 align:middle line:84%
until recently has been
poorly understood in the west.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.525 align:middle line:84%
That language is the union of
thought, feeling, and emotion,

00:09:58.525 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
which is so
fascinating, Corinne,

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.473 align:middle line:84%
because in the
west, emotion, we've

00:10:01.473 --> 00:10:03.890 align:middle line:84%
done our best to get around
it, to get around the feelings

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:05.180 align:middle line:90%
and emotions.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.360 align:middle line:84%
So we are a very logic
mental-based societies.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.380 align:middle line:84%
When you see old movies of
people praying or doing,

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.130 align:middle line:84%
exercising their
powers, their thinking,

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:17.310 align:middle line:84%
their faces are scrunched up and
they make it look really hard.

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:19.130 align:middle line:84%
It's a thought process
and we're invited

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:22.257 align:middle line:84%
to incorporate the feeling
and the emotion into those.

00:10:22.257 --> 00:10:24.590 align:middle line:10%
And there is a quality of
thought, feeling, and emotion,

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:10%
that union, then that
allows our hearts

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.860 align:middle line:10%
desire to come to fruition.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.650 align:middle line:10%
And this is the language
of the ancients.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
And in the ancient
text, it's called

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.275 align:middle line:90%
the language of the angels.

00:10:33.275 --> 00:10:35.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is almost
when you pray,

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.260 align:middle line:84%
it's almost like
playing let's pretend.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.930 align:middle line:84%
You not only pray but you
see it already happened.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you give me an example?

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.050 align:middle line:90%
>> Not yet.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.850 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.070 align:middle line:84%
>> We're going to take a little
break now but we want to hear

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.950 align:middle line:84%
more about this because we all
want to find out how to get

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.560 align:middle line:90%
what we want.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:84%
We're talking to
Gregg Braden here

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.950 align:middle line:84%
who is the author of
"Walking Between The Worlds".

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:84%
We're really walking
between the worlds today.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.203 align:middle line:84%
And you don't want to miss,
though we had to do this.

00:11:03.203 --> 00:11:04.620 align:middle line:84%
Stay with us, we'll
be right back.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.512 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:11:07.512 --> 00:11:13.310 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to Gregg
Braden here about his book,

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:18.460 align:middle line:10%
"Walking Between The Worlds".

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:22.060 align:middle line:84%
And we're talking
today about prayer.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.430 align:middle line:84%
All right, I want to
give you an example.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.620 align:middle line:84%
All right, you have a
child who's very sick

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.150 align:middle line:84%
and you're praying to
god that he gets well.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.780 align:middle line:90%
This is the way we usually pray.

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.490 align:middle line:90%
Please, God, spare my child.

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:35.480 align:middle line:90%
Get him well.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.940 align:middle line:90%
Get them feeling good.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Help me to have the strength
to take care of him.

00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:42.185 align:middle line:90%
That's the usual prayer.

00:11:42.185 --> 00:11:42.985 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:11:42.985 --> 00:11:45.102 align:middle line:90%
>> How would you change that?

00:11:45.102 --> 00:11:48.630 align:middle line:84%
>> I'll answer that question and
I'd like to share an example--

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> OK

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.070 align:middle line:84%
>> --of how this prayer,
so we'll have two examples.

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.460 align:middle line:10%
First, in and asking
for intervention, what's

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:10%
being implied in this
situation is there

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.110 align:middle line:10%
something that we're afraid
of or that we don't trust.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.760 align:middle line:84%
And that brings up
the first question,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.120 align:middle line:84%
when did we forget to trust
in the process of life that's

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.650 align:middle line:90%
unfolding before us?

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.620 align:middle line:84%
When did we forget to trust
in the innate intelligence

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:12.043 align:middle line:84%
within the body
of that child who

00:12:12.043 --> 00:12:13.460 align:middle line:84%
journey through
creation that come

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:17.865 align:middle line:84%
through the womb of the
mother because their illness

00:12:17.865 --> 00:12:19.240 align:middle line:84%
or their fever is
frightening us?

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.870 align:middle line:90%
When do we forget that?

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.960 align:middle line:84%
Now, within that
context, the prayer

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%
may become rather than saying
please help me do something,

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:84%
would be the thought, feeling,
and emotion of the child

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:32.720 align:middle line:90%
in greatest health.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.150 align:middle line:84%
And once that has
occurred, once we

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:38.510 align:middle line:84%
have the feeling and the
thought and the emotion of what

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.150 align:middle line:84%
this child is like in the
greatest state of health,

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:43.370 align:middle line:90%
that's the seed.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:84%
From that point
forward, our prayer

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.170 align:middle line:84%
now becomes a prayer
of thanks for what

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.990 align:middle line:90%
we have created in our seed.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.090 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you another
example that might help

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.490 align:middle line:90%
to flesh this out a little bit.

00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:84%
Back in the mid-1980s,
I spent some time

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.380 align:middle line:84%
in northern New Mexico with a
Native American friend of mine

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.880 align:middle line:84%
during a time of
one of the greatest

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.880 align:middle line:84%
droughts the southwest
of the United States

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.920 align:middle line:90%
has ever experienced.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.280 align:middle line:84%
And invited me to go
with him to his tribal,

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.090 align:middle line:84%
an ancient tribal
location to pray rain.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.000 align:middle line:84%
And this is key, to pray
rain, not pray for rain.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.550 align:middle line:84%
Well, I went out
with an expectation

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:25.010 align:middle line:84%
that I would see a lot
of dancing and movement

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.800 align:middle line:90%
and chanting.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.380 align:middle line:84%
And a little bit to
my disappointment,

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.860 align:middle line:84%
I stood off and watched this
gentleman walk to a tribal spot

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
where his family done it for
thousands of generations.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.730 align:middle line:84%
He took off his shoes,
walked into his stone circle,

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:43.040 align:middle line:84%
and I saw very little outward
expression of the prayer.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.290 align:middle line:84%
And then he came back and
he said, well, I'm finished.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:46.880 align:middle line:90%
Let's go get a bite to eat.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.860 align:middle line:84%
And I said, well,
what about the prayer?

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:50.000 align:middle line:90%
And he says, I just did it.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.400 align:middle line:90%
And I said, well, what happened?

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.150 align:middle line:84%
I thought you were
going to pray for rain.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:54.200 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.957 align:middle line:84%
If I pray for rain, I'm
acknowledging it doesn't exist

00:13:56.957 --> 00:13:58.040 align:middle line:90%
and it will never happen--

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So the universe
answers, OK, you want rain?

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.060 align:middle line:90%
We don't have rain here.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.860 align:middle line:84%
>> You're just
saying pray for rain.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.740 align:middle line:84%
He said, I prayed rain and what
that means to me is I went out

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.610 align:middle line:84%
and I had the thoughts,
feelings, and emotions of what

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.910 align:middle line:84%
it feels like to feel the
mud ooze between my toes

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:15.890 align:middle line:84%
during the rainstorm
in my village.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.860 align:middle line:84%
He said, I smelled the smell
of the water coming off

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.390 align:middle line:90%
the pueblo walls.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:23.000 align:middle line:84%
I felt what it feels like to
walk through fields of corn

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.910 align:middle line:84%
up to my chest because
the rain is so plentiful.

00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:28.130 align:middle line:90%
And doing that, I created--

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.410 align:middle line:84%
somewhere in creation--
I just created rain.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:90%
Maybe not here, somewhere.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:36.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, my prayer becomes a prayer
of thanks for what I've created

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.225 align:middle line:84%
and I know that it
will come to pass.

00:14:38.225 --> 00:14:40.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, the next day, we
watched on the weather maps.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.493 align:middle line:84%
A jet stream dip
down, we had more rain

00:14:42.493 --> 00:14:43.910 align:middle line:84%
than we knew what
to do with and I

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:46.040 align:middle line:84%
called him and I said, how
come we've got so much rain?

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:84%
And he said, well,
that's the part

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.060 align:middle line:90%
I haven't got figured out yet.

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, but see, we don't want
to pray for something for it

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.650 align:middle line:90%
to happen somewhere else.

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.820 align:middle line:90%
We want it to happen here.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:56.005 align:middle line:84%
>> So where in his
prayer does he say,

00:14:56.005 --> 00:14:57.630 align:middle line:84%
please have it rain
here in New Mexico.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it was.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.220 align:middle line:84%
It was in New Mexico
where we had that rain.

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:02.960 align:middle line:90%
And this is the--

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:84%
the prayer, this
last mode of prayer

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.310 align:middle line:84%
in feeling the outcome before it
ever happens, and in that way,

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.910 align:middle line:84%
creating it, that's the
language to creation.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.220 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't promise that
it will come to pass,

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.890 align:middle line:90%
it creates the possibility--

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:19.760 align:middle line:84%
that's the seed-- now, our
prayer is a prayer of thanks,

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.090 align:middle line:84%
and our thanks is what
empowers that seed.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.000 align:middle line:84%
It gives it life so it
can last to come to pass.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.252 align:middle line:84%
This is what we lost
1,700 years ago.

00:15:28.252 --> 00:15:29.710 align:middle line:84%
In our world, if
we do a prayer, it

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.550 align:middle line:84%
doesn't happen immediately
in front of us.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:84%
We say it never
happened because--

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:34.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Because God's not listening.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:35.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Right, because
that's our expectation.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:84%
The ancients knew beyond
the shadow of a doubt

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:41.422 align:middle line:84%
that they are empowered
in this world to create.

00:15:41.422 --> 00:15:43.880 align:middle line:84%
And the moment they had that
thought, feeling, and emotion,

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.910 align:middle line:84%
it has happened somewhere,
they trusted that.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.600 align:middle line:84%
And we don't trust that now
up until very recently anyway.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.310 align:middle line:84%
In trusting that,
they would simply

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.760 align:middle line:84%
continue maybe for days
with prayers of thanks

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.200 align:middle line:84%
because they trusted
it come to pass.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:90%
So now, back to your example.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.600 align:middle line:84%
I would give thanks for
the health and the vitality

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.890 align:middle line:84%
of my child who
in this moment may

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.800 align:middle line:84%
be projecting an illusion
of illness through a body.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.665 align:middle line:84%
And I know that the soul is new,
shiny, and intact as the day it

00:16:13.665 --> 00:16:16.040 align:middle line:84%
burst forth from the heart of
the creator into this world

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.940 align:middle line:84%
and there is no
illness in the soul,

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:21.420 align:middle line:84%
that that body is simply
mirroring a process of learning

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.220 align:middle line:90%
and understanding.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:90%
And I trust that process.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.460 align:middle line:90%
I trust that with all my heart.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And I asked, I give thanks
for the process and thanks

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.237 align:middle line:84%
for the divinity that is
playing out in front of me.

00:16:33.237 --> 00:16:34.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
different than saying,

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.877 align:middle line:84%
please help me do
something I'm afraid of,

00:16:37.877 --> 00:16:39.585 align:middle line:84%
I don't understand
what's happening here.

00:16:39.585 --> 00:16:43.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Let's suppose the child dies,
then how do you look at it?

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Through the science
of compassion and through

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.500 align:middle line:84%
redefining our relationship
with that child,

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.630 align:middle line:84%
with the creative
forces of our world,

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.310 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that
prayer changes,

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying prayer redefines what
that experience means to us.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.010 align:middle line:10%
And in that redefinition,
it expands our opportunity

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.570 align:middle line:10%
to love on levels--

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.210 align:middle line:10%
according to ancient text,
we're in this world learning

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.940 align:middle line:10%
to love on levels deeper than
even the angels in the heavens

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.339 align:middle line:10%
have ever learned to love
because they've never

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:13.118 align:middle line:10%
had to face what we're
facing here in this world.

00:17:13.118 --> 00:17:16.400 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you say something
here in your book about

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.980 align:middle line:90%
the dark knight of the soul.

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.490 align:middle line:84%
You talk about, nobody ever
goes through the dark night,

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.869 align:middle line:84%
this despairing type of
thing that many of us

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:30.020 align:middle line:84%
have gone through
unless they have

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.210 align:middle line:90%
reached some sort of mastery.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:36.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It's-- I attribute that quote
to every mother on the planet

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.710 align:middle line:84%
because every mother, I believe,
in every culture says God will

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:42.938 align:middle line:84%
never give you more than you
can handle on your plate.

00:17:42.938 --> 00:17:44.980 align:middle line:84%
I didn't know what that
meant when I was a child.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, seeing these ancient texts,
the dark night of the soul is

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.200 align:middle line:84%
defined as a time that comes
in almost everyone's life--

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.120 align:middle line:90%
unless you're very fortunate--

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.960 align:middle line:84%
when everything that you've
ever loved or held dear is gone.

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.300 align:middle line:84%
You might come home someday
and your family, your job,

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:01.070 align:middle line:84%
your house, your car,
everything is gone.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:03.920 align:middle line:84%
And in that moment, we're
pushed to the very edge

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.940 align:middle line:84%
of who we believe we are and
we're forced to reach within

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:84%
to pull forth this wisdom that
allows us to gracefully move

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:14.337 align:middle line:90%
through this time.

00:18:14.337 --> 00:18:16.670 align:middle line:84%
With the ancients to remind
us, and what now researchers

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.260 align:middle line:84%
have discovered
digitally, and there's

00:18:18.260 --> 00:18:21.950 align:middle line:84%
a whole science behind
this, is that we're not

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.680 align:middle line:84%
capable of having those
experiences, of losing health,

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.640 align:middle line:84%
of losing finance, of
losing friends, and jobs,

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:90%
and marriage.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.600 align:middle line:84%
It cannot happen until we have
amassed every tool that is

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.840 align:middle line:84%
required to see us gracefully
through that experience.

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.420 align:middle line:84%
And the key is we never know
when it's going to happen.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:38.960 align:middle line:90%
If there are big neon sign--

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.980 align:middle line:90%
>> But many people--

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.275 align:middle line:84%
>> --it would be
different, but there's not.

00:18:42.275 --> 00:18:45.980 align:middle line:90%
>> Many people keep everything.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:84%
They keep the wife, they keep
the car, they keep the money,

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.460 align:middle line:84%
they keep the job, but
they're empty inside

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.720 align:middle line:90%
and nothing has any meaning.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, and if we--

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.720 align:middle line:84%
and this is a very subtle,
it's a very powerful concept--

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.390 align:middle line:84%
if we go through
the world feeling

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:06.680 align:middle line:84%
that we must hold tight on
everything that we've ever

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.650 align:middle line:84%
amassed in our lives, and that
we love, and that we hold dear,

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
that's creations
trigger and that's

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:13.910 align:middle line:84%
the assurance that
we will lose them

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.650 align:middle line:90%
at some point in our lives.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.590 align:middle line:84%
Rather than recognizing the
beauty and the gifts of all

00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:21.140 align:middle line:84%
that have ever come to
us, of our relationships,

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.870 align:middle line:84%
our friendships, of
our jobs, our careers,

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and honoring them
for what they are

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:29.180 align:middle line:84%
and knowing that we
would always be OK

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:30.380 align:middle line:90%
if they should all go away.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.520 align:middle line:84%
And when people say, well, but
I'm not OK, what would I do?

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.560 align:middle line:90%
What would I do?

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:38.750 align:middle line:84%
That is our invitation to
reach inside of ourselves

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:40.370 align:middle line:90%
and find out, what is our fear?

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:84%
Our fear that maybe we can't
do something else in life for

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:49.910 align:middle line:84%
or that there's only
one person in the world

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:51.830 align:middle line:84%
that we're ever
going to be with.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:55.100 align:middle line:84%
It invites us to redefine
what all of those experiences

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.370 align:middle line:90%
mean in our lives.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.550 align:middle line:84%
So rather than
holding onto them,

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:03.180 align:middle line:84%
we can love them greater by
honoring them for what they are

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:05.580 align:middle line:90%
and what they bring to us.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.053 align:middle line:84%
Dark night of the soul happens
to most people at least once.

00:20:09.053 --> 00:20:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's interesting,
once people come through

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:14.720 align:middle line:84%
on the other side, and
they see that they are OK,

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and that they have
redefined their lives,

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.757 align:middle line:84%
some people almost will say,
you know, that wasn't so bad.

00:20:19.757 --> 00:20:20.840 align:middle line:90%
I'm ready for another one.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.940 align:middle line:84%
They'll say, OK, creation,
let's see what you've got.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:90%
Bring it on.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I don't want anymore.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.650 align:middle line:90%
I had one.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.053 align:middle line:90%
>> I think we've all had ours.

00:20:27.053 --> 00:20:28.970 align:middle line:84%
And look how beautiful
you've come through it.

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:31.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, well, I really have.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.030 align:middle line:90%
I really have.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.675 align:middle line:84%
I feel much more whole
as a result of it.

00:20:34.675 --> 00:20:36.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, what this tells
me, when people come to me

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.010 align:middle line:84%
and share with me their stories
of health and relationship

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:43.430 align:middle line:84%
and financial disasters,
the worse story,

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.440 align:middle line:84%
there's this tremendous
propensity for balance

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:49.160 align:middle line:84%
and creation and it takes a
master to upset that balance.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:51.978 align:middle line:84%
And the worse the story,
the greater the master that

00:20:51.978 --> 00:20:53.520 align:middle line:84%
I know that I'm in
the presence with.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.130 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you said to one
man who lost everything,

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.390 align:middle line:90%
you said congratulations.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:58.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Congratulations, you've
just begun the dark knight

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.220 align:middle line:84%
of the soul which can only
happen in the presence

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.350 align:middle line:84%
of a master who has
all these tools.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:07.550 align:middle line:84%
>> So this praying that
you're talking about here,

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:84%
it's very important in the
context of praying for world

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:14.630 align:middle line:84%
peace that you pray
seeing it done.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:18.050 align:middle line:10%
>> For so many people, they're
viewing this time in history,

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.590 align:middle line:10%
all the prophecies of doom and
destruction and all the unrest

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:10%
that we see, if we're
choosing to change that,

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.970 align:middle line:10%
we must change the
thought underlying it.

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.840 align:middle line:84%
And praying from a place that
peace has already occurred

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.240 align:middle line:90%
is the way to do that.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.320 align:middle line:10%
>> So you don't say
please bring peace.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for the peace.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.640 align:middle line:84%
>> You say thank you for the
peace and you picture peace.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:39.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.965 align:middle line:84%
You feel peace in your body
and you recognize peace

00:21:41.965 --> 00:21:44.130 align:middle line:84%
and it's in the
world all around you.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:45.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Whatever the headlines.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:47.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Because there's
always peace around us.

00:21:47.565 --> 00:21:51.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Gregg, you're a fascinating
interviewee, fascinating man.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:52.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Brilliant man.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.411 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you for the pleasure.

00:21:54.411 --> 00:21:57.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we've been
talking to Gregg Braden.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.490 align:middle line:84%
He is the author
of a book called

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:04.240 align:middle line:84%
"Walking Between The Worlds",
the science of compassion.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.630 align:middle line:90%
We learned a lot today.

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:11.820 align:middle line:84%
Like I always tell you, I bring
you miracles on this show.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.790 align:middle line:90%
Keep coming back.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.000 align:middle line:90%
