And people think I'm
either born with it

or I am not born with
it, I either have it

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.790 align:middle line:10%

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.080 align:middle line:10%
Well, that's not true.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.480 align:middle line:10%
There's three things you can
do that will bring passion

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:10%
into any area of your life

Most of us do.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.610 align:middle line:90%
We have help for you today.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.030 align:middle line:84%
We have Steven
Scott here who has

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.170 align:middle line:84%
written a book called "Simple
Steps to Impossible Dreams."

>> Hi, thanks for
having me back.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.650 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, I think that
it's very important for this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.410 align:middle line:84%
audience to know that
you have achieved some

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.570 align:middle line:90%
of your impossible dreams.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.580 align:middle line:84%
That you went from a
poverty stricken young man--

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Failure.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.510 align:middle line:84%
>> --failure to a multi,
multimillionaire today.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And you know, one
of the questions

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.910 align:middle line:84%
that came up in my mind is you
if you've made so much money--

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.030 align:middle line:84%
I understand you did
the Jane Fonda video--

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:90%
>> Treadmill.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.210 align:middle line:10%
>> --treadmill video that
made so much money and Richard

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.440 align:middle line:10%
Simmons' video that made him so
much money and made you so much

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:10%
money, why did you write a book?

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.780 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, going back to something
we said in our last show,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.360 align:middle line:10%
I flunked out of my first nine
jobs in my first six years

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.600 align:middle line:10%
after college.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.690 align:middle line:84%
After nine jobs, I was
earning less than half

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.190 align:middle line:90%
the national average.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Job number three, a
Harvard MBA told me

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.570 align:middle line:84%
I would never
succeed in my career.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And as a 23-year-old,
I believed him.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
And I thought of
myself as average.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I thought of myself
as a little less than average.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.080 align:middle line:84%
And yet, on job number 10,
we created over a billion

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.450 align:middle line:84%
worth of companies and kind
of disproving my critics.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
But at the same
time, I discovered

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
that it was some very
specific strategies that

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.020 align:middle line:90%
had turned my life around.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.460 align:middle line:84%
And I originally
wrote my first book

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.040 align:middle line:84%
to teach my children how
to work through failure.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.460 align:middle line:84%
This particular book,
I wrote to teach people

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.490 align:middle line:84%
how they can use these
same strategies to achieve

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:90%
their impossible dreams.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.760 align:middle line:84%
And somebody once said,
do you do this for money?

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.970 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.310 align:middle line:84%
Each time I do a book I
lose about a million dollars

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.370 align:middle line:84%
in income because I have to go
out on the road for the book

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.200 align:middle line:84%
and that takes me
out of my work.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.670 align:middle line:84%
And so I can't
produce television

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.250 align:middle line:84%
while I'm on the road
promoting a book.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.730 align:middle line:84%
But it is a way for
me to show people

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.980 align:middle line:84%
that they really can achieve
their impossible dreams.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:84%
Because every person
I've met that's achieved

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.900 align:middle line:84%
their impossible dreams has
been a very ordinary person,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
ordinary IQs, usually
sub-ordinary backgrounds.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.510 align:middle line:84%
As we mentioned, I went to high
school with Steven Spielberg.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Both of us were the
least likely to succeed

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.590 align:middle line:84%
in our high school, very shy,
full of acne, very skinny,

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.880 align:middle line:90%
totally unknown.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.490 align:middle line:84%
And yet we both did the exact
same things-- him in film

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.470 align:middle line:90%
and me in business.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.027 align:middle line:84%
And as I met a few
other people who

00:03:28.027 --> 00:03:29.610 align:middle line:84%
have achieved their
impossible dreams,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.550 align:middle line:84%
like Michael Landon, Lee
Iaccoca, found out we

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.690 align:middle line:90%
all did the same things.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.023 align:middle line:84%
But these are things that are
not taught in high school.

00:03:36.023 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:84%
They're not taught in
college or grad school.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.640 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the book
to teach these things.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.130 align:middle line:84%
>> So you feel like an
obligation to teach people how

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.550 align:middle line:90%
to do it?

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.350 align:middle line:90%
>> You know what?

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.370 align:middle line:84%
I feel a passion for it
more than an obligation.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.660 align:middle line:90%
>> You talk about passion.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
>> It's fun to see people that
see the light go on and see

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.740 align:middle line:84%
them say, hey, I can
achieve my dreams.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.420 align:middle line:84%
Whether the dream's
in marriage, they're

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:84%
dreams in relationships,
dreams in parenting,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.050 align:middle line:84%
or dreams in
business and career.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.980 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about Oprah here
when you talk about passion.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.160 align:middle line:84%
>> And I love that quote
of Oprah's that you put

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.960 align:middle line:90%
in your book.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.300 align:middle line:84%
The first time I
saw Oprah interview,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.760 align:middle line:84%
I didn't even know she existed
until Barbara Walters did

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.310 align:middle line:84%
an interview with her right
after "Color Purple" had

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.420 align:middle line:90%
come out.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And Barbara asked
a question that she

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.243 align:middle line:84%
thought was going to lead
down the road of the impact

00:04:26.243 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:90%
of discrimination and so on.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.870 align:middle line:84%
And she asked
Oprah, she said, it

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.850 align:middle line:84%
must have really been
terrible growing up

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.620 align:middle line:84%
under the pangs
of discrimination

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.450 align:middle line:90%
as a little girl in the South.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.230 align:middle line:90%
How did that make you feel?

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.100 align:middle line:84%
And Oprah thought
for maybe one second.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.400 align:middle line:84%
And she said, Barbara, I
learned very early on in life

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.785 align:middle line:84%
there is no discrimination
against excellence.

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:48.660 align:middle line:84%
And it just-- Barbara
didn't know what to do.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.660 align:middle line:84%
She was silent maybe
for 10 or 15 seconds

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:84%
because it killed the
whole train of thought

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle line:90%
she was going to lead down.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.170 align:middle line:84%
And she didn't know
where to go from that.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.080 align:middle line:84%
I jumped up out of
my seat and cheered,

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.360 align:middle line:84%
because I thought,
boy, that is so true.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.240 align:middle line:84%
And that's when
she won my respect.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.270 align:middle line:84%
But in "Simple Steps
to Impossible Dreams,"

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.550 align:middle line:90%
we compare people to a rocket.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.100 align:middle line:84%
We've all got these
seven massive engines.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.460 align:middle line:84%
We're held down to the launching
pad by six giant chains.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.380 align:middle line:84%
So we show you how
to cut the chains.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.200 align:middle line:84%
We show you what the engines
are and how to ignite them.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.710 align:middle line:84%
The fuel for the
engine is passion.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.420 align:middle line:84%
And people think I'm
either born with it

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.595 align:middle line:90%
or I am not born with it.

00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:27.650 align:middle line:84%
I either have it
or I don't have it.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.970 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's not true.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.370 align:middle line:84%
There's three things you can
do that will bring passion

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.380 align:middle line:84%
into any area of your life
that's important to you.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.610 align:middle line:84%
And Oprah is a perfect
demonstration of passion.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.210 align:middle line:84%
I don't care if she talks
about sliced bread, or poetry,

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.540 align:middle line:84%
or books, or mad cow
disease, whatever

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.820 align:middle line:84%
she talks about on
her show she always

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.550 align:middle line:84%
gains this tremendous
passion for the subject.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.133 align:middle line:90%
And why?

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Because she's a
passionate person?

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.350 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.190 align:middle line:84%
Because she's learned
how to bring passion

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.090 align:middle line:90%
into any situation.

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.670 align:middle line:84%
When we bring passion
into our marriage,

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.720 align:middle line:84%
into our parenting skills, into
our relationships on the job,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.930 align:middle line:84%
into our work, then it just
fires those engines up.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.840 align:middle line:84%
And we achieve things that we
never dreamed were possible.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.720 align:middle line:84%
But you have to know
how to bring it in.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.470 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we get
into in the chapter

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.060 align:middle line:90%
on Oprah Winfrey and passion.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.030 align:middle line:90%
>> I want to know now.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.830 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Basically, passion is
made up of three things--

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.520 align:middle line:84%
number one, vision,
number two, hope--

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.520 align:middle line:84%
sincere hope, not wishing,
but having a well-founded hope

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.930 align:middle line:90%
of achieving that vision--

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.473 align:middle line:84%
and number three,
fulfillment as you begin up

00:06:29.473 --> 00:06:30.890 align:middle line:84%
the path of achieving
that vision.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, most people, they fail in
the first place with vision.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.710 align:middle line:90%
They never define their dreams.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And we know from our
previous discussion

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.020 align:middle line:84%
that engine number one is
this dream conversion process.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.990 align:middle line:84%
It's defining your dreams
in writing and then

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.180 align:middle line:84%
converting that dream
into specific goals, goals

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.620 align:middle line:90%
into step, steps into tasks.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:84%
When you do that, when you start
out with your dream in writing,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.430 align:middle line:84%
now you have a concrete
vision of something

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.500 align:middle line:90%
you want to achieve.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.660 align:middle line:84%
So there is the vision
you need for passion.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.370 align:middle line:84%
When you create
the roadmap to get

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.690 align:middle line:84%
there, which is converting it
into goals, steps, and tasks,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.480 align:middle line:84%
now, you have a
well-founded hope.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.030 align:middle line:84%
You now see that that impossible
dream is now possible.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.980 align:middle line:84%
You've just created a
map on how to get there.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.090 align:middle line:84%
Now, you start to
complete the first task.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.790 align:middle line:84%
You complete that task
and it feels good.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:84%
You've now taken your first step
toward your impossible dream.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.810 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:84%
So that brings the
fulfillment side.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.257 align:middle line:84%
So now, you're really
starting to bring passion.

00:07:28.257 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And just by using
the dream conversion

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.000 align:middle line:90%
process that we teach--

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.430 align:middle line:84%
>> This all has
to be in writing.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.950 align:middle line:84%
>> It all has to be
written down, yeah.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.783 align:middle line:84%
If you don't write it
down, it won't happen.

00:07:35.783 --> 00:07:36.910 align:middle line:90%
>> You're so firm on that.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.710 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:90%
>> You don't move.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:39.770 align:middle line:90%
>> No, no.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.293 align:middle line:84%
There are a few
people in life who

00:07:41.293 --> 00:07:42.710 align:middle line:84%
don't have to write
it down, maybe

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.050 align:middle line:84%
one out of every out of every
50 million or 60 million.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, really.

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.142 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, but no more than that.

00:07:48.142 --> 00:07:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Those are the people that
have almost near photographic

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.760 align:middle line:84%
memories and are so
focused that they don't

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.900 align:middle line:90%
need to write things down.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.790 align:middle line:84%
But most people
aren't that focused.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.160 align:middle line:84%
I can ask a crowd of 1,000
people what are your dreams

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.530 align:middle line:90%
and I get 999 blank looks.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:06.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, that doesn't mean
that they don't have dreams,

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.610 align:middle line:84%
it means they just
haven't focused on them.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.685 align:middle line:84%
But when it's in writing,
you focus on it, see?

00:08:10.685 --> 00:08:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And you can go back to
it every single night.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.040 align:middle line:84%
You can say, OK,
what is my dream?

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.840 align:middle line:90%
This.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.700 align:middle line:84%
What are the tasks
I need to complete?

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:17.000 align:middle line:90%
This.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.770 align:middle line:84%
What date do I need
to complete that task?

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.090 align:middle line:90%
Here.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.257 align:middle line:90%
Ooh, that's coming up quick.

00:08:20.257 --> 00:08:21.180 align:middle line:90%
I better get it done.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:21.980 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.980 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, I know if I have a
lot of things to do in the day,

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.850 align:middle line:10%
if I make a list, for some
reason I feel obligated that I

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.130 align:middle line:10%
have to do everything on that.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:33.450 align:middle line:84%
But you go further
on lists than that.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.875 align:middle line:84%
We have to break it
down in priorities.

00:08:35.875 --> 00:08:38.580 align:middle line:84%
We can't just break it down into
things that have to be done.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.640 align:middle line:10%
We have to look
at the things that

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.320 align:middle line:10%
reflect our values and
our true priorities.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.820 align:middle line:84%
And those go to the
top of the list.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.870 align:middle line:90%
And we put an A by those things.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And other things that have
to be done get a lower

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.570 align:middle line:84%
rating like a B or a C.
And because we want our day

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.270 align:middle line:84%
to reflect our values
and our priorities,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle line:84%
not the urgencies of the
day, not the telephone

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.880 align:middle line:84%
calls that need to be made
or that interrupt our day.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And we show you,
engine number seven,

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.087 align:middle line:84%
I call it laser accurate
priority planning.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:08.670 align:middle line:84%
>> We're so much more inclined
to do the easy stuff first even

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:10.230 align:middle line:84%
though they may be
a C on the list.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Get it out of the way so you
don't have to think about it.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:13.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And because it is easy and
it's not uncomfortable,

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.030 align:middle line:84%
but, oftentimes, the
most important things,

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:21.310 align:middle line:90%
they are uncomfortable.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.880 align:middle line:90%
They take a little effort.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.350 align:middle line:90%
They might be a little scary.

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:84%
So those are the things
we tend to procrastinate.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And also, they need
a big slog of time.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.538 align:middle line:90%
Well, we think they do.

00:09:31.538 --> 00:09:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Actually, when you start
to do it the right way,

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.190 align:middle line:84%
you find out almost nothing
needs a lot of time.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:39.640 align:middle line:84%
It just needs focused
time where you're really

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.410 align:middle line:90%
focused on getting it done.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.170 align:middle line:84%
And this chapter alone
really puts a person

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:84%
in charge of their day and puts
them into control of their day.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:48.980 align:middle line:90%
And it really is fulfilling.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:84%
It's liberating once you get
into the habit of doing it.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.205 align:middle line:10%
>> Suppose you don't
know what your vision is,

00:09:54.205 --> 00:09:56.790 align:middle line:10%
do you still write down, "I
don't know what my vision is?"

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.590 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.980 align:middle line:84%
No, what you do is you
start out by dividing

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.000 align:middle line:84%
your life into the most
important areas of life.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.800 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So some people have
three important areas,

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:06.520 align:middle line:90%
some people have five.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.680 align:middle line:90%
I have seven important areas.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.430 align:middle line:84%
You then start in the
most important area.

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.050 align:middle line:10%
And you say, OK, if I
could have anything I want,

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:10%
anything, what would that be?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.577 align:middle line:84%
That becomes your
impossible dream, see.

00:10:18.577 --> 00:10:20.410 align:middle line:84%
And then we build the
road map to get there.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:20.690 align:middle line:90%
>> That's your vision.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.110 align:middle line:90%
It's not as hard as you think.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Really.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.440 align:middle line:90%
So that's the key.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.147 align:middle line:84%
If I could have anything
I wanted in this area--

00:10:29.147 --> 00:10:29.980 align:middle line:90%
>> What would it be?

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.970 align:middle line:90%
>> What would it be?

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's where you start.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, well that's quite
a way to start, I'll say.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.710 align:middle line:84%
We're talking to
Steven Scott here

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.830 align:middle line:84%
who has written a book that
you don't want to miss.

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.650 align:middle line:10%
It's called "Simple Steps
to Impossible Dreams--

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.260 align:middle line:10%
The 15 Power Secrets
of the World's Most

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.730 align:middle line:10%
Successful People."

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.010 align:middle line:84%
And one of them is
sitting here with us.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:55.030 align:middle line:90%
So stay with us.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:56.830 align:middle line:84%
We have a lot more
interesting stuff

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.202 align:middle line:90%
to ask this wonderful author.

00:11:00.202 --> 00:11:03.166 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:13.540 align:middle line:90%


00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to Steven Scott,
one of my favorite authors,

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:23.220 align:middle line:10%
about his book "Simple
Steps to Impossible Dreams."

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
We're after helping you make
your impossible dreams come

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.790 align:middle line:90%
true.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.590 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:28.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.320 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, one of the things
that I think is a tendency--

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:34.050 align:middle line:90%
I know it's been with me--

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.660 align:middle line:84%
that if you want to go into
business with someone, you say,

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.480 align:middle line:84%
oh, I have to find
somebody who has

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:84%
the same passion
and the same likes

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.710 align:middle line:84%
and is the same kind of
personality as I have.

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:45.510 align:middle line:10%
>> Yeah.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.620 align:middle line:10%
And that's wrong.

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.050 align:middle line:10%
You want to find somebody
that has the same vision,

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:51.195 align:middle line:10%
but they need a complementary
personality type.

00:11:51.195 --> 00:11:52.820 align:middle line:84%
And that's not just
in business, that's

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.450 align:middle line:84%
in any area where you want
to partner with somebody,

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.590 align:middle line:90%
whether it's your spouse.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.885 align:middle line:84%
And so we give a five-minute
personality test in the book.

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:00.760 align:middle line:90%
And it's real simple.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.997 align:middle line:84%
It's the one test in
life you can never fail.

00:12:02.997 --> 00:12:04.080 align:middle line:90%
>> I thought I flunked it.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.747 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, no, you
didn't flunk it at all.

00:12:05.747 --> 00:12:08.700 align:middle line:84%
All it does is it tells you
your dominant personality

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.380 align:middle line:90%
type and your sub-dominant.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:15.330 align:middle line:84%
And then that tells you your
strengths that are natural,

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.980 align:middle line:84%
your natural inclinations,
your natural strengths,

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.520 align:middle line:84%
your natural weaknesses,
what motivates you,

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.160 align:middle line:84%
the best way to communicate
with you, and so on.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.130 align:middle line:90%
And it's really a fun test.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what we teach is that
there's four basic personality

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:29.250 align:middle line:90%
types.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.542 align:middle line:90%
And we compare them to animals.

00:12:30.542 --> 00:12:34.433 align:middle line:84%
There's lions, otters, golden
retrievers, and beavers.

00:12:34.433 --> 00:12:36.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Tell us what the
different ones mean.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.330 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:37.320 align:middle line:90%
Now, you're a lion.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm a lion.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.210 align:middle line:90%
Lions are take-charge people.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:43.080 align:middle line:10%
They're either the boss or
they think they're the boss.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.300 align:middle line:84%
Put them in any situation
with other people,

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.090 align:middle line:84%
and if nobody's taking
charge, the lion

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.140 align:middle line:90%
will very quickly take charge.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:51.550 align:middle line:90%
They're project oriented.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:84%
They're very focused on
getting projects done.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.620 align:middle line:90%
They're not detail oriented.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:57.600 align:middle line:84%
A lot of details will
fall between the cracks.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.267 align:middle line:84%
They're not good at
details, but they're

00:12:59.267 --> 00:13:01.290 align:middle line:84%
good at getting the
overall project done.

00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:03.270 align:middle line:84%
They tend to run over
people, because they're

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:04.950 align:middle line:84%
so focused on getting
the project done.

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:08.070 align:middle line:84%
They tend to not to be
sensitive to the needs

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:84%
of the other people
working on the project.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Their strengths are they
get a lot of things done.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.310 align:middle line:84%
They're real good
one-way communicators.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.930 align:middle line:90%
They're visionaries.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.720 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be
entrepreneurs, for example.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:21.645 align:middle line:84%
Their weaknesses are that
they can appear to be abrupt.

00:13:21.645 --> 00:13:22.770 align:middle line:90%
They can appear to be rude.

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.720 align:middle line:84%
They can appear
to be insensitive.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.800 align:middle line:84%
And they are great one-way
communicators, good talkers.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.240 align:middle line:90%
They're not good listeners.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.893 align:middle line:84%
But a lion can choose to learn
how to be a good listener.

00:13:33.893 --> 00:13:36.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So they shouldn't have
another lion as a partner.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Not necessarily,
not necessarily.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:41.670 align:middle line:84%
In fact, more times than
not, they shouldn't.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:45.720 align:middle line:84%
But they tend to partner real
well with golden retrievers

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.640 align:middle line:90%
and otters.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.290 align:middle line:84%
Now an otter is a
party waiting to Happen

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.880 align:middle line:90%
everything has got to be fun.

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:51.870 align:middle line:90%
They make things fun.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.190 align:middle line:90%
They walk in, they beam.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:54.300 align:middle line:90%
They're enthusiastic.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:90%
They're optimistic.

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.860 align:middle line:84%
They tend to be a little
impulsive, a little unrealistic

00:13:58.860 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:90%
sometimes.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:01.590 align:middle line:90%
But they're real social.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if they're in
a meeting with a lion,

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.950 align:middle line:84%
they get a little
upset that the lion

00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:07.500 align:middle line:84%
wants to get down to business
because they're still talking.

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Now, otters are also good
one-way communicators.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.820 align:middle line:84%
Talking's natural, listening
isn't to the otter.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.390 align:middle line:84%
So they, like the lion, have to
choose to learn how to listen.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is all
in your book here.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:20.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:22.320 align:middle line:84%
>> You take this test and you
find out which one you are.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.572 align:middle line:84%
And not only once you
recognize the four types,

00:14:25.572 --> 00:14:27.780 align:middle line:84%
it's easy for you to see
what type your children are,

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
your mate, your boss, your
employees, your peers.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.210 align:middle line:84%
And that enables you to
communicate a lot better

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:90%
with them.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And it enables you to
play to their strengths

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.180 align:middle line:84%
as well as it allowing
you to strengthen or play

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.550 align:middle line:84%
to your strengths and
strengthen your own weaknesses.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.010 align:middle line:84%
The third type-- and this
is one of my favorites--

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:45.330 align:middle line:90%
are golden retrievers.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.580 align:middle line:84%
Golden retrievers are
everybody's best friends.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:48.720 align:middle line:90%
They are people pleasers.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.180 align:middle line:90%
They're very empathetic.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.310 align:middle line:90%
They're great listeners.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.660 align:middle line:90%
They're non-confrontive.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.620 align:middle line:84%
If you told a golden retriever,
I want you to fire somebody,

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.370 align:middle line:84%
they would worry about
it for three weeks.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.070 align:middle line:84%
And when it comes down
to firing the person,

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.530 align:middle line:84%
they'd actually
be sick that day,

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:90%
because they can't confront.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.810 align:middle line:84%
Their weakness is that they tend
to be emotionally malnourished.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.367 align:middle line:84%
Because they're so focused on
meeting everybody else's needs,

00:15:12.367 --> 00:15:13.950 align:middle line:84%
they don't care about
their own needs,

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:90%
they don't look out for it.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.098 align:middle line:84%
They also tend to store
hurts because they

00:15:17.098 --> 00:15:18.390 align:middle line:90%
don't want to confront anybody.

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:20.370 align:middle line:84%
They don't want to hurt
anybody's feelings.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And those hurts
can eat them alive

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.630 align:middle line:84%
and make it hard for them to
forgive somebody who hurts them

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.680 align:middle line:84%
But they'd rather do that
than communicate the hurt.

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.750 align:middle line:84%
But they're everybody's
best friends.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.370 align:middle line:84%
I have a son who's
a golden retriever.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:36.360 align:middle line:84%
And I mean he is so loving,
and patient, and empathetic to

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.350 align:middle line:90%
people.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:39.000 align:middle line:90%
The last one is the beaver.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.410 align:middle line:90%
Your son's a beaver.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.560 align:middle line:84%
And beavers are very
detail oriented.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.040 align:middle line:84%
Lions need to have beavers,
because lions miss detail.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:84%
Beavers don't ever
miss a detail.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.930 align:middle line:90%
And they're very methodical.

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:54.510 align:middle line:90%
They're focused on accuracy.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.910 align:middle line:84%
Their weakness is they can
have such high standards

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.950 align:middle line:84%
for themselves that
they oftentimes

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:00.383 align:middle line:90%
frustrate themselves.

00:16:00.383 --> 00:16:02.550 align:middle line:84%
And if they don't learn how
to relax those standards

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:04.878 align:middle line:84%
for their spouses
and their children,

00:16:04.878 --> 00:16:06.670 align:middle line:84%
they can really make
it hard on their kids.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:middle line:84%
So they need to learn how to
relax some of their standards

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:90%
for harmony's sake.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.640 align:middle line:84%
Whereas the golden
retriever needs

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.520 align:middle line:84%
to learn how to be a
little more confronted,

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:84%
they are so focused on
harmony that they oftentimes

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.310 align:middle line:84%
will take a wrong decision or
put up with something that's

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.150 align:middle line:90%
wrong rather than confront it.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.630 align:middle line:84%
But once we know our
personality types,

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:31.020 align:middle line:84%
then we can really have a lot
of fun, and more tolerance,

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.670 align:middle line:84%
and better communicate
with the people around us.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:35.780 align:middle line:84%
>> So if you want to
go into a business,

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.970 align:middle line:84%
or even have a marriage,
you shouldn't marry or go

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.640 align:middle line:84%
into a business with
someone just like you?

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.100 align:middle line:84%
>> Usually, you won't marry
that person anyway, because--

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.793 align:middle line:84%
>> You and I would never
make it in business.

00:16:46.793 --> 00:16:48.210 align:middle line:84%
>> In business,
we probably would,

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:50.502 align:middle line:84%
but we would have to recruit
some otters along the way.

00:16:50.502 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
We'd also, because
we're both lions,

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.540 align:middle line:84%
we'd have to map
out our territories.

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:57.240 align:middle line:84%
And the way lions can peacefully
coexist is if you say,

00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.490 align:middle line:90%
OK, now this is my territory--

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>> This is mine.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:00.998 align:middle line:84%
- >> Keep out and I'll
keep out of yours.

00:17:00.998 --> 00:17:02.873 align:middle line:84%
And then we can really
be effective together.

00:17:02.873 --> 00:17:04.950 align:middle line:84%
But you need to know how
to set those boundaries.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.930 align:middle line:84%
And that's why, once
again, personality types

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:07.950 align:middle line:90%
are real important.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.888 align:middle line:84%
But that's just in one
little section of the book.

00:17:10.888 --> 00:17:12.930 align:middle line:84%
That's about eight or nine
pages out of the book,

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:13.888 align:middle line:90%
but it's very powerful.

00:17:13.888 --> 00:17:16.520 align:middle line:84%
>> But it's very interesting,
because I think people try

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.089 align:middle line:84%
to get someone like them
to go into business.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:20.010 align:middle line:90%
And that's not right.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:20.810 align:middle line:90%
>> No, it isn't.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:23.730 align:middle line:90%
And also it's hard to tolerate.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.359 align:middle line:84%
A lion who is married
to a golden retriever,

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:29.490 align:middle line:90%
he wants his wife to be more--

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.260 align:middle line:90%
to take a position on things.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Just make a decision.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And she says, well, I
can't make a decision,

00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.150 align:middle line:84%
because she wants you to be
happy and him to be happy.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.720 align:middle line:84%
And if I try to make her do
that, that's as wrong for me

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.970 align:middle line:84%
to do that as it would
be for her to say,

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.070 align:middle line:90%
honey, don't make a decision.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.120 align:middle line:90%
Just be quiet.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.110 align:middle line:90%
Just listen.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.010 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.012 align:middle line:84%
Well, she should tell me to do
that, but it takes work for me

00:17:50.012 --> 00:17:50.970 align:middle line:90%
to learn how to listen.

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:84%
It takes work for her to
learn how to be confrontive.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.150 align:middle line:84%
So she's got to be tolerant
and patient with me--

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>> We are here to
teach each other.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.970 align:middle line:84%
And we can when we know
our personality types.

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.530 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, what about--

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.690 align:middle line:84%
one of the things
that you say that I

00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:05.160 align:middle line:90%
have found that most people--

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.860 align:middle line:84%
if they have a good
idea, they don't

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.460 align:middle line:90%
want to give any part of away,

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And you say, that's
the big mistake.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:12.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:13.530 align:middle line:90%
We need to share--

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.550 align:middle line:84%
anything of value, we
need to share with others.

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:18.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, if I want
to grow my business,

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:20.310 align:middle line:84%
I don't hoard it
all to myself, but I

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.980 align:middle line:84%
find key people, partners,
and key employees,

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.480 align:middle line:84%
and so on, and I offer them a
chance to own a piece of it.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, they have incentive
like you can't believe.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.190 align:middle line:10%
And if I don't give
them that incentive,

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.590 align:middle line:10%
I may own 100% of a small pie.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.840 align:middle line:84%
But if I give them
that incentive,

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.750 align:middle line:84%
I may end up owning 20%-30%
of a huge, giant pie,

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.420 align:middle line:90%
which is much better.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:84%
When my partner gave me
a piece of the business,

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.460 align:middle line:84%
he didn't realize it, but he was
ensuring that he, and his sons,

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.340 align:middle line:84%
and his grandchildren would
all become multimillionaires.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.790 align:middle line:10%
And if he hadn't given me
that piece of the business,

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.770 align:middle line:10%
he might have made a
million dollars or two,

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:00.603 align:middle line:10%
but that's about as far
as it would've gone.

00:19:00.603 --> 00:19:03.120 align:middle line:84%
Because I just gained so
much incentive and motivation

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.220 align:middle line:90%
when he gave that piece.

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's never being wise to
hoard things and be selfish.

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:11.342 align:middle line:84%
I can't find any wisdom
in selfishness whatsoever.

00:19:11.342 --> 00:19:13.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Plus the other part of it
is that if you're starting out

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:18.630 align:middle line:84%
in a small operation, you don't
have money to really recruit

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.070 align:middle line:90%
the best people.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.340 align:middle line:84%
So you say this is one way to
get people is by giving them

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:90%
a piece of the action.

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:25.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.100 align:middle line:84%
And you can recruit
really smart people.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.498 align:middle line:90%
Bill Gates is a perfect example.

00:19:28.498 --> 00:19:29.790 align:middle line:90%
You know, he has Steve Ballmer.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:31.320 align:middle line:90%
And he had Paul Allen.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Without those two people,
Microsoft wouldn't exist today

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:35.580 align:middle line:84%
and Bill wouldn't
be a billionaire.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:36.900 align:middle line:84%
He might be a millionaire,
but he certainly

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.130 align:middle line:90%
wouldn't be a billionaire.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
But because he recruited
the right partners,

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.550 align:middle line:84%
gave them a big
piece of the action,

00:19:42.550 --> 00:19:45.560 align:middle line:84%
they all became
multibillionaires.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:84%
And we have Microsoft
as a result.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:84%
>> You know, you talk a lot
here about passion and setting

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:90%
priorities and positiveness.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:58.920 align:middle line:84%
And you talk a lot
about making task lists.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you go and
say these things also

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:90%
apply to relationships.

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:07.140 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, every strategy that I
give in the book for business

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.182 align:middle line:84%
is just as powerful when
it's applied to personal

00:20:09.182 --> 00:20:09.982 align:middle line:90%
relationships.

00:20:09.982 --> 00:20:11.400 align:middle line:84%
And to me, personal
relationships

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.960 align:middle line:84%
are more important
than business.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.240 align:middle line:84%
So I gave illustrations
of how to bring those

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.440 align:middle line:90%
into your marriage.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.240 align:middle line:84%
For example, Helen
Keller positiveness,

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.580 align:middle line:90%
that's one of the seven engines.

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's one
technique you can

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:25.500 align:middle line:84%
use that can take even
the most negative person

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.510 align:middle line:84%
and give them a real
positive feeling.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.880 align:middle line:84%
And what happens is
that engine isn't

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:34.290 align:middle line:84%
so important for our success
as it is for our happiness.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:37.860 align:middle line:84%
If you attain success without
happiness, it's real empty.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:40.110 align:middle line:84%
But when you learn how
to use Helen Keller's

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.330 align:middle line:84%
real simple
technique for turning

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.950 align:middle line:84%
even the most negative situation
into a very positive one--

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:45.750 align:middle line:90%
>> What is it?

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:47.610 align:middle line:90%
It's called refocusing.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.858 align:middle line:84%
OK, now, for example,
I had a flight

00:20:49.858 --> 00:20:51.650 align:middle line:84%
canceled one day which
meant I wasn't going

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.233 align:middle line:84%
to be able to direct
a crew in Atlanta

00:20:53.233 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:84%
that I was supposed to
direct, a film crew.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And the flight was delayed
over and over again.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.050 align:middle line:84%
For 3 hours, we
sat on the tarmac.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:04.495 align:middle line:84%
And I could have focused, like
everybody else on the plane,

00:21:04.495 --> 00:21:05.370 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to be late.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.540 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to miss this.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.207 align:middle line:84%
Somebody else is going
to have to direct

00:21:08.207 --> 00:21:09.450 align:middle line:90%
that segment of my film.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.040 align:middle line:84%
And all these
negative things and I

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.123 align:middle line:90%
would have been wiped out.

00:21:12.123 --> 00:21:15.420 align:middle line:84%
Instead what I did, I chose
to refocus my attention

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:16.950 align:middle line:90%
on the pilot.

00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.950 align:middle line:84%
And I became very grateful
that he was more concerned

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:84%
about getting me someplace
safely than maybe

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.330 align:middle line:90%
getting me someplace on time.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Because my life to my
six children and my wife

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.880 align:middle line:84%
and myself is far more important
than making one film date.

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:31.680 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.210 align:middle line:90%
So I refocused on that.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:34.762 align:middle line:84%
I then focused on
some things I could

00:21:34.762 --> 00:21:35.970 align:middle line:90%
get done in that three hours.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.588 align:middle line:84%
I wrote a whole chapter in this
book during that three hours

00:21:38.588 --> 00:21:40.380 align:middle line:84%
I was sitting on that
plane, because I went

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.240 align:middle line:84%
and I asked, can I
open up my computer

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.490 align:middle line:90%
since we're just sitting here.

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.340 align:middle line:90%
And they said, yes.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.680 align:middle line:84%
So I focused on that
and ended up making it

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.290 align:middle line:84%
a real productive
and very positive

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.260 align:middle line:84%
experience instead of
letting my mind stay

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.660 align:middle line:84%
where it automatically
set, which is oh, no, we're

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:55.673 align:middle line:90%
going to be late.

00:21:55.673 --> 00:21:57.840 align:middle line:84%
The crew is going to have
to be directed by somebody

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.090 align:middle line:90%
else and so on.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And it's a real
simple technique.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.110 align:middle line:84%
But that's one of two techniques
we teach in that chapter.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.470 align:middle line:10%
>> If you had one thing in 30
seconds that you think would be

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.770 align:middle line:10%
the key to happiness and
success, what would it be,

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:12.040 align:middle line:10%
Steve?

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.700 align:middle line:10%
>> It would be realizing that
you can achieve your most

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.780 align:middle line:10%
impossible dreams when you
simply know the strategies,

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:19.830 align:middle line:10%
when you have the keys.

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:10%
It's kind of like
a key to your car.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.550 align:middle line:84%
You can't run down a highway on
your feet at 80 miles an hour.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.443 align:middle line:84%
But if I give you
a car and a key,

00:22:26.443 --> 00:22:27.610 align:middle line:90%
you don't need intelligence.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:28.530 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to
be an engineer.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:29.730 align:middle line:84%
You just stick the
key in the slot,

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:31.938 align:middle line:84%
turn it, put your feet on
the gas, and you get there.

00:22:31.938 --> 00:22:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And that's what the
book's all about.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:36.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think we've
had a wonderful time here.
