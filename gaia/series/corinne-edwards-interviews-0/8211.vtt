00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:32.470 align:middle line:90%


00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.170 align:middle line:10%
>> If you and I are in a fight,
you bring a piece of the truth,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.670 align:middle line:10%
and I bring a
piece of the truth.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.610 align:middle line:10%
If we're really going to resolve
this in a way that both of us

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.830 align:middle line:10%
are satisfied, both
of those truths

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.630 align:middle line:10%
have to be brought into the mix.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.525 align:middle line:10%
Otherwise, one of us
is going to dominate.

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:46.900 align:middle line:10%
The other one is
going to submit.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.180 align:middle line:10%
And that's just a game where
I'll dominate this time,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.597 align:middle line:10%
and you'll dominate
the next time.

00:00:50.597 --> 00:00:53.410 align:middle line:10%
And in 10 years, we're going
to be filled with resentment.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you intimate
in your marriage?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Do you feel you
have real intimacy?

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.940 align:middle line:84%
We have two wonderful doctors of
psychology and clinical doctors

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.940 align:middle line:84%
here who have written
a book called "The New

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.150 align:middle line:84%
Intimacy Discovering
the Magic at the Heart

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:90%
of Your Differences."

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.690 align:middle line:84%
And their names are Judith
Shervin and James Sniechowski.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.260 align:middle line:90%
You two are married people.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.150 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.950 align:middle line:90%
>> 10 years.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:90%
>> 10 years.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, one of the things that I
have noticed among people who

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.990 align:middle line:84%
have been married just a few
years-- you've kind of crossed,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.930 align:middle line:84%
what, the seven-year itch
that they talk about--

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.210 align:middle line:84%
is that they get married
with such tremendous feelings

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.030 align:middle line:84%
of promise, such high hopes
for this relationship.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:90%
And something happens.

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, to be fair,
think about it.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.140 align:middle line:84%
People get no relationship
training in our culture.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.250 align:middle line:84%
They have to receive
driver's ed training

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.380 align:middle line:90%
to get a driver's license.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.170 align:middle line:10%
People have to have training
and pass a test just

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.860 align:middle line:10%
to cut our hair.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.540 align:middle line:10%
And yet, for one of the
most difficult things we do,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.840 align:middle line:10%
is to put two distinctly
different peoples' lives

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.800 align:middle line:10%
together, hopefully, for
the rest of their lives,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.320 align:middle line:10%
and usually bring children into
that union, with no training,

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.930 align:middle line:10%
no formal preparation
whatsoever.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:84%
All they have to go on is what
their parents' relationship

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.070 align:middle line:90%
was like.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And for most people, they
don't want a relationship just

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.680 align:middle line:90%
like their parents.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.670 align:middle line:84%
So there's no model
for how to have

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.250 align:middle line:84%
a truly satisfying and
rich intimate relationship.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.440 align:middle line:10%
>> One of my favorite
ideas in the book--

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.890 align:middle line:10%
and it's actually Judith's--
it's in the context of, you

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.190 align:middle line:10%
wouldn't go to a hair cutter
if they didn't have a license

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.720 align:middle line:10%
or a mechanic if they
didn't have a license.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:10%
And what she wrote was,
if you needed surgery,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.420 align:middle line:10%
would you trust your
surgery to someone

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:10%
whose only credential was a
deep longing to be a surgeon?

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.690 align:middle line:84%
And yet, you'll give your
heart, and your children,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:84%
and your life to that
kind of situation.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.702 align:middle line:84%
And we do it day,
after day, after day.

00:03:10.702 --> 00:03:11.660 align:middle line:90%
>> So how do we change?

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.630 align:middle line:90%
What do we do?

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have to have a
realistic idea of what marriage

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.810 align:middle line:90%
requires.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.280 align:middle line:90%
>> What is marriage?

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Marriage is the process
of bringing love into form.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.473 align:middle line:84%
That's my definition
of marriage.

00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:25.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, it's a little abstract.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
What that means is that
what exists here between us

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.000 align:middle line:84%
is brought into
form so that when

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.280 align:middle line:84%
you look at this
relationship, it

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.040 align:middle line:84%
has a particular character,
a particular texture,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.720 align:middle line:90%
a particular emotional feel.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.730 align:middle line:84%
And it is our job
in this marriage

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.630 align:middle line:84%
to keep that fertilized,
and fructified, and alive.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.000 align:middle line:90%
So for me, there is love.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.340 align:middle line:84%
But love, like anything
else-- love is like a plant.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.100 align:middle line:84%
If you don't water it, if you
don't focus on it, it will die.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And it dies everyday
in people's lives.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.050 align:middle line:84%
It's the task of
keeping that love alive

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.950 align:middle line:90%
and bringing it into the world.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.820 align:middle line:84%
>> And what we show in the book
is that one of the major ways

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.770 align:middle line:84%
to do what Jim is talking about
is to open to the differences

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.660 align:middle line:90%
between the two people.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.900 align:middle line:84%
The differences
can cause conflict.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.070 align:middle line:84%
>> But most people marry someone
who likes to do what they like

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.089 align:middle line:90%
to do.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.550 align:middle line:84%
>> To some degree, that's
always going to be the case.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.040 align:middle line:84%
But there are also going
to be many ways that they

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.460 align:middle line:84%
are different, even if
it just comes down to,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.500 align:middle line:84%
as some clients of mine
once got into a fight

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.090 align:middle line:84%
over, how to put the
shelving up in the garage.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.890 align:middle line:90%
He had one way.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:31.723 align:middle line:90%
She had another way.

00:04:31.723 --> 00:04:34.120 align:middle line:90%
They fought about it for hours.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.580 align:middle line:84%
What we encourage is for
people to really respect

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.420 align:middle line:84%
those differences and
explore them with curiosity.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.680 align:middle line:90%
Because think about it.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.800 align:middle line:84%
If I deny Jim being somebody
distinctly different from me,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.110 align:middle line:84%
then I don't really
love who he is.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.780 align:middle line:84%
I love some idea
that I've concocted.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.200 align:middle line:84%
But when he is
distinctly him, then we

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.700 align:middle line:84%
can have an expansive
relationship.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.880 align:middle line:84%
But if I insist that
he become like me,

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.240 align:middle line:84%
the relationship
stays this size.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.600 align:middle line:90%
It's static.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.950 align:middle line:90%
I already know who I am.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.770 align:middle line:84%
And it gets boring and dull,
which so many people complain

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.120 align:middle line:90%
about in their marriages.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.530 align:middle line:84%
>> As simple as it may
sound, Judith is not me.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Now, that may be
patently obvious.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.550 align:middle line:90%
She's there.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.880 align:middle line:90%
I'm here.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.680 align:middle line:90%
She's female.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.860 align:middle line:90%
I male, et cetera.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.560 align:middle line:84%
But people go into
relationships particularly

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:84%
with unconscious
fantasies of what

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:84%
it should be like, unconscious
expectations of what

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:90%
the other person should be like.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And so the other
person is really not

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.390 align:middle line:90%
somebody distinct from them.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.760 align:middle line:84%
They are merely an extension
of their own imagery,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.860 align:middle line:84%
their own imagination,
their own projection.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.490 align:middle line:84%
So the phrase, she is not
me, is a profound statement.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.240 align:middle line:84%
Because that means I have to
try and find out who she is.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.870 align:middle line:84%
If she's not me, it behooves
me to find out who she is.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.460 align:middle line:84%
And if people took anything away
from what we are talking about,

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.820 align:middle line:84%
that particular moment would
expand their relationship

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.002 align:middle line:90%
possibilities immensely.

00:05:58.002 --> 00:06:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Because they could actually
go into the world looking

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.200 align:middle line:90%
for someone.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.640 align:middle line:84%
>> So what we're really geared
is to try to make somebody over

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.930 align:middle line:84%
when we get married so
that they're like us.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.760 align:middle line:84%
And that is what causes the
stultification and the boredom?

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The boredom and
so much abrasiveness.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.830 align:middle line:84%
Because think about it,
Corinne, do you really

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.200 align:middle line:84%
want somebody to make
you over into his image?

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.512 align:middle line:90%
I mean, you want somebody who--

00:06:22.512 --> 00:06:24.360 align:middle line:90%
>> I've had a couple of men try.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.750 align:middle line:90%
>> "Try" is the operative term.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.550 align:middle line:90%
Try is all they did.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But you want somebody to
love you for being who you are.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:35.720 align:middle line:84%
So the old way
was people sort of

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.970 align:middle line:90%
tried to make each other over.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.430 align:middle line:84%
What we're teaching in
our book is the new way,

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.300 align:middle line:84%
which is to learn
creative, inventive ways

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:84%
that this relationship can
keep getting expansive, where

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.150 align:middle line:84%
both of us can use the
differences to learn

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.640 align:middle line:84%
from each other,
to keep growing,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.150 align:middle line:84%
to even heal the old,
wounded parts that we bring

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.350 align:middle line:84%
from childhood, and to have
what we call serial monogamy

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.820 align:middle line:90%
with the same person.

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.470 align:middle line:84%
So the relationship
keeps changing,

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:03.940 align:middle line:90%
keeps getting more delicious.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.170 align:middle line:90%
And you can stay together.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:06.545 align:middle line:84%
And it doesn't
get boring at all.

00:07:06.545 --> 00:07:09.130 align:middle line:84%
>> But our expectation
is that we get married,

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.680 align:middle line:84%
we walk off in the sunset,
we get along, we don't fight,

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:18.990 align:middle line:84%
we don't have disputes, or
else, it must not be right.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.490 align:middle line:84%
>> People ask us,
what's the old intimacy?

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.220 align:middle line:84%
The idea that you just
expressed, from my perspective,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:27.660 align:middle line:90%
comes from the old intimacy.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:30.510 align:middle line:84%
In the old intimacy, the
purpose of a marriage

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:32.550 align:middle line:84%
was to procreate
to have children

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.980 align:middle line:84%
and to basically sustain
the structure of either

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.235 align:middle line:84%
the religion, the
community, or the culture.

00:07:37.235 --> 00:07:39.360 align:middle line:84%
It didn't much matter
whether or not the two of you

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.160 align:middle line:90%
cared for each other.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.320 align:middle line:84%
Your job was to
do, basically, what

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.390 align:middle line:90%
the community needed you to do.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.210 align:middle line:90%
In that content--

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:47.010 align:middle line:90%
>> Or the church.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Or the church, precisely.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.490 align:middle line:84%
In that context, you
don't want to fight.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:84%
You want to be
pretty much alike.

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:56.460 align:middle line:84%
Because who you are is
really not relevant.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And if you fight, and
if you break the rules,

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.260 align:middle line:84%
the community is going
to come down on you.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.040 align:middle line:84%
In this century,
in this culture--

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.040 align:middle line:84%
and we are the leaders
in the world with respect

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.200 align:middle line:84%
to what we're talking
about-- men and women

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.230 align:middle line:84%
are free to choose who
they want to be with.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:84%
We are far more mobile than
any society has ever been.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.830 align:middle line:90%
So I am going to--

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm from Detroit.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.530 align:middle line:90%
I met Judith in Los Angeles.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.390 align:middle line:84%
That, in and of
itself, is a difference

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.050 align:middle line:90%
that has to be integrated.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.740 align:middle line:84%
So as a consequence,
there will be differences.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.198 align:middle line:84%
There aren't going to be two
couples, who are really alive,

00:08:25.198 --> 00:08:26.615 align:middle line:84%
who are not going
to stay together

00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:28.480 align:middle line:84%
for a long period of
time without clashing,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.280 align:middle line:90%
without fighting.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.240 align:middle line:90%
And we don't mince around.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.448 align:middle line:84%
We don't use the word
"conflict" to get away from it.

00:08:32.448 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:10%
They're fights.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.240 align:middle line:10%
The point is--

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:10%
>> Do you fight?

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.370 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes!

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.929 align:middle line:10%
>> Absolutely, absolutely.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:38.760 align:middle line:10%
We still do.

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:90%
Yes, we do.

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:43.740 align:middle line:84%
The point here is
that when you go

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.950 align:middle line:84%
into the expectation
of no fighting,

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.050 align:middle line:84%
and everything is going
to be calm sailing,

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.290 align:middle line:84%
you are really denying the
very vitality of your own being

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.610 align:middle line:90%
and the other person's being.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.830 align:middle line:84%
And bring a child into
that relationship,

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.200 align:middle line:84%
and the child, from
the get to, completely

00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.850 align:middle line:90%
belies all of those ideas.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:03.240 align:middle line:84%
He or she is squabbling,
complaining, demanding,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.850 align:middle line:84%
doing all of those things that
you're not supposed to do.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:07.890 align:middle line:84%
Sadly, and oftentimes,
those children

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.640 align:middle line:84%
are molded into what
we're talking about.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.020 align:middle line:90%
And they go on.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And they replicate those
kinds of relationships.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.495 align:middle line:84%
>> And they go
out and make nice.

00:09:13.495 --> 00:09:14.295 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:09:14.295 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.270 align:middle line:84%
But what we're teaching
people, in the book

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.160 align:middle line:84%
and in our trainings,
is that fighting

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.193 align:middle line:90%
can be a spiritual workout.

00:09:23.193 --> 00:09:24.110 align:middle line:90%
What we mean by that--

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:25.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you've got kind of
fair-fighting rules here.

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:26.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.150 align:middle line:84%
>> And they were
kind of interesting.

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.670 align:middle line:90%
It said here, let see--

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:34.262 align:middle line:90%
>> Chapter 9.

00:09:34.262 --> 00:09:35.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Chapter 9.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.740 align:middle line:84%
Well, one of them I remember
was no dirty fighting.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:40.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.230 align:middle line:90%
>> No character--

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Assassination.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:47.260 align:middle line:84%
>> --assassination, name
calling, mockery, hitting--

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:53.160 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] with a fight if you
can't do some of these things.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.540 align:middle line:84%
>> But then you're out to
really destroy the other person.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.585 align:middle line:84%
And we call we call
that "killing."

00:09:58.585 --> 00:09:59.960 align:middle line:84%
Because you're
really out to just

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:90%
win and wipe out your partner.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.770 align:middle line:84%
But if you really
want your marriage

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:07.830 align:middle line:84%
to sustain, a fight
occurs, what we teach,

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:84%
is in the wilderness, where
the two people haven't

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.540 align:middle line:90%
resolved their issues so far.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.230 align:middle line:84%
And if I understand that,
when I'm angry at Jim,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.900 align:middle line:84%
I'm bringing myself
into the relationship

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.260 align:middle line:84%
by expressing the anger,
I'm stepping closer to him,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:25.070 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying this has to
change, I'm unhappy, I'm mad,

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.710 align:middle line:84%
he steps back in, and he
says, well, I'm angry,

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.880 align:middle line:90%
this annoys me.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have the
opportunity to really bring

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.140 align:middle line:84%
in some new material,
listen to each other

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
a little more differently
when we can calm down,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:90%
and really listen.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:10%
And when we can
understand that both of us

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.240 align:middle line:10%
are bringing a
piece of the truth,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.990 align:middle line:10%
neither one of us
having the whole truth--

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.580 align:middle line:10%
>> And that's the key.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.970 align:middle line:10%
>> --then we can get
creative, and inventive,

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.840 align:middle line:10%
and find a resolution so that
the relationship gets larger

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.520 align:middle line:10%
to include both of us.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, is there ever an
impasse there is no resolution?

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there
non-negotiable differences.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.440 align:middle line:84%
For example, when
Judith and I met,

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:04.100 align:middle line:84%
had I, for example, wanted
a child, and she did not,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.750 align:middle line:84%
there are some basics that
people will not resolve,

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.080 align:middle line:84%
and that will tear a
relationship apart.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.080 align:middle line:84%
And what we suggest and argue
is that people lay those out

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.810 align:middle line:84%
on the table in the early
onset of the relationship

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:17.900 align:middle line:84%
to see if this relationship
has possibilities.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But once you understand
what those are--

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:22.565 align:middle line:84%
and you can go into them, so you
negotiate what the boundaries

00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:25.190 align:middle line:84%
are going to be and how the two
people are going to behave with

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.090 align:middle line:90%
one another--

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:84%
the differences
thereafter are gifts.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.590 align:middle line:90%
They're not problems.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.270 align:middle line:84%
>> We're having fascinating
discussion here on marriage

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.850 align:middle line:90%
and the new intimacy.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.120 align:middle line:90%
So stay with us.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.980 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:55.550 align:middle line:90%


00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:10%
>> We're talking about
the new intimacy.

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:59.830 align:middle line:10%
And in particular,
we're talking right now

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:03.520 align:middle line:10%
about fighting in marriage.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Well, a lot of people out
there are saying, well,

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.080 align:middle line:90%
you shouldn't fight.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:11.860 align:middle line:84%
>> That's a sad thing when
people believe that if you are

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:15.850 align:middle line:84%
angry at somebody, it must
mean you don't love them.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.530 align:middle line:90%
That's nonsense.

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:21.640 align:middle line:84%
If I love Jim, and he
treats me in some way that

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.440 align:middle line:84%
hurts my feelings, out
of my love and my desire

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:84%
for the relationship to go
forward and be healthier,

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:31.990 align:middle line:90%
I must confront him.

00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:35.290 align:middle line:10%
I must bring up the issue
and call his attention to it,

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:38.890 align:middle line:10%
educate him about
who I am, how I feel,

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.840 align:middle line:10%
so that he can
understand me and change

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:10%
in whatever ways we
can develop together

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:10%
that will feel OK to him.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.940 align:middle line:84%
>> And also discover
who I am in the context.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:50.588 align:middle line:10%
Because a fight-- a fair
fight, a fight that has rules,

00:12:50.588 --> 00:12:53.130 align:middle line:10%
a fight that has containment,
a fight that does not include--

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.090 align:middle line:10%
>> No name calling.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:54.900 align:middle line:90%
>> No name calling.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Because that's--

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.210 align:middle line:90%
>> No hitting.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:57.560 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>> No hitting

00:12:58.500 --> 00:12:59.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, that's
way out of bounds.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.680 align:middle line:90%
>> Listen with curiosity.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Because neither one of
us has the whole truth.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.170 align:middle line:84%
If you and I are in a fight,
you bring a piece of the truth,

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.670 align:middle line:84%
and I bring a
piece of the truth.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.610 align:middle line:84%
If we're really going to resolve
this in a way that both of us

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.830 align:middle line:84%
are satisfied, both
of those truths

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:15.630 align:middle line:90%
have to be brought into the mix.

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:17.525 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, one of us
is going to dominate,

00:13:17.525 --> 00:13:18.900 align:middle line:84%
the other one is
going to submit.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.210 align:middle line:84%
And that's just a game where
I'll dominate this time,

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.627 align:middle line:84%
and you'll dominate
the next time.

00:13:22.627 --> 00:13:25.110 align:middle line:84%
And in 10 years, we're going
to be filled with resentment.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:84%
But a fight is a
way of saying, I

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.210 align:middle line:84%
love you enough
that I will not let

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.370 align:middle line:84%
this go on with the possibility
of damaging this relationship.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:37.470 align:middle line:84%
I am making my announcement
and my claim clear.

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>> How much honesty in marriage?

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:42.200 align:middle line:90%
>> How much in marriage?

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.020 align:middle line:90%
>> How much honesty is good?

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:84%
Do you tell your
husband everything,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.410 align:middle line:84%
even though you know he's
going to use it against you?

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, now, but see, even though
he's going to use it against

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:53.908 align:middle line:84%
you, we would argue
that's dirty fighting.

00:13:53.908 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:90%
>> That's dirty fighting.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.900 align:middle line:90%
>> That's not loving.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.290 align:middle line:84%
If I can't trust
Jim to hear what

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.660 align:middle line:90%
I am giving him as a gift--

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Even though I
may not like it.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.100 align:middle line:84%
>> All, you have a girlfriend
that he can't stand.

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:08.150 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:11.900 align:middle line:84%
>> So you have decided, rather
than ever mentioning that

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:16.400 align:middle line:84%
you've seen Sally for lunch,

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.695 align:middle line:84%
he says she's stupid, why do you
bother with someone like that,

00:14:19.695 --> 00:14:21.070 align:middle line:84%
she's always in
trouble, bububah,

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:25.140 align:middle line:84%
bububbah, what about
not telling him?

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, see, we propose that,
before anybody needs to come

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.330 align:middle line:84%
to a conclusion not to tell,
there's a basic lack of respect

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.150 align:middle line:84%
for differences in the
story you just told.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle line:84%
In reality, Jim had a friend,
when we first knew each other,

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.450 align:middle line:90%
that I did not like at all.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:84%
But I respected the
fact that he's not me.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.210 align:middle line:90%
And he did like the fellow.

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:49.170 align:middle line:84%
And I just made it
clear, I didn't want

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.980 align:middle line:90%
to be involved in the meetings.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.900 align:middle line:84%
On a big party, I could
put up the prison.

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.880 align:middle line:84%
I didn't have to
keep that secret

00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.785 align:middle line:84%
as long as he respected
my differences

00:14:58.785 --> 00:14:59.910 align:middle line:90%
and that I didn't like him.

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.380 align:middle line:84%
>> And you said, keep
that guy out of my hair.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Period, end of story.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:90%
>> Not end of story.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:06.450 align:middle line:90%
Here's the difference.

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Judith then went on
to say, what about him

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.490 align:middle line:90%
is so attractive to you?

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.578 align:middle line:90%
Why do you enjoy him?

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:13.620 align:middle line:90%
What do you get from him?

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.420 align:middle line:90%
What do you like?

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.300 align:middle line:90%
What do you dislike?

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.130 align:middle line:90%
She didn't just wipe him out.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:20.260 align:middle line:84%
Because if she wiped him out,
and I like him, part of me gets

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.060 align:middle line:90%
wiped out.

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:23.700 align:middle line:84%
And then the relationship
is smaller than it might be.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.070 align:middle line:84%
So she encouraged a
discussion and said,

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:28.710 align:middle line:84%
I want to know what
you feel about him.

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.660 align:middle line:84%
And what I was able
to tell her was

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:34.500 align:middle line:84%
able to open her consciousness
to who this guy was.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.420 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
she has to like him.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.550 align:middle line:84%
But she knows him
better so that, when

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:40.440 align:middle line:84%
I'm going out with him,
she's got some better

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.610 align:middle line:90%
idea of what I'm doing.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.830 align:middle line:84%
And when I come back, and
I say, we did this or that,

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:46.080 align:middle line:84%
she says, all right,
and vice versa.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.615 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, if she
keeps it a secret--

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:51.090 align:middle line:90%
I'll make it mine--

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:84%
she has a friend that I don't
like, and I keep it a secret,

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:58.770 align:middle line:84%
I begin to build a little
secret emotional room.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.690 align:middle line:90%
And I begin to withdraw.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.460 align:middle line:84%
That little piece
of me withdraws

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.630 align:middle line:90%
from the relationship.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:84%
I begin to have an affair with
my own emotions outside of her.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:08.580 align:middle line:90%
I can't show her.

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.900 align:middle line:90%
I'm afraid of her.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:84%
She'll be condemnatory,
or whatever.

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.200 align:middle line:84%
And I begin to develop
this relationship.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.658 align:middle line:84%
And if that gets
large enough, it's

00:16:15.658 --> 00:16:17.283 align:middle line:84%
going to be more
important than she is.

00:16:17.283 --> 00:16:18.090 align:middle line:90%
And then I'm gone.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:22.650 align:middle line:84%
>> And I will begin to develop
some sense that he's keeping

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:23.700 align:middle line:90%
something from me.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.540 align:middle line:90%
I don't know what.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.040 align:middle line:84%

everything, don't we.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.560 align:middle line:84%
So I will begin to
lose trust in him.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.360 align:middle line:90%
Now, I'll become suspicious.

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And little, by
little, by little,

we erode the love
that is so wonderful.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:84%

very little that a couple can't

tell each other, as long as
the differences between them

are valued and respected,

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:84%
don't have to turn each other
into a clone of themselves.

together, and teach together,

for a man-- or a woman,

but I'll speak for
myself-- for a man

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.460 align:middle line:84%
to have no emotional support
outside of the relationship

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.670 align:middle line:84%
and then come back
and expect that she's

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:44.670 align:middle line:90%
going to provide it all.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.733 align:middle line:90%
She can never do that.

00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:46.650 align:middle line:90%
She can never do that.

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.350 align:middle line:84%
Because she's not large
enough, even if she's a giant.

you get the stickers.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.080 align:middle line:84%
But then he said
something so sweet.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:54.390 align:middle line:90%
This was a very burly cop.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:56.250 align:middle line:84%
He said, I want to
tell you something.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:58.030 align:middle line:84%
He said, it's none
of my business.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.870 align:middle line:84%
But I just looked at the
sticker on the side of your car,

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.930 align:middle line:84%
the oil has not been
changed in 6,000 miles.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.790 align:middle line:90%
Change it.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:10.290 align:middle line:84%
But he still gave
me two tickets.

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, that was the
way I was brought up.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:15.380 align:middle line:90%
Men, that was their job.

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.870 align:middle line:84%
They took care of
cars, licenses.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Right we didn't do that.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And, you know, I still
think they should.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:24.640 align:middle line:90%
I hate to do stuff like that.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And certainly,
in the new intimacy,

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.080 align:middle line:84%
both people can do lots of
different things that the other

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.920 align:middle line:90%
doesn't.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.260 align:middle line:84%
But they need to
be on equal footing

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:35.540 align:middle line:84%
and really mutually
respectful of the differences

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.650 align:middle line:90%
between each other.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.260 align:middle line:84%
>> What's the biggest-- if you
had to pinpoint the biggest

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.670 align:middle line:84%
problem between married people
today that could be solved

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:46.460 align:middle line:84%
in one statement
from you, what is it?

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.700 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say that they don't
have a realistic expectation

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:56.570 align:middle line:84%
of what we call love work that's
required to keep the two lives

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:59.870 align:middle line:84%
growing and getting
richer together.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And my response is that they
really don't understand that

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.940 align:middle line:84%
they're different
from one another,

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.632 align:middle line:84%
and they respect
those differences.

00:21:06.632 --> 00:21:08.840 align:middle line:84%
They really don't understand--
to use a phrase I used

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.640 align:middle line:90%
earlier--

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:90%
that she's not me.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
And if I don't
understand that, and I

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.930 align:middle line:84%
expect her to be who I am,
I'll kill her emotionally,

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:16.730 align:middle line:90%
unless she leaves.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.397 align:middle line:84%
And then she's off
to do something else.

00:21:18.397 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:90%
I think that's critical.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:23.230 align:middle line:84%
>> It seems to me that one
of the problems that I notice

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:26.560 align:middle line:84%
among people is that everybody's
trying to get everything from

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.390 align:middle line:90%
one person.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.413 align:middle line:84%
And you literally cannot
get it from one person.

00:21:30.413 --> 00:21:32.830 align:middle line:84%
You've got to spread-- you've
got to go out with the guys.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:36.650 align:middle line:84%
We have to go shopping
together, and talk, and--

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:90%
it's hard.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.460 align:middle line:84%
>> But marriage is a place where
people can develop themselves,

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:48.530 align:middle line:84%
if they're open to not just
getting, but also giving,

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:54.340 align:middle line:84%
and learning that give and
take, and both parts are loving.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.280 align:middle line:84%
>> One part here that you said
here in the book was about

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.770 align:middle line:90%
vulnerability to each other.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.270 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's
something that we

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.240 align:middle line:84%
neglect a lot, is to say to
someone we love, I'm scared.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:08.330 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm hurting.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.170 align:middle line:90%
>> Absolutely.

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:09.890 align:middle line:90%
>> I need.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:10.807 align:middle line:90%
I need you to hold me.

00:22:10.807 --> 00:22:11.780 align:middle line:90%
>> I need.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:14.000 align:middle line:84%
I've got some old baggage
that's come up here.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.233 align:middle line:84%
And would you just hang in
there with me for a minute

00:22:19.233 --> 00:22:20.150 align:middle line:90%
while I talk about it?

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.590 align:middle line:84%
>> And that's the only way you
can ultimately trust a love.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Because when I bring
you my vulnerability,

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.950 align:middle line:84%
and you still love
me, you love me whole.

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.930 align:middle line:84%
And I can trust that
you really love me.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.050 align:middle line:84%
You just don't love me
for the show on the flash.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:30.925 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you think
that we love each other

00:22:30.925 --> 00:22:32.600 align:middle line:84%
because of our
vulnerabilities more?

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Ultimately, yes.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Yes, that's the
only way we really

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:84%
can make that deep bond, that
deep, intimate connection.

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:42.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, Judy and Jim,
wow, what a wonderful,

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.130 align:middle line:90%
wonderful meeting with you.

00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:45.590 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:48.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I would really suggest that
you make sure you read this

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.620 align:middle line:84%
book, "The New Intimacy
Discovering the Magic

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.210 align:middle line:84%
at the Heart of
Your Differences."

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:54.335 align:middle line:90%
It's for single people.

00:22:54.335 --> 00:22:55.940 align:middle line:90%
It's for married people.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a miracle.

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.470 align:middle line:90%
Keep coming back.

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:90%
