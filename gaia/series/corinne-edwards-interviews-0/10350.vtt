00:00:30.104 --> 00:00:32.479 align:middle line:84%
>> They vow they are going to
be different with their own

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.120 align:middle line:90%
children.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.370 align:middle line:10%
They're going to
give them free reign

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.662 align:middle line:10%
and encourage them to have fun.

00:00:35.662 --> 00:00:37.250 align:middle line:10%
And they act just
as overprotective

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.580 align:middle line:10%
as their own parents
because they feel

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.740 align:middle line:10%
they have hurt their parent.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:10%
And therefore, they
feel they deserve

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.180 align:middle line:10%
to be hurt in return
by their own children.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.920 align:middle line:10%
>> You did it again, didn't you?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.690 align:middle line:10%
So did I. Broke every
New Year's resolution.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.490 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it only
takes two weeks

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.770 align:middle line:90%
before you start breaking them.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.245 align:middle line:84%
Why do we behave
in ways we hate?

00:01:02.245 --> 00:01:03.370 align:middle line:90%
We have help for you today.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.380 align:middle line:84%
We have Dr. Irwin Gootnick,
who has written a book called

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.270 align:middle line:84%
by the name "Why You
Behave in Ways You Hate

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.070 align:middle line:90%
and What You Can Do About It."

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.450 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.410 align:middle line:90%
Irwin.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thanks for having me.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Wisdom television is very,
very pleased to welcome you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:84%
because there's not one
person I know out there who

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.480 align:middle line:84%
doesn't behave in ways
they hate sometimes.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Is it true that you can change
when you get into so much pain

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.350 align:middle line:90%
that you can't stand it anymore?

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Most people can't.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.130 align:middle line:10%
And they are doomed to repeating
unpleasant experiences.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.890 align:middle line:10%
As opposed to a child who
burns their hand on a hot stove

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:10%
and learns not to do
it again, most of us

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.110 align:middle line:10%
tend to repeat unpleasant
experiences over and over again

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:10%
because we are motivated
by forces in our life

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.840 align:middle line:10%
that we are not aware of.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we try to
change our behavior

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.640 align:middle line:84%
and do well by
ourselves, ironically,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.919 align:middle line:90%
we end up feeling guilty.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.480 align:middle line:84%
>> Guilt is the basis of
everything that we're doing bad

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.280 align:middle line:90%
to ourselves.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.080 align:middle line:90%
Do you think?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.230 align:middle line:90%
It has a lot to do with it.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
Because when you are
a child growing up

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.630 align:middle line:84%
in a family with flawed
parents, flawed siblings,

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.050 align:middle line:84%
people who act badly on a
consistent, long-term basis

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.820 align:middle line:84%
so that you can't
discount it, you

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.460 align:middle line:84%
have a tendency, as a
child, to blame yourself

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.420 align:middle line:90%
for what goes wrong.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.860 align:middle line:84%
Like the primitive
tribe in nature

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.340 align:middle line:84%
when there are earthquakes and
floods and droughts and so on,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.400 align:middle line:90%
we've angered the gods.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.890 align:middle line:84%
It's our fault.
We have to atone.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.490 align:middle line:90%
>> We've angered our parents.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:45.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:84%
But parents behave in ways that
show that they are wounded.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.130 align:middle line:84%
They say things like,
you're ruining my life.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.020 align:middle line:84%
And you're driving
me to drink and--

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.370 align:middle line:90%
>> How can you do this to me?

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.403 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, how can you do this
to me, my thyroid, my head.

00:02:59.403 --> 00:03:00.320 align:middle line:90%
I hope your children--

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.003 align:middle line:90%
>> You're giving me an ulcer.

00:03:02.003 --> 00:03:03.170 align:middle line:90%
>> You've given me an ulcer.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:05.280 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, you've given me an ulcer.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.910 align:middle line:84%
And I hope your children do
to you what you've done to me.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Irwin, is there such a
thing as a functional family?

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Because there's a large range
on the bell-shaped curve

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.570 align:middle line:90%
of behaviors which are fine.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.270 align:middle line:84%
Children want to give
their parents good grades

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.900 align:middle line:84%
and discount aberrations,
a bad day and so on.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.000 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is that we as
parents have our own childhood

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
experiences which have created
flawed problems for us.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.790 align:middle line:84%
And we carry them over
with our children.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.990 align:middle line:90%
And we don't change.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.200 align:middle line:84%
You know that the adults
that you know who act badly

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.110 align:middle line:84%
do it consistently for
years and years and years.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.080 align:middle line:10%
So a child can't
discount something bad

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.810 align:middle line:10%
happening as a bad day.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:48.920 align:middle line:90%
Parents act badly.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.690 align:middle line:90%
They pout and they get angry.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.640 align:middle line:84%
And they reject
their children and do

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.010 align:middle line:84%
all kinds of things which
show that they are wounded.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.390 align:middle line:90%
And children feel guilty.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.730 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they have
to inhibit something

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.300 align:middle line:90%
which is good for them.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.880 align:middle line:84%
An overprotective parent
is a very simple example

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.860 align:middle line:90%
for your audience to read.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.170 align:middle line:84%
You're out there playing and
having fun and spontaneous

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.850 align:middle line:84%
and riding your bike
and doing sports.

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:84%
And your mother or father,
whoever it is, is frantic.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.260 align:middle line:90%
Getting crazy.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.385 align:middle line:90%
You're going to get killed.

00:04:17.385 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:90%
How can you do this?

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:19.620 align:middle line:84%
>> There are bad
people out there.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.665 align:middle line:90%
And they're getting agitated.

00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:23.790 align:middle line:84%
So you're having fun and
doing what's good for you.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And you see your parent losing
it, going off the deep end.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.530 align:middle line:90%
You are causing that.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.740 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you
become cautious

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.850 align:middle line:84%
and inhibited as a result of
feeling guilty about ruining

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:90%
your parent for having fun.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.778 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be cautious.

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:41.070 align:middle line:90%
You don't want to be inhibited.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.778 align:middle line:84%
But you go through
life feeling that way.

00:04:42.778 --> 00:04:45.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can't understand
why you can't change.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:90%
You can't go on ski trips.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:84%
You can't allow yourself
to fly in a plane

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:middle line:90%
or do sports and so on.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:84%
Because every time
you do, you start

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.490 align:middle line:84%
to feel guilty which is
associated historically

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.710 align:middle line:84%
with ruining someone
else, ruining a parent.

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.772 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could
rebel against that.

00:05:01.772 --> 00:05:04.230 align:middle line:84%
You could say, oh, I'm not
going to limit myself and become

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.860 align:middle line:90%
cautious.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.110 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm going to be a skydiver.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Skydiver, daredevil,
take chances, be wild,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:13.140 align:middle line:84%
ski off cliffs, and so on,
all of which are messages

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.430 align:middle line:90%
to the parent.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.700 align:middle line:84%
I want you to recognize all
of your overprotectiveness

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.480 align:middle line:90%
is ruining my life.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.095 align:middle line:84%
So these are like
neon signs which

00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:22.470 align:middle line:84%
get bigger and
bigger and bigger,

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.610 align:middle line:90%
hoping the parent gets it.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.250 align:middle line:84%
But instead, the parent
gets more frantic.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.910 align:middle line:90%
You feel more guilty.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.020 align:middle line:84%
So the only alternative you have
is either to rebel against it

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.820 align:middle line:84%
or to accommodate it
and become cautious.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.470 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not-- when the child
starts to become very cautious

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.240 align:middle line:84%
because the parent
is overprotective,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.120 align:middle line:84%
it's not necessarily
because the child is afraid.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.890 align:middle line:84%
But it's because
the child doesn't

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.840 align:middle line:90%
want to displease the parents.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.890 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:84%
It's not that the
child is afraid.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.370 align:middle line:84%
It looks like the
child is afraid.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.820 align:middle line:84%
The actual fact is the child
is feeling guilty about hurting

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:90%
someone else.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.793 align:middle line:84%
And when they grow
up, they vow they're

00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:00.710 align:middle line:84%
going to be different
with their own children.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:01.970 align:middle line:84%
They're going to
give them free rein

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.262 align:middle line:90%
and encourage them to have fun.

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:04.850 align:middle line:84%
And they act just
as overprotective

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:08.180 align:middle line:84%
as their own parents
because they feel

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.340 align:middle line:90%
they have hurt their parent.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, they
feel they deserve

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.007 align:middle line:84%
to be hurt in return
by their own children.

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:84%
The second reason, if you
do to your children what

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.683 align:middle line:84%
was done to you, you don't have
to remember how unpleasant it

00:06:20.683 --> 00:06:22.850 align:middle line:84%
was for you when you were
a child because you're now

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.830 align:middle line:84%
the doer instead
of the receiver.

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.100 align:middle line:84%
So you can see with the example
of overprotection that happens.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can have it with a
child's school phobias-- kids

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.180 align:middle line:84%
who are afraid to go to
school and leave home.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.070 align:middle line:90%
It looks like they're fearful.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.100 align:middle line:84%
Well, actually, they're guilty
about leaving a parent who

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.170 align:middle line:84%
needs them, who's
possessive, who's

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.510 align:middle line:84%
holding onto them, who needs
them to be close to the parent.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.170 align:middle line:84%
So they feel if they separate
and move away and have

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.120 align:middle line:84%
other relationships
and enjoy school,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.250 align:middle line:84%
the parent will be
left out and hurt.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.830 align:middle line:84%
So they don't allow
themselves to move away.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.220 align:middle line:84%
That's the
overpossessive parent.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And in relation to a parent like
that, you grow up with values.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Loyalty is best,
loyalty at all costs.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And stick to your ethics,
even if it kills you.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Even if it kills you.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.130 align:middle line:84%
And with the
overprotective parent,

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.630 align:middle line:84%
you grow up with a new
moral rule caution is best.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.650 align:middle line:84%
And with a parent who
is rejecting and doesn't

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.190 align:middle line:84%
want you to be close, you
grow up with a new moral idea

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.930 align:middle line:90%
independence is best.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:24.200 align:middle line:84%
And you can see from the charts
all of the new moral rules

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.060 align:middle line:84%
that you create for
yourself and you live

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.350 align:middle line:84%
your life by in a way
that's unfulfilled is

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.150 align:middle line:84%
based on feeling guilty about
hurting a parent or a sibling.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And in order to protect
them, you restrict your life.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, do you think that
because of books like yours,

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.110 align:middle line:84%
which is different than any
other self-help book I've seen,

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.080 align:middle line:84%
by the way, in that you
go back and say, hey,

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.400 align:middle line:84%
this is what happened, do you
think that we can get to be

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.640 align:middle line:84%
better now than our
parents were for us?

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.010 align:middle line:90%
Or does it always continue?

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:02.070 align:middle line:84%
>> It continues until you
understand what the cause

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:90%
of your problem is.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.810 align:middle line:84%
You need to recognize what
is operating in you to make

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.400 align:middle line:90%
you behave in ways you hate.

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.110 align:middle line:84%
And the only way
you can do that is

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.390 align:middle line:84%
to see what happened
to you in relationship

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.380 align:middle line:84%
to a dysfunctional parent
or sibling or family.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.090 align:middle line:90%
And that's what the charts do.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.700 align:middle line:84%
The charts help you recognize
exactly what happened

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:25.600 align:middle line:84%
because you can see in one chart
all the flaws of your parents

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.800 align:middle line:90%
and what happened to you.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.360 align:middle line:84%
Or in another chart, you
can see your worst problems

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:84%
and look across and see
what happened to you.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:35.070 align:middle line:90%
Charts work like a mirror.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.960 align:middle line:84%
If you lived in an
era without mirrors--

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.573 align:middle line:84%
and let's say you
thought, gee, I

00:08:38.573 --> 00:08:39.990 align:middle line:84%
don't think I'm
attractive enough.

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:41.282 align:middle line:90%
I'd like to be more attractive.

00:08:41.282 --> 00:08:42.780 align:middle line:90%
There were no mirrors around.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.070 align:middle line:90%
Be very difficult to know.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You wouldn't know
whether you were attractive.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.220 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.500 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't tell if was your
skin, your makeup, your eyes,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.410 align:middle line:84%
your hair that needed to be
adjusted or improved in order

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:90%
to look more attractive.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly the same with
these charts in my book.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.480 align:middle line:84%
They help the reader to see
what it was that went wrong

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.670 align:middle line:84%
and how they can
make it go right.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.250 align:middle line:84%
>> So in order to help, to
be a better parent then,

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.950 align:middle line:84%
what you're saying is you've
got to cure yourself first

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:10.530 align:middle line:84%
and understand
where you came from.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.350 align:middle line:90%
>> That's exactly correct.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And when I've spoken to
parent-teachers organizations,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.660 align:middle line:84%
I come in with a
different approach.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And they're always astounded
because I don't give them

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.800 align:middle line:84%
advice on how to
raise their teenagers

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.080 align:middle line:84%
and what they should do and what
they shouldn't do and so on.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.540 align:middle line:84%
Because we all know
the problem is we

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.240 align:middle line:84%
don't know why we're not
doing the right thing.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.720 align:middle line:84%
And where you're
hung up is something

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.150 align:middle line:84%
that can be overcome when you
have the correct knowledge.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:39.400 align:middle line:84%
You were asking me just
before the show what

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.628 align:middle line:84%
do I think about people
with relationship problems

00:09:41.628 --> 00:09:42.670 align:middle line:90%
because it's a very big--

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.503 align:middle line:84%
>> Oh, I want to do a
whole segment on that.

00:09:44.503 --> 00:09:47.470 align:middle line:84%
So I don't want you to start
it right now because that

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.570 align:middle line:84%
is a subject that
I think we really

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:90%
have to approach in depth.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:84%
But this whole
thing about parents

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and the way they
treat their children

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.030 align:middle line:84%
is really an eye opener
because everybody

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.790 align:middle line:84%
says you've got to do it
this way for the child.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.760 align:middle line:84%
And your book takes
the whole premise here

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.070 align:middle line:84%
you've got to do
this for yourself.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:84%
Your child is going to be the
byproduct of your learning

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.810 align:middle line:90%
more about yourself.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.670 align:middle line:90%
>> I agree with that completely.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:90%
That's the essence of the book.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:22.180 align:middle line:84%
>> So we're pretty
important then.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.190 align:middle line:10%
>> It's through us and our
behavior that our children end

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.570 align:middle line:10%
up either doing well or poorly.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:37.190 align:middle line:84%
>> And it's through us and our
past behavior toward us that we

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:43.540 align:middle line:84%
start to behave badly
toward ourselves.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:46.750 align:middle line:84%
So we have to correct things
at many different levels

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:51.410 align:middle line:84%
is what you're saying here in
order to get down to the nub.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is a
fantastic experience

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.350 align:middle line:10%
to meet a psychiatrist by
the name of Irwin Gootnick.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.360 align:middle line:90%
He is a world-class teacher.

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.070 align:middle line:84%
He teaches other
psychiatrists how

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.010 align:middle line:84%
to do this in California
besides his own practice.

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:10.880 align:middle line:84%
But he has written
this astounding book

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.690 align:middle line:84%
which really starts to get
to the core of everybody's

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:18.200 align:middle line:84%
problem of guilt.
The book is called

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:84%
"Why You Behave in Ways You Hate
and What You Can Do About It."

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:22.980 align:middle line:90%
Stay with us.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.490 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about relationships next.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.667 align:middle line:90%
You won't want to miss this.

00:11:26.667 --> 00:11:27.500 align:middle line:90%
We'll be right back.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:29.010 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:10%
Why do you behave
in ways you hate?

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.770 align:middle line:10%
Well, we're talking
about that today.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.010 align:middle line:84%
This is Dr. Irwin
Gootnick's book.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.530 align:middle line:84%
He's a psychiatrist
who has written about

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:44.110 align:middle line:84%
"Why You Behave in Ways You Hate
and What You Can Do About It."

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.615 align:middle line:84%
Irwin, you're mind boggling
here with us today.

00:11:47.615 --> 00:11:49.240 align:middle line:84%
We promised this
audience we were going

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.100 align:middle line:90%
to talk about relationships.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.290 align:middle line:84%
I want to talk about
relationships from the woman's

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.200 align:middle line:90%
standpoint now.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And I hear this from
women all over the place

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.340 align:middle line:84%
that they are
constantly meeting what

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.370 align:middle line:90%
seems to be an available man.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.950 align:middle line:84%
And soon as things
get heated up,

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.040 align:middle line:84%
and they get into a real
loving relationship,

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.090 align:middle line:90%
he takes a powder.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:12.380 align:middle line:90%
And he runs.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.300 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's a
fascinating question.

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.680 align:middle line:10%
It actually applies
to both sexes.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.080 align:middle line:10%
There are equally
as many women who

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:10%
have trouble in fulfilling
their end of the relationship

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.560 align:middle line:10%
as men do.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:90%
>> I have not seen that.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.300 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.220 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, for today's show,
we'll make you right.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.278 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:32.278 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
>> I've been on a number
of TV shows as you know.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.970 align:middle line:84%
And one of them focused
on this subject matter

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.560 align:middle line:84%
from another vantage
point because

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:45.930 align:middle line:84%
of the notoriety about
Clinton's behavior and so on.

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:47.760 align:middle line:84%
And just to use it
as an illustration,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.250 align:middle line:90%
not to talk about him per se.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.280 align:middle line:84%
But people who have
many affairs or are

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.710 align:middle line:84%
unable to be successful in a
committed relationship with one

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:01.410 align:middle line:84%
person can be
understood if you look

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.670 align:middle line:84%
at the three areas in the book
that I've been talking about--

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:10.380 align:middle line:84%
accommodation to a
flawed parent, rebellion

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:13.470 align:middle line:84%
as a protest against a
flawed parent, and three,

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.090 align:middle line:90%
mimicking a flawed parent.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.050 align:middle line:90%
Let's start with the first.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:23.970 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you're a boy who
has a good relationship

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.490 align:middle line:90%
with his mother.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.410 align:middle line:84%
And you have a
father or a brother

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.050 align:middle line:84%
who is very jealous
of that relationship

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.980 align:middle line:90%
or threatened by it.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:36.710 align:middle line:90%
What I mean is they're insecure.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:90%
They have problems.

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.570 align:middle line:84%
You have a father who came
from a family which made him

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.150 align:middle line:90%
feel inadequate and rejected.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:84%
And he feels somehow
threatened by you,

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.130 align:middle line:84%
even though you have a good
relationship with your mother.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:55.110 align:middle line:84%
That would make you feel guilty
about success with one woman

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.410 align:middle line:84%
because it is associated
in your mind with guilt

00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.970 align:middle line:90%
about hurting someone else.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, if you had a
parent who lived vicariously

00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.380 align:middle line:84%
through your sexual
conquests, let's

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:13.470 align:middle line:84%
say you had a father who
was inadequate sexually,

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:16.020 align:middle line:84%
inept socially, did
poorly with women.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:20.070 align:middle line:84%
And he couldn't wait to have a
son fulfill his own fantasies

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.680 align:middle line:90%
by being a great ladies' man.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.410 align:middle line:84%
It would be very difficult
for you to be successful

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:27.570 align:middle line:84%
having a serious
relationship with one woman

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:31.842 align:middle line:84%
because you'd be motivated
to have many affairs.

00:14:31.842 --> 00:14:33.800 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, you'd be
disappointing your father's

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.050 align:middle line:90%
needs for great conquests.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.490 align:middle line:90%
That would be second.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.212 align:middle line:84%
The third would be if you had a
parent who was very rejecting.

00:14:41.212 --> 00:14:42.170 align:middle line:90%
Let's say you're a boy.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.140 align:middle line:84%
And you had a very
rejecting mother.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.290 align:middle line:84%
Every time you tried to
be close, she'd push away.

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:50.680 align:middle line:90%
She'd become uncomfortable.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.940 align:middle line:84%
You would feel guilty
about burdening her

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.930 align:middle line:90%
by trying to be close to her.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.360 align:middle line:84%
And so for you, you would keep
distance from relationships

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:03.367 align:middle line:84%
because you feel that attempts
at being close and committed

00:15:03.367 --> 00:15:04.700 align:middle line:90%
were going to push someone away.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:90%
So that's based on rejection.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:11.420 align:middle line:84%
The second category--
rebellion as a protest.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.550 align:middle line:84%
If you came from
a family which was

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:18.020 align:middle line:84%
highly moralistic and critical
and opposed to sexuality,

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.780 align:middle line:84%
and they put it down, you
might develop an attitude.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:21.980 align:middle line:90%
Oh, yeah?

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:22.920 align:middle line:90%
I'm going to show you.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.587 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to have
my life restricted

00:15:24.587 --> 00:15:29.343 align:middle line:84%
by having a negative
attitude about sex and women.

00:15:29.343 --> 00:15:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And you might go in
the other direction.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:32.760 align:middle line:90%
>> I'll be a transvestite.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.038 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's going
further than the book.

00:15:36.038 --> 00:15:39.050 align:middle line:84%
[LAUGHS] In other words,
I will be promiscuous,

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.730 align:middle line:84%
have multiple
affairs, and so on.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.540 align:middle line:84%
And I'm never going
to let myself be--

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:42.707 align:middle line:90%
>> And be scandalous, right?

00:15:42.707 --> 00:15:44.360 align:middle line:90%
>> Scandalous.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:49.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, the two next areas which
are very, very important

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.700 align:middle line:84%
to your question
have to do with what

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:56.080 align:middle line:84%
is the rebellion against a
possessive or needy mother?

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.180 align:middle line:84%
If a boy has a possessive
mother, love me.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:15:59.980 align:middle line:90%
You don't write.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:00.970 align:middle line:90%
You don't call.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.660 align:middle line:84%
But carried to the
extreme that no matter how

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:84%
much attention and
love and consideration

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.850 align:middle line:84%
you pay to your mother,
it's never enough.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:13.750 align:middle line:84%
And she wants loyalty just
to her and no one else.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:18.430 align:middle line:84%
You would rebel against that
by avoiding ever getting

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:21.730 align:middle line:84%
serious with one person because
of the fear of being trapped.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:23.500 align:middle line:90%
A woman falls in love with you.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:26.080 align:middle line:84%
You now feel obligated
to have to be loyal

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.570 align:middle line:84%
just like you did with your
mother, the idea of being loyal

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.020 align:middle line:90%
or you--

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.020 align:middle line:90%
>> And she devoured you.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:31.240 align:middle line:90%
>> She devoured you.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:35.260 align:middle line:84%
And your guilt also
might be to her

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.810 align:middle line:84%
because you're not supposed to
have other good relationships

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.812 align:middle line:90%
other than her.

00:16:38.812 --> 00:16:40.020 align:middle line:90%
So that would be a rebellion.

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:40.820 align:middle line:90%
Have many.

00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.960 align:middle line:84%
You'd not allow yourself
to be confined to one.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.870 align:middle line:84%
Or similar to that, if
you had a mother who

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:49.330 align:middle line:84%
was very needy
and depressed, you

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.900 align:middle line:84%
might feel that there was
a burden to cheer her up,

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.460 align:middle line:90%
to make her happy.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.430 align:middle line:84%
And you again don't want to be
trapped into being a caretaker.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:59.050 align:middle line:90%
So you run the other way.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:01.630 align:middle line:84%
In "Marvin's Room," we
talked about that, the, movie

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.250 align:middle line:90%
"Marvin's Room."

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.650 align:middle line:84%
You see that with a
woman and a sick father.

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.510 align:middle line:90%
She becomes very cold and hard.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:11.950 align:middle line:84%
She doesn't want to be
sucked in to being a rescuer.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.349 align:middle line:90%
The last would be mimicking.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:16.869 align:middle line:84%
Now, "The Dark Side
of Camelot" was a book

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:20.260 align:middle line:84%
written by Seymour Hersh in
which he chronicled the Kennedy

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.390 align:middle line:90%
family story.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.390 align:middle line:84%
And the senior Kennedy was
notorious, the father of--

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Womanizer.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Womanizer.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.700 align:middle line:84%
And he actually used to
bring prostitutes home

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.610 align:middle line:84%
while the family was
at home having dinner.

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And assuming that's true,
you can imagine the influence

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.980 align:middle line:84%
on the sons, all of
whom have followed suit

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:44.500 align:middle line:90%
and have had multiple affairs.

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:45.670 align:middle line:90%
Every single one of--

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.170 align:middle line:90%
you go down the line--

00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:50.737 align:middle line:84%
the children, the sons,
the grandsons, and so on.

00:17:50.737 --> 00:17:52.570 align:middle line:84%
And it gets passed on
from one to the other.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:53.750 align:middle line:90%
Why does that happen?

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:57.040 align:middle line:84%
One, you don't want to
remember the unpleasantness

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.000 align:middle line:84%
of living in a family where
there is that kind of flaw.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.640 align:middle line:84%
You might feel sorry
for your mother.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:84%
You might be
humiliated, embarrassed.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.810 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, it might
feel wrong for you

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:14.140 align:middle line:84%
to be more successful with
women than your father was

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.420 align:middle line:84%
who obviously was not
successful because he was not

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.240 align:middle line:84%
able to have a successful
relationship with his wife.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.860 align:middle line:90%
He was always having affairs.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:22.750 align:middle line:84%
So it might be
difficult for a son

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.860 align:middle line:84%
to actually better his
father on that count.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:29.230 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at accommodation,
rebellion, and mimicking,

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:34.360 align:middle line:84%
you can begin to understand
why these men that we've talked

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.468 align:middle line:84%
about would have difficulty
being committed and serious

00:18:37.468 --> 00:18:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and why they would
run the other way,

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:84%
why would they be
scared, why it would

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:45.610 align:middle line:84%
be difficult to be
committed and serious.

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.460 align:middle line:84%
>> I've always thought that it
was because they didn't want

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.920 align:middle line:84%
to commit to this one
relationship because they were

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:56.080 align:middle line:84%
sure that right around the
corner was the absolutely

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.330 align:middle line:90%
perfect woman for them.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.980 align:middle line:90%
>> That's a rationalization.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:03.400 align:middle line:84%
That's a justification
for not actually getting

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.810 align:middle line:90%
to the core of the issue.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:09.190 align:middle line:84%
The core of the issue
is one of these matters.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the perfect woman
is around the corner,

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.570 align:middle line:84%
you could have that
actually as a belief

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:20.770 align:middle line:84%
if you had a parent who felt
that you were so perfect,

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.410 align:middle line:84%
no woman was ever
good enough for you.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Why, doesn't every mother
think that about her son?

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:28.490 align:middle line:84%
Didn't your mother think no
one's good enough for you?

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Up to a point.

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.890 align:middle line:84%
>> But then she said how
could you do this to me?

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:33.890 align:middle line:90%
>> The problem is that--

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:90%
>> You're giving me an ulcer.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:38.900 align:middle line:84%
>> If it's carried
to an extreme,

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:42.880 align:middle line:84%
and she really means it
in all her heart and soul,

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.810 align:middle line:84%
then you will have to believe
in fact that there is no woman

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.350 align:middle line:84%
good enough for you
other than your mother.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.940 align:middle line:84%
You see, the whole
purpose of saying

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:55.390 align:middle line:84%
that to a son is because you
want to be cherished as number

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:59.020 align:middle line:84%
one, which undermines
his ability

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.930 align:middle line:84%
to think that anyone
out there is ever

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:01.930 align:middle line:90%
good enough for himself.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.343 align:middle line:84%
So if he find someone, oh,
no, this is not the right one.

00:20:05.343 --> 00:20:06.760 align:middle line:84%
There's someone
else who's better.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:07.940 align:middle line:90%
And the next one is better.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.273 align:middle line:90%
But what is the purpose of that?

00:20:09.273 --> 00:20:12.200 align:middle line:84%
You never, ever settle
into a serious relationship

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.000 align:middle line:90%
with one person.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.780 align:middle line:84%
>> And you end up lonely
and old by yourself.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:17.920 align:middle line:90%
>> And tired.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.330 align:middle line:90%
>> And tired from chasing.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:90%
>> From chasing.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:90%
>> What finally changes it?

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Because I have seen these
men who suddenly settle down.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.080 align:middle line:84%
What changes them
besides your book?

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.580 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I can only address
it from the side that I'm--

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.490 align:middle line:84%
the information I'm offering
to the audience that

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.190 align:middle line:84%
reads the book or
hears me now, which

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:43.230 align:middle line:84%
is if you understand the
cause of a particular issue,

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.170 align:middle line:90%
you can work on it.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:44.970 align:middle line:90%
You can solve it.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:47.820 align:middle line:84%
For example, let's
say you discovered

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:52.350 align:middle line:84%
from reading the book that the
reason you were not allowing

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.680 align:middle line:84%
yourself to get
serious about one woman

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.200 align:middle line:84%
was because let's say
your father was threatened

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.440 align:middle line:90%
by your success.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.350 align:middle line:84%
Every time you notice yourself
pulling away or getting

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:06.680 align:middle line:84%
uncomfortable in a relationship,
you have that knowledge.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:12.590 align:middle line:84%
You say, oh, I'm pulling away
because he felt displaced,

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.410 align:middle line:84%
or he felt threatened,
or he felt jealous.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:17.690 align:middle line:84%
That gives you something
you can work on.

00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:18.770 align:middle line:90%
You can grapple with it.

00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
You can try to solve
the issue but if you--

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:27.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You can say that this is
no more applicable to my life.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.630 align:middle line:84%
That relationship with
my father is over.

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:31.560 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he's dead.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.910 align:middle line:90%
Maybe he's not-- doesn't apply.

00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, even if he's dead, it
might not give you any relief.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.460 align:middle line:10%
And the reason is if you're
still harboring guilt

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:10%
about a dynamic in
your relationship

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.990 align:middle line:10%
with him that you're not
aware of, you can't solve it.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:50.020 align:middle line:84%
You can't overcome a problem
without knowing its cause.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:52.420 align:middle line:90%
>> That is unbelievable.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, what about
somebody going back

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:03.260 align:middle line:84%
in their mind to when
they were children

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.480 align:middle line:84%
and then replaying
the whole thing out

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.880 align:middle line:84%
from a different standpoint
as an adult today?

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.920 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.420 align:middle line:84%
>> You mean if you could relive
your life knowing everything

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:11.690 align:middle line:90%
you know now?

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.565 align:middle line:84%
>> Yeah, in your mind,
go back and replay it.

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:16.530 align:middle line:90%


00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:18.430 align:middle line:84%
>> It would be difficult
to do because--

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think it's an
important thing to know

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:84%
it's difficult. But the
more important thing is

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.530 align:middle line:84%
they're telling me
I've got to close.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.197 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have
to read your book.

00:22:26.197 --> 00:22:27.750 align:middle line:90%
That's the only thing I can say.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.270 align:middle line:10%
Irwin Gootnick, who
is a psychiatrist,

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:36.910 align:middle line:10%
and he has written a book "Why
You Behave in Ways You Hate

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:38.560 align:middle line:10%
and What You Can Do About It."

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.185 align:middle line:10%
Amazing.

00:22:40.185 --> 00:22:41.560 align:middle line:10%
I always tell you
around here, we

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:44.530 align:middle line:10%
give you miracles on this show.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:45.480 align:middle line:90%
Keep coming back.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.830 align:middle line:90%
