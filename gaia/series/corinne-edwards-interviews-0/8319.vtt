00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.220 align:middle line:10%
>> Your reality is created
by your thought about it,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.363 align:middle line:10%
and by the word you speak and
the actions that you undertake.

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:39.780 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, the
first thing we have

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.870 align:middle line:10%
to eliminate from our mind in
the process of manifestation

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.990 align:middle line:10%
is we have to eliminate any
thought that we do not now

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.210 align:middle line:10%
have, or, in the
words of some people,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.680 align:middle line:10%
that we somehow
can't have, there's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.600 align:middle line:10%
some reason why
we can't have what

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.340 align:middle line:10%
it is we choose to experience
in life, but rather to say,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.620 align:middle line:10%
with all the faith
we can muster,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.390 align:middle line:10%
not only can I have that,
I have that right now.

>> Wouldn't it be wonderful to
have a conversation with God?

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have someone here
today who actually has done it,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:84%
and is going to teach us
maybe how you can do it.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.165 align:middle line:84%
And of course, for
the one or two people

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:19.770 align:middle line:84%
who don't know who
that is, that's

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.810 align:middle line:84%
Neale Donald Walsch, who has
completed his third volume

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:90%
of "Conversations with God."

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.583 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:28.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you, Corrine.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to be here.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.760 align:middle line:84%
>> We are so thrilled
to have you back.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, it's good to be back.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.280 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there are one or two
people in the audience who

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.860 align:middle line:84%
don't know the history of
how you happened to have

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.980 align:middle line:90%
a conversation with God.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.830 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, it all started
[INAUDIBLE] in 1992,

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.483 align:middle line:10%
when I reached a low point in
my life and I called out to God.

00:01:47.483 --> 00:01:48.900 align:middle line:10%
And I asked the
kinds of questions

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.790 align:middle line:10%
that we all ask at
times like that.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.290 align:middle line:84%
What does it take
to make life work?

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.707 align:middle line:84%
What have I done
to deserve a life

00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:55.590 align:middle line:90%
of such continuing struggle?

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.290 align:middle line:84%
And help me to understand
how to get from where

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.510 align:middle line:90%
I am to where I want to be.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, much
to my shock and surprise,

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:90%
God answered.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.140 align:middle line:84%
My calling out came in the
form of an angry letter

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.530 align:middle line:84%
that I wrote in the
middle of the night.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.905 align:middle line:84%
At four o'clock
in the morning, I

00:02:09.905 --> 00:02:12.630 align:middle line:84%
woke up with great frustration,
marched out to the living room,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.450 align:middle line:84%
where I was sitting
in the living room,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.630 align:middle line:84%
and I saw a yellow legal
pad on the coffee table,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:84%
so I began to write an angry
letter to the universe with all

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.498 align:middle line:90%
those angry questions.

00:02:22.498 --> 00:02:23.790 align:middle line:90%
>> How could you do this to me?

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.082 align:middle line:90%
>> How could you do this to me?

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:26.260 align:middle line:90%
After all I've done for you.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:90%
>> Right.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>> And there I was, sitting
in my pool of anger,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.820 align:middle line:84%
when I heard a voiceless
voice that said to me, Neale,

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
do you really want answers
to all of these questions,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.620 align:middle line:90%
or are you just venting?

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And I wrote-- I can
recall the moment--

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.150 align:middle line:84%
I am venting, but if you have
answers, I'd sure as heck

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.100 align:middle line:90%
like to know what they are.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.980 align:middle line:84%
And then I was given the
answers to all those questions

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.080 align:middle line:84%
I had written, and to questions
I hadn't even thought about.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.070 align:middle line:84%
And as I began hearing those
answers, really in my head,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.022 align:middle line:84%
as a voiceless voice, other
questions came up for me.

00:02:57.022 --> 00:02:58.980 align:middle line:84%
And I began to answer
those questions, as well.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.300 align:middle line:90%
And the result was--

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.710 align:middle line:90%
that's the short story--

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.630 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful 3 and
1/2 year dialogue

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.540 align:middle line:84%
which has produced an
extraordinary trilogy of books,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.130 align:middle line:84%
never really
intended to be books.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.460 align:middle line:84%
It was always a private
process going on with me

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.830 align:middle line:84%
in the privacy of my own
heart and my own soul

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.330 align:middle line:90%
and my own mind.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.510 align:middle line:84%
But it wound up turning into a
series of best-selling books.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.690 align:middle line:84%
>> The first book,
"Conversations with God,"

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.670 align:middle line:90%
surprised everyone.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it remained,
and I think still remains,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.510 align:middle line:84%
on the bestseller list
after a couple of years.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.310 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.330 align:middle line:90%
For over 95 weeks.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.518 align:middle line:84%
>> Why are people so interested
in what God has said to you?

00:03:37.518 --> 00:03:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Because, Corrine, I think
that people, first of all,

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.490 align:middle line:84%
share my experience,
to some degree,

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:84%
my experience of frustration
with life as it's now being

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.330 align:middle line:90%
lived.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Not that all of us
are having a bad time,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.980 align:middle line:84%
but we see the world in a
place that we don't think

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
it should be, given all of
our own best intentions.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.230 align:middle line:84%
So the universe,
the world has begun

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.650 align:middle line:90%
to lose patience with itself.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:84%
We can see that this is
not the way it ought to be,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.700 align:middle line:84%
the way life is now being
lived on our planet.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.000 align:middle line:84%
And that frustration has driven
the engine of their experience

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.870 align:middle line:90%
of searching.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.120 align:middle line:84%
If that isn't the
way, then what is?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And of course, if
somebody writes a book

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.883 align:middle line:84%
and said I had a conversation
with God about this,

00:04:12.883 --> 00:04:14.520 align:middle line:90%
that's pretty hard to resist.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
So people wind up
reading the book.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.399 align:middle line:84%
And then they, much
to their astonishment,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.763 align:middle line:84%
agree was 95% of what
they're reading there.

00:04:21.763 --> 00:04:23.680 align:middle line:84%
Nobody should agree with
all of it, of course.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.390 align:middle line:90%
I'd be real upset if they did.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.240 align:middle line:84%
I'd be a little bit
frightened of that.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.120 align:middle line:84%
But people are finding a
large place of agreement

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.383 align:middle line:84%
with most of what they're
reading in these three books.

00:04:33.383 --> 00:04:35.550 align:middle line:84%
So I think what's happening
is that people have come

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.460 align:middle line:84%
to the same conclusions
I've come to,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:90%
that there's a better way.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:84%
And the book outlines what
those better ways might be.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.110 align:middle line:84%
So the books have become,
as a result, very popular.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.730 align:middle line:84%
>> What are we
doing wrong, Neale?

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Everything, just about.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.600 align:middle line:84%
It starts, Corrine, with our
understanding of who we are

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.360 align:middle line:84%
and how it is for
us as human beings.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
And the largest misunderstanding
is that there's more than one

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.270 align:middle line:90%
of us in the room.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.880 align:middle line:84%
People think that there's
you and there's me,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
that there's him
and there's her,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.660 align:middle line:84%
that there's that
country and that country,

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.380 align:middle line:84%
and they don't really understand
that there's only one of us.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.100 align:middle line:84%
So the basic misunderstanding,
the first cultural myth

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.020 align:middle line:84%
that drives the engine
of our experience

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.150 align:middle line:84%
in the wrong
direction is the myth

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.670 align:middle line:84%
that we're somehow
separate from each other.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.270 align:middle line:84%
That myth is born in a
larger misunderstanding

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.790 align:middle line:84%
that we're somehow
separate from God.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.770 align:middle line:90%
Both statements are untrue.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.620 align:middle line:84%
But when we start from
such a place of untruths,

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:84%
from such a lack of
understanding, all of the other

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.610 align:middle line:84%
experiences that we
co-create are also

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.820 align:middle line:90%
sent in the wrong direction.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.620 align:middle line:84%
They're experiences
that don't get us

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.720 align:middle line:90%
where we say we want to go.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.670 align:middle line:84%
The result is we have
a human race that's

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.310 align:middle line:84%
saying it wants to go one
place, and is really winding up

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.520 align:middle line:90%
in quite another place.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.320 align:middle line:90%
We don't know why.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.730 align:middle line:90%
We don't know how we got here.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.410 align:middle line:84%
We look over our shoulder and
say, how did this all happen?

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.415 align:middle line:84%
We can't even really
put it all together.

00:06:01.415 --> 00:06:02.790 align:middle line:84%
But we know how
to get out of it.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.490 align:middle line:84%
The way to get out of it is
to change our idea that we're

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.330 align:middle line:90%
separate from each other.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.390 align:middle line:84%
There are several
other cultural myths

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.030 align:middle line:84%
that have also been
mistaken and come

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.070 align:middle line:84%
under the heading of
what we're doing wrong.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.230 align:middle line:84%
The second one is that we
think that there is not

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.210 align:middle line:84%
enough of all the
good things in life.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:84%
We believe in a life of
insufficiency, a life of lack.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And God tells us in the
dialogues that there is enough.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's
the rich statement

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.130 align:middle line:90%
that's made-- there is enough.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we thought
there was enough--

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.230 align:middle line:84%
enough food, enough money,
enough energy, enough oil,

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.412 align:middle line:84%
enough of land or
whatever that we

00:06:39.412 --> 00:06:40.620 align:middle line:90%
think there's not enough of--

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.420 align:middle line:90%
>> Enough health.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.950 align:middle line:84%
>> --enough health-- if we
thought there was enough of all

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.110 align:middle line:84%
the things we need
in life to be happy,

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.260 align:middle line:84%
we'd begin to find a way to
share it more appropriately

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.910 align:middle line:90%
and more freely with others.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.560 align:middle line:90%
What stops us from sharing--

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:84%
even health, by the way, which
is not shared in this country,

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.740 align:middle line:84%
and in most places
on this planet

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.450 align:middle line:90%
in the form of health care--

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.850 align:middle line:84%
we can't find it in
our hearts to provide

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.540 align:middle line:84%
even the minimal adequate health
care for all of our brothers

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.010 align:middle line:90%
and sisters on the planet.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.978 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you have
enough money, of course,

00:07:10.978 --> 00:07:12.520 align:middle line:84%
you can have access
to all the health

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.330 align:middle line:90%
care you could possibly want.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.410 align:middle line:84%
But if you're one of the 95%
of the people on the planet who

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.360 align:middle line:84%
don't have that kind of
money, well, then you

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.620 align:middle line:90%
take your chances.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.890 align:middle line:84%
What kind of a humane race
would set it up that way?

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.110 align:middle line:84%
So we're a very
primitive species

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.080 align:middle line:84%
trying to bumble along
in our misunderstandings.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.827 align:middle line:84%
The books, however,
set things right.

00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:33.660 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do,
therefore, is read them.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.618 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we also have to
do something about it.

00:07:35.618 --> 00:07:38.860 align:middle line:84%
For example, we have to change
the way we have been thinking.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.990 align:middle line:84%
>> The difference between your
book and pretty much 99% of all

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.950 align:middle line:84%
the other metaphysical work
that's out there is that

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.330 align:middle line:84%
the other metaphysical works
says we're here to learn

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:54.460 align:middle line:90%
our lessons.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.630 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.230 align:middle line:84%
>> And your book says
we're here to experience.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:84%
>> And remember
who we really are.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.870 align:middle line:84%
To experience who we
really are and to remember

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.010 align:middle line:90%
who we really are.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, Corrine, to
recreate ourselves anew

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.640 align:middle line:84%
in the next grandest version
of the greatest vision we ever

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:90%
held about who we are.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the missing
element, and that's

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.110 align:middle line:84%
what we're not doing, because
we keep on insisting that we're

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:21.210 align:middle line:90%
here to learn some lesson.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you think you're
here to learn a lesson

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.252 align:middle line:84%
and you're clearly and
obviously not learning it,

00:08:25.252 --> 00:08:28.262 align:middle line:84%
then you'll keep on continuing
behaviors thinking that,

00:08:28.262 --> 00:08:29.470 align:middle line:90%
well, one day, I'll learn it.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:84%
If I keep on doing this, I'll
learn how to do it better.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:84%
The approach to life
that masters take

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.870 align:middle line:84%
is to know that it's not
about learning anything.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:41.470 align:middle line:84%
We're not here to
learn a lesson,

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:84%
but rather to remember something
we've always known and are

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:90%
simply not applying.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.800 align:middle line:84%
No one needs to tell
many people, truly,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.890 align:middle line:84%
what it is like to love, what
it is like to feel compassion,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.090 align:middle line:90%
one for the other.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.670 align:middle line:84%
These are I almost want
to say cellular memories.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:00.040 align:middle line:90%
These are built-in responses.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.190 align:middle line:84%
There is hardly a person on
the planet, even the toughest,

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.980 align:middle line:84%
roughest among us, who
would not feel compassion

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.705 align:middle line:90%
under certain circumstances.

00:09:07.705 --> 00:09:09.580 align:middle line:84%
The question is, why
don't we feel compassion

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.920 align:middle line:84%
under all circumstances,
and for all people?

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.730 align:middle line:84%
And so these are responses
that are built into us.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And what we have to do now
is remember who we really are

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and what the truth
of our soul is

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.100 align:middle line:84%
at times when the exterior
circumstances of our lives

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.240 align:middle line:84%
seem to want us
make us forget that.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:84%
>> The thing that is most
startling is, it says,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:84%
that whatever you came here,
this is not God's test to come

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:90%
down here.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:90%
These are not lessons.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:38.440 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.070 align:middle line:84%
>> That whatever you have
created in your life you can

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:45.410 align:middle line:90%
change, because you created it.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.310 align:middle line:84%
And you talk about the
process of manifesting

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:49.720 align:middle line:90%
whatever you like.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.540 align:middle line:84%
>> God designed us in
his image and likeness.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.600 align:middle line:90%
And God is a three-part being.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Some theologies called
these three parts

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:00.590 align:middle line:84%
God the Father, God the
Son, and God the Holy Ghost.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.882 align:middle line:84%
And there are other ways of
defining those three parts,

00:10:02.882 --> 00:10:03.682 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:10:03.682 --> 00:10:05.860 align:middle line:84%
The conscious, the subconscious,
the superconscious,

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:90%
if you're into psychology.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Virtually every
discipline, whether it's

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.400 align:middle line:84%
theology, psychology,
or raw science,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.370 align:middle line:84%
has some way of describing
the triumvirate,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.790 align:middle line:84%
the three-part beingness
that is all of life.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And what God said to
me in the dialogue

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.220 align:middle line:84%
is that we are also
three-part beings,

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.610 align:middle line:84%
and that we create from
three aspects of the self.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.490 align:middle line:84%
And those three tools of
creation that we're all given

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.260 align:middle line:90%
are thought, word, and deed.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:35.410 align:middle line:10%
That we create with our
thoughts, with our words,

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.230 align:middle line:10%
and with our actions, and
that each one of those three

00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:40.353 align:middle line:10%
elements is created
in and of itself,

00:10:40.353 --> 00:10:41.770 align:middle line:10%
and when we have
all three of them

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.160 align:middle line:10%
together, when we're
thinking and saying and doing

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.910 align:middle line:10%
the same thing, then we become
really very, very powerful.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And we produce
results in our lives,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:53.750 align:middle line:84%
and in the lives of others,
I might add, very quickly.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:57.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We are talking to
Neale Donald Walsch about

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.470 align:middle line:84%
"Conversations with
God Book Three."

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And if you hang
out with us today,

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:06.645 align:middle line:84%
you may find out how you can get
anything you want in your life.

00:11:06.645 --> 00:11:07.810 align:middle line:90%
So stay with us.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.478 align:middle line:90%

00:11:22.485 --> 00:11:25.180 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to
Neale Donald Walsch

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:10%
about the third volume of
"Conversations with God,"

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:32.090 align:middle line:10%
an uncommon dialogue.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:32.890 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.210 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:36.910 align:middle line:84%
>> We were talking about
manifesting anything you want

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:40.060 align:middle line:84%
in your life, and
about how, at first,

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.780 align:middle line:84%
of course we all know that
the idea must come first.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:46.060 align:middle line:84%
Henry Ford didn't
get the car going

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.770 align:middle line:90%
until he had it in his mind.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.380 align:middle line:84%
>> That's right, but I want to
correct something, if I may.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.820 align:middle line:90%
It's more than just terminology.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle line:10%
The truth is God says, you may
not have anything you want.

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:56.560 align:middle line:10%
And this is a
startling statement

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.400 align:middle line:10%
that's made in the dialogue, you
may not have anything you want.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.290 align:middle line:84%
Because the very act
of wanting something

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.860 align:middle line:84%
pushes it away from you,
because if you are expressing

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.920 align:middle line:84%
a wantingness for something,
that's a statement

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.410 align:middle line:90%
that you do not now have it.

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And as you believe it,
so will it be with you.

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:18.428 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, if you're sitting in
a pool of desire for something,

00:12:18.428 --> 00:12:20.470 align:middle line:84%
then you're as much as
announcing to the universe

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.463 align:middle line:84%
that it's not there
right then and there.

00:12:22.463 --> 00:12:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And that, of course,
makes it impossible

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:28.120 align:middle line:84%
for you to experience it in
your life, for your reality is

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.540 align:middle line:84%
created by your thought about
it, and by the word you speak

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.423 align:middle line:84%
and the actions
that you undertake.

00:12:33.423 --> 00:12:34.840 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the
first thing we have

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.930 align:middle line:84%
to eliminate from our mind in
the process of manifestation

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.050 align:middle line:84%
is we have to eliminate any
thought that we do not now

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.270 align:middle line:84%
have, or, in the
words of some people,

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.740 align:middle line:84%
that we somehow
can't have, there's

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.660 align:middle line:84%
some reason why
we can't have what

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:51.400 align:middle line:84%
it is we choose to experience
in life, but rather to say,

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.680 align:middle line:84%
with all the faith
we can muster,

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.000 align:middle line:84%
not only can I have that,
I have that right now.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.590 align:middle line:84%
To really believe
the highest promise

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.720 align:middle line:84%
of God, which is, even before
you ask, I will have answered.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.000 align:middle line:84%
So people of
enormous faith never

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
say I want, but rather
they say, all the good,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.660 align:middle line:84%
all the compassion, all
the help, all the money,

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.420 align:middle line:84%
all the love, all
the health that I

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.940 align:middle line:90%
choose is coming to me now.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:22.920 align:middle line:84%
One of the greatest prayers
I ever heard goes like this.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:84%
"Help me to understand, dear
God, that this problem has

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.290 align:middle line:90%
already been solved for me."

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:33.700 align:middle line:84%
That this problem has
already been solved for me.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.730 align:middle line:84%
And one of the more startling
examples of that in my life

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
was when I needed a great
deal of money at one point.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.933 align:middle line:84%
And I had some people
who were upset with me

00:13:40.933 --> 00:13:42.850 align:middle line:84%
and wanted that money
by a certain date.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And I owed it to
them, and I really

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.610 align:middle line:84%
needed to get it for them,
and I didn't have it.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.950 align:middle line:84%
And I did everything I could
think of, Corrine, for it,

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:49.900 align:middle line:84%
days and days and days,
for several weeks, trying

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.067 align:middle line:90%
to pull together that money.

00:13:51.067 --> 00:13:52.200 align:middle line:90%
It was a large sum.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.950 align:middle line:84%
I called my father, I
called some friends,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.260 align:middle line:84%
I called in all the
chips I had out there,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.640 align:middle line:90%
and I couldn't get it together.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Not all of it.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.060 align:middle line:84%
In fact, only about
a third of it.

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.602 align:middle line:84%
And now had come the day that
I needed to deliver this money.

00:14:02.602 --> 00:14:04.810 align:middle line:84%
And I said to God, all right,
well, whatever you say.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:06.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm leaving it up to you now.

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.268 align:middle line:84%
I did what I should have
done at the beginning.

00:14:08.268 --> 00:14:09.370 align:middle line:90%
I let go and let God.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.020 align:middle line:84%
And I said, OK, God,
whatever you want,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:13.660 align:middle line:84%
because I can't
solve this by myself.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.112 align:middle line:84%
And the next day, I went
to the post office box,

00:14:16.112 --> 00:14:18.070 align:middle line:84%
just doing my normal
routine, everyday things--

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:18.960 align:middle line:90%
it was a Monday--

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.460 align:middle line:84%
and I found an envelope in there
that had been sitting there

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.260 align:middle line:90%
since the Friday before.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Three days of worrying, and
there was an envelope sitting

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.420 align:middle line:84%
there since Friday with a
check from some guy in Florida

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.690 align:middle line:84%
who owed me some money for
many years, and he said,

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:84%
you know it's been bothering
me, and I'm way behind on this,

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:34.330 align:middle line:84%
but I hope you'll
accept this, I hope

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.280 align:middle line:84%
you don't mind that
it's several years late.

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.300 align:middle line:90%
Mind?

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.470 align:middle line:84%
It was the miracle
of the year for me.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But what I learned from that
was, even before I asked,

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.980 align:middle line:90%
God had already answered.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.230 align:middle line:84%
I could see God up there
saying, Neale, just

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.270 align:middle line:90%
go to the post office box.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.310 align:middle line:90%
It's already there.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's a very striking
example of something that

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.270 align:middle line:90%
happens in many people's lives.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:59.140 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in a more subtle way,
but it happens nonetheless.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:02.050 align:middle line:84%
Often, people discover, if
they can accept the good that's

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:04.750 align:middle line:84%
coming to them, that in fact,
it's not only coming to them,

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.250 align:middle line:90%
it's been there all along.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.080 align:middle line:84%
They simply haven't
been able to see it

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.450 align:middle line:90%
for all of their disbelief.

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:13.060 align:middle line:84%
>> But does that manifest in
regular, practical matters,

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.410 align:middle line:84%
such as suppose I've
always wanted a red Jaguar.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.767 align:middle line:90%
I mean, can I have that?

00:15:18.767 --> 00:15:21.100 align:middle line:84%
>> You can, if that's your
highest thought about what it

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.890 align:middle line:84%
is you would choose to
experience in your life.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you can experience
a red Jaguar.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>> But you cannot doubt that
you are going to get it.

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's the big thing.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:30.735 align:middle line:90%
>> These are not new ideas.

00:15:30.735 --> 00:15:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Norman Vincent Peale
wrote 45 years ago,

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.320 align:middle line:84%
if you want a red Jaguar,
just think about a red Jaguar,

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.092 align:middle line:84%
and sooner or later, depending
on the amount of faith

00:15:38.092 --> 00:15:39.550 align:middle line:84%
and energy you put
behind that, you

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:41.290 align:middle line:84%
will, in fact, have
that red Jaguar.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.410 align:middle line:84%
The power of positive
thinking is not a new thought.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It's been around, that
whole idea, for a long time.

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:49.750 align:middle line:84%
But the real central question
is, why would a person

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:52.120 align:middle line:84%
choose a red Jaguar out
of all the things in life

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.200 align:middle line:90%
one would choose to have?

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.380 align:middle line:90%
How about this one?

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.450 align:middle line:84%
How about I choose to learn,
I choose to experience,

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.270 align:middle line:84%
I choose to know myself as
the highest level of love

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.855 align:middle line:90%
I could ever imagine.

00:16:02.855 --> 00:16:05.230 align:middle line:84%
I choose to touch people's
lives in a way that heals them

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:08.590 align:middle line:84%
forever, that alters their
very experience of themselves

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.570 align:middle line:84%
and that gives them
back to themselves.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.080 align:middle line:84%
I choose peace in my
life and for this planet.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.960 align:middle line:84%
I'll take that over
a red Jaguar anytime.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.560 align:middle line:84%
And there are people
now on the planet

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:20.240 align:middle line:84%
who are making those
kinds of choices.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, the reason we want the
red Jaguar is because we think

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:25.118 align:middle line:90%
it is going to give us peace.

00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:25.918 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course.

00:16:25.918 --> 00:16:26.760 align:middle line:90%
And happiness.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.850 align:middle line:84%
>> So that you're
skipping over the Jaguar,

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:31.230 align:middle line:90%
going right to the peace.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:34.350 align:middle line:84%
But I think the most
important point here

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:39.510 align:middle line:84%
is, now, when you start taking
this whole reality of being

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.800 align:middle line:84%
able to create what
you really desire,

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.430 align:middle line:84%
and go into your chapter
here where you talk about

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.180 align:middle line:84%
and ask God what
happens when we die.

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:53.430 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, that's the most
profound question, of course,

00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:56.010 align:middle line:84%
in the universe, and it was
the most important question

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:57.660 align:middle line:90%
in the whole trilogy for me.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:01.140 align:middle line:84%
And God said, even as it is
in life, so is it in death,

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:90%
or what you call death.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:04.392 align:middle line:84%
The first thing we have
to understand, of course,

00:17:04.392 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:84%
is that death as we
understand it does not exist.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:08.498 align:middle line:84%
But if we can get past
those terms for a minute

00:17:08.498 --> 00:17:11.880 align:middle line:84%
and just use them loosely,
after the thing we call death,

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.550 align:middle line:84%
God says, you will
experience yourself exactly

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:15.750 align:middle line:90%
as you do in life.

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.589 align:middle line:84%
That is, as a being capable
of experiencing whatever

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:21.198 align:middle line:90%
it is that you call forth.

00:17:21.198 --> 00:17:22.740 align:middle line:84%
Only the speed with
which you produce

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.650 align:middle line:84%
results will be instantaneous,
whereas in this lifetime,

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:28.530 align:middle line:84%
because of the slow process
of the illusion that we have

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.740 align:middle line:84%
created called time,
it may be a little bit

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.328 align:middle line:84%
between our thought about it and
the experience of it, whereas--

00:17:35.328 --> 00:17:36.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to use
another loose term--

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:84%
on the other side of life,
in that place that we call

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.020 align:middle line:84%
the after-death experience,
immediately when

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:45.240 align:middle line:84%
you think of a thing,
that which you choose

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.980 align:middle line:84%
to experience
through that thought

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle line:90%
is brought into your reality.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.340 align:middle line:84%
So the results
are instantaneous,

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.405 align:middle line:90%
and they're immediate.

00:17:51.405 --> 00:17:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we really
have an opportunity

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.940 align:middle line:84%
to experience and to
express who we really are.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.495 align:middle line:84%
An instant creator of whatever
reality we would select.

00:17:59.495 --> 00:18:00.870 align:middle line:84%
That's what heaven
is, of course,

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.680 align:middle line:84%
being able to have whatever
you want right then and there.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.310 align:middle line:90%
>> I love the paragraph--

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.520 align:middle line:84%
>> I just caught myself
in a verbal contradiction,

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.770 align:middle line:84%
but it's being able to have
whatever you choose right then

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:11.570 align:middle line:90%
and there.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.430 align:middle line:84%
For in the afterlife, as in
this life, if we want it,

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.393 align:middle line:90%
we're saying we don't have it.

00:18:16.393 --> 00:18:18.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So the big difference that
you're making in the book is

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:22.000 align:middle line:84%
that, in this so-called
physical world--

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:84%
>> --sometimes, there
is a time lapse.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:26.873 align:middle line:84%
>> And as soon as you
reach the other side,

00:18:26.873 --> 00:18:27.790 align:middle line:90%
there's no time lapse.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:32.010 align:middle line:84%
And I love the way God
describes the confusion.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:32.880 align:middle line:90%
Tell us about that.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.247 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, people, when they've
moved into the afterlife,

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:37.830 align:middle line:84%
often they don't even know that
they're the thing that we call

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.080 align:middle line:84%
dead, because, of
course, they're not dead.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.760 align:middle line:90%
They're very much alive.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And they expected to be
dead, and they're not dead,

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.370 align:middle line:84%
so they move into an
experience that looks and feels

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:50.197 align:middle line:84%
and is experienced in
a whole different way

00:18:50.197 --> 00:18:52.530 align:middle line:84%
than they might have imagined
that they would experience

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.270 align:middle line:84%
death if they had any
thought about it at all.

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.450 align:middle line:84%
So here they are,
simply feeling exactly

00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:59.940 align:middle line:84%
as they felt a moment ago,
except they may notice,

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.340 align:middle line:84%
oh my goodness, my body is
down there, and here I am.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.760 align:middle line:84%
I'm feeling exactly
the same way,

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.580 align:middle line:84%
but there I am, and I'm not
over there, I'm over here,

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.997 align:middle line:84%
and what is all
this about anyway.

00:19:06.997 --> 00:19:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So there's a great
deal of confusion.

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.300 align:middle line:84%
But then, after
that confusion is--

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.150 align:middle line:84%
and we're normally
sent guides and, I

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:18.300 align:middle line:84%
want to say, angels or
helpers or other souls,

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.900 align:middle line:84%
really, who will fly to
us at that moment, maybe

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.260 align:middle line:84%
those who have passed before
that we are very fond of

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.370 align:middle line:90%
or we've loved very much.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.470 align:middle line:84%
Perhaps our parents or
whoever will show up

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.550 align:middle line:84%
at that time to help
us and say, Neale,

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.850 align:middle line:84%
this is what's happening now,
and here's where you are.

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:37.675 align:middle line:84%
And then we begin to
experience the joy.

00:19:37.675 --> 00:19:40.050 align:middle line:84%
We begin to notice that whatever
we're thinking, wherever

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
we want to go with the
speed of our thought

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.730 align:middle line:90%
is created in our reality.

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.547 align:middle line:84%
But even as glorious as
that experience may feel,

00:19:48.547 --> 00:19:50.130 align:middle line:84%
after a while, it's
simply not enough.

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.150 align:middle line:84%
It could be actually boring,
if you could think about it.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.500 align:middle line:84%
If you could have whatever
you wanted instantaneously,

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.958 align:middle line:84%
a very few moments
of that, and you

00:19:55.958 --> 00:19:57.990 align:middle line:84%
might start thinking
about larger challenges.

00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Try me.

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.422 align:middle line:90%
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:00.422 --> 00:20:01.420 align:middle line:90%


00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You'd be you'd be surprised
how one would say, you know,

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:07.170 align:middle line:84%
this is all a lot of fun, but
I think I want to go back there

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and try that again and do it
another way and experience

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.290 align:middle line:84%
myself at the next
highest level.

00:20:13.290 --> 00:20:15.090 align:middle line:84%
Even in this lifetime,
when we have it

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:17.820 align:middle line:84%
all solved, and there are
no more problems and nothing

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:20.640 align:middle line:84%
more to conquer,
the natural tendency

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.930 align:middle line:84%
of truly wonderful and
enlightened human beings

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:26.670 align:middle line:90%
is to seek a newer challenge.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.890 align:middle line:84%
We're never tired of
climbing the mountain.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:84%
In truth, we say we want it all
to end and all to be smooth,

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.440 align:middle line:84%
but the truth is, for
every truly great explorer

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.140 align:middle line:84%
and every wonderful mind on the
planet, when the game is over,

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.090 align:middle line:84%
they start a new
one immediately.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
No one wants to get to
the top of the mountain.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:41.470 align:middle line:90%
At least--

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:42.060 align:middle line:90%
>> That's no fun.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> --at least, they
don't want to stay there.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
Once you're on the
top of the mountain,

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.075 align:middle line:84%
you start looking
around, where's

00:20:46.075 --> 00:20:47.540 align:middle line:90%
the next mountain to climb?

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:49.800 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that I
thought was so interesting

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.170 align:middle line:84%
about that chapter on death
is that so many people go

00:20:52.170 --> 00:20:56.220 align:middle line:84%
to psychics to contact
the souls of the departed.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.290 align:middle line:90%
And they don't have to.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.110 align:middle line:84%
You can contact the souls of
the departed in an instant.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:04.560 align:middle line:84%
You cannot have a thought about
a dearly departed loved one

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.740 align:middle line:84%
without the essence of that
person coming flying right

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:10.680 align:middle line:84%
to you and being right there
alongside of you as part

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.910 align:middle line:90%
of your experience.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
It's like sending out a
telegram, be here now.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And so you don't need
a medium or a psychic

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.990 align:middle line:84%
to contact anyone
from the other side.

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:24.340 align:middle line:10%
Your very thought about them--
you know the best medium?

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:28.120 align:middle line:10%
Love is the best medium
of communication.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.390 align:middle line:84%
All you have to do is
think of another person,

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:34.540 align:middle line:84%
one who has gone before, from a
place of deep and abiding love.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:37.210 align:middle line:84%
And that love sent out is
received by the essence,

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:38.530 align:middle line:90%
the soul of that person.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.150 align:middle line:90%
And they're right there.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:42.010 align:middle line:90%
They can hear your every word.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.610 align:middle line:84%
If you listen really
carefully, you'll

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:47.410 align:middle line:84%
be able to hear
their words, as well.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.430 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:53.380 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, there are a lot of
people out there who will get

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:56.325 align:middle line:84%
a great deal of consolation
from that statement.

00:21:56.325 --> 00:21:58.575 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's true, and
truth is a great consolation

00:21:58.575 --> 00:21:59.140 align:middle line:90%
in the face--

00:21:59.140 --> 00:21:59.530 align:middle line:90%
>> And one of the things--

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:00.405 align:middle line:90%
>> --of all the lies.

00:22:00.405 --> 00:22:03.250 align:middle line:84%
>> --you say in the book
is that, many times,

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.380 align:middle line:84%
the souls of the
departed contact us,

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:06.980 align:middle line:90%
but we don't believe it.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:07.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.160 align:middle line:90%
>> We don't believe it.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.500 align:middle line:84%
I wish we could go on with
this for another two hours,

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.830 align:middle line:84%
but they're giving me a
signal that we're through.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.740 align:middle line:84%
This has been a fascinating,
fascinating conversation.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking to
Neale Donald Walsch

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:23.170 align:middle line:84%
here, who is the
author of all three

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:28.600 align:middle line:84%
of the books called
"Conversations with God."

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.770 align:middle line:84%
Personally, it's my favorite
of three, book three.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.210 align:middle line:90%
I loved it.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:37.690 align:middle line:84%
I think that you will benefit
a great deal when you read it.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.760 align:middle line:84%
And as I always tell
you around here,

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.790 align:middle line:84%
we bring you miracles
on this show.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:43.990 align:middle line:90%
Keep coming back.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:47.340 align:middle line:10%
