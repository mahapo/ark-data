00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle line:10%
>> I was not looking, I was
not seeking for a visionary

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:10%
experience.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:10%
It began for me in a
very spontaneous way.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.380 align:middle line:10%
But over the next four years
of living on my farm in Hawaii,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.590 align:middle line:10%
these visionary
experiences continued,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:10%
and I found my conscious
awareness continually drawn

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.140 align:middle line:10%
into the connection
with this man's mind.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.470 align:middle line:10%
>> We have a spellbinding
tale to tell you today.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.170 align:middle line:10%
A very exciting guest.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.460 align:middle line:84%
His name is Dr. Hank Wesselman,
and he has written two books.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
The first one you
may have heard of.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.800 align:middle line:84%
It came out a little while
ago, called "Spiritwalker."

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.710 align:middle line:84%
And the second one
is "Medicinemaker."

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.400 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hank Wesselman is a
anthropologist and a mystic.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.450 align:middle line:90%
And we welcome you--

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.180 align:middle line:90%
>> --on the Wisdom Channel.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:84%
Hank, for those of us who
are a little hazy on this,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.470 align:middle line:90%
what is an anthropologist?

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.400 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.420 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, anthropology is
divided into four major fields,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.710 align:middle line:10%
largely for research purposes.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.680 align:middle line:10%
The first is physical
anthropology.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.810 align:middle line:84%
And physical
anthropology is primarily

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.690 align:middle line:84%
concerned with
investigating human beings

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.390 align:middle line:84%
as a biological
phenomenon, reconstructing

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.480 align:middle line:84%
the evolutionary history of
our species on the one hand,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.370 align:middle line:84%
and accounting for the
human variation that

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.100 align:middle line:84%
exists from place to
place around the Earth.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.680 align:middle line:84%
The second major
field is archaeology.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And archaeology is concerned
with material culture,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.750 align:middle line:90%
with the evolution of culture.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.920 align:middle line:84%
It adds a time dimension
to the culture.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.720 align:middle line:84%
Archaeologists are
concerned with anything

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.169 align:middle line:90%
that our ancestors produced.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.790 align:middle line:84%
And in the same way that
the physical anthropologist

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.890 align:middle line:84%
is concerned with
reconstructing stages

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.490 align:middle line:84%
of human biological
evolution, the archaeologist

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.890 align:middle line:84%
is concerned with
reconstructing stages

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.020 align:middle line:90%
of human cultural evolution.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.090 align:middle line:84%
The third major
field is linguistics,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.960 align:middle line:84%
because human culture
rests on language.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.230 align:middle line:84%
It's the medium through which
I'm talking with you right now.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.050 align:middle line:84%
And so anthropologists are
very concerned with language,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.440 align:middle line:84%
both in the descriptive
way sociolinguistics

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.900 align:middle line:84%
is concerned with language
and social relationships

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.050 align:middle line:84%
and historical linguistics,
the evolution of the languages

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.550 align:middle line:90%
that we speak today.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.100 align:middle line:84%
And then finally,
cultural anthropology

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.820 align:middle line:84%
is the study of contemporary
modern human cultures

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.760 align:middle line:84%
on the one hand and the
study of the underlying

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.060 align:middle line:84%
patterns within human
cultures on the other.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.310 align:middle line:84%
Those are known as
ethnography on the one hand

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.290 align:middle line:90%
and ethnology on the other.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.760 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, which one are you?

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm actually a biological
anthropologist because I

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
started out life as a biologist
at the University of Colorado

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.140 align:middle line:84%
then did my doctoral work in
anthropology at UC Berkeley.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.970 align:middle line:84%
It was when I was
there that I began

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.070 align:middle line:84%
to work as part of
an international team

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.800 align:middle line:84%
of scientists,
investigating the earlier

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.750 align:middle line:84%
stages of human evolution out
in the Rift Valley in Africa.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
This is work I began
back in the 1970s,

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle line:90%
and I still do this work today.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.770 align:middle line:84%
>> And you're a professor
also, with several--

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'm an instructor
at several colleges.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.690 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm interested in the type of
work you're doing in Ethiopia.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.070 align:middle line:84%
I understand that, in
the last couple of years,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.720 align:middle line:84%
that you were part
of a team that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.030 align:middle line:84%
discovered a fossil that may
be the missing link between ape

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.100 align:middle line:90%
and man.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.790 align:middle line:84%
>> But we haven't said too
much about this discovery yet.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.170 align:middle line:90%
What can I tell you?

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.010 align:middle line:84%
Well, in 1994, I got the call
from one of my colleagues

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.890 align:middle line:84%
to come out to Ethiopia to
go out on expedition to do

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.840 align:middle line:90%
the specialty work that I do.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.760 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
I do as I reconstruct

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.580 align:middle line:84%
the paleo environments of
early science at the time they

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.400 align:middle line:90%
were laid down.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.320 align:middle line:84%
While I was in the field, over
a roughly 18, 19-day period,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.190 align:middle line:84%
we uncovered about
half of a skeleton

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.530 align:middle line:84%
of an early kind of
protohuman, which

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.030 align:middle line:84%
is so primitive that we're
speculating that it could,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.750 align:middle line:84%
in fact, be the missing
link between humans and apes

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.930 align:middle line:84%
that Charles Darwin predicted
we would eventually find.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.810 align:middle line:84%
>> So it is more
advanced than an ape?

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, it's more human than
an ape, but it's still very,

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.160 align:middle line:90%
very primitive.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a million and
a half years older

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.470 align:middle line:84%
than the famous Lucy find,
for those of your listeners

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:90%
who know about Lucy.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.700 align:middle line:84%
Lucy was discovered
by Don Johanson

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.460 align:middle line:84%
and his graduate
student Tom Gray

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.410 align:middle line:84%
about 25 years ago out in
Hadar, about 60 kilometers,

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.990 align:middle line:84%
70 kilometers northwest of
where we're working today.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.020 align:middle line:84%
This was the most
exciting find of its kind

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.440 align:middle line:84%
at the time it was made because
Lucy, as many people know,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.770 align:middle line:84%
represents about 40%
of a skeleton of a very

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:84%
early kind of human called
Australopithecus afarensis.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.440 align:middle line:84%
>> But this one you're
working on is even older.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.750 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a million and a
half years older than Lucy.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.580 align:middle line:84%
It's roughly 4 and
1/2 million years old.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.540 align:middle line:90%
So it's very exciting.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.790 align:middle line:84%
>> I wanted to kind of set the
stage here for the fact that

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.220 align:middle line:84%
you really are
kind of an egghead.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.150 align:middle line:90%
You're a scientist.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm a mainstream
scientist, it's true.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.470 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you have written
these absolutely startling

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.770 align:middle line:90%
books.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.560 align:middle line:90%
What happened?

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.980 align:middle line:84%
>> I was in my 40s, and I
began to have classic visionary

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.420 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, these experiences actually
began earlier in my life,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.090 align:middle line:84%
but at that time I had
no idea what they were.

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.220 align:middle line:84%
As an anthropologist,
though, I knew

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.080 align:middle line:84%
that in traditional
societies there

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.750 align:middle line:84%
are individuals
called shamans who

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:84%
are masters of trance,
who are masters

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.290 align:middle line:90%
of the visionary experience.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.170 align:middle line:84%
And when I began to
have these experiences

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.220 align:middle line:84%
I suspected that I was
literally journeying,

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.920 align:middle line:84%
like the traditional
tribal shaman journeys

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.130 align:middle line:84%
when they do the work that they
do on behalf of other people,

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.170 align:middle line:90%
usually.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.850 align:middle line:84%
I think it was because
of this knowledge

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.240 align:middle line:84%
that I had as an anthropologist
that I didn't turn myself over

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.530 align:middle line:84%
to the medical profession,
to the psychiatric types.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
You know, what
can I say, I began

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.830 align:middle line:84%
to have these very strange,
dreamlike experiences which

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.720 align:middle line:90%
were super real.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:84%
At the same time,
my body was invaded

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.140 align:middle line:84%
with these strange
sensations of power or force

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.020 align:middle line:84%
that would render my physical
aspect completely rigid

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.760 align:middle line:90%
like a stick of wood.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, I wondered if this
was sleep paralysis,

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and many of your
listeners probably

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.290 align:middle line:84%
know about sleep paralysis--
this state where we come out

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.110 align:middle line:84%
of sleep, sometimes 4:00 or
5:00 o'clock in the morning,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.520 align:middle line:90%
and we can't move.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Our body is
completely paralyzed,

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and we're very much
aware, very much awake.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:84%
Often, we're having
what are sometimes

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:84%
called hypnagogic
hallucinations,

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.000 align:middle line:84%
dreamlike experiences,
which are very real.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:84%
In my case, I was
living in Hawaii

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.230 align:middle line:84%
on my farm, which I
purchased many years ago when

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:84%
you could still buy
agricultural real estate

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.850 align:middle line:90%
for a reasonable price.

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:25.180 align:middle line:84%
And I had one of these
classic visionary experiences

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.670 align:middle line:84%
in which I found myself merged
with the mind of another man.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Can you say that again?

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.650 align:middle line:90%
>> All right.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.020 align:middle line:84%
To go through the
stages, the body

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.980 align:middle line:84%
became paralyzed with these
incredible sensations of power.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.040 align:middle line:84%
I saw these curious
visual hallucinations--

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.750 align:middle line:84%
spots, lines, zigzags,
a curious crescent

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.740 align:middle line:84%
which began to open, the
suggestion of a grid,

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.250 align:middle line:84%
some sort of vast grid, kind
of like flying into Chicago

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.780 align:middle line:90%
at night.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.890 align:middle line:90%
And then suddenly it was gone.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
And I found myself looking
out at a world which

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.460 align:middle line:90%
was beyond my imagining.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.550 align:middle line:84%
I was looking out at
this very strange scene

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.190 align:middle line:84%
as though I were looking
out the window of a house.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.900 align:middle line:84%
And then as I looked
around I realized

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I was actually inside
a house, looking out

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.870 align:middle line:84%
a window at this incredible
tropical rainforest

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:21.070 align:middle line:84%
across this large expanse
of cleared fields.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:24.118 align:middle line:84%
I was literally in
somebody else's body.

00:08:24.118 --> 00:08:25.660 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is like
spirit possession,

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.000 align:middle line:90%
only you were the possessor.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You could say that.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.240 align:middle line:90%
It could be said that way.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:36.010 align:middle line:84%
I was merged in some way
with the conscious awareness

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.289 align:middle line:90%
of another man.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:39.130 align:middle line:90%
>> What did you see?

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I was looking out at
his world through his eyes.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And at the same
time, I became aware

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.550 align:middle line:84%
of his cognitive pattern,
his thoughts, his emotions,

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.540 align:middle line:84%
his feelings, his
judgments, impressions,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.300 align:middle line:84%
memories of his past,
coming up in a kind

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:84%
of multilayered
complex, very much

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.500 align:middle line:84%
the way it is when one
of us you know sort of

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.660 align:middle line:84%
goes through, you know, a
moment-to-moment daily basis

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.640 align:middle line:84%
type experience where
you're thinking,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.770 align:middle line:84%
remembering, judging, and
receiving impressions.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.955 align:middle line:84%
It was very much like this,
except he was him and I was me.

00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:84%
>> This was the
interesting part.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.932 align:middle line:90%
This is not a contemporary.

00:09:19.932 --> 00:09:22.900 align:middle line:84%
This is someone that you're
looking through the eyes

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.600 align:middle line:90%
of someone far in the future.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.060 align:middle line:84%
>> That's what makes
it really sticky.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.610 align:middle line:84%
I learned very quickly
that this man doesn't

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.950 align:middle line:90%
live in our slice of time.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:34.450 align:middle line:90%
He lives in the future.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.600 align:middle line:84%
And in looking
into his memories I

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.270 align:middle line:84%
discovered, in this
interesting first experience,

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.850 align:middle line:84%
that within a very
short period of time

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.180 align:middle line:84%
if I wanted to know something,
it would appear in his mind

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.400 align:middle line:90%
and in my mind simultaneously.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.380 align:middle line:84%
If I wanted him to
look at something,

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:51.940 align:middle line:84%
there would be a
millisecond of delay

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.107 align:middle line:84%
and he would sort of walk
over and look at something

00:09:54.107 --> 00:09:56.440 align:middle line:90%
and study it.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.960 align:middle line:84%
In some way, which
I didn't understand,

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.660 align:middle line:84%
his subconscious mind
did not distinguish

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:05.372 align:middle line:84%
between directives from his
conscious mind or from mine.

00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:07.330 align:middle line:84%
>> So he didn't know you
were there right away?

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:08.480 align:middle line:90%
>> He didn't.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Now, to say I was surprised
would be an understatement

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.210 align:middle line:90%
of vast proportions.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.900 align:middle line:90%
I was stunned.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.360 align:middle line:90%
I didn't know what to do.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.990 align:middle line:84%
Fortunately, I'd had some
experience with zen meditation,

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
with Buddhism, and I was
able to become completely

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:28.210 align:middle line:84%
still and watch, like
a witness almost.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:32.080 align:middle line:84%
And in this particular
instance, the very first time

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.540 align:middle line:84%
I connected with
him, I found myself

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.590 align:middle line:84%
merged with this individual for
roughly 18 hours of his time.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.560 align:middle line:10%
And during this time, I was able
to receive a lot of information

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.270 align:middle line:10%
about him, who he is, about
his world, about his culture,

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.630 align:middle line:10%
about the world that he lives
in, through his memories.

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.490 align:middle line:84%
And I learned, for
example, that he

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:84%
is the descendant
of voyagers who

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.920 align:middle line:84%
came to the Western
coast of North America.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Hold that thought.

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.250 align:middle line:84%
I hate to do this to
you just at this point.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.250 align:middle line:90%
We have to take a break.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:05.050 align:middle line:90%
But don't go away.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:10.040 align:middle line:84%
You don't want to miss 1 minute
of this fabulous, spellbinding

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.895 align:middle line:90%
story.

00:11:10.895 --> 00:11:14.855 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:14.855 --> 00:11:24.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.330 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to
Dr. Hank Wesselman,

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:32.020 align:middle line:10%
who is the author of two
very, very interesting books.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.830 align:middle line:84%
The first one is "Spiritwalker"
and his latest book,

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:36.130 align:middle line:90%
"Medicinemaker."

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:36.930 align:middle line:90%
Welcome back, Hank.

00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.190 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.440 align:middle line:90%
>> You left us hanging here.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.970 align:middle line:90%
>> I left you hanging.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:46.140 align:middle line:10%
In this very first
connection with this man,

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.000 align:middle line:10%
I was very curious
as to who he was,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.530 align:middle line:10%
and I learned a
great deal about him

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:52.860 align:middle line:10%
and the history of his
people through his memories.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.830 align:middle line:10%
Because this man is
interested in history,

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:59.310 align:middle line:10%
I learned that he
lives in a time which

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:07.620 align:middle line:10%
is, roughly speaking, 240
some odd generations after--

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.730 align:middle line:10%
After what?

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.510 align:middle line:84%
There's an instance in the
past, an incident that happened,

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.210 align:middle line:90%
which he thinks of as the fall.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And what this was,
apparently, was the collapse

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.680 align:middle line:90%
of Western civilization.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.420 align:middle line:90%
He lives in a time, roughly--

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:26.250 align:middle line:84%
If you convert 247 generations
into 20 years per generation,

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.830 align:middle line:84%
it comes out to
roughly 5,000 years.

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.650 align:middle line:84%
This man, if my
calculations are correct,

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.960 align:middle line:84%
lives roughly 5,000
years from now.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:84%
>> So you're looking
out of this man's eyes.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.530 align:middle line:84%
Where is he, and
what do you see?

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, he's living on the
Western coast of North America.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.640 align:middle line:90%
He knows this.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.760 align:middle line:84%
He's living in a part of
the world which today we

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.350 align:middle line:90%
call California.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:55.670 align:middle line:84%
But the redwoods and the oaks
and the grasslands are gone.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.340 align:middle line:84%
The chaparral-covered
hills are gone.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:01.880 align:middle line:84%
And in their place is this
well-developed tropical forest

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.390 align:middle line:84%
of really truly
immense proportions.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.730 align:middle line:84%
I've spent, as an
anthropologist, a lot of time

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.740 align:middle line:84%
in tropical regions
of the world,

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:12.200 align:middle line:84%
and I've seen
tropical rainforest.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:16.130 align:middle line:84%
And this looks to me
like tropical forest.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.710 align:middle line:84%
Now, if this is in
fact California,

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and I believe that
it is, it reveals

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:84%
that the worst case scenario
for the greenhouse warming

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.200 align:middle line:90%
has apparently happened.

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.040 align:middle line:84%
And there's been a biome shift
in which the tropical regions

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.710 align:middle line:84%
of the world have expanded
out of the tropics

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:84%
and into the temperate regions,
with the temperate regions

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:39.980 align:middle line:84%
being displaced
further to the north.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.250 align:middle line:84%
It seems that there has been
a worldwide climatic shift

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:48.680 align:middle line:84%
and that he is living
in the greenhouse world.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.060 align:middle line:84%
Now, up until this moment, I
knew about greenhouse warming,

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.580 align:middle line:84%
but I wasn't particularly
interested in it.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.650 align:middle line:84%
At this point, I became
very interested in it,

00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.680 align:middle line:84%
and I began to read the
scientific literature

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.280 align:middle line:84%
about this very important
issue, in my opinion.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Of course, this was 10
years ago, 15 years ago when

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:90%
this actually began for me.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
Today, of course, we're
seeing the results

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.510 align:middle line:84%
of what has been happening
over the last 10 or 15 years.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And it appears that this
greenhouse phenomenon

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.680 align:middle line:90%
is very much in process.

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.460 align:middle line:84%
And, in my opinion, it's
very disturbing information,

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:90%
very critical.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.040 align:middle line:84%
>> What has happened
to California?

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.320 align:middle line:84%
>> California has been
inundated by a rising sea,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.020 align:middle line:84%
which has filled the
Central Valley with water.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So that the Central
Valley of California,

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:39.800 align:middle line:84%
the San Joaquin Valley
today, is what Ninoa--

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.850 align:middle line:90%
this man's name is Ninoa.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:45.050 align:middle line:84%
It's what Ninoa thinks of is
the Inland Sea, surrounded

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.590 align:middle line:84%
by a long archipelago
of islands to the west

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.700 align:middle line:84%
and a mountainous unexplored
region to the east.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.370 align:middle line:84%
In this very first instance
of connecting with him,

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.640 align:middle line:84%
he was in the process of
leaving his community.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.180 align:middle line:84%
This is a community not unlike
the feudalistic society that

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:90%
existed in Hawaii in the past.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.470 align:middle line:84%
He is the descendant
of Hawaiian voyagers

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:84%
who arrived on the coast roughly
130 years before his time.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:84%
And he's leaving on a
voyage of exploration

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.530 align:middle line:84%
into the lost,
well, you could say,

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.700 align:middle line:84%
the interior of the lost
continent of America.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:22.910 align:middle line:90%
This is how he thinks about it.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:25.320 align:middle line:84%
When this first
episode came to an end,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.130 align:middle line:84%
I found myself my conscious
awareness returning

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.830 align:middle line:84%
to my own physical aspect,
which was lying in bed

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.340 align:middle line:90%
next to my wife in Hawaii.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.540 align:middle line:84%
And I literally lay
there in bed in shock

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:40.790 align:middle line:84%
for the best part of
an hour, wondering

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.600 align:middle line:90%
what had just happened to me.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.030 align:middle line:84%
My first thought was that
I might be going crazy,

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:51.070 align:middle line:84%
because in my world of
straight science, you know--

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.820 align:middle line:84%
You know, I'm not one
of those people that

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.000 align:middle line:84%
studied for decades at the
knees of the wisdom masters,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.510 align:middle line:84%
practicing meditation and
yoga, hoping for visions

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:01.010 align:middle line:90%
and transcendent experiences.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.020 align:middle line:84%
I was not looking,
I was not seeking,

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.700 align:middle line:90%
for visionary experience.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.790 align:middle line:84%
It began for me in a
very spontaneous way.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But over the next four years
of living on my farm in Hawaii

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:14.780 align:middle line:84%
these visionary
experiences continued.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.600 align:middle line:84%
And I found my conscious
awareness continually drawn

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:84%
into the connection
with this man's mind.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.250 align:middle line:84%
Then there came an interesting
moment where he had a dream.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:29.030 align:middle line:84%
And in his dream, he found
his mind drawn backwards,

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:84%
and he found
himself in the mind,

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.150 align:middle line:84%
in the body, of a man
who was living in Hawaii.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.210 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.740 align:middle line:90%
It was me.

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.765 align:middle line:84%
And after this experience,
his very first hit--

00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting,
just talking about it

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.320 align:middle line:84%
I have chicken skin all over me,
like the Hawaiians would say.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.180 align:middle line:84%
His very first hit
was that he had

00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:52.130 align:middle line:84%
connected with the spirit
of one of his ancestors.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:56.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I say that to
you, at that moment,

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.130 align:middle line:84%
this whole dynamic
shifted for me.

00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:00.800 align:middle line:84%
I had never considered the
fact that this man might

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.470 align:middle line:84%
be one of my descendants,
or even that he might

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.589 align:middle line:90%
be one of my descendant selves.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:06.530 align:middle line:90%
Uh huh.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:10.010 align:middle line:84%
It threw the whole thing into an
entirely new framework for me,

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:13.220 align:middle line:84%
to regard this man as
a possible descendant.

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.470 align:middle line:84%
And it's quite interesting
because a number of folks

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.480 align:middle line:84%
have pointed out to
me that I didn't start

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:19.460 align:middle line:84%
having these
visionary experiences

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:24.329 align:middle line:84%
until my wife Jill was
pregnant with our first child.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:25.819 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost as
though there had

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:29.150 align:middle line:84%
to be some sort of genetic
contribution to the future

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:33.260 align:middle line:84%
which I had committed myself
to, and then something locked

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.960 align:middle line:90%
into place and it began.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.050 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though it
became possible at that moment.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:40.850 align:middle line:90%
>> Why you?

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:42.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Why me?

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.100 align:middle line:90%
Why me, lord?

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
You know, I used to wonder
this at the beginning.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:46.910 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:50.030 align:middle line:90%


00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.460 align:middle line:84%
"Spiritwalker" is
the study, it's

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.510 align:middle line:84%
really the story, of
my initiation crisis--

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.470 align:middle line:90%
a classic initiation crisis.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.170 align:middle line:84%
And it was very much like
a crisis in the sense

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.960 align:middle line:90%
that I lost all my bearings.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.110 align:middle line:84%
I found myself wandering
aimlessly, kind of sleepwalking

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:10.700 align:middle line:84%
through my life, looking at
things with entirely new eyes,

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.220 align:middle line:90%
seeing with entirely new eyes.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.470 align:middle line:84%
"Spiritwalker" is my
initiation crisis.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:18.650 align:middle line:84%
"Medicinemaker," the second
book, documents my recovery

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.900 align:middle line:90%
when I came back to California.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Why me?

00:18:22.670 --> 00:18:25.310 align:middle line:84%
I had a chance to cross trails
with a traditional Hawaiian

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:27.980 align:middle line:90%
kahuna many years later.

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.680 align:middle line:84%
And I posed that
question to her.

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.313 align:middle line:84%
I downloaded some of
this story to her.

00:18:33.313 --> 00:18:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And it was very interesting
because she looked at me

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.730 align:middle line:84%
and she said, you
know, Dr. Hank,

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:42.080 align:middle line:84%
you may never fully understand
why you had these experiences.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.700 align:middle line:84%
She said, most
people who vision,

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.310 align:middle line:84%
most people who have the
deep mystic experience,

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
for most of them the deep
prayer is a silent one.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.388 align:middle line:90%
Those were her words.

00:18:52.388 --> 00:18:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And of course, what she was
saying was that most people

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.090 align:middle line:84%
cannot take this raw material
of this particular dimension

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.230 align:middle line:84%
and translate it into a form
which is meaningful for others.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:04.693 align:middle line:90%
In my case, she said, now, look.

00:19:04.693 --> 00:19:06.110 align:middle line:84%
She said, you may
never understand

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.600 align:middle line:84%
why you had these experiences,
but it's very tempting

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.190 align:middle line:84%
to say that you had
them for a reason.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.350 align:middle line:84%
Because look, you've
got a PhD from Berkeley,

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.600 align:middle line:84%
you've got credentials,
you're a mainstream scientist,

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:16.600 align:middle line:84%
you're a teacher, you're
a writer, you can talk,

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.960 align:middle line:90%
you can communicate.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.030 align:middle line:84%
She said, I think
you've been given

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.230 align:middle line:90%
this information for a reason.

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.620 align:middle line:84%
Then we had a very long
conversation, some of which

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.930 align:middle line:84%
is documented in
"Medicinemaker,"

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:31.190 align:middle line:84%
about the nature of people
who can see the future

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and how they very often
come into relationship

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.880 align:middle line:90%
with certain spirits.

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And in Hawaii, of
course, that spirit

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:39.380 align:middle line:84%
was Pele, the
volcano goddess, who

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.760 align:middle line:84%
often came into contact
with visionaries-- what

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:90%
are called "kaula" in Hawaiian.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:47.690 align:middle line:84%
She said, it's very
tempting to think

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.450 align:middle line:84%
that you have been given this
information for a reason.

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.770 align:middle line:84%
So she said, your job is
to go back to your computer

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.840 align:middle line:84%
and write this as
it really happened.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand you were going
to write this as fiction.

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:00.875 align:middle line:90%
>> I was.

00:20:00.875 --> 00:20:02.750 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's fantastic
when you think about it.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.030 align:middle line:90%
Time traveling.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.230 align:middle line:84%
You know, it's virtually
100 years ago that H.G.

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.180 align:middle line:90%
Wells wrote "The Time Machine"--

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.190 align:middle line:90%
almost 100 years ago to the day.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.940 align:middle line:84%
Now, I read that
when I was a boy,

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.700 align:middle line:84%
but I never in a
million years would

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:17.000 align:middle line:84%
have thought that such a
phenomenon like time traveling

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.900 align:middle line:90%
might actually be possible.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.170 align:middle line:84%
And one of the things I've
tried to do in these books

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.840 align:middle line:84%
is come from the position
of both the scientist

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:24.830 align:middle line:90%
and the mystic.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.563 align:middle line:84%
>> What do your
colleagues think of this?

00:20:26.563 --> 00:20:28.190 align:middle line:90%
>> My colleagues.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:31.670 align:middle line:84%
My colleagues are strangely
silent about all of this,

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.840 align:middle line:84%
possibly because I work
with them and they know me.

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm also sitting on a lot of
data, and they want my data.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.120 align:middle line:84%
It will be easiest for them
not to say anything at all,

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.420 align:middle line:90%
I think.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I myself did this
when I was a graduate student

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:47.840 align:middle line:90%
in anthropology.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.755 align:middle line:84%
And people would ask me
about Castaneda's work.

00:20:50.755 --> 00:20:52.130 align:middle line:84%
I was very much
aware of the fact

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.390 align:middle line:84%
that Castaneda
was controversial.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And I avoided reading
his books for years

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:57.890 align:middle line:90%
because it kind of put me off.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:59.390 align:middle line:10%
You know, people
would say, oh, what

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.310 align:middle line:10%
do you think about
Castaneda's work?

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:02.730 align:middle line:10%
And I took the easy way out.

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:06.867 align:middle line:10%
I said, you know, I haven't read
his books so I can't comment.

00:21:06.867 --> 00:21:08.450 align:middle line:84%
And I think that
most of my colleagues

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.910 align:middle line:84%
will do that with
my books, as well.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.170 align:middle line:90%
That's just a guess, though.

00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:90%
We'll see.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I'll tell you, both of
these books are so fascinating.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.960 align:middle line:90%
It's like an adventure tale.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, life is an adventure.

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.190 align:middle line:84%
>> We cannot put them down
once we get started with them.

00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:24.260 align:middle line:90%
Hank Wesselman.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Hank Wesselman, a most
extraordinary gentleman

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.422 align:middle line:90%
who has written two books.

00:21:31.422 --> 00:21:35.870 align:middle line:84%
The first one is "Spiritwalker,
Messages from the Future."

00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:38.630 align:middle line:84%
And the second one,
"Medicinemaker,

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:43.010 align:middle line:84%
Mythic Encounters
on a Shaman's Path."

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Absolutely fabulous and
quite controversial.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.800 align:middle line:84%
We bring you miracles
on this show.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Keep coming back.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.650 align:middle line:90%
