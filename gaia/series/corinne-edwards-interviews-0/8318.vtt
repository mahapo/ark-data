00:00:00.998 --> 00:00:03.992 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:03.992 --> 00:00:31.437 align:middle line:90%


00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:33.350 align:middle line:10%
>> You're not supposed
to share those things

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.990 align:middle line:10%
because there's only so much
that we have to go around.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.470 align:middle line:10%
And it's further
than that as well.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.320 align:middle line:10%
We hold the thought that our
demonstration of the highest

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.380 align:middle line:10%
form of love should only be
shared with one other person

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.430 align:middle line:10%
for the rest of our lives.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.030 align:middle line:10%
It's all right if that's
what you desire and seek,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:10%
but supposing you seek and
desire something larger,

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.320 align:middle line:10%
supposing you say
to me, Neale, I

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.440 align:middle line:10%
want to express the deepest
part of my love for all people

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.830 align:middle line:10%
all the time.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.055 align:middle line:10%
Now, what?

00:01:00.055 --> 00:01:01.680 align:middle line:10%
See, there are certain
sacred writings,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.222 align:middle line:10%
the course in miracles
is one of them

00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:05.425 align:middle line:10%
which says there are no
special relationships.

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:10.070 align:middle line:10%
>> How do we become the grandest
version and the greatest vision

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.890 align:middle line:10%
that we can be?

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.470 align:middle line:84%
Neal Donald Walsch says,
that's why we came here.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.890 align:middle line:84%
And he's the author of
"Conversations with God",

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.310 align:middle line:84%
the trilogy of three books,
and he's here to tell us

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.110 align:middle line:90%
how to do it.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.910 align:middle line:90%
Welcome.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:24.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, thank you.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.970 align:middle line:90%
It's nice to be here, Corinne.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:32.360 align:middle line:84%
>> The trilogy of three books
came in a certain order.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.090 align:middle line:84%
Could you tell me was the
first one the easiest one?

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.235 align:middle line:10%
How it is-- how do you--

00:01:37.235 --> 00:01:41.720 align:middle line:10%
>> Well, the first book grew
out of my intense desire to have

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.480 align:middle line:10%
a better understanding of my
individual life and how I was

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.350 align:middle line:10%
living it.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.620 align:middle line:84%
So the first book deals largely
with individual questions

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.850 align:middle line:84%
about life, right
livelihood, one's health,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.740 align:middle line:84%
the appropriate expression of
one's sexual energy, the larger

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.470 align:middle line:84%
question of human relationships
and romantic relationships,

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.263 align:middle line:90%
how those are all negotiated.

00:02:02.263 --> 00:02:04.430 align:middle line:84%
Really, all the individual
questions that each of us

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.920 align:middle line:84%
faces as we march
down the path of life.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.350 align:middle line:84%
The second book has to do with
larger issues and questions

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:90%
facing the entire planet.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.270 align:middle line:84%
How we handle the construction
of the institutions

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:84%
that drive the engine of
our collective experience,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.110 align:middle line:84%
our economy, the
education programs

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.220 align:middle line:84%
that we set up for our children,
our political constructions,

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.020 align:middle line:90%
and our environmental concerns.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.330 align:middle line:84%
All of those larger
issues that concern

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.230 align:middle line:84%
the whole planet and the
human race as a species.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.230 align:middle line:84%
And the third book goes
even further out from there

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.830 align:middle line:84%
and talks about the largest
cosmological questions of life

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.850 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.740 align:middle line:84%
What is really the
true purpose of life?

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.090 align:middle line:90%
How does it function?

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.460 align:middle line:84%
How does it work on
a day-to-day basis?

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:90%
Is there life on other planets?

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.190 align:middle line:84%
How is life experienced by
a highly evolved societies

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.190 align:middle line:84%
and highly evolved beings
elsewhere in the cosmos?

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.600 align:middle line:90%
And those kinds of questions.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.520 align:middle line:84%
So really, it goes
from the individual

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:84%
to the global collective to
the cosmological questions

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.460 align:middle line:84%
that intrigue and have
intrigued humankind

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.630 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.360 align:middle line:84%
>> I think it's
important to people,

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.190 align:middle line:84%
the one or two people in the
audience who have not read

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.500 align:middle line:84%
your books or know
anything about them,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.420 align:middle line:84%
to know that this all came
from just your asking tortured

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.320 align:middle line:90%
question of God.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, what does it
take to make life work?

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.460 align:middle line:84%
The "Conversations
with God" trilogy

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.400 align:middle line:84%
was never intended to
be a series of books.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.950 align:middle line:84%
It was a private
process, if you please,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:84%
that I was having
in my own mind.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.410 align:middle line:84%
I was writing out questions
to the god of my understanding

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
and simply saying,
please God, help

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.360 align:middle line:84%
me to understand even better
how things are supposed

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.680 align:middle line:90%
to be working here.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.490 align:middle line:84%
And the conversation began at
a very low point in my life

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.110 align:middle line:90%
where nothing was working.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.220 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, I was really in
a place of chronic depression.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And so I called out to God, what
does it take to make life work

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.160 align:middle line:84%
and give me the answers to
these questions that have really

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:84%
plagued all of us
for a very long time.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.260 align:middle line:84%
And I have to say,
to my astonishment,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.680 align:middle line:90%
I was given those answers.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And as the answers came, of
course, more questions came.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.780 align:middle line:84%
I began writing
them down because I

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.940 align:middle line:84%
knew I would want to
have a record of this.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.670 align:middle line:84%
It was just for my
own edification,

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.370 align:middle line:84%
never dreaming, of course, that
someone in Peoria, Illinois,

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:84%
much less Bangkok, would
be reading this material.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.140 align:middle line:84%
The books have been translated,
however, into 24 languages

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and they've sold over
two million copies,

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.310 align:middle line:84%
and they're being
now read worldwide

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.930 align:middle line:90%
much to my astonishment.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.710 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the things that has
fascinate me is nowhere does it

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.480 align:middle line:84%
ever say when you talk
about this book that this is

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.803 align:middle line:90%
a channelled book.

00:04:37.803 --> 00:04:38.970 align:middle line:90%
Is this the channelled book?

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.460 align:middle line:84%
>> No, it's not a
channelled book.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.830 align:middle line:84%
>> What is the difference
between God having

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.380 align:middle line:84%
a conversation with you
and a channelled book?

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.780 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that
a channelled book,

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.080 align:middle line:84%
as I understand the definition
of the word channeling,

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.200 align:middle line:84%
is when another entity or being
takes over a person's human

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.340 align:middle line:84%
body, that person's mind turns
off or flees or go someplace

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.960 align:middle line:90%
they're not there.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And the other being
or entity speaks

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.490 align:middle line:84%
through the physical
form, simply

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.120 align:middle line:84%
using the body as a vehicle
through which to communicate.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.980 align:middle line:84%
That's not what
happened here with me.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.300 align:middle line:90%
I call this inspired writing.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it was a great
deal different from Thomas

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.490 align:middle line:84%
Jefferson writing the
Declaration of Independence

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.460 align:middle line:84%
or Mozart composing
his extraordinary music

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.220 align:middle line:84%
or Picasso trying to
figure out from the deepest

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.430 align:middle line:84%
part of his intuitive self
where to put the next line

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.560 align:middle line:84%
or to put the next
dash of color.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Those moments of inspiration
when human beings, not just

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.270 align:middle line:84%
in the creative and performing
arts, but in politics,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.130 align:middle line:84%
in science, in
every area of life,

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.200 align:middle line:84%
in sports, in every
aspect of life,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.630 align:middle line:84%
there are moments when
human beings reach back

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.990 align:middle line:84%
for something
higher, go to a place

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.490 align:middle line:84%
that's a place of
resource within all of us.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.420 align:middle line:84%
And sometimes they even say
the words of God help me,

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.010 align:middle line:90%
I don't know how to do this now.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.010 align:middle line:84%
Imagine Thomas Jefferson being
given a day or two or three

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.890 align:middle line:84%
to write a document
that he knew would

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.780 align:middle line:84%
have to stand the
test of time and maybe

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.550 align:middle line:90%
live for hundreds of years.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.340 align:middle line:84%
And he did that, and he
wrote a magnificent document,

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.768 align:middle line:84%
and I believe if someone
had said to him, Thomas,

00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:10.310 align:middle line:84%
how did you write
that in three days?

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.320 align:middle line:90%
It's absolutely magnificent.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.850 align:middle line:84%
He might have said, I
was inspired by God.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.220 align:middle line:84%
I don't think anyone
would have doubted it.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.670 align:middle line:84%
>> What did God say about life
in other planets and UFOs?

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.345 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, God said there is, of
course, life on other planets,

00:06:24.345 --> 00:06:26.470 align:middle line:84%
and he finds it rather
surprising that anyone would

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.710 align:middle line:90%
question that.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And he said that on many
other planets in the cosmos,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.790 align:middle line:84%
life is lived at a
level of sophistication,

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.010 align:middle line:84%
if you please, a
great deal higher

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.450 align:middle line:90%
than we're living it here.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.200 align:middle line:84%
This is in fact the human race,
or rather primitive species.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And we demonstrate
our primitiveness,

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.510 align:middle line:84%
if that's a word, with our
actions of everyday life

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:middle line:90%
here on this planet.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And so in book three of the
"Conversations with God"

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.690 align:middle line:84%
trilogy, life in the more
highly evolved societies,

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.120 align:middle line:84%
or cultures of the cosmos
is described in some detail.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.640 align:middle line:84%
And those descriptions are
awesome, they're inspiring,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.345 align:middle line:84%
they're uplifting,
they're a bit--

00:07:05.345 --> 00:07:06.145 align:middle line:90%
>> Startling.

00:07:06.145 --> 00:07:06.460 align:middle line:90%
>> --they're startling.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.500 align:middle line:84%
>> What about when God said when
you asked him how far evolved

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.375 align:middle line:90%
are we, and he said--

00:07:10.375 --> 00:07:12.120 align:middle line:90%
>> You are in the 12-yard line.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:13.300 align:middle line:90%
>> The 12-yard line.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:14.100 align:middle line:90%
What?

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.760 align:middle line:84%
And we think we're so smart
and so technically-advanced.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.760 align:middle line:84%
>> He said don't feel
bad, it wasn't so long ago

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.103 align:middle line:90%
you're on the three.

00:07:20.103 --> 00:07:21.520 align:middle line:84%
You really made
some movement here

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.970 align:middle line:84%
in the past couple
of decades or so.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.980 align:middle line:84%
You really made some movement
in the past 2,000 years.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.790 align:middle line:84%
But for a long time, you were
back there on the 3-yard line.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So we have a long
way to go and all

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.300 align:middle line:84%
we have to do to see
how far we have to go

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.090 align:middle line:84%
is to read those descriptions
in book three of what

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.420 align:middle line:84%
is really happening with
highly evolved cultures

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.650 align:middle line:90%
in the universe.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.560 align:middle line:10%
And for instance-- just to
use some real simple examples

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:10%
from the book-- they
share everything

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:48.580 align:middle line:10%
and they don't think of it.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.370 align:middle line:84%
What's mine is yours,
what yours is mine,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.530 align:middle line:84%
and everything is mutually
shared to the mutual benefit

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.370 align:middle line:90%
of all.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.870 align:middle line:84%
One person would
never want to be

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:84%
and would never dream
of withholding something

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.580 align:middle line:84%
from another, much less
charging at other person

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.570 align:middle line:84%
a higher price because what
they held in their possession

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.970 align:middle line:90%
was more rare.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.300 align:middle line:84%
If I was really evolved,
I would never say to you,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.050 align:middle line:84%
Corinne, I know you
really want this water

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.330 align:middle line:84%
and I see you're very
thirsty, and as it happens,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.310 align:middle line:84%
this is the only
glass of water around.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.298 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the price for this
water is going to go sky high.

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:19.840 align:middle line:84%
And I hate to tell
you this, Corinne,

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.882 align:middle line:84%
but if you can't afford
the price of this water--

00:08:21.882 --> 00:08:22.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Die.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.340 align:middle line:90%
>> --you can't have any.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:26.112 align:middle line:90%
It's a very-- and we do that.

00:08:26.112 --> 00:08:28.570 align:middle line:84%
We do it with water, with oil,
with all of our commodities.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's how we live
and it's a rather primitive way

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:34.570 align:middle line:84%
to interact with each
other to say the least.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:84%
And so one of the simple
examples I used from the book

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.330 align:middle line:84%
is that highly evolved
beings would never do that.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.270 align:middle line:84%
They would simply see
that their best interest

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:46.090 align:middle line:90%
is a mutually shared interest.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Because they see that
everyone is the same,

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:90%
that we are all one.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.870 align:middle line:84%
They recognize the brotherhood
of all sentient beings

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.430 align:middle line:90%
everywhere.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:56.980 align:middle line:84%
And so it would violate
something so true

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:01.570 align:middle line:84%
in their soul, not only would
the fact that this was rare not

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.010 align:middle line:84%
caused them to
increase the price,

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:05.140 align:middle line:84%
they would actually
reduce the price

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.030 align:middle line:84%
if there was a price at
all, because it was so rare.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:09.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they'd probably
give it to you for nothing

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.960 align:middle line:84%
and say, oh, my goodness,
this is the only water

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.690 align:middle line:90%
we have between us.

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, here, for
heaven's sake, share.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.667 align:middle line:84%
Now, people have those kinds of
moments on this planet as well.

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:19.000 align:middle line:84%
We know people who have from
the goodness of their heart

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.950 align:middle line:84%
given the last of what
they had to assist another.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.120 align:middle line:84%
So these experiences are
not uncommon on this planet,

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:90%
but they are rare.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.520 align:middle line:84%
It is more common for
people to say, I'm sorry,

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.190 align:middle line:84%
but I'm going to charge you
$5 a swallow for this water

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.650 align:middle line:84%
because it's the only
water in the room.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.280 align:middle line:90%
And that's called economy.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:90%
That's called our economy.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.050 align:middle line:90%
It's called commerce.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:42.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure it's
very enlightened,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.940 align:middle line:90%
but it is called commerce.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.950 align:middle line:90%
Now, that's just why--

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.588 align:middle line:90%
>> And it's called communism?

00:09:46.588 --> 00:09:48.880 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think that what
I've described is communism.

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
I think it's maybe as
close to capitalism.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Capitalism, which
says that I get

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:55.828 align:middle line:84%
to set the price for this water
whatever the traffic will bear.

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.370 align:middle line:84%
And if you're really,
really thirsty,

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:59.050 align:middle line:84%
and if you'll give me
everything that you're

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.133 align:middle line:84%
worth and everything you
have including your first

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:04.450 align:middle line:90%
born for a glass of this water.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.970 align:middle line:90%
That's rank capitalism for sure.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.100 align:middle line:10%
It isn't the kind
of gentle capitalism

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.700 align:middle line:10%
we like to think that we're
experiencing in this country.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.350 align:middle line:10%
But it is capitalism,
nonetheless.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.220 align:middle line:90%
It's not communism.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.160 align:middle line:84%
Communism would say, the
water belongs to both of us.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.506 align:middle line:90%


00:10:21.506 --> 00:10:27.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we are having a
fascinating conversation here

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:33.170 align:middle line:84%
with Neale Donald Walsch who
is the author of the trilogy

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.390 align:middle line:90%
of "Conversations with God".

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:37.850 align:middle line:84%
I don't think you want
to miss a word of this.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.175 align:middle line:84%
We're going to talk
about marriage next.

00:10:40.175 --> 00:10:42.896 align:middle line:84%
So stay with us,
we'll be right back.

00:10:42.896 --> 00:10:45.884 align:middle line:90%
[THEME MUSIC]

00:10:45.884 --> 00:10:50.880 align:middle line:90%


00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.300 align:middle line:10%
We're talking to
Neale Donald Walsch

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.590 align:middle line:10%
about his amazing trilogy of
books called "Conversations

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:58.890 align:middle line:10%
with God".

00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:59.960 align:middle line:90%
Neale, welcome back.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.070 align:middle line:90%
>> Thank you very much.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.940 align:middle line:84%
>> You're setting the whole
world on fire here with all

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.910 align:middle line:84%
these radical ideas
that God has told you.

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.025 align:middle line:90%
How come God told you?

00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Well, God has told all of us.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.910 align:middle line:84%
The question really
might more aptly

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.180 align:middle line:90%
be asked, how come I listened?

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.350 align:middle line:84%
So you've got us talking
to all of us all the time.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.900 align:middle line:90%
I wasn't selected separately.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:25.040 align:middle line:84%
I'm not special but I've
done something a bit unusual.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.910 align:middle line:84%
I've listened to
the words of God.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.500 align:middle line:84%
First of all, I
believed that they were.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.480 align:middle line:84%
I believe in myself
worthy to receive them.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.990 align:middle line:84%
We're all worthy, but I
actually believed that I was.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:37.780 align:middle line:90%
And then I took him seriously.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.360 align:middle line:90%
And I wrote them down.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.140 align:middle line:84%
And I didn't write it off
to just my imagination

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.040 align:middle line:84%
or blow it off as just some
kind of a moment of insanity.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.645 align:middle line:84%
It might be a moment of
insanity for all I know,

00:11:48.645 --> 00:11:50.270 align:middle line:84%
but millions of people
around the world

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:52.640 align:middle line:84%
are finding some
uplifting experiences

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.540 align:middle line:90%
out of reading this material.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.585 align:middle line:84%
So if I'm insane, I
guess, we all are.

00:11:56.585 --> 00:11:59.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I think that's
pretty generally true, anyway.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.500 align:middle line:84%
But one of the things that it's
really been kind of torn apart

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.860 align:middle line:84%
here in your book and
that is the whole idea

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.475 align:middle line:84%
that God has
sanctified marriage.

00:12:10.475 --> 00:12:12.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I don't know
that it's torn apart.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:14.480 align:middle line:84%
I think God has
sanctified marriage.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.330 align:middle line:84%
What's torn apart is the way
we have de-sanctified marriage,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.580 align:middle line:90%
what we've done with marriage.

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.610 align:middle line:84%
What God says in book
three is that the way

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:26.480 align:middle line:84%
we have constructed
and then experienced

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:32.420 align:middle line:84%
the sanctity or the sacrament of
marriage has skewed the result

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:36.530 align:middle line:84%
and caused us to not know at
all what was originally intended

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.860 align:middle line:84%
by the idea of
two people uniting

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.420 align:middle line:84%
in an experience of
bonding and love.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:48.980 align:middle line:84%
Marriage or love, if you please,
is composed of two elements.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.370 align:middle line:84%
I'm told in the trilogy
that true love is

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:56.750 align:middle line:84%
free, totally free, and
unlimited, and eternal.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.210 align:middle line:90%
So it's unlimited and eternal.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:03.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, in marriage, God said the
way we have constructed it,

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:84%
we've turned marriage,
we've twisted it all around

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.750 align:middle line:84%
and turned marriage into some
kind of a game of possession.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:11.212 align:middle line:84%
I put a ring on your finger,
now you belong to me.

00:13:11.212 --> 00:13:13.670 align:middle line:84%
And because you belong to me,
there are certain things that

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.640 align:middle line:84%
you can and certain
things that you cannot do.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:19.315 align:middle line:84%
If we lived like 50 years
ago and I was your husband,

00:13:19.315 --> 00:13:20.690 align:middle line:84%
I might even have
the right and I

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.460 align:middle line:84%
think that I had the
right to tell you

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:25.820 align:middle line:84%
what clubs you can belong to,
how much money you can spend.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if it's more
than 50 years ago,

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:84%
I might even have been able
to tell you whether you can

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.210 align:middle line:90%
or cannot vote.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, you know, there are
people in the audience right

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.403 align:middle line:84%
now who are saying, what
do you mean 50 years ago?

00:13:35.403 --> 00:13:36.362 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, less than that.

00:13:36.362 --> 00:13:38.210 align:middle line:84%
>> That's going on in
my house right now.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:39.335 align:middle line:90%
>> My house right now, yes.

00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:41.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's how it is
in many marriages.

00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
People use marriage
not to expand

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:46.670 align:middle line:84%
their experience of themselves
and each other and hence

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:84%
of life, but rather
to contract it.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.260 align:middle line:84%
To say now that
we're married you

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.110 align:middle line:84%
are going to be less than
you were when you were single

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:56.090 align:middle line:84%
and we are going to be
less even as a twosome

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.520 align:middle line:84%
than we were when we
were two individuals.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.890 align:middle line:84%
And we'll be less in
a variety of ways,

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:03.830 align:middle line:84%
and chiefly, we will ask
you, I will ask you the day

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.850 align:middle line:84%
I marry you, to from now
on love no one else the way

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:90%
you love me.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.400 align:middle line:90%
That, of course, means sexually.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.295 align:middle line:90%
But it means more than sexually.

00:14:12.295 --> 00:14:13.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's gotten
to the point where

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.010 align:middle line:84%
if you even look at a
person across a room

00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:19.370 align:middle line:84%
at a party the wrong way, I feel
I have a right to come home--

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.710 align:middle line:84%
excuse me-- and say to
you when we get home,

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.560 align:middle line:84%
Corinne, why were you looking
at that guy like that?

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.300 align:middle line:90%
Don't you understand that--

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.595 align:middle line:84%
and I get to be jealous about
that because we're now married.

00:14:29.595 --> 00:14:30.970 align:middle line:84%
And you could look
at me and say,

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:33.590 align:middle line:90%
but Neale, he's a nice man.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.100 align:middle line:90%
I just want to let him--

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:90%
or even smile at him.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:37.870 align:middle line:90%
You see, we've gotten--

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.300 align:middle line:84%
Corinne, we've gotten insane
with it, the level of ownership

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.070 align:middle line:90%
and the level of distrust.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.875 align:middle line:84%
And that's all grows out of our
experience of insufficiency.

00:14:46.875 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:84%
You see, my thought
is that there's not

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:50.150 align:middle line:90%
enough love to go around.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.650 align:middle line:84%
So if you're sending love
to the guy across the room,

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:90%
that's less for me.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.700 align:middle line:84%
>> You're taking
it away from me.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.117 align:middle line:84%
>> Of course, and there's only
a finite amount here so you

00:14:57.117 --> 00:14:58.340 align:middle line:90%
can't do that.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:00.593 align:middle line:84%
Not only can you not
smile at him that way,

00:15:00.593 --> 00:15:02.510 align:middle line:84%
you certainly can't go
over there and hug him.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.802 align:middle line:84%
And God forbid, you should
spend a more intimate moment

00:15:04.802 --> 00:15:06.440 align:middle line:84%
in some other
intimate way with him.

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.148 align:middle line:84%
You're not supposed
to share those things

00:15:08.148 --> 00:15:11.510 align:middle line:84%
because there's only so much
that we have to go around.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.000 align:middle line:84%
And it's further
than that as well.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.850 align:middle line:84%
We hold the thought that our
demonstration of the highest

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.910 align:middle line:84%
form of love should only be
shared with one other person

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:21.960 align:middle line:90%
for the rest of our lives.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.530 align:middle line:84%
It's all right if that's
what you desire and seek,

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.840 align:middle line:84%
but supposing you seek and
desire something larger,

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.850 align:middle line:84%
supposing you say
to me, Neale, I

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:31.940 align:middle line:84%
want to express the deepest
part of my love for all people

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.360 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.545 align:middle line:90%
Now, what?

00:15:34.545 --> 00:15:36.170 align:middle line:84%
See, there are certain
sacred writings,

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.753 align:middle line:84%
the course in miracles
is one of them,

00:15:37.753 --> 00:15:42.050 align:middle line:84%
which says there are no special
relationships, that marriage

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:84%
asks us to promise each
other what God would never

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.580 align:middle line:90%
promise to us.

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:84%
God would never say
to you, Corinne,

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.060 align:middle line:84%
I love you more
than anyone else.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.650 align:middle line:90%
That's a very ungodly statement.

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:57.450 align:middle line:84%
>> But you keep talking about
the promises in the book that

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:01.200 align:middle line:84%
people have great difficulty
with promises because they

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.940 align:middle line:84%
don't know how
they're going to feel.

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Promises, says
God in book three,

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:09.210 align:middle line:84%
are virtually impossible to
keep until we rise to the level

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:12.660 align:middle line:84%
of mastery where we can
predict our own future.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.940 align:middle line:84%
Until we get to that place
where I can know exactly

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.242 align:middle line:84%
in 10 years or five
or three or one how

00:16:18.242 --> 00:16:20.700 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to feel about anything
and what my truth will be,

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.710 align:middle line:84%
until I get to that
level of mastery

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:24.480 align:middle line:84%
where I'm creating
my future rather

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.320 align:middle line:84%
than reacting to circumstances
around me, a promise is a lie.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.320 align:middle line:84%
How can I promise you I
will love you forever?

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.960 align:middle line:84%
I can say it's my intention
to love you forever.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.270 align:middle line:84%
How can I promise you
that I actually will?

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:40.980 align:middle line:84%
And that creates enormous strain
and difficulty between people

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:43.858 align:middle line:84%
because they're promising things
that they-- then they hope.

00:16:43.858 --> 00:16:45.150 align:middle line:90%
I hope I can keep that promise.

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:46.308 align:middle line:90%
I hope I can keep my word.

00:16:46.308 --> 00:16:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And they struggle
to keep their word.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.950 align:middle line:84%
And even when they
have lost the love,

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.770 align:middle line:84%
even when the spouse
has been abusive to them

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:54.240 align:middle line:84%
or behaved in some
other way that

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.280 align:middle line:84%
causes them to feel
less than loving,

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:58.500 align:middle line:84%
because they made a
promise, some people

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.965 align:middle line:90%
live lives of quiet desperation.

00:16:59.965 --> 00:17:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>> Stand by your man.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.790 align:middle line:90%
>> Stand by your man.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Living a life of quiet
desperation because I said

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.240 align:middle line:90%
I would.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.069 align:middle line:90%
I said I would.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.869 align:middle line:90%
>> Or of the kids.

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:09.644 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yeah, exactly.

00:17:09.644 --> 00:17:11.085 align:middle line:90%
>> So should we get married?

00:17:11.085 --> 00:17:13.045 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we should
get married, for sure.

00:17:13.045 --> 00:17:15.420 align:middle line:84%
I mean, a marriage is a very
natural thing to want to do.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.670 align:middle line:90%
We want to be with each other.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:20.130 align:middle line:84%
We want to experience oneness,
and marriage is a wonderful way

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:21.042 align:middle line:90%
to do that.

00:17:21.042 --> 00:17:22.750 align:middle line:84%
The question isn't
should we get married,

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.787 align:middle line:84%
the question is what kind of
marriage should we construct?

00:17:25.787 --> 00:17:27.329 align:middle line:84%
The kind of marriage
I've constructed

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:29.610 align:middle line:84%
with my wife,
Nancy, is a marriage

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.270 align:middle line:84%
that's based on freedom and
unlimitedness and eternality.

00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:36.330 align:middle line:84%
That we say to each
other, I will love you,

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.220 align:middle line:90%
I choose to love you eternally.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:39.690 align:middle line:90%
Now, what form that will take?

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.950 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:41.880 align:middle line:90%
I can't tell you that.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:42.990 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.778 align:middle line:84%
But I can tell you that
my love is so open for you

00:17:45.778 --> 00:17:47.070 align:middle line:90%
that I will love you eternally.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And here's how my
levels show up.

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.020 align:middle line:84%
First, I will allow you
to say and do and be

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.230 align:middle line:90%
whatever you choose.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.130 align:middle line:84%
You may be, do and have whatever
you choose because love never

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:57.780 align:middle line:90%
says no.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:02.070 align:middle line:84%
As God never says no to
us, love never says no.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So when my beloved
comes to me and says,

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Neale, I'd like to join this
club or do that or buy a horse

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.250 align:middle line:84%
or have that kind of a hat,
or have any kind of experience

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.440 align:middle line:84%
at all, my job in
the name of love

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:18.150 align:middle line:84%
is to say your will for
you is my will for you.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.925 align:middle line:90%
That's what God says to us.

00:18:19.925 --> 00:18:22.050 align:middle line:84%
Yet you find it very
difficult to say to each other

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.000 align:middle line:84%
because we get
our own interests,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.160 align:middle line:84%
our own self-interest
gets in there.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.840 align:middle line:84%
Yet my self-interest
gets in there

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.780 align:middle line:84%
with my lovely wife,
Nancy, too except that I

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.330 align:middle line:84%
see that my highest
self-interest is

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:84%
our mutual interest, that it
does not serve my self-interest

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:41.046 align:middle line:84%
to say no to Nancy
to any request.

00:18:41.046 --> 00:18:43.710 align:middle line:84%
>> I thought it was very
touching that you put

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:46.140 align:middle line:90%
your wedding vows in the book.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I was asked
to do that by God.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:52.230 align:middle line:84%
You go ahead, put
your wedding vows,

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:53.760 align:middle line:90%
and I inspired them anyway.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Nancy and I wrote
our wedding vows

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.650 align:middle line:84%
and the wedding vows we
wrote promised each other not

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.890 align:middle line:84%
to love, honor, and obey,
but to love and to grant

00:19:01.890 --> 00:19:05.400 align:middle line:84%
each other freedom
and unlimitedness.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.530 align:middle line:84%
I will never restrict
you in any way

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.350 align:middle line:84%
from having any
experience you choose.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And by the way, that's
the greatest-- you know,

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.300 align:middle line:84%
we think that the other vows
are going to cause someone

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.470 align:middle line:90%
to stay with us.

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Why would my wife leave me?

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.100 align:middle line:84%
Why would I leave her
if she promises me

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.410 align:middle line:84%
that I can be, do and
have whatever I choose?

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.281 align:middle line:84%
I've been looking for
that person all my life.

00:19:25.281 --> 00:19:30.540 align:middle line:84%
>> You talk about the soul's
main preoccupation is to be

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:33.180 align:middle line:84%
limitless and to
have no restriction.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Because that's the
nature of the soul.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It is the nature
of the soul itself.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:41.490 align:middle line:84%
The soul is, by definition,
that which knows no limitation.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.820 align:middle line:84%
The soul is a mini-version of
a larger experience we call

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.370 align:middle line:90%
God, which is also limitless.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And so what the soul
seeks to experience

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.630 align:middle line:84%
is the aspect of
itself that we call

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.440 align:middle line:90%
limitlessness or total freedom.

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.190 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean that
we have the freedom

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.520 align:middle line:84%
to go out and hurt
people or do bad things.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't want to be
misinterpreted here.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But it does mean that
we have the freedom

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.990 align:middle line:84%
to make the highest
choices that express

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.230 align:middle line:84%
the grandest version
of who we really are,

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.666 align:middle line:84%
to express deity itself
in physical or human form.

00:20:14.666 --> 00:20:18.960 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not so terrible then
if your wife or your husband

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.130 align:middle line:84%
has an affair with someone else
and wants to come home and say,

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.950 align:middle line:90%
I really prefer to be with you.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:27.810 align:middle line:84%
>> I don't think it
would be so terrible.

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.620 align:middle line:90%
No, I don't.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And I couldn't hold
that against any wife.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.790 align:middle line:84%
If my wife had an affair,
which first of all,

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:90%
she wouldn't have an affair.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:84%
If my wife had a feeling
of love for another person,

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.330 align:middle line:84%
she would just come to me and
say if that were the case.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:42.607 align:middle line:84%
I feel I have a love, a
relationship with this person,

00:20:42.607 --> 00:20:44.190 align:middle line:84%
and I'd like to
express it in whatever

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:45.540 align:middle line:90%
way feels natural and normal.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.605 align:middle line:84%
And my reaction would be, as
you wish and as you choose.

00:20:49.605 --> 00:20:51.730 align:middle line:84%
How can I condemn that you
would love someone else?

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.350 align:middle line:90%
How can I condemn that?

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.505 align:middle line:90%
>> Would you do it?

00:20:54.505 --> 00:20:55.330 align:middle line:90%
>> What, I do what?

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.605 align:middle line:90%
>> Would you allow it, really?

00:20:56.605 --> 00:20:59.410 align:middle line:90%
>> Of course, absolutely.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> You feel that these
books have had that much

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.830 align:middle line:84%
of an influence on you that you
have changed to the point where

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.352 align:middle line:84%
you have no ego about these
things anymore, Neale?

00:21:08.352 --> 00:21:10.810 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, I wouldn't say I have
no ego about them but I have

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.340 align:middle line:84%
a new thought in my
place of ego about them.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.460 align:middle line:84%
And yes, the books have
changed me completely.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, a lot of people are going
to hear what I'm telling you

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.130 align:middle line:84%
on this program and feel that
I've just said blasphemy here,

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:25.990 align:middle line:84%
that I've said
things that I violate

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:84%
every law of common decency
known to human beings.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:32.740 align:middle line:84%
And I have no need to
convince anyone of that.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.480 align:middle line:84%
But of course, in a very
short television program,

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.355 align:middle line:84%
it's hard to get these
kinds of complex ideas

00:21:36.355 --> 00:21:37.885 align:middle line:84%
across in the
fullness and richness.

00:21:37.885 --> 00:21:39.010 align:middle line:90%
>> And you have to read it.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:39.830 align:middle line:90%
>> You have to read it.

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.890 align:middle line:84%
>> What you're mainly saying
here about marriage is that

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:42.690 align:middle line:90%
love is freedom.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:46.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Love is freedom and
love simply never says no.

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.710 align:middle line:84%
>> And to try to accomplish it
by putting someone in bondage

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:middle line:90%
is not love.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:56.440 align:middle line:84%
>> And we've created our
marriages as bondages in this

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.290 align:middle line:84%
century and for
centuries and centuries.

00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:01.330 align:middle line:90%
We've called marriage bondage.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.100 align:middle line:84%
I now own you and you'll
behave in the following ways.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.203 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't, I will
make sure that not only do it

00:22:07.203 --> 00:22:08.620 align:middle line:84%
to you-- no longer
are you with me

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:10.240 align:middle line:90%
but things will go bad for you.

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, we have been having a
marvelous time with you today.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:18.040 align:middle line:84%
It, as Neale says, it's
impossible to squeeze

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.130 align:middle line:84%
all the ideas in this
small space of time.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.260 align:middle line:84%
You're going to have
to read the books.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.820 align:middle line:84%
We've been talking
to Neale Donald

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.470 align:middle line:84%
Walsch about his third book,
"Conversations with God", book

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:30.345 align:middle line:90%
three.

00:22:30.345 --> 00:22:31.720 align:middle line:84%
As I always tell
you around here,

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.740 align:middle line:84%
we give you miracles
on this show.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.240 align:middle line:90%
Keep coming back.
