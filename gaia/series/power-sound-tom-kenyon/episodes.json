Her form is the Milky Way bending over the Earth. Each night she swallows Ra, the Sun and gives birth to him again each morning after his night passage through her body. She is thus a symbol of death and rebirth. The ancient Egyptians depicted her body full of 5-pointed stars, representing her human children as star seeds born to Earth and destined to return to the divine home she holds for us. She is said to receive all her children back into her body when death occurs and is depicted on coffin lids and tomb ceilings across Egypt. Nut is the mother of Nepthys and Set, Osiris and Isis, who brings the inundation. The ancient law of As Above, So Below, is perfectly expressed in the relationship between Nut and the Nile. The ancient ones believed the Nile was the reflected body of Nut on Earth, spreading out across the desert lands of Egypt, bringing life, as Nut spread out across the sky, giving life to her children and receiving them back into her body when the journey was over.
