WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140 align:middle line:84%
>> After I got my training in
Ericksonian medical hypnosis

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and my master's in
psychological counseling,

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.410 align:middle line:84%
I had a private practice for
many years in North Carolina.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And then I moved to
Washington state.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.590 align:middle line:84%
And I was doing work in
Hong Kong as a consultant.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.420 align:middle line:84%
So it was easier to fly back
and forth from the Seattle area

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.820 align:middle line:84%
than from all the way
to North Carolina.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.190 align:middle line:84%
And I worked at something called
the Olympia Wellness Center.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.410 align:middle line:84%
Olympia is the state
capital of Washington,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.160 align:middle line:84%
and it's got horrible
weather in the winter--

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.840 align:middle line:90%
gray, dreary, rainy.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.710 align:middle line:84%
And so I was working there as
a counselor, and at my office

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:90%
was the top.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.500 align:middle line:84%
It was a converted attic, so
it was the top of an old house

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.940 align:middle line:90%
and faced the street.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And I had a window that
looked out on the street.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.880 align:middle line:84%
And so I'd been working
there for several months,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and the head of the center,
director said to me,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.510 align:middle line:84%
a boy came today
and said he needed

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.040 align:middle line:90%
to talk to the man upstairs.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.680 align:middle line:84%
And I said, "well,
there is a man upstairs.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.270 align:middle line:90%
He has an office."

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And the boy said,
"can I see him?"

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.250 align:middle line:84%
And he said, "he's
busy right now."

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.760 align:middle line:84%
And he came for
several days in a row.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.640 align:middle line:84%
He would come in and say
is the man upstairs here?

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.320 align:middle line:84%
And there was one
day where he came,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.600 align:middle line:84%
and I had an hour
space between clients.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And she said, "yes, the
man upstairs is here,

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.560 align:middle line:84%
and I'll go see if
he will see you."

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.135 align:middle line:84%
So she walks up the stairs
to the attic office and says,

00:01:40.135 --> 00:01:41.760 align:middle line:84%
"Tom, you're not
going to believe this,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.790 align:middle line:84%
but there's a boy
who says he needs

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.310 align:middle line:90%
to talk to the man upstairs."

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.700 align:middle line:90%
I said, OK.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So this boy, who's about
seven or eight years old,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.960 align:middle line:84%
walks up the stairs
into a building--

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.000 align:middle line:84%
an office that he's
never been in before.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.410 align:middle line:90%
I'll never forget this.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.250 align:middle line:84%
Seven or eight years
old, and in my office

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:84%
is this lounge chair, because
I did medical hypnosis.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.660 align:middle line:84%
One of the things I
would do is people

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.650 align:middle line:84%
would get in the lounge
chair and lean back.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.430 align:middle line:84%
And as soon as they leaned
back, the neurophysiology

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.650 align:middle line:90%
starts to relax.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.980 align:middle line:84%
And as he sat in
the lounge chair

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.140 align:middle line:84%
and it started to go
back, he grabbed it

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
and pulled it forward
and planted his feet

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.420 align:middle line:90%
firmly on the floor.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.980 align:middle line:84%
This is a wise soul
in a little body.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.840 align:middle line:84%
And in the course
of the conversation,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.740 align:middle line:90%
I realized he thinks I'm God.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.880 align:middle line:84%
Because children
around seven years old,

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.610 align:middle line:90%
they're literal up until--

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.783 align:middle line:84%
especially boys--
until they're seven.

00:02:43.783 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
And after that, they start to
build different connections,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.082 align:middle line:84%
so his mother, when
there were problems,

00:02:49.082 --> 00:02:51.540 align:middle line:84%
she would always say the man
upstairs will take care of it.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.490 align:middle line:84%
The man upstairs
will take care of it.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.910 align:middle line:84%
So he had this in his mind,
and he was walking one day

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.400 align:middle line:84%
and saw me up there and
thought I was the man upstairs.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So he-- the courage
of this child

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:84%
to come into a space like
that is extraordinary.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.180 align:middle line:84%
So anyways, I'm
realizing, my god,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.760 align:middle line:90%
he thinks he's talking to God.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.470 align:middle line:90%


00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:84%
And so he explains to me
that his father lost his job,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.590 align:middle line:84%
and he says they're
very unhappy at home.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And I'm in a quandary, because
I'm a registered counselor

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.120 align:middle line:90%
in the state of Washington.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.790 align:middle line:84%
I have to ascertain if there's
child abuse because if there

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:84%
is child abuse, by law, I have
to report to Child Services.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
So I ask him some questions
that are non-revealing,

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.750 align:middle line:90%
but to get the information.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:84%
So there is no child
abuse taking place.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.940 align:middle line:84%
It's just that his
father is very sad.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.880 align:middle line:90%
He's lost his job.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.850 align:middle line:84%
And there's no work to be had,
and he says, can you help?

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.398 align:middle line:84%
And I realized in
that moment that he

00:04:01.398 --> 00:04:04.620 align:middle line:90%
is talking to a delusion.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.660 align:middle line:90%
He thinks I am God.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.150 align:middle line:84%
But at another level, I
am God, and he is God.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.280 align:middle line:84%
And everybody in
this building is God,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.279 align:middle line:84%
and everybody in
this planet is God.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:22.830 align:middle line:84%
And so there was nothing I could
do to remedy the situation.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.700 align:middle line:90%
I said I will see what I can do.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.020 align:middle line:84%
And he smiled, and you
could just feel him relax.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.080 align:middle line:84%
It was handled
because God had said,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.508 align:middle line:90%
he will see what he can do.

00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And even as I talk about
it, this is years later,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.390 align:middle line:84%
there's still emotion,
because of the courage

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.760 align:middle line:84%
and the innocence of that
child in that moment.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.290 align:middle line:84%
So he left, and I had a half
an hour before my next client.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.890 align:middle line:84%
And I closed the door, and I sat
in the chair, the lounge chair,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.180 align:middle line:90%
leaned back.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.000 align:middle line:84%
And I laughed and I
cried at the same time.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.830 align:middle line:84%
I laughed at the humor of
taking that phrase literally,

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.640 align:middle line:84%
that there is a man upstairs and
him thinking that I am the man

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.600 align:middle line:84%
upstairs, and crying for
the suffering in his family,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.405 align:middle line:84%
and for their situation,
and for all sentient beings.

00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:13.960 align:middle line:90%


00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.110 align:middle line:90%
And what do you do?

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.960 align:middle line:84%
The only thing I could do was
to set an intention in motion,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.750 align:middle line:90%
to set an intention in motion.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.010 align:middle line:84%
So I went inside to my still
place, the deepest place

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:33.730 align:middle line:84%
I could find, and held the
intent that his father find

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:41.580 align:middle line:84%
a job and that they come
back to their happiness.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.960 align:middle line:84%
So it was a very dreary winter,
and about two weeks later,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.055 align:middle line:84%
the sun shone for the
first time in months,

00:05:48.055 --> 00:05:50.430 align:middle line:84%
and you live in the Northwest,
you know what that's like.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.930 align:middle line:84%
It's like people
drop to their knees

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.260 align:middle line:84%
and what is that
light in the sky?

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:01.080 align:middle line:84%
The golden rays of Valhalla
have entered the world.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.220 align:middle line:84%
And I went to the parking
lot, and it was full.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.640 align:middle line:90%
So I had to park on the street.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.870 align:middle line:84%
And for some reason, there
was no parking for two blocks,

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.430 align:middle line:84%
and I parked my car about
two blocks away in the back

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.320 align:middle line:90%
where I normally don't go.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
And I'm walking towards
the wellness center,

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.940 align:middle line:84%
and there's the boy
that I had talked to,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
who thought I was
the man upstairs.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.950 align:middle line:84%
And he's got a brand new
bike, and he's smiling.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:90%
And he recognizes me.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.520 align:middle line:90%
And he says, hi.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.270 align:middle line:84%
My dad got a job, and this
is a new bike he bought me.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:84%
I'd like you to
meet my mom and dad.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.800 align:middle line:90%
Whoa.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.680 align:middle line:84%
So there they are
standing in the yard,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.430 align:middle line:84%
and they're obviously
happy, and things are well.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And it was a funny
moment, because I

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.230 align:middle line:84%
don't know if he ever told them
or what, but he went up to them

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:51.370 align:middle line:84%
and said, Mom, this
is the man upstairs.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.450 align:middle line:90%
And I said, nice to meet you.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.360 align:middle line:84%
We shook hands,
and I went to work.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.460 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.900 align:middle line:90%
And so what it--

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:07.660 align:middle line:84%
that moment was
humorous and poignant,

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.380 align:middle line:84%
but it was also pivotal for
me, because in that moment when

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.830 align:middle line:84%
I went inside to
find a space where

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:84%
I could set an
intention in motion,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.680 align:middle line:90%
I didn't go to any divinity.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.130 align:middle line:84%
I have a whole plethora,
a cornucopia of deities

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
I can go to in
different traditions,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.750 align:middle line:84%
and I have relationships
in these realms with them

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.440 align:middle line:90%
in my experience.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.330 align:middle line:90%
But I didn't go to any of them.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.940 align:middle line:84%
I went to myself, and I went
to the deepest place in myself.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.830 align:middle line:84%
And so what turned for me
was the power of belief

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.520 align:middle line:90%
versus the power of intention.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.620 align:middle line:84%
And that's what I'm
exploring now in my life.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.200 align:middle line:84%
And that's set another
thread in the tapestry

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.590 align:middle line:84%
is that as humans we
have immense powers

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:56.610 align:middle line:90%
of intentionality.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.570 align:middle line:90%
We don't often claim them.
