00:00:04.418 --> 00:00:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>> What I want to do is to
take us into the first sound

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.510 align:middle line:90%
session.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.590 align:middle line:84%
To start is the movement
into the mystery of Nut,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.260 align:middle line:84%
and we're going to do it by
traveling through the stars.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.650 align:middle line:90%
And what will happen--

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.920 align:middle line:84%
I'll be over here with
the drum if the drum has

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.690 align:middle line:90%
managed to hold its pitch.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And if not, then I'll
use another instrument.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.170 align:middle line:84%
And what I'd like you
to do is to imagine

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.320 align:middle line:90%
yourself floating in the stars.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.037 align:middle line:90%
Now, there's an element to add.

00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:33.620 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who
worked with me before

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.930 align:middle line:84%
know how to go
into spaciousness,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.030 align:middle line:84%
because what I have
found when you look

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.300 align:middle line:84%
at all the comparative
alchemical systems,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.230 align:middle line:84%
they all have a method for
operating in such a way

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.432 align:middle line:84%
that the right
hemisphere comes online.

00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:48.890 align:middle line:84%
They all have
different techniques.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.040 align:middle line:84%
A lot of them use sound,
mantras, various--

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.930 align:middle line:84%
sometimes movement,
but it's all designed

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:84%
to activate the
right hemisphere.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.910 align:middle line:84%
And the right hemisphere is a
master of spatial intelligence.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.950 align:middle line:84%
So when you engage the spatial
qualities of your mind,

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.997 align:middle line:84%
you are switching
on, so to speak,

00:01:05.997 --> 00:01:07.580 align:middle line:84%
the circuits of your
right hemisphere,

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and this is where
the magic occurs.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And techniques
have been developed

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.650 align:middle line:84%
over the centuries and
millennia that are very complex.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.390 align:middle line:84%
But I believe in maximum
efficiency, minimum effort,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.100 align:middle line:84%
which is how the
universe operates.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.940 align:middle line:84%
So here's a shortcut
that works for everyone.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.560 align:middle line:84%
All you do is imagine yourself
surrounded by a large space.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.360 align:middle line:84%
It's not the thought about
being in a big space.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.110 align:middle line:84%
It's the feeling of being
surrounded by a large space.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.720 align:middle line:84%
So you could imagine yourself
at the top of a mountain,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.890 align:middle line:90%
that immense space.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.960 align:middle line:90%
It could be in a big cathedral.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.030 align:middle line:84%
It could be a large
shopping mall.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.160 align:middle line:84%
It could be anything
that has a large space.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.550 align:middle line:84%
It's immaterial what
creates the feeling.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.970 align:middle line:84%
But when you go into the feeling
of being surrounded by space,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.470 align:middle line:84%
your right hemisphere, spatial
intelligence, becomes engaged,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.040 align:middle line:84%
and floating through
the stars requires

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.980 align:middle line:84%
your spatial
intelligence essentially.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.610 align:middle line:84%
Those of you who already
know how to do this--

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.860 align:middle line:84%
or if you start doing
this feeling of space,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and you feel, oh
yeah, I've got it--

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.880 align:middle line:84%
you can add another
layer if you want.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.070 align:middle line:84%
And go to the
realization that there

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.320 align:middle line:84%
is no boundary between
your internal space

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.230 align:middle line:90%
and the external space.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.580 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, your
personal boundary disappears.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.670 align:middle line:84%
And then all you do is
you listen to the sounds,

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.350 align:middle line:90%
like we've been doing yesterday.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:84%
And you just float
through the stars.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.140 align:middle line:84%
And what you're
doing-- the reason

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.870 align:middle line:84%
we're doing this is from
the standpoint of the ka.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.870 align:middle line:84%
The ancient Egyptians
discovered long ago

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.480 align:middle line:84%
that the ka could draw
energies from the stars.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.648 align:middle line:84%
So the ka body draws literally
energies that strengthen it.

00:02:47.648 --> 00:02:48.940 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to be traveling.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.590 align:middle line:84%
Some of you are going to
travel through different parts

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.880 align:middle line:90%
of the star systems.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.240 align:middle line:84%
This is for the
big imaginary box.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.550 align:middle line:84%
If that's too weird
for you, then I

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.870 align:middle line:84%
suggest you just
go to the space--

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.900 align:middle line:90%
this is a waking dream.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.725 align:middle line:84%
And all types of weird things
can happen in dreams, right?

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:05.600 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about it.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.280 align:middle line:90%
It's just a dream.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.640 align:middle line:84%
So don't worry about, oh
my god, I can't really

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.300 align:middle line:90%
be floating out in the nebulae.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:90%
Oh, it's a dream.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.330 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.380 align:middle line:90%
I'll go with it.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.172 align:middle line:90%
So just enjoy the experience.

00:03:17.172 --> 00:03:18.880 align:middle line:84%
I don't know how long
it's going to last,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.920 align:middle line:84%
because this one has
an energy of its own.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.130 align:middle line:84%
And so I'll go over
here, and we'll start.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.320 align:middle line:90%


00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.260 align:middle line:84%
So imagine yourself
surrounded by large space

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.770 align:middle line:90%
as large as you wish it to be.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.840 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to travel
to the stars together.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.450 align:middle line:84%
When your mind wanders, bring
it back to the sense of space.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.230 align:middle line:90%


00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.038 align:middle line:90%
Have a good journey.
