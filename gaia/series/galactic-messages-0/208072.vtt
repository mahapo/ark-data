>>SWARUU: You are a lot more
than only what you see in 3D,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.510 align:middle line:10%
but the matrix wants to convince
you that 3D is all there is.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.990 align:middle line:84%
But deep inside you
know you are multi-D.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.989 align:middle line:10%
>>GOSIA DUSZAK: So
how do you call the 3D

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.700 align:middle line:10%
matrix from your level?

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.450 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%

it's just a frequency

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.690 align:middle line:84%
managing and
suppressing machine.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.090 align:middle line:90%
That's all the matrix is for us.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.210 align:middle line:90%
Suppressor would be the name.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.330 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: And the initial matrix?

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.780 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: That's the
universe, but we also

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.430 align:middle line:84%
understand it as an energy
consciousness matrix.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: OK.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.250 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the
reptilian hack of the matrix.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:90%
What do you mean by that?

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.040 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: The hack is
technological as well as

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.100 align:middle line:90%
mind controlling the people.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.080 align:middle line:84%
The matrix is a real
frequency control.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:84%
The hack controls
the lunar matrix--

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.380 align:middle line:90%
physical one, if you may--

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.470 align:middle line:84%
reading your thoughts and wishes
that are a frequency in itself.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
So the hack works as it's
instructing the people

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.770 align:middle line:90%
to manifest the same things.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:10%
But as they are guided by
another species' interests,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:10%
then what results is not in the
best interests of the people.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.030 align:middle line:84%
The system feeds and
modifies the lunar "real"

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.220 align:middle line:84%
hard one, with the
imposing ideas.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.330 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: So the hack
is technological too.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.630 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was only
purely mind control.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: It's technological,
mental, esoteric,

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.200 align:middle line:90%
and ideocratic.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.460 align:middle line:84%
It's using all the
levels and tricks it can.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.450 align:middle line:10%
They first manipulated the
system with controlling ideas

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:10%
so the matrix would
work for them.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And since, like, 1960-ish,
they physically managed

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.430 align:middle line:84%
to get their hands on
the lunar computers.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:20.380 align:middle line:84%
From 2008 to 2017,
Taygetans were in control.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:28.210 align:middle line:84%
And from 2017 to this date,
the Arcturians-Dieslientiplex

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.990 align:middle line:84%
are the ones in control
of the lunar matrix.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.630 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: What changes did
they do to the computer

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.530 align:middle line:90%
program in the 1960s?

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.370 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: They hardened the
matrix to their convenience,

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.150 align:middle line:84%
making it super
dense and super hard.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.760 align:middle line:84%
Still is, making escaping
nearly impossible.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.280 align:middle line:84%
Hacking also the reincarnation
program or the ether fence

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.060 align:middle line:90%
that surrounds the Earth.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.600 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: So the
matrix, the 3D matrix,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.630 align:middle line:90%
is not necessarily bad or good.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.480 align:middle line:84%
It is just a sort of virtual
game placed upon the 5D world.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.680 align:middle line:84%
It is what it is used for
then that makes it bad?

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.740 align:middle line:90%
The hack made it bad?

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.480 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: It's
the interpretation

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.950 align:middle line:90%
and the use you give it.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.700 align:middle line:90%
It's not bad inherently.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.240 align:middle line:90%
It's now used for a bad purpose.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.040 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: OK.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.390 align:middle line:84%
Let's talk about the hack
as the idea's imposition.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.540 align:middle line:84%
When the matrix was set
up 12,500 years ago,

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.030 align:middle line:84%
the reptiles' technology
was destroyed.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.640 align:middle line:84%
So they started to use the
very mechanics of the matrix

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.350 align:middle line:84%
to entrap the remaining humans
on Earth with their mind

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.490 align:middle line:90%
control.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.830 align:middle line:84%
At which point did
they hack it really?

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.990 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: They did it little by
little with a lot of patience.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:16.600 align:middle line:84%
They can have patience, because
they don't have 90 year or so

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.050 align:middle line:84%
lifespans, but there are
important milestone places.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:31.300 align:middle line:84%
The most important one or
relevant one is 1,400 BC.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.490 align:middle line:84%
King Akhenaten implemented
the monotheistic idea

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.550 align:middle line:84%
on the Egyptian
people, making them

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.040 align:middle line:84%
forget the polytheistic
approach that also included

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.710 align:middle line:90%
the cult of the goddess.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:54.730 align:middle line:84%
It came from Aten,
Atenism, Ra, Horus.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.530 align:middle line:84%
The monotheistic approach
of King Akhenaten

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.530 align:middle line:90%
is solar worshipping.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.300 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian people, who were
very tolerant, by the way,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.020 align:middle line:84%
ended up giving
Akhenaten a coup,

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.540 align:middle line:84%
and they expelled the pharaoh
and his followers from Egypt.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And they walked the
desert for 40 years,

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.590 align:middle line:90%
not knowing where to go.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.390 align:middle line:84%
And in Mount Sinai,
the king Akhenaten

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.010 align:middle line:84%
left them while he
went up to see his kin

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.840 align:middle line:84%
and made a plan with
the remaining reptiles.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.920 align:middle line:90%
Moses, Akhenaten.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.730 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: Oh, wow.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.540 align:middle line:84%
It seems we opened a
big can of worms here.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.280 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: Yes, it is.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.240 align:middle line:84%
But to cut this short,
the expelled Egyptians

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.200 align:middle line:84%
went on to found
places like Rome

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.300 align:middle line:84%
where they are still today,
influencing Etruscan culture

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.800 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.120 align:middle line:84%
And the solar cult is
still in place today.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.740 align:middle line:90%


00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.920 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: I love how you make it
all sound so simple sometimes,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.770 align:middle line:84%
and how it all just
falls right into place.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.870 align:middle line:84%
And so this was one of
the ways for reptiles

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.390 align:middle line:84%
to hack the system, by imposing
their religious monotheistic

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:90%
systems?

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.660 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: Yes.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.280 align:middle line:84%
The system is hacked
using beliefs imposed

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.640 align:middle line:90%
on the people as a hive mind.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.320 align:middle line:84%
They do this with fear, so they
have to design a new religion.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.250 align:middle line:90%
This was the hacking system.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.390 align:middle line:84%
If you have everyone
thinking the same way

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:57.270 align:middle line:84%
and doing the same, you have
them marching in unison.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:04.290 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, you make them
manifest the reality you want.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Next milestone is the
full implementation

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.370 align:middle line:90%
of the Christian theology.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
The concept is to isolate
the people from the divine.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:84%
The whole New
Testament was written

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:23.580 align:middle line:84%
under the orders
of Rome, reptilians

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.310 align:middle line:84%
and their descendants
of the expelled people

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:29.940 align:middle line:84%
from Egypt that
followed Akhenaten.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.650 align:middle line:84%
And it's based on a
stoic, Roman, Egyptian,

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:40.049 align:middle line:84%
and Celtic-Druidic
teachings, mostly.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.770 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: And the Old Testament?

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:49.560 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: The Old Testament
is the history of Atlantis.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:54.570 align:middle line:84%
You must learn how to
read it, as it's coded.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.520 align:middle line:84%
It reads like a fairy tale
for the non-initiated,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:84%
but it takes a new
meaning for those

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.760 align:middle line:90%
who know what to look for.

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.330 align:middle line:84%
For example, each
time you encounter

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:16.080 align:middle line:84%
a name in the Old Testament,
think more of a race of people

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:90%
and not about an individual.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So Adam and Eve are not
people, but races of people.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.910 align:middle line:84%
Think of it that way and
it takes a new meaning.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: Yes.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And Elohim mentioned in the
Bible are the race of beings.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: Yes.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.870 align:middle line:90%
Elohim are the expelled ones.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.550 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: They're reptiles?

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.380 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: Yes, they're reptiles.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.610 align:middle line:84%
But the Elohim are
also a race of people

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.780 align:middle line:84%
who live in the Pleiades
star system, another big can

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.860 align:middle line:90%
of worms.

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:90%
So it is complex.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.490 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: OK.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:03.620 align:middle line:90%
Let's go back to the hack.

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.710 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: The major hack
was the implementation

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.650 align:middle line:90%
of the monster of three horns.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.890 align:middle line:90%
Christianity, Judaism, Islam.

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:18.710 align:middle line:84%
They are variants of the
same lies, just tailored

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.990 align:middle line:90%
for different people.

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:26.270 align:middle line:84%
Then once the people were
subdued with fear, mostly

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:32.690 align:middle line:84%
from religion, they implemented
another three-horned monster,

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.680 align:middle line:90%
this recent, 200, 300 years ago.

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.940 align:middle line:84%
Vatican, religious
control over the people.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:44.930 align:middle line:10%
Washington, military
control over people.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And London, financial
control over people.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:54.260 align:middle line:84%
They have a near global
system of control

00:10:54.260 --> 00:11:01.500 align:middle line:84%
using all governments, nearly
all as puppets, as you know,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.670 align:middle line:84%
where the people believe
entirely one thing

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.430 align:middle line:90%
and they another.

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:11.580 align:middle line:84%
The most important
hack in general

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:17.460 align:middle line:84%
is to be able to implement a
complete false reality based

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:23.460 align:middle line:84%
on impulse ideas of how
everything works, this

00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:26.190 align:middle line:84%
leading to the
people manifesting

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:84%
for them the matrix reality
the negative ones want.

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.290 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: They can't
manifest it themselves?

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.590 align:middle line:84%
They don't have the
same mental power.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:39.730 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: They can.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.900 align:middle line:84%
But if they do so, the
people would be free,

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:49.180 align:middle line:84%
and they wouldn't be able to
exploit them for energy, food.

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:54.010 align:middle line:84%
They are manifesting a reality
where they are the lords

00:11:54.010 --> 00:12:00.110 align:middle line:84%
and the people serve them
in every possible way.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.070 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: So they
manipulate us not only

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.420 align:middle line:84%
so we can help them generate
the reality they want, but also

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.470 align:middle line:84%
to keep us as slaves
so we don't escape.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.850 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: Exactly.

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:84%
And now even after death, they
exploit and manipulate people.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.810 align:middle line:84%
After people die,
they intercept them

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:26.410 align:middle line:84%
in what you call
lower astral or 4D,

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:29.710 align:middle line:84%
and they say that they
haven't been nice enough.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.280 align:middle line:84%
They show them their lives,
recorded technologically.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
After all, it's a matrix,
and all is recorded.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.020 align:middle line:84%
They insist that
they must pay karma,

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.650 align:middle line:84%
and their people
are reincarnated.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:48.940 align:middle line:84%
They don't go back to
source, because that

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:51.430 align:middle line:90%
is what they expect to see.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:55.900 align:middle line:84%
Then heaven or hell
is the result of guilt

00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:01.130 align:middle line:84%
or what a person firmly
believes he deserves.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.710 align:middle line:84%
And it is the very person
that is generating that.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So everything is due to the
mental control or perception

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.230 align:middle line:90%
that each soul has.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.970 align:middle line:84%
But this is easily
overcome with the knowledge

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:23.960 align:middle line:84%
that you are going wherever
you have to go by right.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.490 align:middle line:84%
It is the idea of
blame, of karma,

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.250 align:middle line:84%
which is nothing more
than a religious belief

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:90%
that forces souls to return.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: Any other important
milestones of the hack?

00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:41.840 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: It's very gradual.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.620 align:middle line:10%
Other milestones I would
include each time they

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:51.950 align:middle line:10%
have managed to invade other
people like Native Americans,

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:55.520 align:middle line:10%
Africans, or other cultures.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:59.870 align:middle line:10%
But the biggest
matrix-hacking milestones

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.670 align:middle line:10%
are religious or technological,
like the invention

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.410 align:middle line:10%
of mass media via
radio and television

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:14.090 align:middle line:10%
where they have people there
looking and being indoctrinated

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:19.070 align:middle line:10%
all the time into thinking
the way they should.

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:23.330 align:middle line:84%
Technological milestones
are first the mass media

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.720 align:middle line:84%
and the brain-controlled
mind control ones

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
using microwaves
and hard technology.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:37.490 align:middle line:84%
But also, the development of
space travel and real working

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:41.390 align:middle line:84%
starships implemented
by the SSP,

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:46.760 align:middle line:84%
developed mostly by the
reptilians, as nearly all

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:52.310 align:middle line:84%
their technology was destroyed
since the great flood pole

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:58.700 align:middle line:90%
shift, this after 1947 mostly.

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:02.450 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: What about having
to work as a controlling

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.910 align:middle line:90%
and dumbing mechanism?

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.900 align:middle line:84%
I feel it is a very important
concept here that really

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.150 align:middle line:90%
limits people's expansion.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:14.630 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the concept
of having to work

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.720 align:middle line:84%
so we can survive so
we don't have time

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.360 align:middle line:90%
to devote to self-exploration.

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:90%
We are set on the survival mode.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.360 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: Yes.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.320 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.910 align:middle line:84%
That's all part of the
belief system implemented

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:38.060 align:middle line:84%
by using brainwash main control,
because the people simply

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:84%
don't think that there
is another way to live.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.730 align:middle line:84%
They are always thinking
that life is hard,

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:52.710 align:middle line:84%
so working and fighting
is a noble thing to do.

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:90%
They don't see any other option.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.790 align:middle line:90%
No other reality.

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.330 align:middle line:84%
And what do people do
when they get home, tired?

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:05.570 align:middle line:84%
They watch television
where they are being

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.110 align:middle line:90%
mind controlled even more.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: Yes, exactly.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:90%
You put it so well.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.030 align:middle line:84%
Working and fighting
is something noble.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.930 align:middle line:90%
Exactly.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:90%
They are tricked.

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.480 align:middle line:90%
It's nonsense.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.870 align:middle line:84%
The reptiles hacked it
so well that they make

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:24.410 align:middle line:90%
the slaves feel like heroes.

00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: And you
are absolutely right.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.580 align:middle line:84%
No better slave than the
one who doesn't think he is.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.790 align:middle line:90%


00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:37.735 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: How do you know so much
about us here, being up there?

00:16:37.735 --> 00:16:40.360 align:middle line:90%


00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: We have been studying
Earth since 1952 directly,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and we have a lot of data
from older expeditions,

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:55.150 align:middle line:84%
although Taygetans came
to Earth since 1919.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.210 align:middle line:10%
In recent times, of course.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: I understand.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm wondering how
come, such good programmers

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
that you are, you let them
hack the lunar matrix systems.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:84%
There were no
preventive measures?

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.960 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: Simple
and straight answer.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.800 align:middle line:90%
It was wrongly left unattended.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: You mean
by the Federation?

00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.970 align:middle line:90%
Did they just leave?

00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: Yes.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.760 align:middle line:84%
It was weak and hurt
with many losses.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:33.290 align:middle line:84%
The solar system was a mess back
then because of the destruction

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.090 align:middle line:90%
of Tiamat.

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:90%
It was left unattended.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.060 align:middle line:90%
This was wrong.

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, but we are
not perfect beings.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.180 align:middle line:90%
We are people.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.820 align:middle line:90%
We do make mistakes.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:53.860 align:middle line:84%
That's also why we are here,
to do their cleaning up.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:55.180 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: No problem, Swaruu.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.750 align:middle line:90%
How long was it left alone for?

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:06.190 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: 12,500
years, until 2008.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:11.230 align:middle line:84%
But what I said above was
unattending the matrix computer

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:12.160 align:middle line:90%
system.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.600 align:middle line:84%
Some individual people,
Taygetans and other races,

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:21.770 align:middle line:84%
have always been around
in some way or another.

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:26.710 align:middle line:84%
And now, as of now,
countless species

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.050 align:middle line:90%
are helping from the inside.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.070 align:middle line:90%
Starseeds too.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:38.460 align:middle line:84%
Humans only see time as a
one-lane road like those

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:43.020 align:middle line:84%
in the countryside, where if a
vehicle drives against another

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.050 align:middle line:84%
one approaching from
the opposite direction,

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:51.420 align:middle line:84%
both must very carefully move
to the side to let another one

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:57.780 align:middle line:84%
pass, because two cars cannot
physically fit on the same

00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:59.700 align:middle line:90%
asphalt road.

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:05.190 align:middle line:84%
So they think that things
are like that everywhere.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:09.180 align:middle line:84%
As I perceive time
using the same analogy,

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:12.720 align:middle line:84%
it is like a highway
with eight lanes,

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.770 align:middle line:84%
but also with levels
one above the other

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:22.620 align:middle line:84%
where a car can not only change
lanes to the one it wants,

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.940 align:middle line:84%
left and right, but
up and down too.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.590 align:middle line:90%
Left and right, back and forth.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:31.740 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:90%
Another analogy.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:37.110 align:middle line:90%
Humans see time as a line.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:40.740 align:middle line:84%
The arrow of time,
as they describe it.

00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.370 align:middle line:84%
I see a bubble
within another bubble

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:51.100 align:middle line:84%
within another bubble to
infinity and eternal expansion.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.320 align:middle line:84%
So I don't just see
a series of events

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.680 align:middle line:84%
as a sequential
line in the way how

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.980 align:middle line:84%
people want me to explain
to them as what is brewing

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.010 align:middle line:90%
in the future on a single line.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:10.650 align:middle line:84%
But I see it as events that
change continuously, jump

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:15.780 align:middle line:84%
between one another and
influence each other.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:21.870 align:middle line:84%
As in this last image, time
expands in any direction, one

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and each line being
only a sequence

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.050 align:middle line:84%
of events in particular
that is observed

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:90%
as it progresses to develop.

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:36.810 align:middle line:84%
Not necessarily forward in time,
also receding like a vessel

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
that has been broken and you
see how it is being rebuilt.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.960 align:middle line:84%
Like a sheet of paper
that is unburning.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:51.400 align:middle line:84%
Although humans see this as
an impossibility and something

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:55.240 align:middle line:84%
that violates the laws
of thermodynamics,

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.150 align:middle line:90%
it is not so from other angles.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:03.070 align:middle line:84%
Only from the limited
time arrow that they see.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:06.650 align:middle line:84%
Each red point is
the nexus point,

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:11.290 align:middle line:84%
which is where the energy and
events of a series of lines

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:16.100 align:middle line:84%
or a line converge
and influence others.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:19.750 align:middle line:84%
So from any point,
you have the influence

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:24.860 align:middle line:84%
of other points being that,
for example, the past, present,

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:31.480 align:middle line:84%
and future are all intertwined
and as a single whole, a unit,

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.610 align:middle line:84%
being temporarily animated
only by where the attention is

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.120 align:middle line:90%
placed and at will.

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:84%
I see a chain of events,
but I see similar chains

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:49.450 align:middle line:84%
with their own outcomes,
all equally valid,

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:55.850 align:middle line:84%
all simultaneously, constantly
influencing each other.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:22:00.830 align:middle line:84%
What is understood on Earth as
parallel universes or timelines

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.810 align:middle line:90%
is basically garbage.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:84%
They denote limitation and
isolation from each other,

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:15.050 align:middle line:84%
while it is a whole that works
together and beyond all time.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:18.170 align:middle line:84%
It is each individual
who animates

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:21.830 align:middle line:90%
everything in a specific way.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:25.010 align:middle line:84%
When it comes to
geometric shapes,

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:31.850 align:middle line:84%
time is an ever-expanding scalar
bubble, both already expanded

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.730 align:middle line:90%
and at the same time not.

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:40.130 align:middle line:84%
And simultaneously, it also
contracts without contradicting

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:90%
itself in its energy dynamics.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.850 align:middle line:84%
Toroid within
toroid within toroid

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
with the mind at the
center or motor of it.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:58.850 align:middle line:84%
So with that in mind, what I
see is that on the eight-lane

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:03.740 align:middle line:84%
and eight-level super
highway, what will come

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.850 align:middle line:84%
is more confinements and more
restrictions, progressively

00:23:07.850 --> 00:23:08.750 align:middle line:90%
tighter.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.030 align:middle line:90%
Economies will collapse.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.280 align:middle line:84%
People will panic
and attack those

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.530 align:middle line:90%
who don't follow the rules.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:21.470 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on humans,
on what they manifest,

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:26.030 align:middle line:84%
as I have been saying, and
I have tired of saying.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is set in stone.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:34.190 align:middle line:84%
Everything I describe
above is not deterministic.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:37.790 align:middle line:84%
They are in control
of everything.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:41.390 align:middle line:84%
And I mean the
people themselves.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.760 align:middle line:10%
I know it doesn't look
like that from there,

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.300 align:middle line:10%
from the surface and from the
point of view of the family who

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.300 align:middle line:10%
will be taken out of their
house because they cannot pay

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:55.160 align:middle line:10%
the mortgage, because
that's what 3D is all about,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.820 align:middle line:10%
giving your free will up
for a collective experience.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.580 align:middle line:10%
And even so with
what little you have

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:08.130 align:middle line:10%
left to get ahead as a soul
if not as a body biology.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:11.420 align:middle line:84%
So in this case,
as in any other,

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.630 align:middle line:84%
the only thing
that matters is how

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:18.440 align:middle line:90%
you are inside, what you think.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Your values, morals, ethics,
and level of consciousness

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:84%
always changing,
always expanding,

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.820 align:middle line:84%
leaving behind what
does not serve you

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:37.160 align:middle line:84%
without any attachments,
because those slow you down.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:90%
Values on Earth are reversed.

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.750 align:middle line:84%
What doesn't matter matters,
and what really matters

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.020 align:middle line:90%
doesn't, money and material.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Bodily satisfaction
is what matters.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:55.430 align:middle line:84%
Immediate gratification with
a low level of consciousness,

00:24:55.430 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:84%
materialistic and deterministic,
that's what matters there.

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:05.090 align:middle line:84%
The mind, the spirit, what you
take with you when you die,

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.480 align:middle line:84%
that does not
matter, just as life

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:12.110 align:middle line:84%
itself does not matter,
neither that of people,

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:16.310 align:middle line:84%
nor that of animals,
nor that of plants.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Ethics, morals, consciousness
does not matter.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:22.190 align:middle line:90%
Only obeying the masters.

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:84%
And that is where
the human error lies.

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:27.930 align:middle line:90%
That brings their destruction.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:32.090 align:middle line:84%
But the key is not to
defeat the big corporations

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:36.890 align:middle line:84%
or the villains, because
villains only have power

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.800 align:middle line:84%
because the same
people give it to them.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:45.050 align:middle line:84%
The key is not politicians
then realizing progressively

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:49.760 align:middle line:84%
but very quickly that this
is all a hoax, that nothing

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.260 align:middle line:90%
is happening.

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:55.940 align:middle line:84%
Yet this always comes
at great cost to people.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Great cost, because
it depends on them

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.570 align:middle line:84%
realizing en masse that
they are being manipulated.

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:07.730 align:middle line:84%
And this causes people
to react with protests,

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:13.500 align:middle line:84%
and this follows with subsequent
government retaliation.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.970 align:middle line:84%
So all progress
towards the positive

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:20.600 align:middle line:84%
will bring a strong reaction
in people confronting

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.970 align:middle line:84%
each other because
of the very confusion

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:25.370 align:middle line:84%
to which they are
being subjected.

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:30.740 align:middle line:84%
In almost all timelines--
let's say 50 out of 64,

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.140 align:middle line:90%
not being able to be precise--

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:38.090 align:middle line:84%
the cabal does not achieve its
primary purpose or objective

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:84%
in the long run, while they
do achieve it temporarily.

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:47.120 align:middle line:90%
But broken shoes is the key.

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.470 align:middle line:10%
What every little person
out there feeling like trash

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:57.920 align:middle line:10%
can do by learning to use a
simple two-letter word, no.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.920 align:middle line:84%
Everything that
happens is a reflection

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:90%
of the mind of broken shoes.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:09.320 align:middle line:84%
They are the creators, not
the cabal, not the Federation.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Those are reflections
of their psyche.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:84%
They are gods, but
they want to play

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.600 align:middle line:90%
that, whatever it's called.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.580 align:middle line:84%
And that is what they
have and will have.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:26.660 align:middle line:84%
Nothing and no one can
stop what will happen.

00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:31.370 align:middle line:84%
Only them, because
it comes out of them.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:84%
They are the cause
and the solution.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:90%
