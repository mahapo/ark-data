[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:43.090 align:middle line:90%


00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.920 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, Swaruu.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.350 align:middle line:10%
Today we will talk
about what you

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.110 align:middle line:10%
would call initial or original
matrix, the kind of matrix

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.190 align:middle line:10%
you are in, too, from
what I understand.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.350 align:middle line:84%
But first, how would
you define matrix

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
from your perspective
in general terms?

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, Gosia.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.460 align:middle line:10%
Matrix, as in a set of rules
within a contained game,

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.110 align:middle line:10%
like a video game
with set rules,

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.085 align:middle line:10%
because that's what it is,
just like in your movie

00:01:29.085 --> 00:01:29.885 align:middle line:10%
"The Matrix."

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:32.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.740 align:middle line:90%
There is more matrix out here.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:45.160 align:middle line:84%
But Earth is a matrix inside a
matrix, a dream within a dream,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.080 align:middle line:84%
and I am the one
shaking you to wake up.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.970 align:middle line:90%
Nothing there exists.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.190 align:middle line:90%
It's all in your mind.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.880 align:middle line:84%
It's all your perception
and the interpretation

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.330 align:middle line:90%
you are giving that perception.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.479 align:middle line:84%
And you interpret
perception with the set

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.130 align:middle line:84%
of ideas the 3D matrix
has imposed on you,

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.550 align:middle line:90%
but it's all perception.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.970 align:middle line:84%
In the instant you decide
something is real, then it is.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.360 align:middle line:90%
Your experience is real.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.510 align:middle line:84%
Your experiences
there or anywhere else

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.710 align:middle line:90%
is reality to you.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.030 align:middle line:90%
You decide.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.870 align:middle line:84%
There are multiple
realities, not only one.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.000 align:middle line:90%
It's the consciousness behind--

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.430 align:middle line:90%
that is, having the experience--

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.460 align:middle line:84%
the one who decides what
is real and what is not.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.070 align:middle line:84%
But as with a video game,
the game and the action in it

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.680 align:middle line:90%
is not real.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.200 align:middle line:84%
But your experience
in the game is real.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.390 align:middle line:84%
There is no world,
no matter, as such.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.550 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a body.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.730 align:middle line:84%
All you are is
spirit, and the rest

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.440 align:middle line:84%
is all you're making
to have an experience.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.040 align:middle line:90%
There is no matter.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.065 align:middle line:90%
It's all mind.

00:03:26.065 --> 00:03:31.380 align:middle line:90%


00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.820 align:middle line:84%
>> I have always sensed that the
reality that is spread around

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:90%
me is a sort of a projection.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.930 align:middle line:84%
And there is a part within
me screaming to be unplugged,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.150 align:middle line:90%
beamed up.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.490 align:middle line:84%
I have always sensed
the frustration

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.970 align:middle line:84%
of being trapped within
the imposed limits

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.910 align:middle line:84%
of physical
perception of things.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.670 align:middle line:90%
For example, a lamp.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:84%
Why am I perceiving it in this
way, with this shape and form?

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
I know it doesn't
only exist this way,

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.000 align:middle line:84%
but it's like there is something
in me, some program, which

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.940 align:middle line:84%
is hard to escape,
that forces me

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.310 align:middle line:84%
to interact with the lamp
in the form of a lamp.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.430 align:middle line:84%
I feel trapped
within this denseness

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.960 align:middle line:84%
of having to perceive things
and objects only in one way.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.200 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.940 align:middle line:84%
I feel there has been a
certain decoder of reality

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.480 align:middle line:84%
so we can decode it in
this way and not the other.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.300 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And that's part of the
initial matrix, too.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.100 align:middle line:84%
That's because you
have an agreement

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.600 align:middle line:84%
to see that lump of
potential energy as a lamp.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:90%
But it's all potential energy.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.010 align:middle line:84%
If you are not in that room
and there is no one else in it,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:09.410 align:middle line:84%
the lamp is only potential
energy and not a lamp.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.460 align:middle line:90%
Only you can give it a meaning.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.680 align:middle line:84%
And, yes, in a 3D matrix,
you have been imposed.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.320 align:middle line:84%
You have been
programmed with a set

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.480 align:middle line:84%
of beliefs that limit what you
manifest and what you perceive.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.410 align:middle line:84%
The way you interpret
that potential energy,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.390 align:middle line:84%
that imposition is the
matrix, like the written code

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.790 align:middle line:84%
in the video game that has a
law that will impose on you that

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.100 align:middle line:90%
you cannot walk through walls.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.890 align:middle line:84%
>> But that perception of a lamp
as a lamp is a group perception

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.370 align:middle line:84%
We all perceive it
in the same way.

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.920 align:middle line:84%
That's why I feel it was
imposed on a mass level.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.480 align:middle line:84%
That agreement to see the
lump of energy as a lamp

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.010 align:middle line:90%
is a certain code.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.060 align:middle line:84%
We have been led to
perceive it as a lamp.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.800 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, precisely.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.480 align:middle line:84%
That's the hive mind
I was talking about.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.960 align:middle line:10%
Time, for example,
is also an agreement

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.210 align:middle line:10%
to see it the same way.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And the clock or a
watch is the metronome

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.470 align:middle line:84%
that will keep all the people
manifesting that reality

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.860 align:middle line:90%
in unison, at the correct time.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.930 align:middle line:84%
Time and the clock is your
metronome or your conductor.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:44.610 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.950 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so who is
a code programmer?

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.540 align:middle line:90%
>> You are.

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:55.040 align:middle line:84%
>> I am the programmer
of the matrix?

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.650 align:middle line:84%
I understand you are referring
to the initial matrix

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.210 align:middle line:90%
here, too, in general.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.420 align:middle line:90%
I programmed it upon myself?

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.380 align:middle line:84%
>> You and the other
fractals of yourself there.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you have, to
have an experience.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.830 align:middle line:90%
But you are not a victim.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.480 align:middle line:10%
You went in there knowingly
and with full purpose

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.790 align:middle line:10%
and with a plan.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:84%
You program and change
the matrix at will

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:28.130 align:middle line:84%
using your emotions
and your desires.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.730 align:middle line:84%
It changes as it
senses you and what

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.690 align:middle line:84%
you want based on your
focused attention that

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.970 align:middle line:90%
comes from your intention.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.290 align:middle line:84%
>> But if I programmed the
matrix for the experience

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.400 align:middle line:84%
of it, why then do I
need to wake myself up?

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.860 align:middle line:84%
I designed it for
myself, so what's

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:55.050 align:middle line:90%
the purpose of waking up now?

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.610 align:middle line:84%
>> So you can manifest what you
want and not what others have

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.400 align:middle line:90%
hijacked into your mind.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.760 align:middle line:10%
A lot of what you are
programming into the matrix

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.430 align:middle line:10%
is not your real intention.

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:14.680 align:middle line:84%
It's the organ's intention,
the hive-imposed mind.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Aren't they a part of
the reality of myself, too?

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.540 align:middle line:84%
In other words, maybe
I manifested them also.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, if I, in
the highest sense,

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:30.475 align:middle line:84%
am all that there is, then
are they part of me, too?

00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:33.640 align:middle line:90%


00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.919 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, you did, and then
that's by intention as you went

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:43.360 align:middle line:84%
in in full knowledge of what
you would experience there.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And then this ties to the
prime directive again.

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:53.830 align:middle line:84%
We cannot interfere if you are
having the experience you want.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.880 align:middle line:84%
So the negative aspects of
the world, in some level,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.580 align:middle line:90%
is of your own doing.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.315 align:middle line:84%
But you forgot that, so
you may need a little push

00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:06.115 align:middle line:90%
in your game.

00:09:06.115 --> 00:09:08.970 align:middle line:90%


00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.660 align:middle line:84%
>> If that is so, then it
becomes complicated indeed

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:17.130 align:middle line:84%
because it becomes hard to know
which part of our experience

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.630 align:middle line:84%
here is really self-imposed
by ourselves programming us

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.680 align:middle line:84%
to have this experience of
limitation and which part are

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.080 align:middle line:90%
the hijackers.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And I am beginning to understand
the hard decisions and dilemmas

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.060 align:middle line:90%
of prime directive.

00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:38.750 align:middle line:84%
>> All the negative aspects
and events in the world--

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:42.890 align:middle line:84%
wars and weather events,
catastrophes, volcanoes,

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:45.080 align:middle line:90%
and tsunamis--

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.430 align:middle line:84%
are an exteriorized
matrix-read reflection

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:55.390 align:middle line:84%
of what the real people there
have manifested for themselves.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:58.240 align:middle line:84%
What you see
outside in the world

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.810 align:middle line:84%
is a direct reflection
of the inner world

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.450 align:middle line:90%
in the psyche of the people.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:09.950 align:middle line:84%
And you must be aligned with
your so-called higher self

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.820 align:middle line:84%
to understand what
is imposed and what

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:18.290 align:middle line:90%
is you there to experience.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.540 align:middle line:84%
And I am glad you
are understanding.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:23.270 align:middle line:84%
As you can see, not
everyone is equipped

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.500 align:middle line:84%
to even start to understand
the complexities of why

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.454 align:middle line:90%
of the prime directive.

00:10:29.454 --> 00:10:38.170 align:middle line:90%


00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, I am still trying
to understand, though.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:48.130 align:middle line:10%
Did we impose Archons on
ourselves to experience them,

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:54.280 align:middle line:10%
or are they hijackers that
went against our will?

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.420 align:middle line:10%
Because if the
second is true, we

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.810 align:middle line:10%
are sleeping not
due to our own will.

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:07.120 align:middle line:10%
In this case, it makes
sense trying to wake us up.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.430 align:middle line:10%
>> Again, both
parts are correct.

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:16.580 align:middle line:10%
That's another problem
we face, particularly me,

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.700 align:middle line:10%
that if something
is false, it doesn't

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.850 align:middle line:10%
mean the other is correct.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.280 align:middle line:84%
And there may be two
contradicting correct

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.685 align:middle line:84%
explanations and all the
combinations in between.

00:11:28.685 --> 00:11:31.270 align:middle line:90%


00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.990 align:middle line:90%
Some people have been hijacked.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Others go in to experience
what it is like to be hijacked.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.630 align:middle line:10%
Some feel that what they
wanted in their experience

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:48.220 align:middle line:10%
has been taken from them.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Others are there to experience
lack and restriction

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:56.490 align:middle line:84%
because only then can they
understand and appreciate

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.190 align:middle line:90%
abundance.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:84%
Many, not all, die there
only to awaken here

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:08.490 align:middle line:84%
in another body that
was literally asleep,

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:14.820 align:middle line:84%
in cryo sleep or hyper
sleep, especially star seeds.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.340 align:middle line:84%
Others go back to
source directly.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:19.860 align:middle line:90%


00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Are you part of
the matrix, too?

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you also see
lamps, shoes, for example.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.260 align:middle line:84%
We are perceiving them
all in the same way.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:34.470 align:middle line:90%


00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>> As I said you are in
a matrix inside a matrix,

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.660 align:middle line:90%
a dream inside a dream.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.080 align:middle line:84%
I see shoes and I
see lamps as well.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.140 align:middle line:84%
We both had an
agreement to see them

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.805 align:middle line:90%
this way from the other side.

00:12:50.805 --> 00:12:53.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So you are in a higher
layer of the matrix?

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:59.660 align:middle line:90%
>> That's correct.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:04.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So seeing lamps and shoes is
still being in a matrix then,

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.870 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:11.200 align:middle line:84%
Because I feel they don't
exist in that way only.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.720 align:middle line:84%
My perception of that
potential energy,

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.220 align:middle line:84%
as you said, as lamps and
shoes, has been imposed--

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:23.790 align:middle line:84%
by myself or
Archons, but imposed.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.900 align:middle line:84%
So, by matrix, are
you referring only

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.360 align:middle line:84%
to what the negatives
have imposed

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.500 align:middle line:84%
on us, hacking the
program, or is it

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:37.640 align:middle line:84%
any perception of objects
around, like lamps, shoes, et

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:39.290 align:middle line:90%
cetera?

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:43.610 align:middle line:84%
Because that would be a positive
or neutral matrix but still

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.690 align:middle line:90%
matrix, no?

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Since the lamps and shoes
are just lumps of energy,

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.370 align:middle line:84%
and we decode them
as lamps and shoes.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:55.940 align:middle line:84%
I feel now that the
matrix is any type

00:13:55.940 --> 00:14:00.410 align:middle line:84%
of decodification mechanism
of energy into objects,

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.160 align:middle line:90%
into matter.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.960 align:middle line:84%
I don't know if I'm
right about that.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:08.000 align:middle line:84%
But then, here, matrix
is also perceived

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.380 align:middle line:84%
as something negative, as the
program of the negative ones.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:84%
So which matrix are
you referring to when

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:90%
you say we are in the matrix?

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:90%


00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.820 align:middle line:90%
>> You are in both.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:31.640 align:middle line:84%
Let's say that as you're in the
matrix inside another matrix,

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.260 align:middle line:84%
some things belong to the
false matrix and the others

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:40.790 align:middle line:90%
to the real or initial matrix.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:45.320 align:middle line:84%
This means that even if you
are not aware of those things,

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:49.370 align:middle line:84%
they are still there,
and they may affect you.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.680 align:middle line:84%
The Archons, for
example, they are

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.560 align:middle line:84%
part of the old
matrix, the first one,

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:59.060 align:middle line:84%
and they are aware
of both matrices.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
So they exploit that,
leeching onto you

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.060 align:middle line:84%
like a ferric,
blood-sucking leech.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:10.650 align:middle line:84%
But, yes, normally, I am
referring to it as negative.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:84%
But, then again,
that would depend

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.680 align:middle line:84%
on you and your personal
interpretation--

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:22.350 align:middle line:84%
if something is good or not,
beneficial to you or not.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:27.700 align:middle line:84%
False or not false,
the experience is real,

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.640 align:middle line:90%
and that's what is important.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:38.630 align:middle line:10%
>> OK, so if we are both in the,
let's call it, initial matrix,

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.980 align:middle line:10%
so that is why if I see a
dog, you will see also a dog.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.290 align:middle line:84%
We will both
perceive that energy

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.770 align:middle line:84%
as a dog, with the same
color and everything, right?

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:51.370 align:middle line:90%


00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:57.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because we have an
agreement to see it that way.

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:02.410 align:middle line:84%
But apart from that, things
do change with dog between you

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
and I. You see a
pet and a companion.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.410 align:middle line:84%
Taygetans will see
dangerous, wild animal.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:16.330 align:middle line:84%
Because in Taygeta, dogs
are only wild animals.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.090 align:middle line:84%
There are no dogs
as you know them,

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:24.250 align:middle line:84%
only coyote, wolves, and
other variants of canines

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:28.390 align:middle line:90%
that you don't have on Earth.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.180 align:middle line:84%
To have a dog as
a pet in Taygeta

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.305 align:middle line:84%
is as rare as for humans
to have a pet leopard.

00:16:35.305 --> 00:16:38.300 align:middle line:90%


00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Very interesting and strange
for me you don't have dogs

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:90%
as pets.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, but coming back
to the subject,

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:50.390 align:middle line:84%
yes, we are both
programmed by ourselves

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:55.280 align:middle line:84%
to decode the dog in a certain
way and see it in front of us

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.810 align:middle line:90%
in a certain way.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:17:01.070 align:middle line:84%
So that agreement is a part
of the initial matrix, yes?

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.800 align:middle line:84%
It is an agreement
with ourselves

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.940 align:middle line:90%
from the higher level.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.810 align:middle line:90%


00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, both, the
matrix and ourselves.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.480 align:middle line:84%
But, for example, you
don't decode Moghyay.

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.069 align:middle line:90%
You don't know what it is--

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.960 align:middle line:90%
or do you?

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.730 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.339 align:middle line:84%
>> So I come and
tell you what it is,

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:30.320 align:middle line:84%
then we are making an agreement
about how we both should see

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.820 align:middle line:90%
Moghyay.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
The old matrix
does have influence

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:36.680 align:middle line:90%
over the new, false one.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:39.500 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:41.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Very fascinating for me.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.630 align:middle line:84%
I am sensing some strange
overlaying of matrices here.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.550 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Being incarnated
is like a game,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and it includes all what you
would consider the material

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.230 align:middle line:90%
universe-- one matrix.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:59.490 align:middle line:90%
Let me give you an example.

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:03.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.620 align:middle line:90%
We remember who we were before--

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:11.540 align:middle line:84%
our past two or three
lives, at least.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.630 align:middle line:10%
Now, whenever we
die, we always end up

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.680 align:middle line:10%
in the same afterlife place.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.360 align:middle line:84%
We may go jumping
stars in a ship.

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.770 align:middle line:84%
We may go through wormholes
and travel very, very far

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.870 align:middle line:90%
from home--

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:84%
so far we finally get
lost in deep space.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:31.700 align:middle line:90%
We die there.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:37.580 align:middle line:84%
And, surprise, we end up
again in the same afterlife,

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.550 align:middle line:84%
planning to reincarnate
in Taygeta again.

00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:43.850 align:middle line:90%
So why is this?

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:49.130 align:middle line:84%
The whole universe is a matrix
made of perceptual agreement.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.650 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So your universe is
also a part of the matrix?

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.360 align:middle line:84%
Maybe that's why we feel
such nostalgia as always,

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:90%
me and you.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.705 align:middle line:84%
We feel we are not
in the real world.

00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:06.360 align:middle line:90%


00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, we are all
part of that matrix.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.015 align:middle line:84%
That's why we have
similar bodies.

00:19:12.015 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:90%


00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:21.300 align:middle line:84%
But the matrix on Earth
is one step deeper,

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:26.505 align:middle line:84%
matrix inside matrix, but we
are all from somewhere else.

00:19:26.505 --> 00:19:29.470 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.420 align:middle line:90%
>> So what happened?

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.390 align:middle line:84%
We imposed on ourselves
a matrix for us all?

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:36.000 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:41.430 align:middle line:84%
It's said that we did this in
order to have an experience.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:43.950 align:middle line:90%


00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.780 align:middle line:90%
>> Who did, exactly?

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:46.920 align:middle line:90%
>> You again.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.480 align:middle line:90%
You made the universe.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.190 align:middle line:84%
You, Gosia, from
your point of view.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.500 align:middle line:90%
I made it from mine.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:20:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Robert's cat made it
from his point of view.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:05.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but we all share similar
objects in our universes-- you,

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.130 align:middle line:90%
me, and Robert's cat--

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.600 align:middle line:84%
so we have a common thread
there, common programming.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.255 align:middle line:84%
Is it because we
are all one, anyway?

00:20:15.255 --> 00:20:17.760 align:middle line:90%


00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, because we perceive it
all under the same agreement.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:27.930 align:middle line:84%
But we haven't agreed
about Moghyay yet.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:32.910 align:middle line:84%
You pick up agreements as you
evolve lifetime after lifetime,

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:38.460 align:middle line:84%
from simpler organisms to more
complex ones, all accumulating

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.710 align:middle line:90%
experience.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.230 align:middle line:84%
The reason that
we all agree today

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:49.480 align:middle line:84%
how we see things, what
they are, even Moghyays,

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:54.910 align:middle line:84%
is because in the end, we don't
exist as separate entities.

00:20:54.910 --> 00:20:57.830 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:01.520 align:middle line:84%
We are all interconnected
in consciousness.

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.180 align:middle line:90%
We are literally all one being.

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.720 align:middle line:84%
We share ideas
because we are one.

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:90%
>> Exactly.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.920 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we coded ourselves
to perceive things

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:20.550 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way from the
higher level of the matrix.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:24.460 align:middle line:84%
If not, one person would see
a cat and the other one a frog

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.260 align:middle line:90%
in the same place.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:90%


00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:32.970 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that we all see the
same thing points to the fact

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.160 align:middle line:90%
that we are truly one.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness programmed
itself to decode things

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.210 align:middle line:84%
in a certain way, and we
go around decoding them

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:46.590 align:middle line:84%
that way because it is all
us, all of us same being.

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:49.110 align:middle line:90%
Am I correct?

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:51.710 align:middle line:90%
>> You are perfectly correct.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:52.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Amazing.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:57.470 align:middle line:84%
But, if so, if we imposed
the whole initial matrix

00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:02.710 align:middle line:84%
on ourselves, then
why fight anything

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.750 align:middle line:90%
that we perceive as negative?

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:09.550 align:middle line:84%
It's all a game of the highest
matrix operator, ourselves.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.780 align:middle line:90%
Just thinking out loud.

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:18.220 align:middle line:84%
It's ultimately all
an external reflection

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:22.445 align:middle line:84%
of an inner conflict based
on the idea of duality

00:22:22.445 --> 00:22:23.245 align:middle line:90%
or contrast.

00:22:23.245 --> 00:22:33.830 align:middle line:90%


00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:37.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Why do you have Reptilians?

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.400 align:middle line:84%
Are they the reflection
of some inner conflicts

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:43.840 align:middle line:90%
in your universe, too?

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>> Reptilians are part of
an inner conflict, yes.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And they exist on
Earth and anywhere else

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:53.770 align:middle line:90%
because they are also us.

00:22:53.770 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:90%
They are also you.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:01.450 align:middle line:84%
If Reptilians exist-- because
after all the data you've seen

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:06.000 align:middle line:84%
you know they have to be there
must be there and knowing that

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.840 align:middle line:84%
this universe is
based on duality--

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.100 align:middle line:84%
then as a consequence of the
reptilians' existence, then

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.800 align:middle line:90%
the opposite must also exist.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:20.420 align:middle line:90%
Bad alien, good alien.

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:24.650 align:middle line:84%
That can be also used as an
argument about our existence,

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:26.630 align:middle line:90%
the Taygetans.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:30.230 align:middle line:84%
We do consider ourselves
to be the opposites

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:84%
of the Reptilians,
their nemesis.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.100 align:middle line:90%
>> I understand.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.180 align:middle line:84%
OK, when we talked
about the 3D matrix,

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.790 align:middle line:84%
you mentioned that
some concepts,

00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:46.430 align:middle line:84%
like law of
attraction, are still

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.700 align:middle line:90%
present in that original matrix.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:52.145 align:middle line:84%
Can you expand on that
a bit more, please?

00:23:52.145 --> 00:23:54.770 align:middle line:90%


00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:58.760 align:middle line:84%
>> It's the reflection of an
intention from the spiritual

00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.750 align:middle line:90%
world.

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.810 align:middle line:90%
It manifests first as energy.

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:06.510 align:middle line:84%
Then, by means of
an attention focus,

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:10.230 align:middle line:84%
it becomes something
with matter.

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:14.030 align:middle line:84%
It's the original matrix,
so it has no technology

00:24:14.030 --> 00:24:16.340 align:middle line:90%
as such controlling it.

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:20.570 align:middle line:84%
It was set up by
us all, real souls,

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:27.290 align:middle line:84%
as a necessity to expand even
with an illusion of separation.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:30.350 align:middle line:10%
The key concept here
is to understand

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.110 align:middle line:10%
how the attention
of consciousness

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:36.920 align:middle line:10%
will turn potential
energy into something

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.880 align:middle line:10%
that reflects its intent.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.320 align:middle line:10%
That's how it works.

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:47.630 align:middle line:10%
And your mind and consciousness
is incredibly powerful.

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:52.740 align:middle line:84%
You literally can create
a world or a universe.

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.490 align:middle line:90%
You are source.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
The difference is that
here in 5D, you know it,

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.510 align:middle line:84%
so you can control your
feelings and thoughts

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.730 align:middle line:90%
to change your world.

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:10.310 align:middle line:84%
However, even inside the
original matrix, or the 5D,

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.800 align:middle line:84%
you do have the
sensation of limitedness

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.060 align:middle line:84%
because as you go ascending
in the frequency realm

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.400 align:middle line:84%
curve or stages,
the higher you go,

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:24.560 align:middle line:84%
the faster things manifest
as they are less dense.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.720 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.650 align:middle line:84%
The how it came to
be, no one knows.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:34.220 align:middle line:84%
It's always been
here, physicality.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.100 align:middle line:10%
There is no time,
so it's eternal.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:38.840 align:middle line:10%
It just is.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a shape for
something that has

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:46.460 align:middle line:84%
no shape, a reflection of
your consciousness awareness.

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:49.040 align:middle line:84%
The more expanded
you are inside,

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.220 align:middle line:84%
the more you can
see of the universe.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:26:07.140 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:12.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, you said the original
matrix was set up by us all,

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.790 align:middle line:90%
real souls.

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:18.020 align:middle line:84%
You mean us from above,
some more etheric plane,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.710 align:middle line:84%
decided to become more
fractalized to experience

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.800 align:middle line:84%
material expansion
and we established

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.290 align:middle line:90%
a set of rules for the game--

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.620 align:middle line:90%
original matrix set of rules?

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.370 align:middle line:84%
What would be those
original matrix rules?

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:39.800 align:middle line:84%
Law of attraction,
duality, what else?

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:45.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, something like that, but
not necessarily as us sitting

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:47.600 align:middle line:90%
down making plans.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.090 align:middle line:84%
More of manifesting what
we all want, as in a web.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:56.870 align:middle line:84%
More of manifesting
what our attention wants

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:00.210 align:middle line:90%
and/or where it goes.

00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:06.020 align:middle line:84%
I think duality is not part
of the original matrix,

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:11.700 align:middle line:84%
also as the result of the
split brains humans have--

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.150 align:middle line:84%
always fighting between
left and right brains.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:20.790 align:middle line:84%
Here, we don't have that,
and above, even less.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:23.770 align:middle line:84%
If it seems like
we have duality,

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:27.650 align:middle line:90%
it's in a much lesser degree.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:31.670 align:middle line:84%
Law of attraction, it
simply is creating what you

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:35.060 align:middle line:90%
are focusing your attention to.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:39.740 align:middle line:90%
That is primordial, I would say.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:40.700 align:middle line:90%
>> I was thinking that.

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:43.940 align:middle line:84%
But then you do
have darker beings,

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:50.240 align:middle line:84%
such as reptiles, so you do have
some sort of a duality, still.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't really
have reptiles.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Those go only as
high as 4D, lower 5D.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:03.800 align:middle line:84%
We are in higher 5D, so they
cannot touch us unless we go

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:06.940 align:middle line:90%
down, we descend.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:11.500 align:middle line:84%
The only reptiles we have
here are the positive ones.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.320 align:middle line:90%
We live very much in peace.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:84%
We can see the
reptiles in 3D, 4D,

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:21.400 align:middle line:90%
but they cannot see or touch us.

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.780 align:middle line:84%
So they must use tactics
like using advanced clones

00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.680 align:middle line:84%
to be able to work through
them here to try to get to us.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:37.290 align:middle line:90%


00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:41.140 align:middle line:84%
>> But the Tiamat and Mars
wars, you said those were bloody

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:41.940 align:middle line:90%
wars.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.110 align:middle line:90%
Many died.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:47.220 align:middle line:84%
It was before 3D installment,
so it happened in 5D.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.390 align:middle line:90%


00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:54.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, but frequency
is not fixed.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.650 align:middle line:84%
It depends on your
state of mind.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:00.910 align:middle line:90%
You go up and down in frequency.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:01.980 align:middle line:90%
We all do.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:04.600 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.810 align:middle line:84%
All that mess happened
when we were low--

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:10.660 align:middle line:90%
higher 4D, lower 5D.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:14.960 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on
your intention.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:84%
So going on to pick a fight
is a lower frequency activity.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:24.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you look for a fight,
you will find a fight.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.300 align:middle line:84%
The trick is to stay
above in frequency

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:33.060 align:middle line:84%
to avoid being accessed or
touched by negative things.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:37.530 align:middle line:84%
As I said before, 5D
is not a fixed thing.

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:41.800 align:middle line:84%
It's a gradient of frequency
from lower to higher,

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.800 align:middle line:84%
and you determine what you see
with your personal frequency.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.830 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:54.750 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so in the original
matrix, higher 5D state,

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:58.980 align:middle line:84%
there is usually no negativity
and cruelty spreading around.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.390 align:middle line:90%
You live in harmony.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:02.340 align:middle line:90%
Is that right?

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.690 align:middle line:90%
>> Mostly.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.590 align:middle line:84%
Not in complete harmony
but, compared to below,

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:11.190 align:middle line:84%
we are quite harmonious,
mostly because we

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:13.080 align:middle line:90%
do understand how this works.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.980 align:middle line:90%


00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Did the original matrix
install the experience

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:24.330 align:middle line:84%
of physical pain, or is it
something more to do with 3D

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.130 align:middle line:90%
world?

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.410 align:middle line:90%
>> There is pain here as well.

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:30.330 align:middle line:90%
But it's seen differently.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:33.250 align:middle line:90%
Pain here is not a problem.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:36.030 align:middle line:84%
Some of it means you
are away from being

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:39.690 align:middle line:84%
aligned to your needs
and wants, and that

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:42.260 align:middle line:90%
includes a broken finger.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:46.520 align:middle line:84%
But pain and suffering needs
at least a whole video apart.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.240 align:middle line:90%


00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:54.610 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, do you consider the
possibility that just as the 3D

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.930 align:middle line:84%
is an installment
and we didn't know,

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:04.750 align:middle line:84%
the 5D could be also
and you just don't know?

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:05.550 align:middle line:90%
>> No.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.260 align:middle line:90%
There is a difference.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:13.710 align:middle line:84%
Unlike within 3D, from 5D, you
can talk to beings above you,

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and they will explain
it all very kindly.
