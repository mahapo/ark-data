00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.160 align:middle line:90%
>> Hello, everybody.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.060 align:middle line:90%
My name is Gosia Duszak.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.620 align:middle line:84%
And I'm very happy to be
here with the material

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.920 align:middle line:90%
from our Taygetan crew.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.020 align:middle line:84%
We are going to
introduce the Taygetans.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.910 align:middle line:84%
And I will explain a
little bit who they are,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.330 align:middle line:84%
how they got here, what
they are doing here,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.415 align:middle line:90%
and how this contact began.

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:05.269 align:middle line:90%


00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.510 align:middle line:90%
I was born in Poland.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:16.770 align:middle line:84%
And at the age of 22, I left
Poland, first to the USA.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.110 align:middle line:10%
Then I lived in
Australia, where I

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.900 align:middle line:10%
went to the University
of Queensland,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.620 align:middle line:10%
studying comparative religion.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.190 align:middle line:84%
Then I went on to
live in Costa Rica,

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.830 align:middle line:84%
then on to Spain, in
Barcelona, where in 2011 I

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.170 align:middle line:84%
opened a metaphysical store
called Cosmic Agency--

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.550 align:middle line:90%
Spanish "Agencia Cosmica."

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.560 align:middle line:84%
And already at that point, I
felt like my dream and vision

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.030 align:middle line:84%
somehow is to serve as
the mediating point, where

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.060 align:middle line:84%
higher-dimensional concepts
and ideas can be introduced

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.530 align:middle line:90%
to the earthly realm.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:13.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.230 align:middle line:10%
In 2017, my friend Robert, who
is actually my work partner,

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.470 align:middle line:10%
went to the UFO
Congress in Barcelona.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.190 align:middle line:10%
And he was introduced
there to a lady who,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.030 align:middle line:10%
as she revealed to him,
had a direct communication

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.030 align:middle line:10%
with the Taygetan
Pleiadians on the ship

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.760 align:middle line:10%
in the orbit of the Earth.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.220 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after, the lady
introduced him to the crew.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.430 align:middle line:84%
After a few months,
he introduced me

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.170 align:middle line:84%
to that lady, who, after a
few weeks of preparation,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.480 align:middle line:84%
introduced me to the
lady on the ship.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.470 align:middle line:10%
Her name was Swaruu.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.990 align:middle line:10%
She was our first and
main contact at the time.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.660 align:middle line:90%
She was a Taygetan Pleiadian.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.180 align:middle line:84%
So we are very honored
to be speaking to her.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.020 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.990 align:middle line:84%
We started communicating in
writing through the internet.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.050 align:middle line:84%
The information
is not channeled.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.000 align:middle line:84%
Since we have the
technology of the internet,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.490 align:middle line:84%
and they have tapped into
it, the communication

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.720 align:middle line:84%
is much more reliable
this way, for the purity

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.150 align:middle line:84%
of the information
is maintained.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.720 align:middle line:90%


00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.980 align:middle line:84%
We started communicating almost
daily, many times for hours.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.200 align:middle line:10%
Later on, we were
introduced also

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.720 align:middle line:10%
to Aneeka, who is our
other principal contact.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.840 align:middle line:84%
She has arrived here to the
Earth's orbit in April 2016.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.740 align:middle line:84%
And her position in the crew--
as they all have their specific

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:05.820 align:middle line:90%
positions--

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:84%
is that of chief analyst
of the terrestrial

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.350 align:middle line:90%
as well as space data.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
And she is a sort of a chief
intelligence on the ship.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Also, among other
responsibilities and tasks--

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.860 align:middle line:84%
because they all specialize
in many different things--

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.900 align:middle line:84%
is holographic
computers on board,

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:90%
quantic computers on board.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.147 align:middle line:84%
But you have to completely
redefine the word "quantic."

00:04:37.147 --> 00:04:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Because what we
understand by the word

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.290 align:middle line:84%
"quantic" is not what they
are referring to here.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.860 align:middle line:84%
They can live up to
1,000 Earth linear years.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.370 align:middle line:84%
However, this specific
crew is very young.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.150 align:middle line:84%
They are from the fifth
density, the natural density

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.770 align:middle line:84%
in which everything outside
of Earth is immersed.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:84%
However, as Yazhi
Swaruu explains,

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.540 align:middle line:90%
there are actually no densities.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.290 align:middle line:90%
It's all state of mind.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.590 align:middle line:90%
It's not a specific location.

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.210 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.610 align:middle line:84%
In the course of the
last three years,

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.240 align:middle line:84%
we talked to many of
them from the crew.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.860 align:middle line:84%
And altogether, we talked
to about 16 of them.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.280 align:middle line:84%
And now I'm going to actually
explain to you each photo--

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.550 align:middle line:84%
how much work has been done,
and if it's a real photo

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.960 align:middle line:90%
or if it's a modified photo.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.108 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's begin.

00:05:33.108 --> 00:05:38.090 align:middle line:10%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.920 align:middle line:10%
Well, this is Yazhi Swaruu.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.100 align:middle line:10%
This is a modified photo of her.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:50.330 align:middle line:90%


00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.590 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is Minerva--

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.530 align:middle line:10%
Minerva Swaruu,
Swaruu 11 so-called.

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.150 align:middle line:10%
This is also modified.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.920 align:middle line:10%
This is modified
but based on her,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.290 align:middle line:10%
based on how she really is.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.900 align:middle line:10%
And yes, Minerva Swaruu has
very dark eyes, almost black.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.430 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.430 align:middle line:10%
Dhor Káal'él-- this is
a real photo, real face.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.630 align:middle line:10%
This is how he is.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.360 align:middle line:10%
A photo is a bit
overworked, perhaps.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:29.080 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.570 align:middle line:10%
Now, this is Raguel.

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:36.160 align:middle line:10%
This is also his face, real
photo, also a bit overworked.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:45.530 align:middle line:90%


00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.050 align:middle line:10%
Nai'shara-- this is her.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:53.330 align:middle line:10%
And it's minimum work that has
been applied to this photo.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.790 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:01.310 align:middle line:10%
Aneeka of Temmer--
you already know her--

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.525 align:middle line:10%
real face, real photo,
moderate work has been applied.

00:07:05.525 --> 00:07:16.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:21.000 align:middle line:10%
And Athena Swaruu, also
real face, moderate work.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.950 align:middle line:10%
And some other
photos that I will

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.600 align:middle line:10%
be sharing also in the future--

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.030 align:middle line:10%
real bold and direct photos.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.720 align:middle line:10%
Sometimes even the big run
comes through if it's plain,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.760 align:middle line:10%
and there's nothing to it.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.840 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:10%
Now, when we began
this communication,

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:10%
there were about 20, 25
thousand Taygetan Pleiadians

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.740 align:middle line:10%
in the orbit.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.820 align:middle line:90%
Now it's down to 30.

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And it's a very limited
number of the Taygetans who

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.420 align:middle line:90%
can actually speak to humans.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Not all of them are actually
trained in the human languages

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.150 align:middle line:90%
or in human mentality.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.260 align:middle line:84%
Because the mentalities
here differ,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:06.730 align:middle line:84%
and you have to be sort of
prepared to talk to humans.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:10.450 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.900 align:middle line:10%
At this point, I want to specify
that they are specifically

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:19.000 align:middle line:10%
from the star system of
Taygeta in the Pleiades M45.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.880 align:middle line:10%
That's why they don't like
to be called Pleiadians.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Because in the
Pleiades, there are

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.640 align:middle line:84%
so many different races, some
of them not even interstellar.

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.200 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.791 align:middle line:84%
In that system, there
are four planets.

00:08:33.791 --> 00:08:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Temmer is the main
one, where the capital

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.409 align:middle line:90%
city is, Toleka City.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:44.780 align:middle line:84%
It's a tropical planet
full of tropical islets.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.270 align:middle line:90%
Then there is Erra.

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:51.050 align:middle line:84%
And then there is
Procyon and Dakotee.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.230 align:middle line:84%
Most of them are
from Temmer and Erra.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.780 align:middle line:84%
I actually asked Aneeka for
some detailed and technical

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.810 align:middle line:90%
information about their ship.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.990 align:middle line:84%
And this is the information
she provided to me.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.240 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.270 align:middle line:90%
Their ship is called Toleka.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:19.950 align:middle line:90%
Construction year-- 1935.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:84%
And construction site,
Temmer, Taygeta, M45 Pleiades.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:84%
The ship's emblem--
white-haired woman

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
with golden and silver
armor, red cape,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.560 align:middle line:90%
on a royal crown background.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.080 align:middle line:84%
Sister ships, which
means other ships

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.120 align:middle line:90%
of this type, same class--

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle line:90%
8.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.740 align:middle line:84%
Ship type classification--
heavy cruiser.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.860 align:middle line:90%
Ship type use and equipment--

00:09:53.860 --> 00:10:00.120 align:middle line:84%
flagship of the
fleet, Queen's yacht.

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.570 align:middle line:90%
Ship internal equipment layout--

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:09.450 align:middle line:84%
science, multipurpose,
and luxury installations.

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:12.300 align:middle line:10%
Crew accommodations--
originally the ship

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:16.950 align:middle line:10%
is designed for
1,800 crew members.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.660 align:middle line:10%
But the crew accommodations
at this time--

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle line:10%
30.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:28.590 align:middle line:10%
Hull length is 1,734 meters.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:10%
Hull length with
frontal sensor boom--

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.590 align:middle line:10%
2,023 meters.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:43.200 align:middle line:10%
Hull width-- 140 meters.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.190 align:middle line:10%
Hull height-- 120 meters.

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:49.590 align:middle line:10%
Main hangar length--

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:53.770 align:middle line:10%
1,156 meters.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:11:00.940 align:middle line:10%
Mass weight-- approximate
2 million metric tons.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:06.590 align:middle line:84%

Now, why are they
here, especially

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:45.630 align:middle line:84%
at this time of
our history, which

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:48.660 align:middle line:84%
is one of the most
important times and points

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.650 align:middle line:90%
of the human history?

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.980 align:middle line:90%
It's a turning point.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.860 align:middle line:84%
The main role here
of the Taygetans--

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.710 align:middle line:84%
because I can only speak for
the Taygetans themselves,

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:middle line:90%
I don't speak to anybody else--

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:04.500 align:middle line:84%
is to assist right now with
the transformation on Earth,

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.310 align:middle line:84%
with the human consciousness,
and with the fight

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:13.410 align:middle line:84%
against the negative regressives
who are controlling the Earth

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:15.810 align:middle line:90%
and have been for millennia.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:20.510 align:middle line:90%


00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:22.870 align:middle line:84%
They have been stationed
here for centuries.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:27.160 align:middle line:84%
They have always been here,
one crew or the other.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.050 align:middle line:90%
And they are always on rotation.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:31.795 align:middle line:84%
But their presence
has always been here.

00:13:31.795 --> 00:13:34.330 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:39.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, this specific
ship appeared in 1952.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
Their purpose of being
here and the tasks

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:84%
keep changing
depending on the times.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.100 align:middle line:90%
But their tasks are multiple.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.700 align:middle line:84%
They are here to observe
what is going on,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.810 align:middle line:84%
to study what is
going on, to assist

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:58.720 align:middle line:84%
the Earth and the humans
in any way possible.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:04.150 align:middle line:10%
However, you have to understand
that that assistance--

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.180 align:middle line:10%
and I'm not just talking
about Taygetan Pleiadians--

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.350 align:middle line:10%
is mostly done covertly.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.820 align:middle line:84%
It's not done in the public
and for the human knowledge.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.520 align:middle line:90%
They don't want any credit.

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.610 align:middle line:10%
Actually, it's against
so-called "prime directive,"

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:10%
which is very real,
to be assisting

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:10%
humans in the open way with
things like technology that

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.190 align:middle line:10%
are not aligned with
the natural evolution

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:37.750 align:middle line:10%
of the technological
state of the given planet.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.230 align:middle line:84%
Even though, ah, there's
much more to this.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
And there are a lot of
factions of extraterrestrials

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.920 align:middle line:84%
and within the
Federation itself.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.580 align:middle line:84%
And those factions sometimes do
cooperate with certain factions

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:54.250 align:middle line:84%
on Earth, and that
prime directive

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.950 align:middle line:90%
is not always exactly followed.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.960 align:middle line:90%
But that's for another topic.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.630 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:05.130 align:middle line:84%
So the specific
crew consists mainly

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:09.390 align:middle line:84%
of very young, idealistic,
noble, very proactive

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
and passionate Taygetans, who
came here to assist the Earth.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.040 align:middle line:84%
And some of them,
not all of them,

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.190 align:middle line:84%
learned to speak
human languages.

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.950 align:middle line:84%
And in that group,
some of them were

00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:28.060 align:middle line:84%
trained to interact with
people here on Earth.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:34.630 align:middle line:84%
So Aneeka, and Yazhi
Swaruu, and also Káal'él--

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Káal'él is a man,
Taygetan pilot;

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:43.570 align:middle line:84%
and Raguel is another
Taygetan pilot, man--

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.800 align:middle line:84%
some of the ones that
we have been talking to.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Since 2008, they have had
thousands of humans on Earth

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.230 align:middle line:90%
who they talked to.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.720 align:middle line:10%
Because at that time,
they were more numerous,

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.660 align:middle line:10%
and there were about
500 Taygetan staff

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.330 align:middle line:10%
talking to the humans on Earth.

00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.800 align:middle line:90%
That was their mission.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.410 align:middle line:84%
That was, actually, one
of their objectives.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.770 align:middle line:10%
And to assess the level
of mental preparation

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.480 align:middle line:10%
for an extraterrestrial contact.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:18.720 align:middle line:90%

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.630 align:middle line:84%
The main job now for this
communication, I feel,

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:30.470 align:middle line:84%
is to simply offer
liberating knowledge

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:35.120 align:middle line:84%
for the humans,
the knowledge that

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:84%
has been hidden from the
humankind for such a long time.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.490 align:middle line:84%
They share with us a
multitude of topics

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:49.750 align:middle line:84%
on how the reality works, the
metaphysics, spirituality,

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:59.590 align:middle line:84%
who we are, history, hidden
