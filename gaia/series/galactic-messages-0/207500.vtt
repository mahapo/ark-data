00:00:45.045 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:10%
>> You are not limited
in any way genetically.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.900 align:middle line:10%
It does not work that way.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.280 align:middle line:84%
You are trapped in a
materialistic mentality that

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.450 align:middle line:84%
doesn't let you see how the
real science of genetics

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.500 align:middle line:90%
really works.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.810 align:middle line:84%
Genes are an
expression developed

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.410 align:middle line:84%
by consciousness
and materialization

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.930 align:middle line:90%
of an intention.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Genes are not fixed, set
items, blueprints of which you

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.190 align:middle line:90%
are a victim during your life.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.690 align:middle line:84%
Genes can be overwritten,
can be erased,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.770 align:middle line:84%
and can be developed
as entirely new ones.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.360 align:middle line:84%
Entirely new ones are
created all the time.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.800 align:middle line:84%
They respond to stimuli
from the outside world that

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.400 align:middle line:84%
is outside the cell
that holds them.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.780 align:middle line:84%
That stimuli comes as the result
of the subject's perception

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.090 align:middle line:90%
of the outside world.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And the subject's perception is
dependent on its consciousness,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.810 align:middle line:84%
awareness, and
frequency of existence.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.090 align:middle line:84%
This last statement can
be clearly understood

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.180 align:middle line:84%
studying the work of Dr.
Bruce Lipton, epigenetics.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:15.540 align:middle line:84%
But what I am telling you here
goes far beyond Bruce's work.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.710 align:middle line:84%
What I am telling you is
that epigenetics is not

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.830 align:middle line:84%
only how mind and
perception alters

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.210 align:middle line:84%
your body to a genetic
level, but it actually

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.530 align:middle line:84%
is how your entire
body is built.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.380 align:middle line:84%
It is the result
of your perception

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.860 align:middle line:84%
and your consciousness
intention as well as

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.050 align:middle line:90%
your frequency of existence.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.630 align:middle line:90%


00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.260 align:middle line:84%
Genes develop as a
shadow interpretation

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.520 align:middle line:84%
of what you are in a level
or a plane of existence

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.850 align:middle line:84%
above the one you are
perceiving, study,

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.730 align:middle line:90%
or living in.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Each point and minute
particle of matter

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.970 align:middle line:84%
that makes up your genes come
as the result of an energy

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.230 align:middle line:90%
pattern--

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
standing wave,
concentration manifestation

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.920 align:middle line:84%
process, directly as the result
of your focus, intention,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.730 align:middle line:90%
consciousness, and frequency.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
It has been said that you
were limited genetically

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.340 align:middle line:84%
in a laboratory by
beings like the Anunnaki

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.690 align:middle line:84%
who created the human species
splicing genes from a monkey.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
Other versions say from
scratch, not using the monkey.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.790 align:middle line:90%
All this is not accurate.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.340 align:middle line:84%
It is said that
your higher brain

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.880 align:middle line:84%
functions, such as telepathy,
clear cognizance, and so on,

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.830 align:middle line:84%
have been edited out,
altering your genes.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.850 align:middle line:84%
It's been said that you have
been limited in the lifespan

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.620 align:middle line:90%
as well.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:14.970 align:middle line:84%
You have not, not in the way
described by those theories.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.649 align:middle line:10%
Humans have been tampered
with genetically in the past

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.660 align:middle line:10%
many times.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.000 align:middle line:10%
But those changes do not
stick, and as a species,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.100 align:middle line:10%
result in a dead end
with no reproduction

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.080 align:middle line:10%
or limited only to
a few generations.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.730 align:middle line:84%
A permanent change in the
genetic structure of humans

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.510 align:middle line:90%
has been done in another way.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle line:84%
All those higher
psychic abilities

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:90%
do not reside in the brain.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:90%
Nor do they reside in a gene.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.350 align:middle line:84%
They are only
expressed by a gene.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing to edit out.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Those psychic abilities come
from your energetic body

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.290 align:middle line:84%
and your spiritual
essence higher yourself.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.870 align:middle line:90%
They are not physical.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.200 align:middle line:84%
There is no center
for telepathy.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.010 align:middle line:84%
There is no center
for clear cognizance.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.430 align:middle line:84%
The only point that
mildly resembles that

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.340 align:middle line:90%
is the pineal gland.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.920 align:middle line:90%
But it's only a translator.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.230 align:middle line:84%
It does not control your
higher mental functions.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.310 align:middle line:84%
The way you have been limited
is with the extensive use

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.710 align:middle line:90%
of mind control.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.410 align:middle line:84%
This is, the
controllers have led

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:51.240 align:middle line:84%
you to believe, with arguments
and with compelling yet false

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.400 align:middle line:84%
ideas, that you are living
in a deterministic world.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.770 align:middle line:84%
That is, you are
living in a place

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.280 align:middle line:84%
where you experience
and suffer things that

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:90%
are not under your control.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.630 align:middle line:90%
Victim mentality.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:13.500 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:22.840 align:middle line:84%
Everyone on Earth is telepathic,
clear cognizant, and psychic.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.570 align:middle line:84%
But you are trained to
ignore when you are having

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.670 align:middle line:90%
an experience of that sort.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.820 align:middle line:84%
So you can no longer
recognize when

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.040 align:middle line:84%
you are being telepathic,
as you automatically

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.520 align:middle line:90%
ignore the subtle messages.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.260 align:middle line:84%
But once you understand
this and how it works,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.540 align:middle line:84%
you will start to see that,
in fact, you are telepathic.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.910 align:middle line:84%
It's those subtle
messages you feel

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.950 align:middle line:84%
about anything or about
anyone, an inner knowing that

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.720 align:middle line:90%
doesn't come from you.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.010 align:middle line:84%
This is what you have been
trained to ignore and to pass

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.260 align:middle line:90%
for false.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.630 align:middle line:84%
In your world, you are taught to
discredit feelings and emotions

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.230 align:middle line:84%
as something
unwanted, as something

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:19.590 align:middle line:84%
that contradicts logic as if
it were higher understanding.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.280 align:middle line:90%
Your emotions are higher wisdom.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:27.420 align:middle line:90%
They are who you are as a soul.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.150 align:middle line:90%
The moment you discredit them--

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.210 align:middle line:90%
yours or those of others--

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.510 align:middle line:84%
you are losing a great
part of your soul.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:43.390 align:middle line:90%


00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:47.200 align:middle line:84%
Humans have been genetically
intervened all the time

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.630 align:middle line:90%
throughout history.

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:84%
I am not saying
they have not been.

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.710 align:middle line:84%
What I'm trying to say
is that they were not

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:90%
created like that as a species.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.180 align:middle line:84%
But they were altered
at each individual level

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:09.760 align:middle line:84%
by other species or stellar
races for various reasons,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.370 align:middle line:84%
for example to accommodate the
frequency of a to-be mother

00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:18.690 align:middle line:84%
for her to be able to
carry out a good pregnancy

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:24.000 align:middle line:84%
to bring a high frequency
star seed into your world.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.330 align:middle line:84%
If this is not
done many times it

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.669 align:middle line:84%
will result in nervous damage
to the mother or to the child.

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:38.220 align:middle line:84%
And in many cases, it does
lead to a miscarriage.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:41.925 align:middle line:84%
Another example of genetic
manipulation by another star

00:08:41.925 --> 00:08:46.740 align:middle line:84%
race is to heal subjects
presenting severe damage

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:51.090 align:middle line:84%
to their body in order to permit
them to fulfill their life

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:57.750 align:middle line:84%
plan as their life is in danger
This is done quite commonly.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:84%
But it depends on each
individual's life plan.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.340 align:middle line:84%
So not all subjects who
get sick will be repaired.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:12.560 align:middle line:90%


00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.560 align:middle line:10%
Throughout history,
many attempts

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:18.020 align:middle line:10%
to alter the human
genome have been

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:25.740 align:middle line:10%
made by regressive and
invasive species by the cabal.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:29.290 align:middle line:90%
And it's still going on.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:34.530 align:middle line:10%
But as genes are not fixed,
deterministic, inflexible

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.340 align:middle line:10%
things, and due to
humans high contact

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.880 align:middle line:10%
rate with source and
with higher self,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:10%
they have a tendency to
rewrite themselves back

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.620 align:middle line:10%
into their original
configuration,

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.514 align:middle line:10%
erasing the modification.

00:09:53.514 --> 00:09:56.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Why are these
attempts being made?

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.460 align:middle line:90%
What do they try to achieve?

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.620 align:middle line:84%
>> They want to achieve total
control over humans in order

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.690 align:middle line:84%
to exploit them, the most
effective and efficient way

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.970 align:middle line:90%
possible: to make them slaves.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:19.520 align:middle line:84%
If humans have high contact with
source, they end up rebelling.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.135 align:middle line:84%
And the history has demonstrated
that over and over again.

00:10:23.135 --> 00:10:31.600 align:middle line:90%


00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.610 align:middle line:84%
Going back to what
I said earlier about

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.880 align:middle line:84%
the genes rewriting
themselves to their original

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.710 align:middle line:84%
configuration, when
DNA is aggressively

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:47.440 align:middle line:84%
altered in an invasive way as
you would do in a laboratory,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.800 align:middle line:84%
it has the tendency
to immediately return

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.130 align:middle line:84%
to its original
configuration given

00:10:54.130 --> 00:11:00.190 align:middle line:84%
by the consciousness perception
of the owner subject.

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.460 align:middle line:84%
This will occur very
fast, in a matter

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.210 align:middle line:90%
of weeks in the fifth density.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.630 align:middle line:84%
But on Earth, due
to the low density

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:16.380 align:middle line:84%
slow manifestation properties,
it may take more time.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.160 align:middle line:84%
But it's directly
dependent on each subject.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.200 align:middle line:84%
In the worst case scenario,
it may take one generation

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.860 align:middle line:84%
before it returns to
original DNA configuration.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.520 align:middle line:84%
The only way to make
aggressively made laboratory

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:39.050 align:middle line:84%
changes to DNA permanent
is to keep the subject

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
in a very low consciousness
state and state of mind.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.700 align:middle line:84%
This is, the subject
must be kept in fear

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:84%
with a clear deterministic view
and interpretation of reality,

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:59.000 align:middle line:84%
alienated from
source consciousness.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000 align:middle line:84%
This way, the subject from
above will order its genes

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.450 align:middle line:84%
to remain in a
deterministic state that

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.260 align:middle line:84%
matches its consciousness
and perception of reality.

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:16.980 align:middle line:90%


00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.180 align:middle line:10%
This is why sodium
fluoride is used

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:24.860 align:middle line:10%
in large quantities, and
everything else that calcifies,

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.750 align:middle line:10%
and therefore isolates, the
pineal gland, as well as

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:35.570 align:middle line:10%
the widespread use of drugs,
especially psychotropic ones,

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:39.830 align:middle line:10%
to suppress especially
alert individuals,

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:44.180 align:middle line:10%
also calling them
crazy or mentally ill,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.680 align:middle line:10%
labeling it as schizophrenia,
psychosis, depression,

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.280 align:middle line:10%
Asperger's, autism,
attention deficit,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:58.130 align:middle line:10%
and other false psychopathys
that have other explanations

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:05.750 align:middle line:10%
from physical brain damage to
sheer nonsense or mind control.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The population has imposed the
use of pharmaceutical drugs

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.300 align:middle line:84%
with enormous damage
to their systems

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.770 align:middle line:84%
due to side effects put there
by them under the excuse

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.660 align:middle line:90%
of masking symptom.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.600 align:middle line:84%
They also socially
impose the use

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:84%
of harmful substances
that separate

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.660 align:middle line:84%
the unified eye, the original
source, and keeps them

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.220 align:middle line:84%
very much in 3D,
always maintaining them

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:43.680 align:middle line:84%
within a concept of the
deterministic reality,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.550 align:middle line:84%
of victims accepting
as true only

00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:84%
what comes from their
material senses.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:56.670 align:middle line:84%
And that is living within an
invasive mental control matrix.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:59.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:06.670 align:middle line:84%
These substances are
alcohol, tobacco, and coffee.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.000 align:middle line:84%
But in the case of
other genes, the ones

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.090 align:middle line:84%
that do control
genetic disorders

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.810 align:middle line:84%
and autoimmune
illnesses and other ones

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:21.520 align:middle line:84%
such as cancer, which do have
a genetic component to them,

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.510 align:middle line:84%
although not entirely
dependent on genes,

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.280 align:middle line:84%
will maintain the negatively
configured genetic structure

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
if the connection to
source of the subject

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.890 align:middle line:90%
is effectively suppressed.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:43.070 align:middle line:90%


00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:84%
The modification
of the human genome

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.480 align:middle line:84%
by aggressive means in a
laboratory with the intention

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:84%
of keeping humans under control
and as slaves is not necessary.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:02.120 align:middle line:84%
All that must be done is to
mind control the population

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.300 align:middle line:84%
into accepting a
belief system that

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.860 align:middle line:84%
will result in the subjects
themselves changing

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:84%
their genetic configuration
to the one that

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.970 align:middle line:90%
suits the controllers.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:20.450 align:middle line:10%
This last statement is
important because it's

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:27.360 align:middle line:10%
what has been going on
for 12,500 years on Earth.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.200 align:middle line:10%
The controllers
not only know this,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.160 align:middle line:10%
but they apply
this with mastery.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.010 align:middle line:84%
They make people
believe something,

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.300 align:middle line:84%
and the people will
eventually change their genes.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:49.130 align:middle line:84%
It takes time, but they are
patient because their lifespan

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:53.160 align:middle line:84%
by far exceeds
the one of humans.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.180 align:middle line:10%
This is working against
humans because they

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.060 align:middle line:10%
are incapable of
seeing things clearly

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:01.730 align:middle line:10%
when there is an
agenda that involves

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:08.710 align:middle line:10%
slow but controlled changes
that involve generations.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
Humans only can
perceive what changes

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.240 align:middle line:84%
their immediate
reality, sometimes

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.620 align:middle line:84%
being blind to changes that are
done to them during the course

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.840 align:middle line:90%
of their lifetime.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:26.980 align:middle line:84%
Change is the only
constant in the universe,

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.580 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean
all changes are good.

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.250 align:middle line:84%
And that doesn't
mean you should not

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.220 align:middle line:84%
react to changes that
are affecting you

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:44.520 align:middle line:84%
directly or indirectly, both as
a species and as an individual.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.660 align:middle line:84%
Humankind is not
equipped to see interests

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.650 align:middle line:84%
in an expanded context
as two things that

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.040 align:middle line:90%
affect the entire species.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.490 align:middle line:84%
They only can effectively
perceive interests

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:05.000 align:middle line:84%
that involve their immediate
survival, with rare exceptions,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.980 align:middle line:90%
of course.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.000 align:middle line:84%
The imposition of a belief
system such as religion,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.220 align:middle line:84%
including science
as it's dogmatic,

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.200 align:middle line:90%
therefore also a religion.

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.950 align:middle line:84%
And as a result,
a genetic change

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.069 align:middle line:84%
will occur in the
subject population

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:26.589 align:middle line:90%
in an acceptable period of time.

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:34.020 align:middle line:90%


00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.130 align:middle line:10%
>> Why so much interest in
making us believe that we were

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.700 align:middle line:10%
manipulated in a laboratory
or come from a monkey

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:43.850 align:middle line:10%
or hybridized with a monkey?

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Because the moment you
discovered that you are not

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:54.020 align:middle line:84%
limited, your consciousness will
rise and you will be liberated

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:90%
from the illusion of the matrix.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:00.980 align:middle line:84%
You will have all
your abilities.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.830 align:middle line:84%
You will realize
everything that goes on.

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
matrix will end.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:84%
>> How much is genetics
linked to 4D and higher?

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:21.210 align:middle line:84%
>> The link with it is total,
and not only with the 4D

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:84%
but with all the densities being
part of a whole of the same.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.290 align:middle line:84%
If a person is
disconnected or isolated,

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:36.580 align:middle line:84%
it is their own ideas
and beliefs of limitation

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:42.270 align:middle line:84%
that provide the genetic
stability of artificial change.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:48.000 align:middle line:84%
But that change does not have
to be made in a laboratory.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.100 align:middle line:84%
The body itself follows the
instructions of the mind,

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:55.980 align:middle line:84%
following the concepts
of epigenetics

00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.330 align:middle line:84%
at the cellular and
intracellular level.

00:19:01.330 --> 00:19:05.560 align:middle line:84%
It goes much further
than epigenetics,

00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:09.310 align:middle line:84%
to the extent of explaining
the entire formation

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:15.820 align:middle line:84%
of all DNA, and with it, of
the individual and the species

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.760 align:middle line:90%
itself.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.890 align:middle line:84%
The mind and consciousness
create the individuals,

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:28.330 align:middle line:84%
their genetics, and all
their personal traits

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.330 align:middle line:90%
at the total level.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:36.250 align:middle line:84%
What I am saying is that
epigenetics is not only

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:38.740 align:middle line:84%
how the mind and
perception alter

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.240 align:middle line:84%
your body at the genetic
level, but that it is how

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.420 align:middle line:90%
the whole body is constructed.

00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:53.250 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.610 align:middle line:84%
>> With the mental control,
which part of genetics is

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.380 align:middle line:90%
changed?

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Is there any part
in particular that

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.230 align:middle line:90%
is the one that is altered?

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:06.860 align:middle line:84%
>> Mind control has the
potential to change all

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.080 align:middle line:90%
genetics.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.350 align:middle line:84%
To change a particular
aspect, you only

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:16.890 align:middle line:84%
need to study what
behavior, what ideas,

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:21.140 align:middle line:84%
concepts, and beliefs are
the ones that would influence

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.640 align:middle line:90%
a particular gene.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:29.210 align:middle line:84%
But rarely if at all there is
talk of altering a single gene.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:34.360 align:middle line:10%
For one, groups or segments
of interrelated genes

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.950 align:middle line:10%
are altered that in the
end will give the desired

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:44.920 align:middle line:10%
result from the point of
view of the controllers.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:50.990 align:middle line:84%
The whole genetics can be
changed, or just one part.

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.020 align:middle line:84%
It is only necessary
to change the mentality

00:20:54.020 --> 00:21:00.230 align:middle line:84%
of the individual, his
perception, his concept of what

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.600 align:middle line:90%
is and is not real.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.320 align:middle line:10%
In the '90s in the
USA, an experiment

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.200 align:middle line:10%
was conducted that
ended up classified

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.460 align:middle line:10%
and was not disclosed
to the public as it was.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.150 align:middle line:84%
A group of elderly people
was taken and isolated

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:24.570 align:middle line:84%
in a community structured as
a town but set in the 1950s.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:28.290 align:middle line:84%
All people were over
80 years of age.

00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Everything was as
it was in the '50s--

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:38.400 align:middle line:84%
cars, food, music,
even radio stations.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.420 align:middle line:84%
As the weeks passed, they
were all rejuvenated.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:84%
Their ailments were
mostly disappearing.

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.320 align:middle line:84%
After three months, everyone
was walking energetically

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:54.470 align:middle line:90%
without walking sticks.

00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:58.670 align:middle line:84%
At six months, all had the
physical body structure

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:04.280 align:middle line:84%
of at least 10 to 20 years
younger, in some cases up

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:07.730 align:middle line:90%
to 25 years younger.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Everything is in the mind.

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.910 align:middle line:84%
Those people were
mentally back in 1955.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.150 align:middle line:84%
And their bodies,
their genetics,

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:24.750 align:middle line:84%
was doing its best to adapt
to the perception of the mind.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:30.630 align:middle line:84%
They were still in the '90s, but
by perception, they were not.

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:41.160 align:middle line:90%
They were back in 1955.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.380 align:middle line:84%
I am aware that there
is scientific evidence

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:51.050 align:middle line:84%
of genetic tampering in
the laboratory on humans.

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:54.290 align:middle line:90%
I am not denying this fact.

00:22:54.290 --> 00:22:57.260 align:middle line:84%
But what I am pointing
out is the fact

00:22:57.260 --> 00:23:02.270 align:middle line:84%
that those artificial changes
do not constitute the reason

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:06.200 align:middle line:84%
nor do they affect the
whole as a species.

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:10.160 align:middle line:90%
They are localized and limited.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.750 align:middle line:84%
An example of this is the
said genomic telomeron

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.950 align:middle line:84%
that are at the end of
the genetic sequence

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:23.840 align:middle line:84%
and are said to be the point
or the genetic structure that

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.820 align:middle line:84%
controls and limits
human lifespan.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:31.090 align:middle line:90%
This is not so.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:36.070 align:middle line:84%
Those genomic telomerons
shorten a notch year

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:43.130 align:middle line:84%
by year as the result of
the idea that you are aging.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:46.420 align:middle line:84%
The genomic
telomerons, in general,

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.260 align:middle line:84%
are part of any gene
sequence and are

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:53.170 align:middle line:84%
lost due to other
factors like being

00:23:53.170 --> 00:23:56.560 align:middle line:84%
exposed to an aggressive
and not nourishing,

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:58.880 align:middle line:90%
hostile environment.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:05.480 align:middle line:84%
You, the individual, has the
idea that reality is hostile.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.030 align:middle line:90%
But that is perception.

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:12.170 align:middle line:84%
And perception is
dependent on belief systems

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:15.560 align:middle line:90%
and consciousness awareness.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:19.670 align:middle line:84%
The reason why the telomeres
shorten with the years

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:25.730 align:middle line:84%
is as a consequence of the idea
that it is getting older, one

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.820 align:middle line:84%
of the explanations that
you have been given,

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.690 align:middle line:84%
that you age because the cells
are copied to be replaced

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:36.440 align:middle line:84%
by new ones as part of
the normal process of body

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:40.280 align:middle line:84%
regeneration and that
during the process

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:45.170 align:middle line:84%
data is lost because of the
shortening of the telomeres,

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:48.950 align:middle line:84%
resulting in deficient
cells that, summed up,

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:53.810 align:middle line:84%
give the final result
of an aged person.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:84%
The genes, therefore
the telomeres,

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.720 align:middle line:84%
do not work as a
bad copy of a copy

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.470 align:middle line:84%
of the copy that ends up
degrading the sharpness

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.820 align:middle line:90%
of the original.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.490 align:middle line:90%
This is not so.

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:13.340 align:middle line:84%
The genes can be replicated with
total clarity and reliability

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.680 align:middle line:90%
in a virtually infinite way.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:23.020 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Is my unconscious body
perception and reality

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:90%
connected to the collective one?

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Because if so, even if I work
on myself and change my beliefs,

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:40.450 align:middle line:84%
if the collective doesn't,
I will still age, right?

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:44.890 align:middle line:84%
>> It is because you have an
agreement with the collective

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:48.520 align:middle line:84%
to perceive reality
the way you do--

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:56.200 align:middle line:84%
aging, sky is blue,
roses are red: agreement.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:90%
But you can override it.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:03.790 align:middle line:84%
You can drastically
slow it down.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:07.090 align:middle line:84%
>> So maybe you can explain
a bit how to override

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:10.510 align:middle line:84%
the genetics with consciousness,
because you said that

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:14.110 align:middle line:84%
the collective unconscious
plays a role here, too.

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:16.420 align:middle line:84%
Then, how to
override the genetics

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:22.370 align:middle line:84%
that is manifested on the basis
of limited collective beliefs?

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:26.570 align:middle line:84%
>> It overrides genetics
because they are perceptions.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:32.240 align:middle line:84%
They are the external world
in which the individual lives.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Perceptions and
experiences give you

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.920 align:middle line:84%
the framework of beliefs
that, in themselves, form

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:84%
consciousness and
individual frequency.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:48.380 align:middle line:84%
This is what naturally
modifies or overrides

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.920 align:middle line:90%
the genes of the individual.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.750 align:middle line:84%
It is not necessary to modify
a species such as the human one

00:26:56.750 --> 00:27:02.360 align:middle line:84%
in the laboratory if there is
a more effective and easier way

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.080 align:middle line:84%
to achieve the desired
behavior, the application

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.040 align:middle line:84%
of mental control, and
social engineering.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.070 align:middle line:84%
>> If my perception and
experience is of my aging

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:20.340 align:middle line:84%
parents, for example, then
this gives me my belief we age.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.490 align:middle line:84%
How to override this
having the experiences

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:84%
around that only
validate getting old?

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:84%
This gives me a framework
of belief, which afterwards

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:90%
will only validate more aging.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.080 align:middle line:90%
It's a loop.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.590 align:middle line:84%
How to get out of the
loop and override this?

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:42.260 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why you
are still aging.

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:47.525 align:middle line:84%
If you saw everyone around
you not aging, why would you?

00:27:47.525 --> 00:27:51.650 align:middle line:84%
What you describe is
part of the matrix.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:55.880 align:middle line:10%
Still, yes, you can
fight it, understanding

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:10%
that the fact that you
see other people aging

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.960 align:middle line:10%
does not mean that
you also will.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:07.010 align:middle line:84%
You age because you are
convinced you must age.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:09.830 align:middle line:84%
It's not enough to
change your mindset.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.130 align:middle line:90%
It helps.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.680 align:middle line:84%
But in 3D, you must accept
that your body is functioning

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.390 align:middle line:84%
as apart from you due to
the extra low frequency soup

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:90%
and density you live in.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.950 align:middle line:84%
This means that your body
is not well synchronized

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.390 align:middle line:90%
with your consciousness.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is because,
like it or not,

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.210 align:middle line:84%
that is part of what
defines 3D density--

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:42.800 align:middle line:84%
your apparent
separation from source.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Your body functions
like your unconscious

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:50.950 align:middle line:90%
because it is your unconscious.

00:28:50.950 --> 00:28:55.390 align:middle line:84%
So it is reacting
before said program.

00:28:55.390 --> 00:28:59.230 align:middle line:84%
That is what keeps you in
a deterministic mindset

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:02.710 align:middle line:84%
as you fail to see any
immediate or short term

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:06.580 align:middle line:84%
changes to your body even
in spite of your efforts

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.430 align:middle line:84%
to raise your frequency
and your consciousness

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:13.580 align:middle line:84%
as well as your
connection to source.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.470 align:middle line:84%
You must treat your
body as your unconscious

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:21.740 align:middle line:84%
with the direct intention
of changing the program.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:26.880 align:middle line:84%
And one of the most effective
tools to do so is repetition.

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:33.280 align:middle line:90%


00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.520 align:middle line:84%
>> They say that human
life is getting longer now.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.090 align:middle line:90%
What do you think about that?

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.940 align:middle line:90%
>> That's life expectancy.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.340 align:middle line:84%
It obeys other things
that have nothing

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.520 align:middle line:84%
to do with the final
length of the human being.

00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.710 align:middle line:84%
That is around 85
to 90 years old.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:56.540 align:middle line:84%
We must add in environmental
and toxic factors that

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.650 align:middle line:84%
also influence the
final result, factors

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:07.030 align:middle line:84%
such as the hostile environment,
stress cortisol, food

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:13.280 align:middle line:84%
poisoned by GMOs and chemicals,
the high gravity of the Earth

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.280 align:middle line:84%
because the human
being was designed

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:21.410 align:middle line:84%
for a gravity of 80%
of that of Earth.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:26.850 align:middle line:84%
This directly influences
the cartilages and bones,

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:31.770 align:middle line:84%
as well as the skin and
other internal organs.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:35.400 align:middle line:84%
>> What influences more,
mental control and beliefs

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.460 align:middle line:90%
or the factors you mentioned?

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:43.200 align:middle line:10%
>> As far as aging is concerned,
everything influences,

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:49.230 align:middle line:10%
but the environmental factors
fall to a distant second place

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.230 align:middle line:10%
after the state of
perception consciousness

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.060 align:middle line:10%
of the individual.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:57.350 align:middle line:90%
Everything is mind control.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:08.480 align:middle line:90%
