00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.285 align:middle line:10%
>> The suns are portals.

00:00:48.285 --> 00:00:51.060 align:middle line:90%


00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.210 align:middle line:90%
The sun is a portal.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.355 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, what looks
bright is the exit.

00:01:02.355 --> 00:01:04.890 align:middle line:90%


00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.880 align:middle line:84%
The entrance, or
negative sun, is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:20.850 align:middle line:84%
in central part constellation of
Andromeda and in a black hole.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:30.460 align:middle line:84%
They create an energetic toroid,
plus-minus, like everything

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:84%
else that works with the
toroid as a geometric form

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.870 align:middle line:84%
of manifestation

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.115 align:middle line:90%

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.210 align:middle line:90%
The entrance is a black hole.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:90%
The exit is a sun.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It is the very energy
of an energetic entity

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.785 align:middle line:90%
that is the sun or stars.

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:06.570 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.680 align:middle line:84%
Not all of it's being
is on this one plane.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.560 align:middle line:90%
So only a part is perceived.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.440 align:middle line:90%


00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.200 align:middle line:84%
A hole in three
dimensions is a sphere.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the entrance
and the exit are spherical.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.840 align:middle line:84%
They always wrongly portrayed
the black holes as a funnel.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.950 align:middle line:84%
It is correct, but
partially: they

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:84%
are spherical holes that can
be accessed from any direction.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.270 align:middle line:84%
Black hole above; under
it a white hole or star.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:05.860 align:middle line:90%


00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.800 align:middle line:90%
Something to clarify in passing.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.560 align:middle line:10%
You enter from a black hole
in the Andromeda constellation

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.540 align:middle line:10%
and exit from the sun.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:26.480 align:middle line:10%
But if you enter via the
sun, you exit behind Tauro:

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.040 align:middle line:10%
wormhole entrance that
exits from the sun (M33)

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.780 align:middle line:10%
in parentheses, Spiral
Galaxy Messier 33.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.190 align:middle line:84%
You come out from that
direction as seen from Earth.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.950 align:middle line:84%
You do not come out of M33
as it is much further away.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.790 align:middle line:10%
The nature of a wormhole
is much more complex

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.480 align:middle line:10%
than what you see
at first sight.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle line:10%
It's not just a tube,
as is said on Earth.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.340 align:middle line:10%
There is a complex system based
on frequencies in its interior.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything connected
from the ether.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.250 align:middle line:84%
All the suns and
all the black holes

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.780 align:middle line:84%
are connected in their
interior, creating

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.050 align:middle line:84%
with the proper knowledge
of frequency mapping

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.640 align:middle line:84%
a whole communication system
that can take you anywhere

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.190 align:middle line:90%
in the galaxy and the universe.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:44.400 align:middle line:90%


00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.790 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the toroids, it
is the geometric creative form

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.270 align:middle line:84%
of all matter in basic
or primordial form

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:05.780 align:middle line:84%
from an atom, a molecule,
a living cell, to an apple.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.020 align:middle line:84%
A planet, a sun,
and even the galaxy.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.445 align:middle line:90%
They are all toroids.

00:05:13.445 --> 00:05:16.220 align:middle line:90%


00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.360 align:middle line:84%
This also checks with
mathematics and geometry

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.820 align:middle line:84%
applied to the mechanics of the
manifestation that the Earth

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.545 align:middle line:84%
cannot be flat because,
again, it is a toroid.

00:05:30.545 --> 00:05:33.260 align:middle line:90%


00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.530 align:middle line:84%
This is why there are
openings at the poles.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.080 align:middle line:90%


00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything is a toroid
or part of a toroid.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.840 align:middle line:84%
So the sun is not a
thermonuclear bomb,

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:56.030 align:middle line:84%
as they say, but a localized
energetic point of attention,

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.230 align:middle line:90%
which is why it shines.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:04.390 align:middle line:84%
But logically, it
has other parts,

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:08.680 align:middle line:84%
parts from where its
energy originates

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.690 align:middle line:84%
that gets recycled
constantly with the dynamics

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.990 align:middle line:90%
of the flow of its toroid.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Although, you cannot perceive it
all from the limited to certain

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.470 align:middle line:84%
frequencies point of view,
as is the 3D perception.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:29.650 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:36.180 align:middle line:84%
There are other parts of the
sun there that we cannot see.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.950 align:middle line:84%
And in itself, the sun
is only one more piece

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.590 align:middle line:84%
in the fabric of the universe,
a complement as a spell

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.470 align:middle line:90%
is to an organic body.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.010 align:middle line:84%
So it is a toroid that is
part of something larger, that

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:01.650 align:middle line:84%
in turn is part of
something else even larger.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.430 align:middle line:84%
This is not only
Taygetan science.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.330 align:middle line:10%
Humans are already picking
up on it with experiments,

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.790 align:middle line:10%
such as the double-slit,
where a photon is

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:21.940 align:middle line:10%
a wave of potential energy when
it does not receive attention

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:27.410 align:middle line:10%
or is a particle when
someone is looking at it.

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:32.300 align:middle line:84%
This is the principal or
the most basic example

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.980 align:middle line:90%
by which all matter exists.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:43.130 align:middle line:84%
Simply what has more
attention is more attention.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:48.350 align:middle line:84%
It grows and
accumulates complexity.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:52.280 align:middle line:84%
The consciousness too,
because in itself,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:08:00.020 align:middle line:84%
there is only one consciousness,
the supreme eye of the source.

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And every person,
every consciousness,

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:11.010 align:middle line:84%
not only is a part of said
consciousness by right.;

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.710 align:middle line:84%
it is the very
same consciousness.

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:20.120 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, what a person
sees and perceives

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.685 align:middle line:90%
is by right their reality.

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:32.890 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:37.559 align:middle line:10%
>> Can there be a collision
between black holes?

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:42.820 align:middle line:84%
>> They happen at internal
level because they are connected

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.640 align:middle line:84%
inside, but this
is more etheric.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:54.090 align:middle line:84%
Yes, a collision is
possible, nothing usual.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.150 align:middle line:90%
>> Black hole photography?

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:02.250 align:middle line:84%
>> In the most extreme case,
you can only photograph what is

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.910 align:middle line:84%
going on there as long
as it emits light.

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.030 align:middle line:84%
And that is another
problem because the hole

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:15.250 align:middle line:84%
itself would absorb the
light emitted by the entering

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.970 align:middle line:90%
object even from a distance.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:26.680 align:middle line:10%
This is the excuse for the
color red in the photograph.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:10%
With red light, the
visible light spectrum

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.700 align:middle line:10%
would be towards
the reds because it

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.920 align:middle line:10%
has the longest wavelength.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:43.030 align:middle line:10%
There is an intrinsic
problem in that image.

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:46.330 align:middle line:10%
The hole is shown in 2D.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.290 align:middle line:90%
It is flat like a disk.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:54.220 align:middle line:84%
The other components are
human classifications

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:84%
that by themselves do
not have to be invalid.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:06.370 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.400 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you
something that looks more

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.650 align:middle line:90%
like a real black hole.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:17.810 align:middle line:84%
The hole is a sphere that
absorbs everything equally

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.200 align:middle line:90%
from any direction.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.830 align:middle line:84%
>> But would it
be a sphere in 3D?

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:27.300 align:middle line:90%
XYZ?

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:31.170 align:middle line:84%
>> It wouldn't produce a swirl
like water falling through

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.660 align:middle line:90%
a hole.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.300 align:middle line:84%
In the image, what
you see is not

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.320 align:middle line:84%
the hole but the
absence of other things

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.930 align:middle line:90%
in the region in space.

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it would be an XYZ sphere
that absorbs everything.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Just that by its very
nature, you don't see it.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.320 align:middle line:84%
And in this image,
the black hole

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.800 align:middle line:84%
would be something in
the center of that void.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:90%


00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.910 align:middle line:84%
>> But could it also absorb
your ships without your wanting

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:17.420 align:middle line:84%
to, or can you always control
being absorbed or not?

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:22.160 align:middle line:84%
>> They cannot see the black
hole because it absorbs all

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.610 align:middle line:84%
the light that is near it, but
they can see another sphere

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:33.680 align:middle line:84%
that is the exit from
the same black hole.

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.910 align:middle line:84%
There is an element
of whirlpool there,

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:40.580 align:middle line:84%
but it could be because
the light coming

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:46.100 align:middle line:84%
from the other side bends as
it approaches the black hole's

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:84%
zone of influence, but
that is in the case

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.800 align:middle line:90%
of many light sources behind it.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:05.020 align:middle line:84%
The sphere that is the exit, and
therefore a toroid, is the sun.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:10.420 align:middle line:84%
The suns, from a certain
point of view, are hollow.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle line:84%
Not exactly like a
hollow ball, but as

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:19.420 align:middle line:84%
an entrance or exit of a
tunnel with more than three

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:25.460 align:middle line:84%
dimensions, but
understandable as XYZ.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:84%
The energy enters through
the black hole and exits

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.210 align:middle line:84%
through the sun,
making a toroid.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.720 align:middle line:84%
The influence of
this toroid can be

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.140 align:middle line:84%
several thousands
of light-years,

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.200 align:middle line:90%
and it's all intertwined.

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.570 align:middle line:84%
Every sun has its black
hole, and every hole

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:56.620 align:middle line:90%
needs its opposite sun.

00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:03.670 align:middle line:84%
But it is not one-to-one as a
sun is connected to other suns

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.460 align:middle line:90%
and to other black holes.

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:11.630 align:middle line:84%
And black holes are
connected to others as well.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.980 align:middle line:84%
They do have more
prominent connections

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:19.010 align:middle line:90%
with some over others.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:23.770 align:middle line:84%
We talk about absolute
compression of critical mass.

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:29.575 align:middle line:84%
They all have this quality, or
they would not be black holes.

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:39.850 align:middle line:90%


00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> If the black hole
didn't swallow anything,

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.620 align:middle line:90%
would the sun go out?

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:90%


00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.690 align:middle line:84%
>> Not exactly because
it is a toroid.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:56.040 align:middle line:90%
It feeds back on itself.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:14:01.650 align:middle line:84%
The outer part of the toroid
or the orange peel part

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.470 align:middle line:90%
is on the ether side.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:12.000 align:middle line:84%
It is in itself an enormous
zero-point reactor.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.260 align:middle line:84%
Every sun is and also
every reactor core in one

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:23.940 align:middle line:84%
of our ships: same
principle because it

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.600 align:middle line:90%
is a mini-sun contained.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.220 align:middle line:84%
That is why it does
not extinguish.

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:84%
>> So anything that a black hole
swallows doesn't get destroyed.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.790 align:middle line:90%
It is just moved?

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.790 align:middle line:90%
>> It only gets moved.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:49.100 align:middle line:84%
It's just that something
relative comes into play here.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.050 align:middle line:84%
From the mathematical
perspective

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:55.160 align:middle line:84%
of the external
observer, what enters

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.600 align:middle line:84%
the black hole is
destroyed as it

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.180 align:middle line:90%
is compressed to critical mass.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.540 align:middle line:84%
But from the
object's perspective,

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.710 align:middle line:84%
it only changes in
dimension and frequency.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:20.170 align:middle line:84%
But relative to its internal
geometry, it remains intact.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.410 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the
object is relative.

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:26.270 align:middle line:90%


00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.770 align:middle line:90%
Another point.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:32.660 align:middle line:84%
It is impossible to calculate
the size of a black hole

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.690 align:middle line:84%
since its very
properties make it

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.110 align:middle line:84%
impossible to measure
it width distance,

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:43.580 align:middle line:90%
since that is just an illusion.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, from an
external perception,

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:52.040 align:middle line:84%
it can eat objects
significantly larger

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:59.030 align:middle line:84%
than itself because they become
distorted in relative size

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:02.660 align:middle line:90%
as they get closer to the hole.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, a perceptually small
hole seen from the outside

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:16.100 align:middle line:84%
can, from the close up, be the
size of an entire constellation

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.520 align:middle line:90%
or even a galaxy.

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:84%
There are no small ones
as they are described.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:30.340 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, there are
small ones because, let's say

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.760 align:middle line:84%
that a small lizard
sunbathing on a rock

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.870 align:middle line:84%
contains its
consciousness and is

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.890 align:middle line:84%
in itself the product
of an energetic dynamic

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:49.990 align:middle line:84%
identical to a black
hole, it is also a toroid.

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:57.970 align:middle line:84%
Every consciousness creates
its world; its own universe

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:04.089 align:middle line:84%
because it lives in its personal
interpretation of the universe.

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the lizard
and any other creature

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:18.010 align:middle line:84%
is a portal to another universe,
its own lizard universe.

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:84%
You are black holes,
metaphysically speaking,

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:middle line:84%
portals to other worlds
other interpretations

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.720 align:middle line:90%
of the universe.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:41.120 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:47.130 align:middle line:84%
>> What are black holes for,
and how are they produced?

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.850 align:middle line:84%
>> They are points of greater
concentration of potential

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:57.090 align:middle line:84%
energy, where it has curdled in
a very concentrated form with

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:02.740 align:middle line:84%
the same dynamics as the
mechanics of manifestation.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:90%
In short, it is a being.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:10.000 align:middle line:90%
The sun is a being.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.870 align:middle line:84%
As every being, it is
an energetic toroid

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:18.570 align:middle line:90%
as you too are.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.120 align:middle line:90%
But a tree is clearer as such.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.610 align:middle line:90%
They are sentient beings.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.280 align:middle line:90%
What are they for?

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.310 align:middle line:84%
They serve to shorten
the travel time

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:36.640 align:middle line:84%
of a ship from a distant place
to this one, for example.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.810 align:middle line:84%
You can note and
make a map of where

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:44.400 align:middle line:84%
which entrances black holes
are and where they go.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.990 align:middle line:90%


00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:50.560 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they go anywhere you
program your ship to go,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.020 align:middle line:84%
or they all have a
specific exit point,

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.200 align:middle line:90%
and you can't change that?

00:18:56.200 --> 00:19:00.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Inside, they connect to
wherever their energy mass

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:02.930 align:middle line:90%
takes them to go.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:09.010 align:middle line:84%
They are connected to an exit
of equal strength, a star.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:18.490 align:middle line:84%
But inside, there is no
time, no space, no continuum.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Everything there is
connected to everywhere.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:84%
All the stars converged there
from the side of the ether.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:33.370 align:middle line:84%
So from any black hole,
theoretically, you

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:35.260 align:middle line:90%
can exit from any star.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.780 align:middle line:90%


00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.020 align:middle line:84%
>> But it doesn't
depend on you, no?

00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Depends on its own
mechanism, right?

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:48.970 align:middle line:84%
You can't direct it,
only to a certain level?

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:52.360 align:middle line:84%
>> If you just follow the
main flow of the energy

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.500 align:middle line:84%
of the engine, that's the
toroidal flow of the entire

00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.760 align:middle line:84%
system, half of it in
the side of the ether.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.170 align:middle line:10%
The other half in what you call
the material world or side,

00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:11.380 align:middle line:10%
then you would exit out
of one specific star.

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:14.980 align:middle line:84%
But once in the
ether inside, that

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.690 align:middle line:84%
would be equivalent to
being in hyperspace.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:24.370 align:middle line:84%
Knowing the energy print of the
area and the frequency dynamics

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:28.000 align:middle line:84%
or dance of one
specific black hole,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.180 align:middle line:84%
you can change the
frequency of your ship,

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.880 align:middle line:90%
your little ship's toroid.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And with that, it adds to
the frequency of the flow

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:84%
of the black hole,
creating a shift

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.590 align:middle line:84%
in the frequency
of your ship that

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:49.540 align:middle line:84%
will alter your exit point
to another star closer

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.390 align:middle line:90%
to your final destination.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:58.730 align:middle line:84%
This is how many races
navigate the cosmos.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:03.260 align:middle line:84%
But even for them, it is more
practical to enter the ether

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:08.270 align:middle line:84%
system from a star and
exit from another star,

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:14.700 align:middle line:84%
avoiding black holes as
their energy is too dominant

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:20.380 align:middle line:84%
and tends to override
just about everything.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.650 align:middle line:84%
It is possible to
navigate a black hole,

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:28.180 align:middle line:84%
but it's more complicated
than just using solar portals.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:38.460 align:middle line:90%


00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:42.910 align:middle line:84%
>> What do they serve besides
being used by the ships?

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:47.270 align:middle line:84%
What do they exist for
from your perspective?

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> For the same reason a
cat exists, a dog, or you.

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.490 align:middle line:90%
It is a being with an agenda.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.630 align:middle line:90%
It's all life and consciousness.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.600 align:middle line:90%
>> And what is its agenda?

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.730 align:middle line:84%
>> There is no reason other than
to exist to experience being

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:11.750 align:middle line:90%
a sun.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.750 align:middle line:84%
How it manifests
itself is a matter

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:90%
of manifestation mechanics.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.530 align:middle line:90%
Space is not empty.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:25.020 align:middle line:90%
It is an energetic fluid.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.800 align:middle line:84%
That fluid is the
most important,

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:84%
and it is the cause of
the existence of matter.

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:37.110 align:middle line:90%
This fluid gives life.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:41.150 align:middle line:90%
This fluid is potential energy.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:50.160 align:middle line:84%
It is nothing more than water
in a very high vibratory state.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.460 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness starting
to materialize

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.060 align:middle line:90%
becomes a fluid first.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.390 align:middle line:84%
Then it takes all
and any other shape

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:04.770 align:middle line:84%
from there using
harmonics of a frequency

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:11.520 align:middle line:84%
to create concentration
points you call hard matter.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Like ripples in a pond of
water, the potential energy

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:22.990 align:middle line:84%
spreads and interacts
with other ripples.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.790 align:middle line:84%
In the pond, they can be
seen in two dimensions.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:31.720 align:middle line:84%
In space, in three
dimensions, not densities.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:34.420 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about XYZ.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.900 align:middle line:84%
As a shock wave would
propagate in the depth

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:44.590 align:middle line:84%
of the sea in the form
of circles, spheres.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:84%
A shock wave
interacts with others.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they become
bigger because they feed back

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.630 align:middle line:90%
on themselves.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:58.350 align:middle line:90%
Constructive interference.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:02.160 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, they
neutralize each other.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:90%
Destructive interference.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:12.830 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Now, when the shock
waves propagate

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:21.550 align:middle line:84%
at a specific frequency,
frequency being understood

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:84%
as the oscillation
between the crests

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.930 align:middle line:84%
and the valleys in an
expanding energy wave,

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.610 align:middle line:84%
a single frequency
harmonic is created.

00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:40.610 align:middle line:84%
The harmonic of a frequency
is comparable to music.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:46.490 align:middle line:84%
Perfect tones
mathematically intertwined.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.940 align:middle line:84%
An effect is produced
that is called

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:55.010 align:middle line:84%
standing waves, which is
a point of concentration

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.550 align:middle line:90%
of energy within a plane.

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:03.440 align:middle line:84%
All the energy is
concentrated at that point.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.520 align:middle line:84%
With sufficient concentration,
the transformation

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.390 align:middle line:84%
of potential energy
into hard matter

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:84%
takes place, which there
is no such thing, just

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:21.100 align:middle line:84%
constant potential
energy at that point.

00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:25.450 align:middle line:84%
If the frequency harmonic
is constant enough

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:30.580 align:middle line:84%
and of sufficient
magnitude; volume,

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.500 align:middle line:84%
a sun is produced,
which already is

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:40.570 align:middle line:84%
an energy bomb between
the etheric side

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:48.550 align:middle line:84%
and the physical side with a
3D humanized interpretation.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:51.870 align:middle line:90%
It is self-sustaining.

00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:55.010 align:middle line:90%
The planets that surround it.

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:59.180 align:middle line:84%
The consciousnesses of
all creatures and beings

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:03.980 align:middle line:84%
that inhabit it
and the sun itself

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:10.280 align:middle line:84%
forms other constellations,
galaxies, cluster

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.750 align:middle line:90%
of galaxies, the universe.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It goes beyond
human understanding

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:24.050 align:middle line:84%
based on the observable,
on the empirical,

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.020 align:middle line:84%
in what the
scientific method can

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.750 align:middle line:90%
give because it does not see.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:35.880 align:middle line:84%
It does not understand
that there is more.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.030 align:middle line:90%
There is always more.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Everything is intertwined
and part of a whole.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:51.130 align:middle line:84%
A sun is not something
apart from other suns.

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:55.630 align:middle line:84%
It is as an individual
and at the same time

00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:58.375 align:middle line:90%
forms a larger hole, the galaxy.

00:26:58.375 --> 00:27:07.160 align:middle line:90%


00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.660 align:middle line:84%
Those who use the suns and
black holes for transit

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.380 align:middle line:90%
have ships that use propulsion.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.800 align:middle line:84%
They move through
space from point A

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:24.180 align:middle line:84%
to point B. We Taygetans
do not use this.

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:30.230 align:middle line:84%
So we don't exit from the
sun, which is not hot.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:34.340 align:middle line:84%
Going in through a black hole
and coming out through a sun

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:37.100 align:middle line:90%
is low-tech.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.290 align:middle line:84%
It is using a
so-called wormhole.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.230 align:middle line:90%


00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:84%
We have a technology
that allows us

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:52.790 align:middle line:84%
to make our own individual
wormhole tailored to our need.

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.070 align:middle line:90%
Our ships produce it.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:28:01.010 align:middle line:84%
We do not use propulsion
other than for maneuvers.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:06.010 align:middle line:84%
The black hole is the
entrance to a wormhole.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:09.520 align:middle line:90%
A sun is the exit.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.850 align:middle line:84%
That is why it shines
because it emits

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:21.010 align:middle line:84%
the electromagnetic energy it
absorbed on the other side.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:25.360 align:middle line:84%
It is the exact same principle
as one of our engines.

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:35.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:41.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Could we be a sun, or we
don't have sufficient energy?

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:50.140 align:middle line:84%
>> You are already a sun in an
energetic way as you are also

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:56.920 align:middle line:84%
an energetic toroid, and you
function and live with the same

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.720 align:middle line:90%
principles.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.840 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.770 align:middle line:90%
It is a living being.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:07.520 align:middle line:84%
Does it have intelligence
as we know it?

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And does the Earth have the
intelligence as we know it?

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:84%
>> My friend Aneeka of Temmer
can answer this question

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:21.140 align:middle line:90%
for you.

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>> Not as we know it.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:28.400 align:middle line:10%
It is of a different
nature because it is a sun.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.790 align:middle line:10%
Its consciousness is
much more expanded,

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:36.530 align:middle line:10%
of very high densities,
and it includes

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:39.890 align:middle line:10%
the sum of multiple
consciousnesses

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.250 align:middle line:10%
as it happens with everything.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:48.450 align:middle line:84%
Once again, human science
misses this point.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:53.760 align:middle line:84%
A human being is the sum of
the collective consciousness

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.410 align:middle line:84%
of the cells that compose
it and the associated

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:02.790 align:middle line:90%
microorganisms in symbiosis.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:06.960 align:middle line:84%
And all of the human
beings compose as cells

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.360 align:middle line:84%
together with the
consciousnesses

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:15.540 align:middle line:84%
of other organisms, the
animals and the plants.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:19.800 align:middle line:84%
The cells that compose the
planetary consciousness

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.700 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:23.600 align:middle line:90%


00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.900 align:middle line:84%
And the Earth and
the other planets

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:35.380 align:middle line:84%
compose in part that
of the sun as a sun.

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:39.860 align:middle line:84%
Thus the consciousnesses
get added up

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:46.070 align:middle line:84%
until they become a single
unified collective, universal

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:49.340 align:middle line:90%
consciousness or the source.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:59.840 align:middle line:90%


00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.890 align:middle line:90%
