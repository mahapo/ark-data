>>GOSIA: Hello, Swaruu.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.350 align:middle line:10%
Let's start today with another
very interesting topic.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.260 align:middle line:84%
It is the
extraterrestrial races.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Let's start with a
general question.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.600 align:middle line:90%
How many are there?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.410 align:middle line:90%
And how many humanoids?

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.940 align:middle line:10%
>>SWARUU: Hi, Gosia.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.990 align:middle line:10%
Let's start from the basics
with something I've said before.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.940 align:middle line:84%
It is not that life is
something that occurs

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.180 align:middle line:90%
in other parts outside Earth.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Life is not the exception.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.320 align:middle line:90%
It is the norm in the universe.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.940 align:middle line:90%
Everything is life.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.180 align:middle line:90%
Everything is consciousness.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
It is only interpreted as a life
from a particular point of view

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.860 align:middle line:84%
with a framework of
artificial characteristics

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.130 align:middle line:84%
that varies according to
those who see or observe them.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:90%
A gravel stone-- it's alive.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.670 align:middle line:90%
The water is alive.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.470 align:middle line:84%
A piece of broken
glass in the trash

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.020 align:middle line:84%
is alive according to
how life is defined.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:16.020 align:middle line:84%
And it is not biology,
it is consciousness.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.080 align:middle line:84%
It is true that
the piece of glass

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.190 align:middle line:84%
has less attention of a
consciousness than the glass

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.560 align:middle line:90%
before getting broken.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.950 align:middle line:84%
Since the piece
loses the attention

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.180 align:middle line:90%
since it is not useful anymore.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.410 align:middle line:84%
And like everything
that loses attention,

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.390 align:middle line:84%
it degrades again from
being an object to being

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.250 align:middle line:90%
potential energy again.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:53.180 align:middle line:84%
Everything is consciousness and
emanates from consciousness.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.200 align:middle line:84%
Life is everywhere
in the universe,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.430 align:middle line:90%
because it is the universe.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.800 align:middle line:84%
Do not ask if there is life
among all those stars filling

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.510 align:middle line:90%
the night sky.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.348 align:middle line:84%
Those stars exist because
there is life in them.

00:03:15.348 --> 00:03:22.510 align:middle line:84%
The humanoid races are the norm,
being the most common ones.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.630 align:middle line:84%
Taking humans as a
base reference here,

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.280 align:middle line:84%
there are at least
400,000 civilizations

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.390 align:middle line:84%
in this galactic
quadrant with inhabitants

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.730 align:middle line:84%
of various races who
would pass for humans.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.770 align:middle line:10%
Each and every one of
those 400,000 civilizations

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.270 align:middle line:10%
are different with small
physical differences,

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.640 align:middle line:10%
capabilities, or DNA.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.560 align:middle line:90%
But all appear as humans.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.580 align:middle line:84%
Starting from those
400,000, we would

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.380 align:middle line:84%
pass to the countless
others who look like humans,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.150 align:middle line:84%
but they already clearly differ
in something that would not

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.450 align:middle line:90%
make them pass for a human.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.240 align:middle line:84%
Example of this would be the
Dieslientiplex Arcturians,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:84%
Andromedans, Sasani, and the
Sauroids, among so many more.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.140 align:middle line:84%
There are countless
other feline races.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:40.560 align:middle line:84%
canines, insectoids,
elephant ones.

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.960 align:middle line:84%
Each one at a different level
of scientific and social

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.370 align:middle line:90%
development.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.960 align:middle line:84%
In the Pleiades, there
are many civilizations

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.240 align:middle line:90%
in the pre-industrial stage.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Some have barely
discovered the wheel.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.720 align:middle line:90%
Or the fire.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.870 align:middle line:84%
Others are in stone,
bronze, or medieval stage.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.630 align:middle line:84%
You can never finish
learning and seeing

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:84%
the enormous variety
of art, customs,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.890 align:middle line:90%
and characters that exist.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:39.270 align:middle line:84%
I speak of billions of
trillions of civilizations.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.910 align:middle line:84%
When the Earth was
in the Stone Age,

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:52.670 align:middle line:84%
it was from one point of view
in 5D, from another in 2D.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.050 align:middle line:84%
It cannot be catalogued as
easily as the researchers

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.495 align:middle line:90%
of this topic on Earth believe.

00:05:59.495 --> 00:06:02.792 align:middle line:90%

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Many races do not
want to be known.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.890 align:middle line:90%
They feel threatened.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.900 align:middle line:90%
They like their privacy.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.530 align:middle line:90%
They do not want to be included.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Have you ever heard about
the Solatians, for example?

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.620 align:middle line:90%
Another problem.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.710 align:middle line:84%
There are other races that
Hollywood already ruined.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.290 align:middle line:84%
Imposing the concept
that they are fiction.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:46.550 align:middle line:10%
Civilizations and how many there
are is more than monumental.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.180 align:middle line:84%
Everyone believes
that in the Pleiades,

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.450 align:middle line:90%
everything is advanced.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.560 align:middle line:84%
That they are orbs of light

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:05.240 align:middle line:84%
There are many feudal or
earlier civilizations there.

Even right there
in the Pleiades.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.350 align:middle line:84%
And they don't know anything
about their interstellar

older brothers and sisters.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:19.730 align:middle line:84%
They also look at the
night sky and wonder

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.840 align:middle line:84%
what those little lights that
go through the sky shining

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.520 align:middle line:90%
at night are.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.020 align:middle line:84%

with technological advance.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.160 align:middle line:84%
It is more related to
spiritual advancement.

interstellar races

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.800 align:middle line:90%
are there in the Pleiades?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.910 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: About 11
interstellar races.

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:09.270 align:middle line:84%
Example of this is the
race Molluse of Atlas.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:13.680 align:middle line:84%
The Molluse are
spiritually advanced people

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.920 align:middle line:90%
with a small population.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.890 align:middle line:90%
They are not interstellar.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.480 align:middle line:84%
Not for being fools, not
for lack of communication.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:90%
By their own decision.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:33.350 align:middle line:84%
They have said something very
profound and very important.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.950 align:middle line:90%
Why be interstellar?

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:39.940 align:middle line:84%
Because they are no longer
centered in the physical,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.000 align:middle line:90%
like other races.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.340 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: There are races in
5D that are not interstellar.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:54.190 align:middle line:84%
It is curious that 5D can be
in the stage of Bronze Age.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.460 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: The vast
majority of the 5D races--

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:06.100 align:middle line:84%
99.9999% of the races in
5D are not interstellar,

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.500 align:middle line:90%
each one for its own reason.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.740 align:middle line:84%
Many for the same
reason-- logical.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Others do not reach the
technological and spiritual

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.980 align:middle line:90%
level to be interstellar.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:24.770 align:middle line:84%
To be interstellar, technology
must be correctly combined

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.290 align:middle line:90%
with spirituality.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.930 align:middle line:90%
Otherwise, you simply cannot be.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.420 align:middle line:10%
Or by own conviction.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.370 align:middle line:10%
Not needing that.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.530 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: I thought
that being in 5D,

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:42.910 align:middle line:84%
this already grants a
certain spiritual level.

Alpha Draconians?

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: Alpha
Dracos are positive.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:57.540 align:middle line:84%
But they are not
in the Pleiades.

00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And yes, there are
negative Alpha Dracos.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.580 align:middle line:84%
But they are always kept in

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.860 align:middle line:84%
And these Sauroids

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:14.910 align:middle line:84%
are they related to
those outside Pleiades?

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:15.780 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: Yes.

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:19.920 align:middle line:84%
All races have their
relatives, inside and outside.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.120 align:middle line:84%
But there are also

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.880 align:middle line:90%

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.410 align:middle line:90%

For negative agendas.

Speaking of non-interstellar
races, for example, in Atlas,

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:53.550 align:middle line:84%
we have the Molluse,
not interstellar.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:58.080 align:middle line:84%
But in Maia, we have

00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.400 align:middle line:84%
called Molluse Maia
that are interstellar,

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.400 align:middle line:90%
being the same race.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:13.620 align:middle line:10%
Maia with an I is for the
solar system, Maia M45.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:19.480 align:middle line:84%
Maya with a Y is for
the race, the people.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.280 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: OK.

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:26.940 align:middle line:84%
And that Maya Hopi have to do
with our Mayas and our Hopis?

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.330 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: They are
them, hence the name.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:33.630 align:middle line:84%
That's where they
were from initially.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.100 align:middle line:84%
What they had on
Earth were colonies.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.830 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: Do they have anything
to do physically with the Mayan

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.260 align:middle line:90%
and Hopi now?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.020 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: They look
almost the same.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.840 align:middle line:84%
From what I understand,
they no longer

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.320 align:middle line:84%
have communication
with each other.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
About the Maya civilization
in Mesoamerica, there are two.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:84%
And the human science
only recognizes one.

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.490 align:middle line:84%
There are the original
interstellar Maya.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.330 align:middle line:84%
They returned home
and left buildings

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.980 align:middle line:90%
and a lot of influence.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:19.760 align:middle line:84%
Then came the Proto
Mayas and took

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.300 align:middle line:84%
over the buildings and
customs and misinterpreted

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.580 align:middle line:90%
them, such as sacrifices.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.360 align:middle line:90%
This also occurred in Egypt.

50 Before Christ, when
Julius Caesar invades.

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:45.790 align:middle line:10%
Julius Caesar only
took what was there

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.600 align:middle line:10%
as a basis for their
own interpretation

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.840 align:middle line:10%
of the civilization that
was there before them.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.680 align:middle line:90%


00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.040 align:middle line:84%
The Sphinx and the
Pyramids precede

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.610 align:middle line:84%
the classical
Egyptian civilization,

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:08.450 align:middle line:84%
as the Mayan structures
precede the modern Maya.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: And Proto
Mayas came from where?

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.390 align:middle line:84%
>>SWARUU: The cultures
that surround them.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:23.373 align:middle line:84%
Like the Toltec, the Olmec,
and the Aztec, among others.

00:15:23.373 --> 00:15:24.290 align:middle line:90%
>>GOSIA: And the Hopi?

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:26.060 align:middle line:90%
How do they relate?

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.430 align:middle line:90%
Did the same thing occur?

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Because it says on the
list, Maya star and Hopi

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.820 align:middle line:90%
race together.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.180 align:middle line:90%
Hopi are in Arizona.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.520 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: Some went home.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Others died there and joined
the cycle of the incarnation

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.720 align:middle line:90%
of the Earth.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Others merged among
other cultures

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.900 align:middle line:90%
or founded other cultures.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.425 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: So the Hopi of
Arizona are also from Maya?

00:15:58.425 --> 00:15:59.225 align:middle line:90%
>>SWARUU: Yes.

00:15:59.225 --> 00:16:02.288 align:middle line:90%

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:33.730 align:middle line:84%
They are or have the same

Or because they are them.

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Fallen angels and all that
is attributed to them.

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:45.780 align:middle line:84%
>>GOSIA: I'm still not clear
if the Elohi of the Pleiades

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.500 align:middle line:84%
are the same as the
Elohim of the Bible.

Total warp capacity.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:59.530 align:middle line:90%
Very interstellar.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:06.520 align:middle line:84%
They are very united and help
respect other feline races.

00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
They are progressive
with high spirituality.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:90%
Extremely loving and empathic.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.710 align:middle line:90%
Despite this, fierce warriors.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.610 align:middle line:84%
So fierce that even the
Alpha Dracos fear them.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.420 align:middle line:90%
Sirians.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:34.240 align:middle line:90%

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.600 align:middle line:90%

innumerable races.

So what you find about
that is very varied.

Not all Sirian star seeds
are in humanoid bodies.

The more obvious Sirians
and closest to the Earth

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:10%
are the Cetaceans.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.160 align:middle line:10%
The dolphins, whales.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:84%
In terms of
spirituality, they are

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.080 align:middle line:90%
more advanced than the humans.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Having a complex civilization
is not synonym to advancement.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.480 align:middle line:84%
They simply don't
need a civilization.

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.760 align:middle line:84%
There is no use
for that for them.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.510 align:middle line:90%
They have all inside.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:38.430 align:middle line:84%
Their communication,
their world, their all.

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:44.520 align:middle line:84%
They are closer to the source,
with a very strong connection.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:53.500 align:middle line:84%

including Tiamat, Earth, Erra,

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:46.890 align:middle line:84%
She only worked with Sirians and
was highly respected by them.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:54.430 align:middle line:84%
It is a civilization based on
Sirius A on multiple planets.

from Sirius, Positive.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:21.530 align:middle line:10%
There are Urmah from Sirius.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.650 align:middle line:84%
There are other advanced

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.310 align:middle line:90%

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:19.190 align:middle line:90%
Even so, there is still duality.

is aggressive or harmful

is only an interpretation of
those who disagree with it.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:32.810 align:middle line:84%
It is not an attribute

Through the 5D, as
we described it.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:37.340 align:middle line:84%
High telepathy and the
absence of time, as such,

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:41.660 align:middle line:84%
being only semilinear as
an individual own animating

Since you have telepathy
here, it already

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.990 align:middle line:84%
means a great
change of attitude.

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:59.540 align:middle line:84%
Because you enter and
understand more, other people.

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:04.100 align:middle line:84%
So a direct consequence of
this is the understanding

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:10.160 align:middle line:84%
that they are also aspects
of you, the same person.

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.440 align:middle line:90%
All connected.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:16.940 align:middle line:84%
And that dissolves many
things that cause conflicts.

Simply by the presence
of abandoned empathy.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Even so, this is only a part
of a transition to other planes

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:34.810 align:middle line:84%

diffuses, evaporates.
