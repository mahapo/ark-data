00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.960 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, Swaruu.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.530 align:middle line:10%
I am so happy I can be
chatting with you again.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.030 align:middle line:10%
Today, we will talk
about the densities.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.410 align:middle line:84%
First, I would like to clarify
why you prefer to call them

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.850 align:middle line:90%
densities and not dimensions.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Does it have to do with not
wanting to be mixing it up

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.440 align:middle line:84%
with our mathematical
perception of dimensions?

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.570 align:middle line:10%
Dimensions are, for
me, more like talking

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.460 align:middle line:10%
about geometric and mathematics.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.050 align:middle line:90%
One dimension is a line, x.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.300 align:middle line:84%
Two dimension is a grid
on a flat surface, x-y.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:39.300 align:middle line:10%
Third dimension is a position
within a square using the x, y,

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.770 align:middle line:10%
and z lines.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.560 align:middle line:90%


00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.190 align:middle line:84%
So this has nothing
or not much to do

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.510 align:middle line:84%
with what we are talking
about, as in 2D, 3D and 5D

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.070 align:middle line:90%
frequency realms.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.250 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Humans confuse dimensions
with densities.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.880 align:middle line:84%
In Earth physics,
they see a square

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.730 align:middle line:90%
on a paper as a 2D object.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.780 align:middle line:90%
A 3D square is a cube.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:90%
A 4D square is a tesseract.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.780 align:middle line:84%
And they go on to 8D geometry,
all based on mathematics.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.790 align:middle line:84%
But you must notice that they
are all physical objects that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.850 align:middle line:84%
have nothing to do with what
I've been talking about.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:44.960 align:middle line:90%


00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.540 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so what are
you referring, then,

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.730 align:middle line:90%
when you talk about densities?

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.100 align:middle line:90%
What are they?

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.630 align:middle line:90%
>> I will make it simple.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.220 align:middle line:90%
There are no densities.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.230 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, so what do you refer to
then when you say 3D, 5D, 7D,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.300 align:middle line:90%
et cetera?

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.040 align:middle line:90%
>> All those numbers--

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.860 align:middle line:84%
first, second, third,
fourth, fifth density--

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
are only concepts humans
came up with as an attempt

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.400 align:middle line:84%
to understand something
bigger than themselves.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
It's only one great
potential energy

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.420 align:middle line:84%
curve from slow frequency
to very high frequency.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.170 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.950 align:middle line:90%
Take a ruler.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:84%
Your third density is
only between centimeter 3

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.610 align:middle line:90%
and centimeter 4.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.470 align:middle line:84%
All the rest is what humans
cannot see and cannot

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.030 align:middle line:90%
understand.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.530 align:middle line:84%
They cannot see it because
they do not have the frequency

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.760 align:middle line:90%
to see it.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.270 align:middle line:84%
Imagine a car running so fast
that you can barely see it.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.680 align:middle line:84%
If it runs even faster,
you will no longer see it.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.610 align:middle line:90%
So it's not in your frequency.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:84%
But if you jump into another
car and go next to it

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.160 align:middle line:84%
as fast, that same car will
appear as if it was stopped,

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.980 align:middle line:90%
motionless.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.590 align:middle line:90%


00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.210 align:middle line:84%
>> So densities could be
regarded as lower or higher

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.070 align:middle line:90%
frequencies, then.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.390 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:90%
A frequency is a density.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.160 align:middle line:84%
And a density is a
range of a frequency.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:84%
So 3D is only within a
certain vibration frequency.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.080 align:middle line:90%
And what is that?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.980 align:middle line:84%
The cycles per second
of the oscillations

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:84%
of the atomic
structure of matter.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.240 align:middle line:84%
>> So your frequency
is higher, yes?

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.200 align:middle line:90%
I mean, faster.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.000 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.840 align:middle line:84%
5D matter oscillates
much faster than in 3D.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So there is no frontier
between the densities.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:28.370 align:middle line:84%
It's all one gradient, one
whole universe, oneness, source.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:84%
People in each
density can only see

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.720 align:middle line:84%
what is in their
range of perception.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Things that are strange for
you, strange and not empirically

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.560 align:middle line:84%
provable, are simple
life facts for me.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.070 align:middle line:84%
It's all a gradient
of frequency,

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.215 align:middle line:90%
like the dial in your radio.

00:05:51.215 --> 00:06:01.740 align:middle line:90%


00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Let's talk about 4D.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.200 align:middle line:90%
Can you describe what it is?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.930 align:middle line:84%
>> 4D is a lighter
version of 3D.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.400 align:middle line:84%
It's what they call the
astral or lower astral.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:24.480 align:middle line:10%
It's just a frequency above 3D,
and there are many creatures,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.900 align:middle line:10%
many scary ones in 4D.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.280 align:middle line:84%
But people cannot see them, even
if they do interact with them

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.960 align:middle line:90%
every day.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Now, 4D is the frontier, or
frequency border, between 5D--

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.930 align:middle line:90%
normal space, normal existence--

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.350 align:middle line:90%
and 3D.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.080 align:middle line:90%
Take it as a buffer zone--

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.565 align:middle line:90%
not quite 3D, not quite 5D.

00:06:56.565 --> 00:06:59.100 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, someone in 5D can
perceive everything

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:13.695 align:middle line:84%
in 4D, 3D, 2D, and 1D, but not
6D and above because number 5

00:07:13.695 --> 00:07:21.660 align:middle line:84%
is made of numbers 1, 2,
3, and 4, and itself, 5.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.990 align:middle line:84%
When you are in any
density, you are

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.510 align:middle line:90%
in a frequency matched to it.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.630 align:middle line:84%
So as with the
example of the cars,

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.560 align:middle line:84%
you can see what's
there because you

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:84%
are moving as fast as the rest
in that particular frequency.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.640 align:middle line:90%


00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.000 align:middle line:90%
>> What creatures occupy the 4D?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:90%
And can they see us?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:58.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Fourth can see the
third, but not fifth.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:04.810 align:middle line:84%
So the lizards in the 4D
cannot touch us Taygetans.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:06.620 align:middle line:90%
But we can them.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:10.360 align:middle line:90%
So that's a great advantage.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.360 align:middle line:90%
All kinds of creatures.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:17.320 align:middle line:84%
See it as populated by as
many variations of creatures

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.490 align:middle line:90%
you have in 3D, but different.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:27.490 align:middle line:84%
You have astral slugs,
leeches in your etheric

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:32.360 align:middle line:84%
field, all kinds of
parasitic creatures.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:38.559 align:middle line:84%
>> Why do they get born
in 4D and not in 3D or 5D?

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:44.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Because 4D was a match
for their consciousness.

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.710 align:middle line:84%
It's same with
any other density.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
There are all kinds
of beautiful creatures

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:57.100 align:middle line:84%
there as well, things that
people see as mythology only--

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:04.000 align:middle line:84%
creatures like elves,
trolls, dragons, fairies,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.710 align:middle line:84%
and so many birds
you don't have in 3D.

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.010 align:middle line:84%
>> And the beings
who occupied the 4D--

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.470 align:middle line:90%
are they stuck there, too?

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.610 align:middle line:90%
How come they are limited to 4D?

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.695 align:middle line:84%
>> They cannot
see beyond the 4D.

00:09:20.695 --> 00:09:23.380 align:middle line:90%


00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Did this happen as a result
of locking us in the 3D?

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.290 align:middle line:84%
The 3D lock on Earth affects
their existence, too,

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:34.090 align:middle line:90%
in other words?

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:35.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Correct.

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.540 align:middle line:90%
They will also be free.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.530 align:middle line:84%
Reptilian consciousness
is locked in 4D,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:46.060 align:middle line:84%
even if they are 3D
creatures as well.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:51.430 align:middle line:84%
See 4D as the zone where the
matrix frequency is getting

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:56.830 align:middle line:84%
weaker, so it cannot suppress
5D enough in the frequency

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.020 align:middle line:90%
compatible to 4D.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.760 align:middle line:90%
The 4D leaks into existence.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.320 align:middle line:84%
4D is not supposed
to exist, yet it

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.080 align:middle line:84%
does because the
system is not perfect.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:17.050 align:middle line:84%
So it cannot suppress
all the 5D frequencies,

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:21.170 align:middle line:84%
only some of them
in certain areas.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:27.760 align:middle line:84%
So those are the 4D,
or weak matrix areas.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.800 align:middle line:84%
Imagine stars, for
example, being 5D.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.900 align:middle line:84%
On a clear day, you cannot see
them because the sun is too

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.650 align:middle line:90%
bright, and it outshines them.

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:46.540 align:middle line:84%
You cannot see the stars,
but they are still there.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.360 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes, you
can see the moon--

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.800 align:middle line:84%
not as clear as at
night, but it's there,

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:59.155 align:middle line:84%
as the sun is not bright enough
to completely hide it, 4D.

00:10:59.155 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:90%


00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Are people there in the 4D?

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:15.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Examples of 4D people
would be the Agarthans.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.630 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.910 align:middle line:84%
As we ascend, will we be able
to see all those 4D creatures--

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:24.970 align:middle line:90%
elves, gnomes, et cetera?

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and it's
already happening.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.545 align:middle line:84%
That's why people see strange
creatures all over the place.

00:11:32.545 --> 00:11:35.050 align:middle line:90%


00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:39.670 align:middle line:84%
>> Is the fourth density
where we go when we sleep?

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.570 align:middle line:84%
>> When you sleep, you go
anywhere your consciousness

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:48.640 align:middle line:84%
and your frequency and frequency
you have at that moment may

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.170 align:middle line:90%
take you.

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:52.960 align:middle line:90%
You are source there.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.300 align:middle line:90%
You are free.

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
That's why you manifest
anything you want,

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:04.970 align:middle line:84%
because you are in a very high
density and on the other side.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:10.070 align:middle line:84%
The only reason you are
manifesting 3D-like dreams,

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:14.630 align:middle line:84%
like cars, trees,
water, or a city street,

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:19.370 align:middle line:84%
is because that's what
your awareness and focus is

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:25.510 align:middle line:84%
on because you are
having a 3D experience.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.790 align:middle line:84%
It's said on Earth
that when you sleep,

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:32.860 align:middle line:84%
you go to some
specific astral realm.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.480 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's how humans
and their dissecting ideas

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.365 align:middle line:90%
limits things.

00:12:38.365 --> 00:12:45.350 align:middle line:90%


00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> What about 1D and 2D?

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.160 align:middle line:90%
What is that?

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.370 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are three related
ways of seeing densities--

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:04.540 align:middle line:84%
one, the human math way; two,
the survival mode consciousness

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:12.220 align:middle line:84%
way; three, the frequency,
ever-increasing curve.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:17.770 align:middle line:84%
As in the way to look at
densities number two, in 1D,

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.110 align:middle line:90%
you are a mineral.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.580 align:middle line:84%
You are, and you don't
know that you are.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.470 align:middle line:84%
1D would be like
quartz crystals.

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:36.700 align:middle line:84%
2D is a state of consciousness,
thinking very linear, enclosed

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:42.640 align:middle line:84%
in duality, not thinking
of other options,

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.670 align:middle line:90%
very down to survival only.

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:48.980 align:middle line:90%
Many creatures live like that.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say many
people as well.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:56.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they are, because their
consciousness is still stuck

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:01.510 align:middle line:90%
in 2D or lower 3D.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:05.470 align:middle line:84%
In 2D, you are only
starting to be aware

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:10.150 align:middle line:84%
that you are something
separate to the others.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:15.970 align:middle line:84%
In 3D, for example, they tend
to think only in three ways.

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.836 align:middle line:90%
Can I eat that?

00:14:17.836 --> 00:14:19.330 align:middle line:90%
Can that eat me?

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.050 align:middle line:90%
And can I mate with that?

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:26.635 align:middle line:90%
2D is only die or survive mode.

00:14:26.635 --> 00:14:29.350 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:84%
3D is more of a die,
survive, or thrive.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.360 align:middle line:90%
Thrive would be mating.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:84%
3D-- you have an
identity, as you know now,

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.830 align:middle line:90%
that you are an ego.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.950 align:middle line:84%
You are you, and
there are others.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:55.630 align:middle line:84%
4D-- there is more, but you
have an ego, an identity.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.710 align:middle line:84%
You are starting to be aware
that you are not only you,

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.820 align:middle line:90%
but you are part of others.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:11.440 align:middle line:84%
5D-- you have a clear identity
but no longer an ego as such,

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.170 align:middle line:84%
and you might know your
other identities as well.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.430 align:middle line:84%
You are more of a
conscious self, an I,

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:25.910 align:middle line:84%
and you are aware
that you both are you,

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.240 align:middle line:90%
and you are others as well.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:32.960 align:middle line:90%


00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Which one is the
way you perceive it?

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Because from your
explanation, I see it

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.410 align:middle line:84%
as a mix of number
two and three--

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:45.850 align:middle line:84%
consciousness state
and frequency rate--

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
with the two probably
being strictly related.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.580 align:middle line:84%
>> My mind sees things
holographically.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.990 align:middle line:84%
I include all three
descriptions as attempts

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:middle line:90%
to understand the same.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.030 align:middle line:90%
I cannot separate them.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:07.540 align:middle line:84%
I use parts of
each one as I need

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and when I need to
describe a density.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:16.210 align:middle line:84%
I see them all as parts
of the explanation.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.520 align:middle line:84%
If I had to choose,
I would choose

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.260 align:middle line:90%
the spiritual explanation.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:31.260 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, let's move on
to the 6D and above.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:38.600 align:middle line:90%
What's in 6D?

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:43.000 align:middle line:84%
And can you communicate
with beings there?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Only if they want to.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:54.430 align:middle line:84%
See it as the 5D
astral, as 4D is for 3D.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:17:01.300 align:middle line:84%
It's there, but not entirely
physical from my point of view,

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:06.650 align:middle line:84%
although from their
perspective, they are physical.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.880 align:middle line:84%
The higher you
go, the less dense

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.900 align:middle line:90%
you are, and rules change.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.619 align:middle line:84%
You may still look
like you have a body,

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:24.109 align:middle line:84%
but you are nearly entirely
energy, manifestation

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:34.450 align:middle line:84%
of an intention, eternal and
the conscious that you are.

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:41.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So material universe in
your universe is mostly 5D,

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.520 align:middle line:84%
but there are other
material universes.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they are material, but
only from their perspective.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:56.020 align:middle line:90%
From ours, they are energy--

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle line:84%
not in this plane,
outside the rules

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.995 align:middle line:90%
we follow in the material world.

00:18:02.995 --> 00:18:13.320 align:middle line:90%


00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Who lives in six,
seven, eight, nine density?

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:22.780 align:middle line:84%
And how many densities are there
until you reach the source?

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.030 align:middle line:90%
Any specific races?

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:26.660 align:middle line:90%


00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:90%
>> As I said, it's a gradient.

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:36.650 align:middle line:84%
So it never ends, as it probably
goes in a circle spiral, where

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.320 align:middle line:84%
at the point in
the one universe,

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:45.470 align:middle line:84%
the highest part is the lower
part of another, or probably

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:46.730 align:middle line:90%
the same one.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:53.690 align:middle line:84%
Both apply-- a
circle, a spiral--

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:59.540 align:middle line:84%
and it can also be seen that
you are reaching source, yes,

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:84%
but as it's a spiral, probably
source can never be reached.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Better said, source
is all-inclusive.

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:13.130 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Those are the realms
of light beings

00:19:16.370 --> 00:19:21.980 align:middle line:84%
who only take shape when
they want to, like whether he

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.720 align:middle line:90%
wants to talk to you.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Some examples are many Yena--

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:27.940 align:middle line:90%
Alcyone mainly.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Also, many Amelie
from Aldebaran.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:46.130 align:middle line:84%
You can reach source because
you already are source,

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.490 align:middle line:84%
and there are no
other universes.

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:54.380 align:middle line:90%
It is all one big wholeness.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:20:00.200 align:middle line:84%
If they are others, then they
are, again, parts of the whole

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:03.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm talking about.

00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:06.480 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you ever talked to them?

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
>> They are those who
guide us all the time.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:17.870 align:middle line:84%
And yes, I have talked to
a 6D-7D being not long ago.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.540 align:middle line:84%
>> Do you have conversations
with them like us now

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.140 align:middle line:90%
or telepathically?

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.260 align:middle line:90%
And did you see them?

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.140 align:middle line:90%
>> In astral only.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:30.180 align:middle line:90%
>> You mean your astral, 6D.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.620 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, 6D-7D astral.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:39.120 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes they may hack
our communication devices,

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.670 align:middle line:90%
but it's rare.

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:45.000 align:middle line:84%
You must raise your
frequency, and they

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.920 align:middle line:84%
must lower theirs in order
to interface, to connect.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:59.150 align:middle line:90%


00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.410 align:middle line:84%
>> Have you considered that
perhaps you are stuck there,

00:21:03.410 --> 00:21:08.300 align:middle line:84%
like us here, due to
something they have done,

00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:90%
locking you in the 5D?

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:16.370 align:middle line:84%
Or do you think existing
within 5D is something natural?

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:21.230 align:middle line:84%
>> As there is no time there,
there is no point in solving

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.040 align:middle line:84%
the problem in their past
because there is no past

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:29.600 align:middle line:90%
for them, not even perceptually.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:35.300 align:middle line:84%
5D is the natural manifestation
into matter, often

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.910 align:middle line:90%
a etheric being.

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.930 align:middle line:84%
>> But I understood
they also have matter.

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:46.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Only from their
point of view.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:51.660 align:middle line:84%
7D-- there is only
energy and consciousness.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:56.490 align:middle line:84%
There is matter only as
the result of an intention,

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:02.850 align:middle line:84%
to manifest in the hard
matter universe such as 5D.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:09.410 align:middle line:84%
It's with intent,
only with intent.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:13.160 align:middle line:84%
>> You said earlier that
frequency is oscillations

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.720 align:middle line:90%
of matter.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.920 align:middle line:84%
Does matter at some point
disappear completely?

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:24.590 align:middle line:84%
Or is it always matter
for the level it occupies?

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.890 align:middle line:84%
When matter oscillates too
fast, it becomes energy.

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:35.640 align:middle line:84%
So it gradually
stops being solid

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.230 align:middle line:84%
and becomes only
potential energy.

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:45.900 align:middle line:84%
There, you must focus a
lot with intent so matter

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:51.210 align:middle line:84%
manifests in the spot
and shape you want it to.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:55.350 align:middle line:90%
They just are, and they know.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:59.970 align:middle line:84%
They are no longer
interested in anything matter

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:03.120 align:middle line:90%
can give them as an experience.

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.530 align:middle line:90%
They are pure consciousness.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:12.270 align:middle line:84%
There is no matter at
any point or density.

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:17.220 align:middle line:84%
Matter is only an
idea, a concept held

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:21.390 align:middle line:90%
by a consciousness with intent.

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:26.260 align:middle line:84%
>> You now said there, you
must focus a lot with intent

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:30.780 align:middle line:84%
so matter manifests in the
spot and shape you want it to.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:34.410 align:middle line:84%
But that shape--
will it still be 7D,

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:90%
or will it manifest in 5D?

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:43.320 align:middle line:84%
>> It will be any
density, including 3D.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.470 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to focus
anything or on anything.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.210 align:middle line:84%
You only have to be
yourself, and everything will

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.080 align:middle line:90%
fall into place around you.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.890 align:middle line:84%
>> I guess I'm trying to
determine at what D matter

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:02.360 align:middle line:90%
ceases to exist as we know it.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:07.970 align:middle line:84%
>> I would say, during the
transition between 6D and 7D.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.270 align:middle line:84%
Matter stops
existing at any point

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:16.430 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of the
observer decides it is so.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:18.950 align:middle line:90%
It is not something fixed.

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:24.620 align:middle line:84%
It is relative to the
observer and its ideas,

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.735 align:middle line:90%
as matter is only that--

00:24:27.735 --> 00:24:28.535 align:middle line:90%
an idea.

00:24:28.535 --> 00:24:37.920 align:middle line:90%


00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:42.470 align:middle line:84%
>> Do they have individualized
perception of self?

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:49.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The self starts to evaporate
as you feel you are everyone,

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and that defines your
new expanded self.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.290 align:middle line:90%
>> At what D does it happen?

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:02.410 align:middle line:84%
>> You can notice
that even in 5D,

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:06.850 align:middle line:84%
where you are starting to manage
being more than one person

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.190 align:middle line:90%
at a time.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.650 align:middle line:90%
It happens gradually.

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:16.510 align:middle line:84%
That happens in
or at any density.

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:22.310 align:middle line:84%
It is relative to the
observer's consciousness.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.440 align:middle line:84%
>> From what you
told me earlier,

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:30.390 align:middle line:84%
you experienced yourself as a
7D being in another existence.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.450 align:middle line:84%
How do you remember
the 7D plane?

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:35.070 align:middle line:90%


00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:40.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I remember that it was
thick in love and peace,

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:44.640 align:middle line:84%
as in so much you could wrap
yourself with it as a warm

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.130 align:middle line:90%
blanket.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:50.430 align:middle line:84%
I remember that everything
I wanted or needed

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.880 align:middle line:90%
was met instantly.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.180 align:middle line:84%
I could see all
around at once, and I

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:01.330 align:middle line:90%
could enjoy everything at once.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:07.540 align:middle line:84%
A feeling that you are and
you don't need anything

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.000 align:middle line:90%
because you are everything.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.610 align:middle line:90%


00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.570 align:middle line:90%
You are the planets.

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:21.190 align:middle line:90%
You are the interstellar dust.

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:25.960 align:middle line:84%
You are the grass
in a faraway world.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:35.520 align:middle line:84%
Every little creature,
big and small,

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.060 align:middle line:84%
you can access that
at the same time,

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:45.750 align:middle line:84%
be all of that at the
same time, completing you.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:51.870 align:middle line:84%
Every memory of them,
all in you, making you,

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:55.500 align:middle line:84%
and you are aware of
it all because it's all

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.400 align:middle line:90%
happening as there is no time.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.650 align:middle line:90%
You just are.

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.125 align:middle line:90%
No words suffice-- no words.

00:27:04.125 --> 00:27:11.310 align:middle line:90%


00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:14.480 align:middle line:84%
>> If our consciousness is
not limited to one particular

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.400 align:middle line:84%
density, why doesn't the
perception go up there?

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Why does it stay within 3D-5D
if our higher being is there

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.010 align:middle line:90%
anyway?

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:32.270 align:middle line:90%
>> We are all standing waves.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:36.140 align:middle line:84%
A standing wave is
an energy concept

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:41.150 align:middle line:84%
where potential energy,
scattered all over,

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:45.320 align:middle line:84%
will tend to
concentrate in one point

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:51.860 align:middle line:84%
because that point is
receiving a lot of attention.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.400 align:middle line:84%
You are a standing
wave because you

00:27:55.400 --> 00:28:01.850 align:middle line:84%
are used to giving attention to
your present identity as Gosia,

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:09.350 align:middle line:84%
your ego, and I
as Swaruu, my ego.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:15.050 align:middle line:84%
When we let go of all
attachments, and we just are,

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:21.170 align:middle line:84%
we can access other points of
attention or standing waves.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:25.400 align:middle line:90%
We can be whoever we want to be.

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.840 align:middle line:84%
In order to do that, you must
be in a higher dimension,

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.420 align:middle line:90%
like the 7D.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.350 align:middle line:84%
Potential energy will
manifest into matter

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:42.620 align:middle line:84%
with and as the result of an
attention-creation intention

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.620 align:middle line:90%
of a consciousness.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.610 align:middle line:84%
>> How do we stop giving
attention to our ego vehicles

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:90%
so we can move the wave?

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:59.760 align:middle line:10%
>> Transcending what you are,
understanding that you are

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:05.100 align:middle line:10%
so much more, letting
go of the ego--

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.190 align:middle line:10%
that is only the result
of the destruction

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:11.700 align:middle line:10%
of the self during
deep meditation

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.674 align:middle line:10%
or when you finally passed on.

00:29:16.674 --> 00:29:20.670 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
transcend anything.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:24.270 align:middle line:84%
You need to
assimilate everything.

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.030 align:middle line:90%
You are all.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:32.370 align:middle line:84%
You don't need to reject
your lower-density self.

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:84%
There is nothing wrong with your
3D or 5D vehicles or bodies.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:42.810 align:middle line:90%
They are you as well.

00:29:42.810 --> 00:29:47.010 align:middle line:90%
But you are also so much more.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:49.560 align:middle line:90%
Never reject your body.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.620 align:middle line:90%
Add it into all what you are.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:30:01.530 align:middle line:90%


00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:05.800 align:middle line:10%
>> Before we incarnated
into 3D or 5D,

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.720 align:middle line:10%
there was something in our 7D
consciousness and above that

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.630 align:middle line:10%
pushed our attention out.

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.510 align:middle line:84%
I guess it all goes back
to the question of why

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:19.810 align:middle line:90%
the source pushed itself out.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:26.740 align:middle line:84%
>> That intention to create
something else, something more,

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:29.670 align:middle line:90%
enlightenment.

00:30:29.670 --> 00:30:33.570 align:middle line:84%
In a space where
time does not exist,

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:37.710 align:middle line:90%
everything is already created.

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:41.280 align:middle line:90%
You don't create anything.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.790 align:middle line:90%
It is already there.

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:48.900 align:middle line:10%
But the fact that
everything exists then

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.290 align:middle line:10%
holds the argument
that then it is only

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:55.410 align:middle line:10%
the level of consciousness
of the observer who

00:30:55.410 --> 00:31:04.350 align:middle line:10%
goes rediscovering what already
is, because the whole source,

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:09.330 align:middle line:10%
if it is the sum of
everything that exists,

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:15.360 align:middle line:10%
then the parts are also
contained in the whole.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.080 align:middle line:84%
So seeing something
limited is only

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.880 align:middle line:84%
a reflection of a particular
limited point of view.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.530 align:middle line:90%


00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:31.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Before doing that,
pushing itself out, we,

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.540 align:middle line:84%
as the higher density
consciousness, the source,

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:39.430 align:middle line:84%
we didn't know it would be
hard to pull back in again?

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.790 align:middle line:90%
Or did we know it?

00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:48.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The source, we
did know quite sure--

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.170 align:middle line:90%
its source, anyway.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:54.370 align:middle line:84%
And I am sure the
purpose of the adventure

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:58.600 align:middle line:84%
is to bring itself
together again.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:05.230 align:middle line:84%
As you bring yourself together
again, you are more expanded.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:08.320 align:middle line:84%
Although this is touching
the realm of nobody

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.690 align:middle line:90%
knows exactly, including us.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:27.000 align:middle line:90%
