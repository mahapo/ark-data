00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.170 align:middle line:10%
>> The basis of everything is
the law of mirrors or the law

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.610 align:middle line:10%
of attraction.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.440 align:middle line:10%
You are and you see what
your frequency dictates,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.290 align:middle line:10%
and you are your frequency.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.080 align:middle line:90%
You don't have a frequency.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.720 align:middle line:90%
You are it.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.460 align:middle line:84%
When you die, all that
remains is only your frequency

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.810 align:middle line:84%
without the part of the
solid physical manifestation

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.220 align:middle line:90%
we call the body.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.090 align:middle line:84%
So when you die,
you see what you

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.350 align:middle line:84%
wish to see because
in higher planes,

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.350 align:middle line:84%
everything manifests faster,
progressively faster.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.640 align:middle line:84%
But in after life or in
the high astral world,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.780 align:middle line:84%
where it is said that
souls go to rest,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:84%
everything manifests immediately
because it is the source.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.080 align:middle line:90%
You are one with the source.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.300 align:middle line:90%
You are the source.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.650 align:middle line:90%
You are at the source.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.350 align:middle line:84%
But the concept of
going to the source

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.720 align:middle line:84%
is like displacement movement,
like going from one place

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.280 align:middle line:90%
to another.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.010 align:middle line:90%
The source is everywhere.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.230 align:middle line:90%
Everything is the source.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.670 align:middle line:84%
And, as has been said
before, each person,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.669 align:middle line:84%
each consciousness, or soul
only sees what it perceives.

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.610 align:middle line:10%
What is in its
consciousness is perception,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.480 align:middle line:10%
which is dictated by its unique
frequency, which in turn is

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.650 align:middle line:10%
the result of what you have
seen, where you have had

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.780 align:middle line:10%
your attention, your experiences
and your interactions

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.750 align:middle line:10%
with other people that have only
been a reflection of you again.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.790 align:middle line:84%
So each soul is the
source by right.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.690 align:middle line:84%
When a person dies, they
will see and experience

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:90%
exactly what they expect to see.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.090 align:middle line:90%
They will find just that.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.860 align:middle line:84%
As it is already said and
already known in other places,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.200 align:middle line:84%
if someone believes in
Jesus, Jesus will be found.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.640 align:middle line:84%
If he believes in
Allah, Allah will find.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.840 align:middle line:84%
If he believes in
Vishnu, Vishnu will find.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.100 align:middle line:84%
So there can be no
Archon traps waiting

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.700 align:middle line:90%
to force souls to reincarnate.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.860 align:middle line:84%
That is only found because that
is what they expect to see.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.300 align:middle line:84%
Then heaven or hell
is the result of guilt

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.560 align:middle line:84%
or what a person firmly
believes he deserves.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.140 align:middle line:84%
And it is the very person
that is generating that.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.510 align:middle line:84%
So everything is due to the
mental control or a perception

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.690 align:middle line:90%
that each soul has.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.400 align:middle line:84%
But this is easily
overcome with the knowledge

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.420 align:middle line:84%
that you are going wherever
you have to go by right.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.860 align:middle line:84%
It is the idea of
blame of karma,

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.680 align:middle line:84%
which is nothing more
than a religious belief

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.530 align:middle line:90%
that forces souls to return.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:84%
You cannot be separated from
the source because one is

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.710 align:middle line:84%
the source, and the
source is everywhere.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.350 align:middle line:84%
In itself, the whole world
outside you is illusory.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.019 align:middle line:90%
Everything is within you.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Everything you want to see,
experience, your reality,

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.270 align:middle line:84%
universal laws, scientific laws,
everything is a great illusion.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.870 align:middle line:90%
What you look for, you find.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.980 align:middle line:84%
So fighting for which God
is the true one, fighting

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.480 align:middle line:84%
whether or not there is a
God, and how this God is,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.530 align:middle line:84%
what is the most important
particle, the primordial,

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.750 align:middle line:90%
is meaningless.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.820 align:middle line:90%
Everything is perception.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So everything is true,
or everything is a lie,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:07.830 align:middle line:84%
except one thing, who
observes yourself, your soul.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:84%
That is the only
unquestionably real thing.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Free your mind, and you will
free yourself from all matrix.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.120 align:middle line:10%
>> You said that after we die,
we are going to the source,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.210 align:middle line:10%
but also that it
is a high astral.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.680 align:middle line:90%
So what is it?

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.180 align:middle line:90%
Or is it the same?

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.690 align:middle line:84%
Because the astral would
be something like 4D,

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.090 align:middle line:90%
but the source is the source.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.630 align:middle line:84%
It transcends
everything, doesn't it?

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.800 align:middle line:84%
>> I only use familiar words,
but it's something I have

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.540 align:middle line:90%
to clarify.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.020 align:middle line:90%
That place isn't any frequency.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.820 align:middle line:90%
It is everything.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:84%
It is all frequencies together
when you access the all,

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.390 align:middle line:84%
when you are able to be
everything, being everything,

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.890 align:middle line:84%
being aware and conscious
of everything that exists

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.890 align:middle line:90%
and what has always existed.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.670 align:middle line:84%
All equally easy
to access, past,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:17.070 align:middle line:84%
present, and future are mixed,
converged into the same.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.960 align:middle line:84%
That is the original
source, and there you are,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.920 align:middle line:90%
and there you go when you die.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Unlike other people, I have
total memory of that place.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.220 align:middle line:90%
It is everything.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.380 align:middle line:90%
Whatever you want, you are.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Everything you think,
you manifest immediately.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.840 align:middle line:90%
You are everything.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.240 align:middle line:84%
Everything is at
your fingertips.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.400 align:middle line:84%
You are literally
an omnipotent being.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.780 align:middle line:84%
There, you understand
that it was you and only

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.900 align:middle line:90%
you who created everything.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:84%
And I mean the whole infinite
in creation, infinite in space,

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:90%
and infinite in time.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.240 align:middle line:84%
Although, you do not or never
wants to get out of there,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
that also fulfills itself
because you have never

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.860 align:middle line:90%
left there.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:19.500 align:middle line:84%
You have only chosen to
experience only a small part

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:23.910 align:middle line:84%
at a time, a life,
and incarnation

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:30.000 align:middle line:84%
with an apparent linearity
of animated events in a line.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Because from the source,
everything is at the same time,

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.500 align:middle line:90%
without time.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.130 align:middle line:84%
And that without
time being everything

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.910 align:middle line:90%
also includes with a linear.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.820 align:middle line:84%
It is a feeling of
love and infinite

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.270 align:middle line:84%
and total integration,
which envelops you

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:56.190 align:middle line:84%
like a warm blanket in the
winter, a total realization

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.900 align:middle line:84%
that it is you who has
done everything, that you

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.500 align:middle line:90%
are integration and love.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.090 align:middle line:84%
No good, no evil,
everything is you.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:13.170 align:middle line:84%
Only unimportant contrasts,
only valid from points

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
of view limited to
certain experiences

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.810 align:middle line:84%
that you understand from
there and overcome, exceed,

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.490 align:middle line:90%
look for more.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.860 align:middle line:90%
You always look for more.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:30.780 align:middle line:84%
You understand at that moment
that you are everything,

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.400 align:middle line:84%
and that it's OK that
you are, by definition,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:42.220 align:middle line:84%
the creative source,
therefore, indestructible.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:45.870 align:middle line:90%
We are all literally the source.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.890 align:middle line:84%
We are all the same
person, experiencing

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.600 align:middle line:84%
multiple incarnations
simultaneously and outside

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.430 align:middle line:90%
of time.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:02.160 align:middle line:84%
It is oddly linear, as perceived
from within an incarnation.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.930 align:middle line:90%
There is no past.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.690 align:middle line:90%
There is no future.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Everything is or
everything is your ideas.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.680 align:middle line:84%
You incarnate in a dinosaur
or a grey alien of the future,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.230 align:middle line:84%
and you have done
it, and you are,

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:24.600 align:middle line:84%
and you are embodied as such,
and more, infinitely more.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:84%
Simultaneously, everything
is a sea of consciousness

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.765 align:middle line:90%
that is you.

00:09:31.765 --> 00:09:33.820 align:middle line:90%
You want a challenge.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.420 align:middle line:90%
That's why you incarnate.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.430 align:middle line:84%
Being the original source
is the maximum, literally,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.490 align:middle line:90%
and, infinitely, the maximum.

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:50.340 align:middle line:84%
It is the very concept of
God, but you want a challenge,

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.570 align:middle line:84%
and you return to
where you wish to be.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.130 align:middle line:90%
You make your plan.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:59.820 align:middle line:84%
You start to think what it
would be good to experience.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.730 align:middle line:10%
Like programming
a video game, you

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:07.740 align:middle line:10%
make your map of life, your
characters, what will happen,

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.450 align:middle line:10%
the outcome, everything.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:14.940 align:middle line:84%
And from there, you decide
that by frequencies, you

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.830 align:middle line:90%
will forget.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.950 align:middle line:84%
From forgetting all,
to just a little,

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:84%
as the Taygetans who remember
a lot, but also forget.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.550 align:middle line:84%
And you enter your own
game, your incarnation

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.030 align:middle line:90%
and live what you have designed.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:36.240 align:middle line:90%
But only you have done it.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.030 align:middle line:84%
From this point of
view, there is not even

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.700 align:middle line:84%
mental control on
the part of Archons,

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.050 align:middle line:84%
or reptiles, or space
slugs because it is also

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:51.540 align:middle line:84%
you who has manifested
them, and you are them, too.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:55.380 align:middle line:84%
So when entering,
each soul knows

00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:84%
what it is doing from
the original source

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:03.130 align:middle line:84%
because it is the
original source.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.220 align:middle line:90%
So it is part of the game.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.220 align:middle line:84%
Humans are literally
manifesting,

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:11.925 align:middle line:84%
reptilians, pleiadians,
devils, fairies.

00:11:11.925 --> 00:11:15.060 align:middle line:90%


00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.860 align:middle line:84%
That is why there are
no victims from above.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.030 align:middle line:84%
But from the point of
view below, there are.

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.880 align:middle line:90%
Everything is included.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.270 align:middle line:84%
Everything is real,
and at the same time,

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:90%
nothing is, only you.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.550 align:middle line:84%
When you die, you will
see what you want to see.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.220 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, there are
ghosts, fleshless

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:46.950 align:middle line:84%
beings, vampiric entities that
stick to your aura, everything.

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:49.710 align:middle line:84%
When someone dies with
a lot of attachment

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.790 align:middle line:84%
to the body, more than
normal, as in a violent death,

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.360 align:middle line:84%
she does not know
that he has died.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And as from the original source
that is everything manifests,

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:06.270 align:middle line:84%
so a body manifests as
the one he had in life,

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.910 align:middle line:90%
called the astral body.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.340 align:middle line:84%
Then she goes through
the streets of the city

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.760 align:middle line:84%
where he lived, for
example, and does not

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:17.520 align:middle line:90%
realize that he's dead.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.560 align:middle line:84%
He perceives himself with
clothes, shoes, everything.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:84%
And since he has
obsessions, he often

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:31.080 align:middle line:84%
experiences the same
situation over and over again.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.320 align:middle line:84%
That is why dead
people begin to create

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.300 align:middle line:84%
alliances and an entire
astral sub-world when

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.880 align:middle line:90%
they realize they are dead.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.140 align:middle line:10%
They live and relive the
same traumatic situation

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:50.520 align:middle line:10%
because from that plane,
they all manifested.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.160 align:middle line:84%
The result is a
low astral world,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.530 align:middle line:84%
where the physical world is
copied almost perfectly, only

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:02.550 align:middle line:84%
manifested as with strange
changes or deformations

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
by the memory of the dead
one who is manifesting them,

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:09.240 align:middle line:84%
like the bathroom
door too small to pass

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.520 align:middle line:90%
through when they have to go.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.520 align:middle line:84%
And they continue like
that over and over again.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.680 align:middle line:84%
It is a caricature
world of physical 3D.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.220 align:middle line:84%
But in itself, there
is not even a density

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:26.340 align:middle line:90%
gradient as we have told you.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.490 align:middle line:84%
Everything is the
same, only graduated

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:middle line:84%
by the perception of each
fragment of the original source

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.000 align:middle line:90%
or soul.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:43.230 align:middle line:10%
That's why gradients don't fit
with 3D, 4D, or 5D, with 6D.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.480 align:middle line:90%
There are no gradients.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:47.580 align:middle line:90%
Everything is a whole.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Everything is the source.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And there are only
points of perception

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:57.270 align:middle line:90%
of each soul consciousness.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.540 align:middle line:84%
How low astral
worlds are generated,

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.920 align:middle line:84%
with ghosts hovering around
cemeteries and haunted houses,

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.530 align:middle line:90%
depends on each soul.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And happy worlds
are also generated--

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:90%
heavens, Valhallas, Voltavor.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.350 align:middle line:84%
Whatever they call
it, it is generated.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:18.930 align:middle line:84%
>> But it is still valid
that to access there,

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.510 align:middle line:84%
it is necessary to have
the high frequency?

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Or just by being there already,
you have the high frequency?

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.730 align:middle line:84%
>> It's part of what helps you
focus on something you want,

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.700 align:middle line:84%
leaving behind what
you don't want.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.410 align:middle line:84%
But it is your intention
that matters, your focus.

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.720 align:middle line:84%
Don't just think
about which frequency

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:43.880 align:middle line:90%
is higher than the other.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:47.510 align:middle line:84%
>> You said that frequency is
the result of where attention

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.250 align:middle line:90%
was directed.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.670 align:middle line:84%
But where your attention
is, is not also dictated

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:54.110 align:middle line:90%
by your frequency?

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:58.190 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit like what came
first, chicken or egg?

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:02.690 align:middle line:84%
>> You are everything, frequency
and the point of attention,

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:06.140 align:middle line:84%
what is observed
and who observes.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:10.550 align:middle line:84%
You are the chicken and
the egg, simultaneously.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.440 align:middle line:90%
There is nothing but you.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:90%
There is no separation.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.550 align:middle line:90%
It's only you.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.960 align:middle line:84%
You cannot harm anyone
without harming yourself.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:84%
Even so, you have
to defend yourself

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:84%
as part of the game or
point of attention below.

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:32.160 align:middle line:84%
>> So it's not that something
dictates something else

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.470 align:middle line:84%
because this has been
said at the beginning.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.870 align:middle line:84%
Your perception is
a result of that

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.410 align:middle line:84%
and, later, that dictates
the following, et cetera.

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.420 align:middle line:84%
Everything simply is
at the same time, no?

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.440 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, from above, from
the point of integration,

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.280 align:middle line:90%
there is no mind control.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.280 align:middle line:84%
It is only part
of the experience.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.050 align:middle line:90%
>> OK, thank you.

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:59.630 align:middle line:84%
You said that when someone
believes in something,

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.730 align:middle line:90%
they will see it when they die.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.920 align:middle line:90%
For how long will that be seen?

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.350 align:middle line:84%
At some point in the past,
you said that when we die,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.670 align:middle line:84%
we manifest our beliefs, but
then they will fade away.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.920 align:middle line:84%
>> It is not a matter of
time, since it is irrelevant.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.860 align:middle line:84%
The perception of
animation of linear events

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.520 align:middle line:84%
that you call time is
different in the astral.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:26.480 align:middle line:84%
It depends on the attachments
of each fragment of yourself

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.700 align:middle line:90%
that you call soul.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:34.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it would take Earth
time several incarnations,

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.550 align:middle line:84%
where you enter a life
believing in Jesus

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
and die seeing Jesus, who
tells you that you must go down

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:43.250 align:middle line:90%
to pay karma.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:47.310 align:middle line:84%
And you re-enter hundreds
of times, thousands,

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:52.040 align:middle line:84%
maybe, until on your
own you, that soul;

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.390 align:middle line:84%
that fragment understands
that it is only he

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.300 align:middle line:90%
who is generating everything.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:03.200 align:middle line:84%
>> But is there something that
releases the soul from seeing

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Jesus at the end?

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle line:84%
Or will the soul be with
Jesus forever, so to speak?

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And what factor would contribute
to the soul finally leaving

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:middle line:90%
the attachment to that concept?

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.339 align:middle line:90%
Does it do it on its own?

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.190 align:middle line:84%
There in the afterlife,
he also continues

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:84%
to expand spiritually in
contemplating the existence?

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.400 align:middle line:84%
Can the soul reach this
conclusion from there

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.500 align:middle line:90%
without incarnating?

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Or do you have to enter
the incarnation again?

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.220 align:middle line:84%
>> From the most
expanded point of view,

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:38.210 align:middle line:84%
from the moment you hold the
concept that there is a soul

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:42.320 align:middle line:84%
that is still trapped in the
religious belief of any kind,

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:45.710 align:middle line:90%
it becomes an eternal concept.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:48.560 align:middle line:84%
From that more
expanded point of view,

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:55.250 align:middle line:84%
that soul will be trapped in
it for an eternity, forever.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.350 align:middle line:84%
>> This leads me to
another question.

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Here, the Catholic people
pray for souls of the dead.

00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:84%
Does this work in any way
to help free these souls?

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:09.140 align:middle line:90%
Do our intentions get there?

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.330 align:middle line:90%
>> The dead ones are there.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.190 align:middle line:90%
It is true what they say.

00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.010 align:middle line:10%
They go to their own funeral.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.010 align:middle line:84%
It is because it is the
point of greatest attention

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:22.520 align:middle line:84%
for that consciousness
that has disembodied.

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:28.340 align:middle line:84%
So yes, they hear the prayers
and the cries of the family.

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.650 align:middle line:84%
But from the point
of view of perception

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.620 align:middle line:84%
of the newly
disembodied or dead,

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.460 align:middle line:84%
those prayers only serve
to further strengthen

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:42.380 align:middle line:84%
their perception when they die,
convincing them to see or look

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:44.970 align:middle line:90%
for Jesus, for example.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.190 align:middle line:84%
So if the dead man was
doubtful, with the prayers,

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.470 align:middle line:84%
they are showing him
the way, so to speak.

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:56.570 align:middle line:10%
But it is the way that
suits the churches, those

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.630 align:middle line:10%
who wish to control souls.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But if a person
is very spiritual

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and knows what he is and
has firm control over what

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:10.280 align:middle line:84%
he believes, and that
is in being free,

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.960 align:middle line:84%
he will listen to the prayers
and will be with the family.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:19.190 align:middle line:84%
But he will go where
he should go freely.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:23.840 align:middle line:84%
He will see what he wants,
ignoring the prayers.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:26.630 align:middle line:84%
That is why the
prayers in the funerals

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:30.620 align:middle line:84%
are so repetitive as
mantras because that

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.300 align:middle line:84%
is what they are, to put
ideas into the dead man's head

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.610 align:middle line:90%
because he no longer has one.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.590 align:middle line:90%
They are mantras.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:43.700 align:middle line:84%
But I insist, that a
person free consciousness

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.590 align:middle line:84%
is immune to this, if he's
believing relatives pray.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:52.970 align:middle line:84%
If the dead person is
confused, as he usually is,

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:58.100 align:middle line:84%
praying will help him find his
way, yes, because he listens.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.470 align:middle line:84%
But it is up to the
living to help him

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.920 align:middle line:84%
where they want the
dead to go or see.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.440 align:middle line:90%
That is why it is dangerous.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.870 align:middle line:84%
Those who were
not guided will be

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.870 align:middle line:84%
trapped in their
same infinite loops,

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.060 align:middle line:84%
where they will
not know what to do

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:19.460 align:middle line:84%
and will remain obsessed with
whatever has their attention.

00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:22.760 align:middle line:84%
>> And what would family members
have to do, instead of praying,

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.640 align:middle line:90%
if they can do something?

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Talk to the dead.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.590 align:middle line:84%
There, he is free and
forgiving for whatever he has

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.620 align:middle line:90%
done, for his failures in life.

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:36.800 align:middle line:90%
This is freeing karma.

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.190 align:middle line:84%
>> You can pray, not
religiously, but spiritually,

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.650 align:middle line:84%
leading them to follow
where they want to go,

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:48.630 align:middle line:84%
beyond light source, whatever,
no religious characters, right?

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Sure.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:50.930 align:middle line:90%
That's a good idea.

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:54.510 align:middle line:10%
Therefore, talk to the
dead because they listen.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:58.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you are there
surrounded by disembodied ones

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.900 align:middle line:90%
all the time.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.090 align:middle line:90%
They walk the same streets.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.860 align:middle line:90%
Some know they are dead.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.450 align:middle line:90%
Others do not.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:08.870 align:middle line:84%
>> I imagine it works
the same with animals.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Animals or not, it is
the same being a dog, cat,

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.000 align:middle line:90%
or a flea.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.440 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the experience,
like being a man or a woman.

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:90%
It is all at once.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.740 align:middle line:84%
>> And should we go to the
cemetery to speak to them out

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.410 align:middle line:90%
loud, is it necessary?

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:31.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes because all those
souls listen from wherever.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:34.130 align:middle line:84%
There are more of them
there in the cemeteries

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:35.930 align:middle line:90%
for their own reasons.

00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.760 align:middle line:90%
They manifest themselves there.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:41.990 align:middle line:84%
But a very close
person will closely

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.150 align:middle line:90%
follow their loved ones.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.430 align:middle line:84%
So speaking to
them from anywhere

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:51.950 align:middle line:84%
is enough, especially with
their recently deceased.

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you know if they
are here still or not?

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.140 align:middle line:90%
And if you need to talk to them?

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.330 align:middle line:90%
>> You feel it, the need.

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.590 align:middle line:84%
But it is something that is
also done for oneself, not only

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:04.820 align:middle line:90%
for the dead.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:11.120 align:middle line:84%
You connect with yourself and
it reaches your deceased person.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.170 align:middle line:84%
>> Do the dead have telepathy
with the incarnated ones?

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:17.180 align:middle line:90%
>> Some, yes, and some, no.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:18.350 align:middle line:90%
That is the problem.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:20.390 align:middle line:84%
It is not that
they do not have it

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:90%
because we all have telepathy.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.400 align:middle line:84%
But because of
their own beliefs,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.170 align:middle line:90%
they just don't have it.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:32.360 align:middle line:84%
That is why it is necessary
to speak to them aloud.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.140 align:middle line:84%
>> And if they aren't there, any
way, they won't listen, right?

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.900 align:middle line:84%
If I die, I don't want to
waste my time in my grave

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.680 align:middle line:90%
or listening to people.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.910 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:47.680 align:middle line:84%
But as there is no time, a
portion or an echo of you

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:53.380 align:middle line:84%
will remain in 3D because
everything that has always been

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:58.570 align:middle line:84%
will be from the point of view
of the ether of the source.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:04.430 align:middle line:84%
But you will no longer have
that point of attention.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.595 align:middle line:90%
All that exists is our echo.

00:23:07.595 --> 00:23:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:11.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Fascinating.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And I have this
question, Swaruu.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.430 align:middle line:84%
In the end, how are these
souls liberated, the ones

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:90%
who do not know they are dead?

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.030 align:middle line:90%
They do not incarnate, right?

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.790 align:middle line:90%
They stay there?

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:28.020 align:middle line:84%
>> They also evolve with
or without physical body.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And, at the same time,
they stay there, yes.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.770 align:middle line:90%
All is: nothing ceases to be.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:36.540 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is destroyed.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.340 align:middle line:90%
Nothing is created.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.020 align:middle line:90%
Everything is already.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:46.530 align:middle line:84%
It's just what you want to
see and in what sequence.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:49.320 align:middle line:84%
There is evolution
everywhere, as long

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.430 align:middle line:84%
as you perceive and
control with your intention

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:58.020 align:middle line:84%
to have an experience of
progressive linear events,

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.360 align:middle line:90%
which we call time.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.530 align:middle line:84%
In the case of the ghost that
every night again and again

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:08.070 align:middle line:84%
passes, dragging its chains
through the same hallway

00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:13.560 align:middle line:84%
of an old abandoned house,
so it will continue forever.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.100 align:middle line:84%
Even so, from his point
of view, something

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:84%
should change and not
present the same obsession.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:26.140 align:middle line:84%
Every evolution
confirms the concept

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:31.780 align:middle line:84%
that something is and progresses
towards something else, bigger,

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:34.750 align:middle line:84%
expanded, or
whatever, generally,

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:39.030 align:middle line:84%
by the accumulation of
knowledge and awareness.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:44.100 align:middle line:84%
That is why it is linked
to a temporal progression.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.640 align:middle line:84%
But this time is
only from the point

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.640 align:middle line:84%
of view of the person
or soul in question.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.580 align:middle line:84%
>> And where the dead are,
they don't have this concept

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.810 align:middle line:90%
and this experience?

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:56.220 align:middle line:90%
They do not evolve?

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.230 align:middle line:90%
They lack this concept?

00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:01.710 align:middle line:84%
Why can't they free
themselves from there?

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:04.290 align:middle line:84%
>> They are wherever they
think of manifesting,

00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:06.930 align:middle line:84%
whatever they want
to themselves.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:11.730 align:middle line:84%
From the most expanded point of
view, many souls are trapped.

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.470 align:middle line:84%
From the concept of
souls themselves,

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:18.480 align:middle line:84%
they only experience their
own evolution or progression.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Then, from that point of
view, nobody gets lost,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:25.960 align:middle line:90%
and nobody gets trapped.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.070 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.460 align:middle line:84%
Could you go to the cemetery
and talk to the dead in group,

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.190 align:middle line:90%
to free them at last?

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.330 align:middle line:90%
>> Oh, yes.

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.940 align:middle line:84%
But remember that
being dead doesn't mean

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.930 align:middle line:90%
they will be receptive to you.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:41.560 align:middle line:84%
It's the same as
saying I go downtown

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.420 align:middle line:84%
to the central
square of the city

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.670 align:middle line:84%
to stand on a box
with a megaphone

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.910 align:middle line:84%
and talk to those who
pass there to freedom.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:52.150 align:middle line:84%
They are as closed as
the living because they

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.080 align:middle line:90%
are people, the same ones, too.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
>> But the dead are
happy in that astral?

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.030 align:middle line:90%
Do they get used to being there?

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:02.890 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, some live there.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:03.700 align:middle line:90%
They are.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:05.620 align:middle line:90%
They choose to be there.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.230 align:middle line:90%
Others are immensely unhappy.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:12.130 align:middle line:84%
They form clans, groups,
alliances, families

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.600 align:middle line:90%
as with the living.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.660 align:middle line:84%
Yes, you could make a
YouTube channel for the dead.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.030 align:middle line:90%
It doesn't matter, seriously.

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.910 align:middle line:84%
It will reach more dead
ones than if you just

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.830 align:middle line:84%
stand on the box with a
megaphone in the square.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So, somehow, they are
aware that they already live

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.640 align:middle line:90%
a parallel reality?

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.540 align:middle line:84%
>> There is an infinite
amount of parallel realities,

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.860 align:middle line:84%
but let's say that one is the
most strongly linked to what is

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:44.690 align:middle line:84%
perceived as the material
or real 3D world.

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:45.950 align:middle line:90%
>> The dead see each other?

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:46.750 align:middle line:90%
Eat?

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.810 align:middle line:90%
Can they touch themselves?

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:49.610 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.910 align:middle line:84%
As stated above, they
form alliances, and clans,

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.050 align:middle line:90%
and everything.

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.570 align:middle line:84%
But as with everything,
they can only

00:26:56.570 --> 00:27:01.550 align:middle line:84%
see what is within their
frequency perception range.

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:03.860 align:middle line:90%
>> Do they eat?

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>> In their
perception, some yes.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:07.760 align:middle line:90%
Others, no.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.110 align:middle line:90%
>> Can they be extracted?

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.420 align:middle line:90%
Do they talk with ETs?

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.880 align:middle line:84%
>> There, they manifest
everything they can think

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.030 align:middle line:90%
of, everything.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Have you extracted some?

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:20.080 align:middle line:90%
>> Not that I know of.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.290 align:middle line:84%
>> I do not want to go
there, to this world.

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:24.820 align:middle line:90%
>> Then you won't go.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:26.380 align:middle line:90%
What's the problem?

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.650 align:middle line:84%
Knowing this frees you
because you already

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:33.070 align:middle line:90%
know what not to do.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.830 align:middle line:84%
>> And if you don't believe
in reincarnation, but heaven,

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.210 align:middle line:90%
you never reincarnate?

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Heaven you will
find to suit you.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.540 align:middle line:84%
But yes, you will reincarnate
because from the heaven,

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.680 align:middle line:84%
by definition, it also
opens up more possibilities

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.480 align:middle line:90%
for the awareness.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.310 align:middle line:84%
It is part of the collective
manifestation of Catholicism.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:28:00.110 align:middle line:84%
They must go their own
way, and you, yours.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.950 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:03.080 align:middle line:84%
And, at least, it's
important for the people

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.690 align:middle line:84%
to know that they are the
ones with the creative power.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.882 align:middle line:84%
I think this is the most
important message here.

00:28:09.882 --> 00:28:11.090 align:middle line:90%
You believe what you believe.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.600 align:middle line:84%
But, at least, you know
that you are creating it

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:19.190 align:middle line:84%
and that you choose your
path, even after death.

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
Maybe, soon, I will
go to the cemetery.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:22.280 align:middle line:90%
I really want to.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.090 align:middle line:90%
I will talk to the dead

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:24.890 align:middle line:90%
>> OK.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.380 align:middle line:84%
But when you leave,
order them not

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.810 align:middle line:84%
to follow you
because they do that,

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.730 align:middle line:90%
and no children to the cemetery.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.630 align:middle line:10%
Their aura is not
yet well-developed.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.170 align:middle line:84%
They are very jealous and
resentful of the children

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.620 align:middle line:84%
because their vitality
charge is full.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:47.630 align:middle line:84%
And that may influence
their entire life.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:51.580 align:middle line:90%
