00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:42.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.700 align:middle line:10%
>> Hello, Swaruu, and thank you
so much for meeting tonight.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.540 align:middle line:10%
>> Thank you for
being here with me.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.780 align:middle line:84%
>> To start, could you please
tell us who you are more

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.520 align:middle line:90%
exactly?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.890 align:middle line:10%
>> We are from mostly planets
Erra and Temmer that are

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:08.540 align:middle line:10%
revolving around the sun
Taygeta in the Messier 45, M45,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.770 align:middle line:10%
star system, Pleiades,
the Seven Sisters.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.450 align:middle line:90%
That is 422 light years away.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.610 align:middle line:84%
We are a task force of
nearly 18,000 Taygetans

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.550 align:middle line:90%
in several ships.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.290 align:middle line:90%
>> What dimension are you from?

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.860 align:middle line:84%
>> We come from
the fifth density.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.880 align:middle line:84%
We prefer to call it
densities than dimensions.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:43.530 align:middle line:84%
However, all outside Earth
is fifth density anyway.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.500 align:middle line:84%
It's only Earth
that is artificially

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.970 align:middle line:84%
kept in the super-dense
third density.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.920 align:middle line:84%
The normal universe
is all fifth density.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.760 align:middle line:84%
Having said that, we don't
observe those densities

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.080 align:middle line:90%
as people on Earth do.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.810 align:middle line:84%
We observe everything
as a whole.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.070 align:middle line:84%
One gradient of softly
raising frequencies.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.550 align:middle line:84%
Not separate densities as if
they had a wall between them.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.800 align:middle line:84%
Those ideas are an
Earth concept only.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.130 align:middle line:84%
>> You said you are about 18,000
Taygetans in several ships.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Are you in the orbit of
planet Earth permanently

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.610 align:middle line:84%
or moving around between various
places and how far from Earth

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.680 align:middle line:90%
are you stationed?

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.120 align:middle line:84%
>> The ships are placed on
several orbit height depending

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.540 align:middle line:84%
on the individual
task of each ship.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.210 align:middle line:84%
This one is at 490,000
kilometers orbit.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:84%
The big ones are
mostly stationary.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.280 align:middle line:84%
The smaller ones are
moving all over the place.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.270 align:middle line:84%
>> What are the tasks of
these different ships?

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.220 align:middle line:84%
>> Some ships are command and
control from where everything

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.420 align:middle line:84%
is monitored, organized,
and controlled.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.940 align:middle line:90%
Leadership is in them.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.550 align:middle line:90%
There are two such ships.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.350 align:middle line:90%
This is one of them.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:84%
Others are dedicated to
enforce the blockade.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.180 align:middle line:84%
One of them is a science
ship, and there are also

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:84%
several smaller, agile
ships to do multiple tasks,

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.360 align:middle line:84%
and then there are
also the most numerous.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.640 align:middle line:84%
These are shuttles to go
to and from the ships.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.130 align:middle line:84%
These are mostly this
discoidal or box shaped.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.520 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you expand on what
you mean by ships that are

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.870 align:middle line:84%
dedicated to enforce
the blockade?

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.150 align:middle line:84%
>> We stop ships from leaving
Earth or from going into Earth

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.080 align:middle line:90%
without a clear motive to do so.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.270 align:middle line:84%
This to prevent hostile forces
from entering and reinforcing

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.300 align:middle line:90%
the negative ones on Earth.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:84%
The blockade is enforced
mostly by three races.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Taygetans in
command and control.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Alfratans from Alpha
Centauri and Antarians.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.950 align:middle line:84%
>> Are the small moving ships
the ones that can be seen by us

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.120 align:middle line:90%
here mostly?

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.760 align:middle line:90%
The so-called UFOs.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.300 align:middle line:84%
>> And then you said you
monitor ships going in and out.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.480 align:middle line:84%
What about the secret
space program ships?

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.530 align:middle line:84%
Have they left the Earth
as they claim they have?

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.040 align:middle line:90%
They bypassed your blockade?

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.660 align:middle line:90%
>> There are many ships.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Some are in areas like S-4, Area
51, but most of the big ones

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.410 align:middle line:84%
are on the moon and
under federation control.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.620 align:middle line:84%
The US space program has
lost all its large ships.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.700 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it mean at some
point they did leave Earth?

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, they did in the '60s
all the way up to the year 2008

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.070 align:middle line:84%
when Asket knocked them all out
in a space battle and captured

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.170 align:middle line:90%
them.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.740 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, you said you stop
ships leaving Earth.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.450 align:middle line:90%
What ships leave Earth?

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.870 align:middle line:90%
Are you referring to SSP ones?

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:84%
>> Some of the
remaining ones are SSP.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Others are reptilian or Tall
White, or Maitre (Tall Grey)

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.940 align:middle line:90%
ships.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.300 align:middle line:90%
There is a lot of traffic here.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.930 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, let's leave SSP for
another topic then as it is

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.910 align:middle line:90%
a big one too.

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.200 align:middle line:84%
You said everything around
Earth is fifth density.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Are your ships in
the fifth density

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.300 align:middle line:84%
too when they are
close to Earth?

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Everything outside
Earth is in fifth density.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.530 align:middle line:84%
>> How far out from Earth does
it begin to be fifth density?

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.280 align:middle line:84%
>> The Van Allen Belts
mark the barrier.

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.750 align:middle line:84%
>> How can we see those ships
if they are in the fifth or are

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.570 align:middle line:90%
they below the Van Allen Belts?

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.030 align:middle line:84%
>> I have a problem
describing them here.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.300 align:middle line:84%
They are fighter ships,
and I am reluctant to call

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.270 align:middle line:84%
them like that because they
sound very belligerent.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And yes, many are
below the belts.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.230 align:middle line:84%
Many are on the surface
landed or a low-level flight

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.740 align:middle line:90%
and all variants in between.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.460 align:middle line:84%
When ufologists say
they saw a plasma ship,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
it's not the ship itself
what they are seeing.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the ionization that
occurs in the atmosphere when

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:13.770 align:middle line:84%
the presence of a
starship's engine super

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.000 align:middle line:84%
heats and ionizes
the air's molecules.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.900 align:middle line:84%
In short, what they are seeing
is the ship's exhaust pipe.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the Black
Knight satellite.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.540 align:middle line:90%
There are 19 of these.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.440 align:middle line:84%
They are Alfratan
L-class fighters.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:38.810 align:middle line:84%
They stay in low Earth orbit
nose down like a bird of prey

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:45.320 align:middle line:84%
looking for cabal, reptilian,
or other negative ships.

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Are more people coming from
different places in Pleiades

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.980 align:middle line:84%
or mainly from the
planets you mentioned?

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.650 align:middle line:90%
>> Mainly, but not incarnating.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.210 align:middle line:84%
They mostly go in using
full immersion technology.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.770 align:middle line:84%
They do the same as we
do, but as they see fit.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:08.330 align:middle line:84%
However, we all must
follow the same rules.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.570 align:middle line:84%
>> What is an
immersion technology?

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.020 align:middle line:84%
>> A computerized virtual
reality where you hack

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.010 align:middle line:84%
into the digital matrix
that controls Earth.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:24.020 align:middle line:84%
You appear and function as
a human when you are not.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:29.090 align:middle line:84%
You go in there for a
mission or a purpose.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:34.280 align:middle line:84%
>> Wow, you are a biological
human-looking beings, right?

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.179 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, we are from
the same Lyrian branch.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Our main differences are the
12-strand, 24-chromosome DNA.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And as a result of
this difference,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.170 align:middle line:84%
our nervous system is different
as well as the sexual organs

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.610 align:middle line:90%
mainly.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.200 align:middle line:84%
It's nearly all related
to the nervous system

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
where the nerve voltage is a
lot higher than with humans,

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.170 align:middle line:84%
and the brain has
no cerebral lobes.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.720 align:middle line:90%
No right and left brain.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.510 align:middle line:90%
It's all one mass.

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:84%
We think holographically,
understanding duality

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.650 align:middle line:84%
with no conflict
between hemispheres

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:22.010 align:middle line:84%
as it occurs with
most Earth people.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.760 align:middle line:84%
We also can see in
the dark as cats do.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.200 align:middle line:84%
This is also because of a higher
nervous system efficiency,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and all our senses are
also heightened as well.

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:38.420 align:middle line:84%
We hardly get tired when
running because our recovery

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.340 align:middle line:90%
time is a lot faster.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.110 align:middle line:84%
That is because of added
mitochondrial efficiency

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:50.240 align:middle line:84%
processing oxygen and also
because of a higher oxygen

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:56.510 align:middle line:84%
level in our planet and the
ship's internal atmosphere.

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:04.640 align:middle line:84%
We are at 78% oxygen, 20%
nitrogen, 2% other gases.

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.590 align:middle line:84%
When on Earth, you
are at roughly 78%

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:15.680 align:middle line:84%
nitrogen and 20%
oxygen 2% other gases.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.590 align:middle line:90%
We are inverted.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:21.410 align:middle line:84%
Also, we have no
skeletal problems,

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:26.090 align:middle line:84%
or they are rare, because
our gravity is at 80%.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:29.360 align:middle line:90%
0.8 than that on Earth.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.970 align:middle line:84%
In our planets and
in the settings

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.780 align:middle line:84%
of the artificial
gravity in the ships.

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.360 align:middle line:84%
>> How do you
learn our language?

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.890 align:middle line:84%
>> By telepathic download
and some practice as we pass

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.890 align:middle line:84%
information in bulk
between us all here.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.470 align:middle line:84%
It's quite easy to
learn a new language.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:55.270 align:middle line:84%
Most of us speak fluently
more than 10 Earth languages.

00:10:55.270 --> 00:10:58.660 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, I understand
you are mostly women.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:03.760 align:middle line:84%
>> Our population is
roughly 75% female, yes.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.380 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is it mostly women?

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:90%
What happen to yin and yang?

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.570 align:middle line:84%
>> We don't know the
answer ourselves.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.760 align:middle line:90%
There are many theories.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.850 align:middle line:90%
It's more of a 50%, 50%.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.780 align:middle line:84%
When you look at it from a
reproduction-only point of view

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:24.910 align:middle line:84%
as most women that are in
excess are very old and not

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.250 align:middle line:90%
interested in having a mate.

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:32.110 align:middle line:84%
>> To be clear, old but still
in a 20-year-old body, yes?

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:35.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Some older women
in a 20-year-old body,

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.010 align:middle line:84%
and others in older
looking bodies.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.880 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on what
they want to look like.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.790 align:middle line:84%
The reason why most
babies are female

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:48.730 align:middle line:84%
is also coming from
the spirit side.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.390 align:middle line:84%
So cloning doesn't work,
because there is no one

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.620 align:middle line:84%
to inhabit a male
body if most souls are

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.440 align:middle line:90%
interested in being female.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.070 align:middle line:84%
Everything here is for
women, nearly everything.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.430 align:middle line:84%
It's easier to have
a project as a woman,

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.420 align:middle line:84%
because you are more respected
in a professional manner.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.470 align:middle line:84%
This shouldn't be, I
know, but it's how it is.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.880 align:middle line:84%
A woman is very respected
in science and art circles,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.400 align:middle line:90%
and men not so much so.

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.450 align:middle line:84%
Because Taygetan men are
mostly interested in love

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:29.650 align:middle line:84%
and relationships, romance
and sports, entertainment

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:35.410 align:middle line:84%
and technology, science,
and rarely in politics.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.010 align:middle line:84%
So even if there are
many more women here,

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:42.230 align:middle line:90%
most are not interested in men.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:47.170 align:middle line:84%
With the men, nearly all
are interested in the women.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.080 align:middle line:90%
So it's balanced.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.030 align:middle line:90%
>> Totally opposite as here.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.260 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:90%
>> What is your native language?

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.250 align:middle line:90%
What is it similar to?

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.730 align:middle line:84%
>> Our native language
is Taygetan Pleiadian.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.590 align:middle line:84%
Similar to Earth Navajo
language or Inuit.

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:09.250 align:middle line:84%
The language is
verbal telepathic.

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle line:84%
This means that
individual words are

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:17.140 align:middle line:84%
loaded with extensive
telepathic data and meanings.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Each word is a vehicle
for the telepathic load.

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
We talk with our
mouths like you do.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.680 align:middle line:84%
But as we talk, we
also load details

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.960 align:middle line:84%
to our words passing
close to 1000% more data

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.990 align:middle line:84%
than a normal Earth
language does per phrase.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:40.770 align:middle line:90%


00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:41.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I see.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.000 align:middle line:84%
Can it be said that you
are from our future,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.900 align:middle line:84%
because some contactees contact
with beings from the future

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:50.840 align:middle line:90%
as they say?

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.500 align:middle line:90%
>> There is no future.

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.220 align:middle line:90%
It's all occurring now.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.730 align:middle line:84%
It's just your perception
and your frequency

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:04.070 align:middle line:84%
that determines what you are
experiencing in your now.

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:07.250 align:middle line:84%
In one way or
another, yes, it can

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:12.170 align:middle line:84%
be said that we are from the
future but not from Earth.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:16.300 align:middle line:84%
We are not Earth
humans from the future.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, those concepts are
always very difficult for us

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.680 align:middle line:90%
to understand.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:24.460 align:middle line:84%
OK, so you are not Earth
humans from the future, not

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:28.030 align:middle line:84%
time travelers, not us
traveling back in time

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.490 align:middle line:90%
as some people claim.

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:34.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Well, essentially, to
travel through space using

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.350 align:middle line:84%
a hyperspace drive
engine is time traveling.

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, I understand
that, but I mean,

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:84%
you are not Earth people that
advanced several hundred years

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.900 align:middle line:90%
and came back, right?

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:49.120 align:middle line:90%
>> Right, we are not.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.330 align:middle line:84%
We are kin both
from Lyrian descent,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:57.700 align:middle line:84%
but we are another race,
another people, another culture.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.480 align:middle line:10%
>> You and the humans here
are both of Lyrian descent?

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.920 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, as well as many
countless other civilizations

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.090 align:middle line:84%
with human-looking
people in them.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:14.410 align:middle line:84%
Lyrians are the oldest
known human-looking race.

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:18.610 align:middle line:84%
>> I understand from our
previous conversation that 2008

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:22.330 align:middle line:84%
is when you came here, although
I understand you have been here

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.340 align:middle line:90%
before too.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.850 align:middle line:84%
>> We were here before
in smaller numbers.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.490 align:middle line:84%
We've been here for
thousands of years,

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:35.740 align:middle line:84%
but we came in force
in 1952 and then

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:43.700 align:middle line:84%
in a much larger force in 2008
and have been here ever since.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.740 align:middle line:84%
>> You came back in a
larger force in 2008.

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:47.540 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.730 align:middle line:90%
What happened exactly?

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.240 align:middle line:84%
>> The cabal was preparing
for the culling of the people.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:90%
A mass killing.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:16:00.170 align:middle line:84%
It was related to the
end times of 2012.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:05.220 align:middle line:84%
We stopped that,
agenda 21, to be exact.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:09.680 align:middle line:84%
It was to start in
high gear in 2012.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:15.110 align:middle line:84%
It's slowed down now but
not off yet, unfortunately.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Does it have to do with
a new world order agenda?

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:20.830 align:middle line:84%
Elimination of human
population, et cetera?

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, it's part of
the New World order.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.440 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, wow, so you
came back for that.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, what do you mean
the end of times?

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.710 align:middle line:84%
I understood that
2012 and all that

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.860 align:middle line:84%
only meant the
ascension process.

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
>> In reality, it is an
ascension process, as you said.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.900 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that the cabal
used the 9/11 2001 as a start

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.420 align:middle line:84%
for heating up of
the negative plan.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:53.340 align:middle line:90%


00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.580 align:middle line:84%
>> So among other reasons,
that's why you came?

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:59.250 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, and there
isn't just one reason.

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.710 align:middle line:90%
It's many.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.609 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you give me the other
reasons of why you are here?

00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:09.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Solving the problems of Earth
is not something we can do from

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.770 align:middle line:90%
outside.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:90%
It has to be done from inside.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:18.359 align:middle line:84%
So what we do is to point
things out to people,

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:22.290 align:middle line:90%
so they will in turn see more.

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:27.390 align:middle line:84%
Investigate on their own until
a tipping point in consciousness

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:84%
is achieved, and then
things will start

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.860 align:middle line:90%
to turn towards the positive.

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:37.290 align:middle line:84%
And you don't have
to awaken the masses.

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.910 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about that.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:45.570 align:middle line:84%
All you need is to awaken
a key core of people.

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.900 align:middle line:84%
The rest will
follow, and they will

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.480 align:middle line:84%
follow, because
they are not even

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:55.890 align:middle line:84%
real people but
manifestations within the mind

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.590 align:middle line:90%
of the few real people.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.430 align:middle line:84%
We are on a massive
contact campaign now

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:06.840 align:middle line:84%
to give information that will
resonate with some people.

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.400 align:middle line:84%
It may not resonate with
most, but it doesn't need to.

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.260 align:middle line:84%
All we need is to
activate a few key people,

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:21.030 align:middle line:84%
then a chain in
reaction will occur.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.100 align:middle line:84%
>> But after it
resonates with them,

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.160 align:middle line:84%
is that the purpose of
the contact just for it

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.090 align:middle line:90%
to resonate?

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.340 align:middle line:90%
The resonance is enough?

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:32.100 align:middle line:84%
>> As it resonates,
it's fulfilled.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.030 align:middle line:84%
It makes those key people
understand who they are.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.090 align:middle line:84%
They will be in enlightenment
with their true self

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and will start to manifest
a different reality

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:47.010 align:middle line:84%
for themselves, and therefore,
for the rest of humanity

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.350 align:middle line:90%
or for the world.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:53.160 align:middle line:84%
As they manifest,
they change the world.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:90%
They terraform.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:19:01.530 align:middle line:84%
Those key people are manifesting
all the reality you see.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:07.950 align:middle line:84%
What I mean is that if you
have 7,500,000 key people,

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:10.830 align:middle line:84%
and they all understand
what's going on,

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.950 align:middle line:84%
then they will
manifest a new reality

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:18.450 align:middle line:84%
for all, because the remainder
of the population on Earth

00:19:18.450 --> 00:19:21.570 align:middle line:90%
is just more matrix.

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.330 align:middle line:84%
As they are just
more matrix, they

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:27.720 align:middle line:84%
are the product of
the manifestation

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.590 align:middle line:90%
of those mentioned key people.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:37.890 align:middle line:84%
We, or anyone else, cannot
come into Earth shooting at all

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.250 align:middle line:84%
the negatives and
cleaning the place.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.550 align:middle line:84%
Setting a new
holographic government up

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:48.550 align:middle line:90%
and all because it won't last.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.770 align:middle line:84%
It won't last, because it
has been done that way before

00:19:52.770 --> 00:19:55.440 align:middle line:90%
with horrible results.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.800 align:middle line:84%
People tend to make
us into deities.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.750 align:middle line:90%
We are not.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:03.240 align:middle line:90%
We are messengers.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.740 align:middle line:84%
That's the very meaning
of the word "angels."

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.150 align:middle line:84%
And for hundreds if
not thousands of years

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:15.540 align:middle line:84%
they've been pinning
that angel thing on us

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.610 align:middle line:90%
over and over again.

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
That's because the
people of Earth

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.520 align:middle line:84%
are brought up that way,
to look for a parent

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.380 align:middle line:90%
to take care of them.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:32.560 align:middle line:84%
And in a way, that could be used
to describe us versus humans.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.310 align:middle line:84%
We are a race who
is self responsible.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:39.580 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, we are adults.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:41.800 align:middle line:84%
The humans, on the
other hand, don't

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.530 align:middle line:90%
know how to be responsible.

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:49.150 align:middle line:84%
The people of the Earth have
to be told what to think,

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:54.130 align:middle line:84%
what's right, and what's
wrong, who to listen to.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.610 align:middle line:84%
First, the father
and the mother,

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:03.370 align:middle line:84%
then the teachers in school,
then the bosses at their jobs,

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:07.270 align:middle line:84%
and the priests and
the politicians.

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:11.500 align:middle line:84%
They are guided all the
time and don't know how

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.390 align:middle line:90%
to make their own decisions.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:19.780 align:middle line:84%
They are in a hive mind,
at least most of them.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:25.710 align:middle line:84%
So they must learn how to
grow up, be self responsible.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:30.960 align:middle line:84%
The humans must be the ones
who transcend the oppressors.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.040 align:middle line:90%
Not us.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:34.740 align:middle line:90%
We don't need their credit.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.250 align:middle line:90%
We know who and what we are.

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:42.960 align:middle line:90%
The humans must do the work.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.310 align:middle line:84%
But going back to why
we are here exactly now.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:53.070 align:middle line:84%
We are here to help and aid the
liberation of souls and minds

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:54.840 align:middle line:90%
on Earth.

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
We are also here to aid and
study the ascension of Earth

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:02.280 align:middle line:90%
from a scientific point of view.

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.650 align:middle line:84%
And many of us come here for
personal reasons as well.

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:84%
Apart from that, but
related, we are here

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.370 align:middle line:84%
to place star seeds
on the surface

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
to aid the awakening of
humankind from the inside.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:22.350 align:middle line:90%
The ones who want to go in.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:25.620 align:middle line:84%
Then to monitor,
find, and bring them

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:31.110 align:middle line:84%
back home once they have
fulfilled their task.

00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:35.530 align:middle line:84%
>> I see, and it can be
done from your planet?

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.240 align:middle line:84%
>> It can and is, but
it's faster and much more

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.200 align:middle line:84%
comfortable to do so
from a ship in orbit.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.990 align:middle line:84%
The main problem with
doing so from the planets

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:50.790 align:middle line:84%
is because there is a
significant 4.5 to one time

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:52.950 align:middle line:90%
slip ratio.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:56.160 align:middle line:84%
That is for each
day in our planets,

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.000 align:middle line:90%
108 hours have passed on Earth.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.180 align:middle line:84%
Four days, 12 hours for
each day on our planets.

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Is this the same time ratio
for you now in the orbit?

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:15.570 align:middle line:84%
>> No, from here, time is only
five minutes slower per day.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:19.320 align:middle line:84%
If I had a watch, and I
synchronized it with yours,

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:23.760 align:middle line:84%
tomorrow, mine will be
minutes slower than yours.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:29.620 align:middle line:84%
Day after, it will be 10
minutes slower and so on.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.080 align:middle line:84%
>> But you are still in
the fifth density up there

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:36.580 align:middle line:84%
in the orbit, so shouldn't it
be the same as on your planets?

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:40.370 align:middle line:84%
>> No, time is relative
to each person.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:45.250 align:middle line:84%
It is not a universal
constant as Einstein wrongly

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.290 align:middle line:90%
claims it is.

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.350 align:middle line:84%
Time in the planet
is the average

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:56.110 align:middle line:84%
of the perception of the
entire population inside it.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So it has nothing
to do with densities?

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
>> No, only because densities
are tied to consciousness.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:08.440 align:middle line:84%
Time is a product
or a perception

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:15.190 align:middle line:84%
of each individual consciousness
in itself is non-existent.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:19.060 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, you say that the time
is only the perception within

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:84%
the consciousness of the people
residing in the given world

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.520 align:middle line:90%
density.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:28.660 align:middle line:84%
Is that why your time in the
orbit is so similar to ours

00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:84%
here, because you
are closer to the 3D,

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.140 align:middle line:84%
and our consciousness
affects you there?

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:39.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Correct, and also because
we are coordinating with you

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.680 align:middle line:90%
and with Earth events.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.090 align:middle line:84%
So our collective perception
of time is similar from here

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:48.340 align:middle line:90%
in orbit.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:52.180 align:middle line:84%
>> OK, is there another
reason you are here?

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.270 align:middle line:84%
You said it is to
help us ascend,

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:59.740 align:middle line:84%
but is it important
for you that we ascend,

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.640 align:middle line:84%
or is your helping
us purely altruistic?

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.740 align:middle line:90%
The question is, why?

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.420 align:middle line:90%
The deeper why.

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.300 align:middle line:84%
Is it perhaps that
our presence in 5D

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.840 align:middle line:90%
is needed for some reason?

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:19.180 align:middle line:84%
>> The real population of
Earth is made of star seeds,

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:23.530 align:middle line:84%
even if they have been on
Earth several or thousands

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:25.870 align:middle line:90%
of incarnations.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:84%
They are all star seeds, because
they don't originate on Earth.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:33.220 align:middle line:90%
They are source.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, the real people
on Earth are us or our family,

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:46.300 align:middle line:84%
and we cannot be truly free
if someone else is oppressed.

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:52.550 align:middle line:84%
Also, many of us are there
and here at the same time.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:56.830 align:middle line:84%
We want to get all our
timelines variants out.

00:25:56.830 --> 00:26:04.150 align:middle line:84%
And yes, you are needed
in 5D, because 5D is home,

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:09.430 align:middle line:84%
as home as it gets outside
the non-physical existence.

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:13.010 align:middle line:84%
>> You said you cannot be
truly free if someone else is

00:26:13.010 --> 00:26:13.810 align:middle line:90%
oppressed.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:19.480 align:middle line:84%
You don't feel yourself to be
a free race with us oppressed?

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.100 align:middle line:90%
>> Complicated answer.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.700 align:middle line:84%
My people say and feel
they carry a lot of karma.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.470 align:middle line:84%
Things like nuking
Mars, for example.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So they feel that this
cleans their karma.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.690 align:middle line:84%
The problem is that the
karma concept is wrong.

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:38.350 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to
carry bad karma.

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:42.910 align:middle line:84%
You do only because
you choose to do so.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.720 align:middle line:84%
You liberate karma
when you understand why

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:49.840 align:middle line:90%
your past events took place.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.010 align:middle line:84%
You overcome karma when
you accumulate and process

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:58.570 align:middle line:84%
sufficient wisdom
to let it all go.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.930 align:middle line:84%
From that point of
view, we are here only

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.140 align:middle line:90%
because of altruistic reasons.

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.420 align:middle line:84%
>> And you volunteered
to come here?

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.720 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes, it's strictly volunteer.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Mostly, it is the young
and idealistic Taygetans

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:15.910 align:middle line:90%
who come here.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.190 align:middle line:84%
The older ones
prefer other things.

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:20.860 align:middle line:90%


00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Are other planets in a
similar situation to ours,

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.830 align:middle line:90%
and are you helping them too?

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:31.180 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, there were exactly
nine other planets in similar

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:32.200 align:middle line:90%
condition.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.180 align:middle line:90%
10 in total.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:38.230 align:middle line:84%
But none of them are in
such a critical condition

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:42.700 align:middle line:90%
and are as relevant as Earth is.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:47.560 align:middle line:84%
Now, Earth and another
are the only ones that

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.500 align:middle line:90%
remain in such a condition.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.460 align:middle line:84%
The other one is Venus,
but the problem there

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:57.400 align:middle line:90%
isn't related to Earth.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.430 align:middle line:90%
>> Why is Earth so important?

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:04.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Because it's closer to us
and to a very large variety

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:08.860 align:middle line:84%
of species, because it's
full of their star seeds,

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:12.580 align:middle line:84%
and we all must take
care of our own.

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:15.490 align:middle line:90%
Also for strategic reasons.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.920 align:middle line:90%
This is the negative stronghold.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.730 align:middle line:84%
If Earth's negative forces
are defeated on Earth,

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:27.100 align:middle line:84%
the other planets in trouble
will also be liberated.

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:32.320 align:middle line:84%
The other planets are only
nodes of the Earth's cabal.

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Mars and Venus, for example.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:39.640 align:middle line:90%
Earth is the key planet.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Key in this
quadrant, you mean,

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:44.700 align:middle line:84%
because the universe
is very large?

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.360 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, this quadrant
and problem of negative

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.550 align:middle line:90%
infiltration.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.090 align:middle line:84%
>> Can you specify the problem
of negative infiltration

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.620 align:middle line:90%
please?

00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:00.690 align:middle line:84%
>> The negative forces going in
to peaceful planets to overtake

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:05.550 align:middle line:84%
and dominate the indigenous
population using lies and mind

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:09.970 align:middle line:84%
control for service
to self purposes.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.870 align:middle line:84%
>> So this is a key
planet for them also.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:17.570 align:middle line:84%
Why so much interest in
Earth from both sides?

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:18.610 align:middle line:90%
>> That's right.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:23.350 align:middle line:84%
See it as the negative
forces headquarters and also

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:26.230 align:middle line:84%
because in other
positive timelines

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:32.140 align:middle line:84%
Earth is also the headquarters
of the federation.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.060 align:middle line:84%
It's the negative forces
headquarters and the federation

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:41.010 align:middle line:90%
headquarters at the same time.

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.740 align:middle line:90%
>> Now, this is interesting.

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.710 align:middle line:84%
You mean we are the
headquarters of the Federation

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:47.150 align:middle line:90%
in other timelines?

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:50.090 align:middle line:84%
So is it that by
helping us here now,

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:54.650 align:middle line:84%
you are also saving the
federation in other timelines?

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:57.440 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:00.670 align:middle line:90%
It's all concentrated here.

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:05.200 align:middle line:84%
>> And why are the negative ones
interested in the 3D planet,

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.640 align:middle line:90%
or you mean they made it 3D?

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:14.200 align:middle line:84%
>> We, the federation,
made it 3D.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:17.500 align:middle line:84%
The negative forces
only hijacked it

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.070 align:middle line:90%
and used the 3D in their favor.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:84%
We didn't intend it to make
it such a difficult place.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:29.640 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.620 align:middle line:84%
>> Going back to
not feeling free,

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:33.630 align:middle line:90%
as it is still on my mind.

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.650 align:middle line:84%
You said, and we cannot be
truly free if someone else is

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:38.790 align:middle line:90%
oppressed.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.790 align:middle line:84%
Does it mean you feel
compassion for the humans,

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.970 align:middle line:84%
or you help just to
be free yourselves,

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:47.560 align:middle line:90%
or is it all connected?

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.110 align:middle line:90%
>> It is connected.

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:54.450 align:middle line:84%
The concept that we are all
one is very clear from here.

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:57.600 align:middle line:84%
We are a very
empathic race, and we

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:02.220 align:middle line:84%
suffer in the shoes of
others as in our own.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:08.010 align:middle line:84%
So we do it, because we can do
something about the problem.

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:12.150 align:middle line:84%
If we do nothing it makes
us as guilty as those

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.700 align:middle line:84%
who perpetuate the
problem, because we

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.700 align:middle line:90%
do have the solution.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.400 align:middle line:84%
>> I imagine that you can

00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.920 align:middle line:90%
the limits of the laws.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:28.320 align:middle line:84%
>> Yes, correct, and the problem
is that many may not understand

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:32.310 align:middle line:84%
the solutions as it's
very metaphysical.

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:37.200 align:middle line:84%
In short, though, you change the
perception of the real people

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.950 align:middle line:84%
who are manifesting the
matrix from the inside,

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:45.450 align:middle line:84%
and you change;
solve the problem.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:50.280 align:middle line:84%
The problems on Earth are
the external reflection;

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:54.930 align:middle line:84%
mirror of a split
and traumatized self

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:59.550 align:middle line:84%
of the real people
manifesting the matrix.

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:02.220 align:middle line:84%
>> The real people here
are the ones manifesting

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.090 align:middle line:84%
and maintaining the matrix
mind control to do so.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:09.720 align:middle line:84%
The matrix imposed
by the negative ones

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:13.020 align:middle line:84%
and to change our
perception consciousness

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.230 align:middle line:84%
is to reprogram the
matrix from within.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.280 align:middle line:90%
I think I understand.
