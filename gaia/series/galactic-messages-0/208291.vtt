00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.400 align:middle line:10%
>> Would you advise me to travel
to Egypt and enter the pyramids

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:10%
to meditate?

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.050 align:middle line:90%
Is it positive energy?

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.900 align:middle line:10%
>> Yes, that is why I say they
will not understand because it

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:04.530 align:middle line:10%
has no material function useful
to the modern mind because it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.180 align:middle line:10%
is to achieve things that
are not supposed to exist.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:84%
It is extraterrestrial
understanding.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.120 align:middle line:84%
You have to think like
an extraterrestrial,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.920 align:middle line:84%
not with material
profit, nor with nonsense

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.670 align:middle line:84%
like religious beliefs
like tombs that everyone

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.920 align:middle line:90%
knows they are not.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.140 align:middle line:84%
Again, they tell you
all in Hollywood.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.970 align:middle line:10%
In the 1997, Hollywood
film "Contact,"

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.640 align:middle line:10%
where plans arrived
from deep space

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.780 align:middle line:10%
to create an incredibly
expensive large machine, which

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.230 align:middle line:10%
is believed to have many
complicated functions,

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.850 align:middle line:10%
such as a portal or
a means of transport.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.170 align:middle line:84%
In the end, that
great colossal machine

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.370 align:middle line:84%
is only to give a
mystical experience

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.220 align:middle line:90%
to whoever makes it work.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
there how society

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.900 align:middle line:84%
discredits that experience
in the end, worthless.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.982 align:middle line:90%
That is what pyramids are.

00:02:16.982 --> 00:02:20.758 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:20.758 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:90%


00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.190 align:middle line:84%
They were constructed
as power plants.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.870 align:middle line:84%
Pyramids are the perfect shape
for planetary based zero point

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.640 align:middle line:90%
energy.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.850 align:middle line:84%
But as a side effect
from such a power plant,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.300 align:middle line:84%
they become portals, as
well, mostly astral portals,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.880 align:middle line:90%
helping people fly.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Astral travel, remote
view, live that way.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.330 align:middle line:84%
They can also be full
blown portals where

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.850 align:middle line:90%
material things go to and from.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.060 align:middle line:84%
They also work in an array,
bringing a certain frequency

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.720 align:middle line:84%
to a planet, even
moving the entire planet

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.020 align:middle line:90%
to a higher realm or density.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.960 align:middle line:84%
They connect with
others in key ley line

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle line:84%
places all over a planet and
create an energy grid that

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
sustains a planet
in high vibration

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.520 align:middle line:84%
and that can even be
controlled at will.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.690 align:middle line:84%
This is a very similar
way as starship's engine

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:39.250 align:middle line:84%
keeps the ship and itself in
another density wherever it is.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Some pyramids don't even need to
have complex mechanisms inside.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.660 align:middle line:84%
As they work with vibrational
synchronicity reflecting

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
and vibrating to
the same frequency

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.780 align:middle line:90%
other pyramids vibrate too.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.890 align:middle line:84%
With that, they also
contribute to sustain

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.330 align:middle line:84%
their planetary frequency
and also augment

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.190 align:middle line:84%
the power producing efficiency
of those that do have

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.930 align:middle line:90%
electric components inside.

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:17.220 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.680 align:middle line:84%
The pyramids are frequency
generators, placed there

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.380 align:middle line:90%
at the same time as the moon.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.940 align:middle line:84%
They had to take part on
the creation of the matrix,

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.290 align:middle line:84%
but under federation
control, they

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:84%
could be capable of
removing the lunar

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.400 align:middle line:84%
matrix by changing
the frequencies

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.540 align:middle line:84%
and mingling with
the ones of the moon.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.800 align:middle line:84%
In a very real way,
providing a way

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.310 align:middle line:84%
to control the
frequency of the Earth

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.760 align:middle line:84%
without having to go
all the way to the moon.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.170 align:middle line:84%
Those are the main
functions of a pyramid.

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:07.350 align:middle line:84%
They were built for
those specific purposes

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.270 align:middle line:90%
from the very beginning.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.900 align:middle line:84%
Also, note that
some pyramids were

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.990 align:middle line:90%
built as monuments to pyramids.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.550 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they don't do
much, only be there.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.700 align:middle line:84%
The true purpose of
the Great Pyramids

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.980 align:middle line:84%
is to augment the potential
of everyone who is inside them

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.880 align:middle line:90%
for interstellar travel at will.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.620 align:middle line:84%
Astral flight with or
without, their physical body

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.690 align:middle line:90%
remains the same.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:84%
The transmutation of
personal energy of the self

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.660 align:middle line:84%
into another dimension
with all intention

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.030 align:middle line:90%
of doing it or achieving it.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.960 align:middle line:84%
Yes, it can be done
without a pyramid,

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.620 align:middle line:84%
because you are
an energetic torus

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
and an energetic torus
is a merkaba, which

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.740 align:middle line:90%
are two interlocking pyramids.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.375 align:middle line:90%
You already are the pyramid.

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:17.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Under the pyramids is there
another inverted pyramid?

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.660 align:middle line:90%
>> Yes and no.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.290 align:middle line:84%
A pyramid, the one
on the physical side,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.870 align:middle line:90%
it is what you see.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.430 align:middle line:84%
The other pyramid is
energetically intertwined

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.580 align:middle line:90%
with the one you can see.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.670 align:middle line:84%
The other pyramid is
inverted to form the merkaba.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.250 align:middle line:84%
It is not under the material
pyramid, it is intertwined.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:56.400 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.240 align:middle line:90%
>> Wow.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it intertwined in an
energetic way, one physical

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.340 align:middle line:90%
and the other non-material?

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.770 align:middle line:90%
>> A pyramid is material.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
The other is on the
other side, spirit world.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.090 align:middle line:90%
The ether.

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:22.960 align:middle line:84%
Creating the merkaba, thus
creating the flow of energy

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:90%
called free.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.200 align:middle line:84%
>> Is it true that visualizing
yourself in this merkaba,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:84%
it is a vehicle for
interdimensional travel?

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.840 align:middle line:84%
>> Visualizing yourself is
activating an intention.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.770 align:middle line:90%
Yes, it works.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.700 align:middle line:90%
That's how it works.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Egypt, because it is
in a specific place,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:52.130 align:middle line:84%
like the geometric center of
the Earth on the ley lines,

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.720 align:middle line:84%
and this increases the energy
efficiency of the pyramids

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.010 align:middle line:84%
and also distributes
and connects the energy

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.870 align:middle line:84%
distribution with other pyramids
in other parts of the world.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.770 align:middle line:90%
Mostly also on the ley lines.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.480 align:middle line:90%
It's the main point.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.290 align:middle line:10%
It was chosen as the
main dump base as well.

>> Dump as a general base
for the United Federation

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:28.730 align:middle line:84%
of planets, and if we
went down into that dump,

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.890 align:middle line:90%
what could we find?

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.220 align:middle line:84%
Is there some kind of
ancient library of knowledge?

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:41.090 align:middle line:84%
Some kind of quartz crystal or
one of those new age stories?

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.710 align:middle line:84%
>> Downstairs, there is a
base as it was back then.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.790 align:middle line:84%
That is, it does not look
like an Egyptian relic,

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:55.730 align:middle line:84%
but they are metal and composite
corridors with pneumatic doors

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:58.260 align:middle line:90%

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.590 align:middle line:84%
I don't know what
exactly, but I do

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.580 align:middle line:84%
know that there would
be places of recreation,

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:10.980 align:middle line:84%
places with bedrooms, kitchens,
common areas, laboratories,

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.100 align:middle line:84%

computer equipment

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and location navigation for
ships, portals, and warehouses.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.650 align:middle line:84%
Engineering places, such as
support and accommodation

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.620 align:middle line:90%
systems for various species.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:34.500 align:middle line:84%
Places like medical centers,
met bots, small ships.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.040 align:middle line:84%
In the computers, there
will be information.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:84%
Everything is
dormant and damaged

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.030 align:middle line:90%
but some things will work.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.395 align:middle line:10%

found under Mount Bucegi.

know about this?

>> It's mostly the shape
of the pyramid itself.

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:14.920 align:middle line:84%
In itself, that
geometric shape makes

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.270 align:middle line:84%
a spiral of energy
rebound in its interior

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.240 align:middle line:90%
and is of high frequency.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:27.130 align:middle line:84%
It is mainly concentrated

but the entire
interior is affected.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:37.540 align:middle line:84%
This in itself increases
the connection with source,

making all astral
experiences more efficient.

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:48.610 align:middle line:84%
It is a natural hub or
amplifier for consciousness

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.750 align:middle line:84%
due to its internal
high frequencies.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:57.850 align:middle line:84%

It is atenism based on Egypt.

deities of the constellation of
triangulum, Enlil, Anu, and EA.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:28.520 align:middle line:84%
The obelisk is an offering
to those three deities.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.520 align:middle line:90%
It is a look up.

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.930 align:middle line:84%
Where there is an obelisk,
it means that the illuminati

Also Anu and EA.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:04.370 align:middle line:84%
Anu, equals almighty
creator God.

EA equals Yahweh or Allah.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Enlil equals Elohim:
gods, plural.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:16.140 align:middle line:90%
Yahweh is not a person.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.880 align:middle line:90%
It is an event.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.240 align:middle line:90%
It is a creative orgasm.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.130 align:middle line:84%
It is the big bang as a
Yahweh, creative explosion.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:30.540 align:middle line:84%

>> Yes, I even have the map.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.600 align:middle line:84%
It is an extraterrestrial

It is about the
subject of slaves.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:44.760 align:middle line:10%
There are many geoglyphs

Man power with the small ones,
because the stones were not

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:18.840 align:middle line:90%

due to the plasticity it holds.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:07.030 align:middle line:84%
But as an educated linear guess,
the Sphinx is over 35,000 years

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.500 align:middle line:90%
old.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.930 align:middle line:84%
I know the pyramids
are also said

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:14.650 align:middle line:84%
to be as much as
30,000 years old,

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:20.150 align:middle line:84%
but to the best of my data,
they are closer to 15,000 years

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:20.950 align:middle line:90%
old--

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:33.780 align:middle line:84%

as 12,000 to 11,000 years old.

As I said above, you cannot
calculate time that is not

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.430 align:middle line:84%
a linear as it
was not back then,

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:47.310 align:middle line:84%
and the pyramids at Giza do not
show the same water damage that

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:49.860 align:middle line:90%
the Sphinx does display.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.180 align:middle line:84%
So they could not have
been built at the same time

00:28:54.180 --> 00:28:57.150 align:middle line:84%
and the water damage
in the pyramids

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:00.630 align:middle line:84%
give you a clue
that it was produced

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:06.720 align:middle line:84%
by minor floods such as the ones
the Nile would produce and not

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.110 align:middle line:84%
because of a cataclysmic
inundation event water

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:14.640 align:middle line:84%
damage such as the one
that Sphinx does display.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.880 align:middle line:84%
Meaning it was totally submerged
at the time of the flood coming
