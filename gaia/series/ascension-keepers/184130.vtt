00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.832 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.832 --> 00:00:19.530 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.855 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm William Henry and
this is "Ascension Keepers."

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.570 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.960 align:middle line:10%
The Essenes community was
an intersection or portal

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:10%
between heaven and Earth with
celestial or heavenly beings

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.570 align:middle line:10%
living amongst them
as instructors.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.060 align:middle line:84%
Their goal was to
transform Earth

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.780 align:middle line:90%
into a planet of righteousness.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.810 align:middle line:84%
One gets the impression that
the Essenes perceived Earth

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.070 align:middle line:84%
as disconnected from
the cosmic real world.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.590 align:middle line:84%
And their goal was
to put humanity back

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.350 align:middle line:90%
on line, so to speak.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.920 align:middle line:84%
To the Essenes, the real
world we are seeking

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.170 align:middle line:84%
included joining a
celestial city called Sion,

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.150 align:middle line:90%
or the New Jerusalem.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.570 align:middle line:84%
It was conceived as an
actual city constructed

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.760 align:middle line:84%
in heaven that will be revealed,
or disclosed, when it comes out

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.520 align:middle line:90%
of heaven to Earth.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.590 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes tell
us it's inhabited

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.880 align:middle line:84%
by an advanced human race
of just humans made perfect.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.800 align:middle line:84%
And they tell us how
we can join them.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.260 align:middle line:84%
For one thing, only
the pure in heart

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.550 align:middle line:90%
can enter and dwell in Sion.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.710 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes believed
that in order

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.010 align:middle line:84%
to enter this heavenly
city, one is required

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.670 align:middle line:84%
to become like the
angels, who dress lightly

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.510 align:middle line:90%
in a white robe of glory.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.530 align:middle line:84%
This robe symbolizes their
ascension, or conversion,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.320 align:middle line:84%
into an energy
pattern and attainment

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.570 align:middle line:84%
of the celestial
light body that was

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.160 align:middle line:84%
capable of being reconverted,
or re-materialized, into matter

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.260 align:middle line:90%
into flesh and blood.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.990 align:middle line:84%
This gave them the
ability to phase

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.130 align:middle line:84%
between the two states of being,
between earthly and celestial.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.640 align:middle line:84%
Obtaining this robe of
glory, or robe of light,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.910 align:middle line:84%
required a transformation
or perfection

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.870 align:middle line:84%
of our being from earthly
flesh to celestial flesh,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.980 align:middle line:84%
of which the Essenes
claim to be experts.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.080 align:middle line:84%
Here, we recall the
words of Matthew,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.320 align:middle line:84%
who said that at the
moment of Jesus's death,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.940 align:middle line:84%
his flesh and the
veil were both torn,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and the way was opened
into the heavens,

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.470 align:middle line:90%
into the presence of God.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.340 align:middle line:10%
In flesh, Jesus is veiled.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.190 align:middle line:10%
And when he unveils,
he dissolves the flesh

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:10%
into the rainbow body.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.950 align:middle line:84%
And in a flash, he
dematerializes, or passes,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.690 align:middle line:84%
through the hole in heaven
to the world beyond the veil.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.120 align:middle line:84%
Then he re-materializes at will,
appearing over a dozen times

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.230 align:middle line:84%
to the disciples in
the New Testament.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.480 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes believed
that they were not

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.940 align:middle line:84%
only privileged to receive
these divine mysteries,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.190 align:middle line:84%
but that doing so would put
them in the company of angels

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.560 align:middle line:90%
in the celestial city.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.550 align:middle line:84%
This belief is referred to
in the scroll known as 1QM.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.040 align:middle line:84%
"Oh, God of Israel, who is like
thee in heaven or on Earth, who

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.170 align:middle line:84%
accomplished deeds
and mighty works

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.580 align:middle line:84%
like thine, who is like thy
people Israel, which thou hast

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
chose for thyself from all
the peoples of the lands,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.700 align:middle line:84%
the people of the saints of the
covenant instructed in the laws

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.020 align:middle line:84%
and learned in wisdom, who
have heard the voice of majesty

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and have seen the
angels of holiness,

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.420 align:middle line:84%
whose ear has been
unstopped and who

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.320 align:middle line:90%
have heard profound things."

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.190 align:middle line:84%
Instructed in the laws and
learned and wisdom, who

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.740 align:middle line:84%
have heard the voice
of majesty, and have

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.250 align:middle line:90%
seen the angels of holiness.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.600 align:middle line:10%
In today's UFO vernacular,
that is a close encounter

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.340 align:middle line:10%
of the third kind.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.839 align:middle line:10%
They saw an other worldly being.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.910 align:middle line:84%
Another passage in
the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.420 align:middle line:84%
indicates the further
belief that the Essenes were

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.766 align:middle line:84%
in the company of these angels,
or extraterrestrial beings.

00:04:28.766 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle line:84%
"Thou hast raised me up
to the everlasting height.

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.780 align:middle line:84%
I walk on limitless
level ground,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.420 align:middle line:84%
and I know there is
hope for him whom

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.620 align:middle line:84%
thou hast shaped from the dust
for the everlasting council.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.610 align:middle line:84%
thou hast cleansed a
perversed spirit of great sin

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.240 align:middle line:84%
that it may stand with
the host of the holy ones

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.320 align:middle line:84%
and that it may enter into the
community with the congregation

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.790 align:middle line:90%
of the sons of heaven."

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:90%


00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.640 align:middle line:10%
In my opinion, this
is a description

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.500 align:middle line:10%
of a close encounter
of the fourth kind,

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.600 align:middle line:10%
a CE4, an event in which a
human is taken or abducted

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.130 align:middle line:10%
by an alien.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.370 align:middle line:10%
In this case, it's not
a malevolent abduction.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a benevolent one.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
They have been raised up to
the everlasting height, taken

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.860 align:middle line:90%
from Earth into heaven.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.850 align:middle line:84%
This is also a close encounter
of the fifth kind, a CE5,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.550 align:middle line:84%
which involves
direct communication

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.210 align:middle line:84%
between extraterrestrials
and humans.

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.730 align:middle line:10%
This type of interaction,
according to Doctor Steven

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.330 align:middle line:10%
Greer, is a willing
and bilateral contact,

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.530 align:middle line:10%
experienced through conscious,
voluntary, and proactive

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.800 align:middle line:10%
human-initiated
cooperative communication

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.900 align:middle line:10%
and extraterrestrial
intelligence.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.770 align:middle line:84%
Having been altered,
cleansed, taken

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.380 align:middle line:84%
into the celestial
realms, the Essenes

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.790 align:middle line:84%
now stand with the
holy ones, the angels.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.550 align:middle line:90%
They have become one of them.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.900 align:middle line:84%
They star walk into
the angelic realm.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.660 align:middle line:84%
This is a close encounter of
the eighth and ninth kind, a CE8

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.810 align:middle line:90%
or a CE9.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.850 align:middle line:84%
These passages show that
the Essenes believed, one,

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.970 align:middle line:84%
that they possessed
the secrets of God.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.410 align:middle line:90%
They learned wisdom.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.900 align:middle line:10%
They heard the voice of majesty.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.160 align:middle line:84%
They saw and
interacted with angels,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:90%
extraterrestrial beings.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.280 align:middle line:84%
They could be raised
or translated to heaven

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.200 align:middle line:84%
and purified, so that they
could join the holy ones

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.490 align:middle line:84%
and enter into their
company as sons of heaven

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.810 align:middle line:90%
in Sion, the celestial city.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the purpose
of the Essene community

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.050 align:middle line:84%
was to purify members
in anticipation

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.700 align:middle line:84%
of joining the company of
angels in the celestial city.

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So what do we know or need to
know about this celestial city?

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:23.240 align:middle line:84%
For instance, is this
celestial city a craft?

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.580 align:middle line:10%
Are the Essenes
talking about something

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.730 align:middle line:10%
like what we saw in "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind."

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.380 align:middle line:10%
"Close Encounters" was
a 1977 sci-fi flick

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.220 align:middle line:10%
that explicitly mined
traditional religious themes,

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.400 align:middle line:10%
especially those of the Essenes.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.890 align:middle line:84%
In the movie, everyman,
Richard Dreyfus,

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.220 align:middle line:84%
experiences a dramatic
experience on a road,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.030 align:middle line:84%
like Paul on his way to
Damascus or to Qumran.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.150 align:middle line:84%
He becomes obsessed with
the pursuit of some truth

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.030 align:middle line:84%
that he doesn't
fully understand.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.840 align:middle line:10%
He ends up abandoning and
being abandoned by his family

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.540 align:middle line:10%
and goes on a cross-country
journey with another believer

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.510 align:middle line:10%
to seek some sort of
unknown fulfillment.

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:10.070 align:middle line:10%
When he arrives, he sees
the light, a saucer.

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:13.340 align:middle line:10%
When the saucer
lands, he boards it.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:18.080 align:middle line:10%
The saucer departs and Dreyfus
is assumed, or ascends,

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.080 align:middle line:10%
into heaven.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.560 align:middle line:10%
Are the angels of the
Lord of the Essenes

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.780 align:middle line:10%
really gray aliens as
Spielberg envisions?

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:36.320 align:middle line:10%
Or the elder race they spoke
of, a more advanced ET race?

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.140 align:middle line:10%
Is the new Jerusalem a massive
interstellar spaceship?

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:45.260 align:middle line:10%
When viewed from the bottom, the
spaceship in "Close Encounters"

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:51.050 align:middle line:10%
seems to mirror the descent of
some kind of a celestial city.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.490 align:middle line:84%
But in Christian art, it's
referred to as a portal.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:58.590 align:middle line:84%
The new Jerusalem
itself is a portal.

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:00.920 align:middle line:84%
And this certainly, to
me, makes more sense

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.920 align:middle line:90%
than does a spaceship.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.640 align:middle line:84%
If the new Jerusalem
is a portal,

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.370 align:middle line:84%
does it exist in
the material world?

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:14.870 align:middle line:10%
Or does it only exist in the
realm of higher consciousness?

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.040 align:middle line:84%
Is it accessible only by
the mystically initiated,

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.400 align:middle line:90%
the awakened?

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.210 align:middle line:84%
We must ask these
questions early and often.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:29.440 align:middle line:84%
And for the answers, we can
begin where the Essenes did--

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.040 align:middle line:90%
with Ezekiel.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.680 align:middle line:84%
A priest and prophet,
Ezekiel is one

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.180 align:middle line:84%
of the contenders for the title
of founder of the Essenes.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.970 align:middle line:84%
He wrote his visionary
book containing

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.240 align:middle line:84%
his vision of the celestial
city while captive

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.670 align:middle line:84%
along with thousands
of other Jews

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.200 align:middle line:84%
taken from Jerusalem to
Babylon between 593 and 571

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.290 align:middle line:84%
BC after Nebuchadnezzar
destroyed

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.470 align:middle line:90%
the first temple of Solomon.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.340 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel tells how he was
among the captives living

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.960 align:middle line:84%
by the River Chebar in Babylon
when the heavens were opened

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:90%
and I saw visions of God.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.410 align:middle line:84%
In the book, Ezekiel tries
to convey the limitless realm

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:19.040 align:middle line:84%
he experiences via
this hole in space

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.370 align:middle line:90%
to the limited terrestrial mind.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:10%
The book of Ezekiel tells
of the reunification

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.610 align:middle line:10%
of the 12 Jewish tribes
around a manifestation

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:10%
of a new Jerusalem, a perfect
cubed shaped heavenly temple

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.190 align:middle line:10%
or city, apparently
centered on or hovering

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:42.970 align:middle line:10%
above a rebuilt
temple of Solomon.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:47.590 align:middle line:84%
Ascension to this celestial
throne, the heavenly Jerusalem,

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.650 align:middle line:90%
is the goal of the Essenes.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:57.140 align:middle line:84%
And as their scrolls say, it
requires a change in being.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:02.140 align:middle line:84%
Angelification or human
transformation into an angel,

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.620 align:middle line:84%
like what the archangel
Michael did for Enoch,

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.820 align:middle line:84%
is one term academics use
for this metamorphosis

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.590 align:middle line:90%
or transformation.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:16.400 align:middle line:84%
This metamorphosis is featured
in the Essene story of Enoch,

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.550 align:middle line:84%
the pre-flood sage who
walked with God, when

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:23.840 align:middle line:84%
he was raised to the heavenly
city by the archangel Michael

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:28.280 align:middle line:84%
and transformed into a glorious
and glowing angel, named

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.470 align:middle line:90%
Metatron.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.640 align:middle line:84%
As Metatron, he became
a guide for all humans

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:38.720 align:middle line:90%
on the path of ascension.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.390 align:middle line:84%
These are the teachings
that were ripped away

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:43.790 align:middle line:84%
from the Israelites
by King Josiah

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:47.360 align:middle line:84%
and replaced with
the Ten Commandments.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.960 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes were not content
to repeat the 10 commandments,

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.220 align:middle line:84%
which they lived by, nor
mere stories of past prophets

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.830 align:middle line:84%
or the history of
the people of Israel.

00:11:57.830 --> 00:12:02.480 align:middle line:10%
Instead, as we have seen,
their texts were practices,

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.810 align:middle line:10%
they were visualizations,
rehearsals

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:10%
that put them in the vibration,
or frequency, of the angels

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.545 align:middle line:10%
and elevated them
to their company.

00:12:12.545 --> 00:12:15.790 align:middle line:90%


00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.220 align:middle line:84%
The experiences of
Ezekiel and Enoch

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:24.650 align:middle line:84%
effectively became scripts,
or mind maps, for the steps

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:29.390 align:middle line:84%
an initiate would take along
the ascension pathway to heaven,

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.660 align:middle line:90%
or to the Celestial City.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.720 align:middle line:84%
These scripts were part of
what is called the Hekhalot,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:38.000 align:middle line:90%
or Merkabah mysteries.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.520 align:middle line:84%
These were developed
by the Essenes

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.510 align:middle line:84%
and aimed at attaining
perfection, meaning wholeness,

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.770 align:middle line:84%
holiness, completion,
or compassion.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:54.270 align:middle line:84%
The term Hekhalot refers to
the seven steps in the journey

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.460 align:middle line:90%
to the Celestial City.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.220 align:middle line:84%
And as they ascended
the path of perfection

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:04.200 align:middle line:84%
they proceeded to the divine
throne in the Celestial City.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Along the way, the eyes of
their heart were opened.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.240 align:middle line:90%


00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.720 align:middle line:84%
The term Merkabah,
or thrown chariot,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.920 align:middle line:84%
represents a vehicle that is
separated into seven chambers,

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.020 align:middle line:90%
according to the teaching.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.340 align:middle line:84%
It ultimately refers to the
chariot, or throne, that God is

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:29.060 align:middle line:90%
sitting on in Ezekiel's vision.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.640 align:middle line:84%
For this reason,
Merkabah's mysticism

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.930 align:middle line:84%
is called throne
chariot mysticism.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:39.170 align:middle line:84%
And those who sought to
duplicate Ezekiel's experience

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.970 align:middle line:84%
were called Descenders
of the Chariot.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.840 align:middle line:84%
This is the chariot throne that
we see Jesus ascending upon

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.850 align:middle line:90%
in Christian art.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.760 align:middle line:84%
It is a lost fact
among modern Christians

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.720 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus was a Merkabah
mystic, even that he

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.710 align:middle line:84%
was connected with the Essenes,
and that the cloud he ascended

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:04.490 align:middle line:84%
upon is the Merkabah
throne chariot that

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:07.480 align:middle line:90%
takes us to the new Jerusalem.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.180 align:middle line:84%
Prophecies of Jesus's
return tell us

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:14.305 align:middle line:84%
he will ride upon this
very same cloud chariot.

00:14:14.305 --> 00:14:17.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
John the Revelator's
Book of Revelation,

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.380 align:middle line:84%
which tells of this return,
was written a generation

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.260 align:middle line:90%
after the Essenes.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:30.980 align:middle line:84%
It can be thought of as not
only inspired by the Essenes,

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:34.400 align:middle line:84%
but as a continuation
of Ezekiel's vision

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.300 align:middle line:84%
and clearly reflects Essene
beliefs and teachings

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:42.710 align:middle line:84%
about ascension to
the new Jerusalem.

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:47.060 align:middle line:84%
In the Book of Revelation, John
espouses Essene belief when

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:52.580 align:middle line:84%
he says, "Blessed are those who
wash their robes so that they

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.800 align:middle line:84%
will have the right
to the tree of life

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.670 align:middle line:84%
and may enter the
New Jerusalem."

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.250 align:middle line:90%


00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.100 align:middle line:10%
Writing from the Isle
of Patmos in Greece,

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.160 align:middle line:10%
John prophesied that
the Celestial City seen

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.200 align:middle line:10%
by Ezekiel and the Essenes
descends, or comes down, out

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.090 align:middle line:10%
of heaven and becomes the
capital of the kingdom of life,

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:19.030 align:middle line:10%
the meeting place of
the 12 tribes of Israel

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:22.840 align:middle line:10%
and the gathering place
where righteous and perfected

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.000 align:middle line:10%
humans meet.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.580 align:middle line:84%
Some believe this will
happen in the near future.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.390 align:middle line:84%
For example, in Hans Memling's
St. John the Evangelist

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:37.720 align:middle line:84%
on Patmos, we see
John the Revelator

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.110 align:middle line:84%
in the midst of this visionary
experience that put him

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:43.750 align:middle line:90%
in the presence of Christ.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.470 align:middle line:84%
Over the rainbow bridge,
a bridge of consciousness,

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:51.640 align:middle line:84%
is the glorified Jesus
on his rainbow throne

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.990 align:middle line:90%
in his rainbow body in Sion.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.750 align:middle line:84%
What I noticed is
that this scene

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.420 align:middle line:84%
has exactly the same
meaning as the Tibetan image

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.480 align:middle line:84%
of the fourth Dalai Lama
seeing the rainbow body

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.540 align:middle line:90%
being, Avalokiteeshvara.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:13.100 align:middle line:84%
Revelation, Chapter 4,
provides John's description

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:17.870 align:middle line:84%
of this rainbow
doorway, this star gate.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.920 align:middle line:84%
"After this I looked and behold,
a door was opened in heaven.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And the first
voice which I heard

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:25.820 align:middle line:84%
was as it were of
a trumpet talking

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.520 align:middle line:84%
with me, which
said come up hither

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.110 align:middle line:84%
and these things which
must be hereafter."

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:36.350 align:middle line:84%
According to the vision
given to John the Revelator,

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:42.920 align:middle line:84%
the New Jerusalem is an
actual, enormous, 12-gated city

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.130 align:middle line:90%
that comes out of heaven.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.120 align:middle line:84%
The resurrected Jesus
sits on the throne.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.890 align:middle line:84%
And it is he who
gives John his vision.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.680 align:middle line:84%
And he has a rainbow
around his body.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.640 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.069 align:middle line:84%
John said, "Then I saw a
new heaven and a new Earth,

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.260 align:middle line:84%
for the first heaven and
Earth had passed away

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.270 align:middle line:90%
and the sea was no more.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.630 align:middle line:84%
I saw the Holy City,
the New Jerusalem,

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:16.630 align:middle line:84%
coming down out of
heaven from God,

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:21.430 align:middle line:84%
prepared as a bride
adorned for her."

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.520 align:middle line:84%
John tells us the New
Jerusalem is made of pure gold,

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.960 align:middle line:90%
like clear glass.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.050 align:middle line:10%
And its brilliance is
like a very costly stone,

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:33.340 align:middle line:10%
as a stone of
crystal clear jasper.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Its streets have no names
and are made of pure gold.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It's like the Garden
of Eden with a river

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.450 align:middle line:84%
flowing the waters of life
from the throne of God,

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.700 align:middle line:84%
and the tree of
life at its center

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:48.715 align:middle line:84%
has leaves for the healing
of all the nations.

00:17:48.715 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:90%


00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.550 align:middle line:84%
In another part of
the temple, John

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.500 align:middle line:84%
saw the Ark of the
Covenant, which

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.570 align:middle line:90%
had been lost for centuries.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:02.040 align:middle line:84%
And he also saw the Jar of
Manna, Aaron's rod that butted,

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:04.710 align:middle line:90%
and the Jar of Anointing Oil.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.670 align:middle line:10%
All these items were lost
after the purge of Josiah,

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:10%
but would return when
the Messiah restored

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:16.360 align:middle line:10%
the temple, the New Jerusalem.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.810 align:middle line:10%
From the author of another
text based on Essene teaching,

00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:24.370 align:middle line:10%
we learn the New Jerusalem is
inhabited by a race of divine,

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:28.600 align:middle line:10%
righteous, or perfected humans,
who bear the name of God

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:34.630 align:middle line:10%
on their foreheads and who have
ascended to the Celestial City.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:40.150 align:middle line:10%
The book of Hebrews says Sion
is the holy city of the living

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:10%
God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
and our arrival there marks

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:50.440 align:middle line:10%
our acceptance into an
innumerable company of angels

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.720 align:middle line:10%
and just humans made perfect.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:00.760 align:middle line:84%
Who are these just
humans made perfect?

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
A group of humans,
we are being told,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:09.160 align:middle line:84%
have ascended to this holy
city and now live there.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.640 align:middle line:84%
What we want to know is,
again, who are these people?

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.550 align:middle line:90%
And how did they get there?

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.330 align:middle line:84%
In my view, they are
the ascended Essenes who

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:22.780 align:middle line:90%
followed the way of perfection.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:24.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, when we
look at the meaning

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:29.650 align:middle line:84%
of the words used to describe
them, it tells us just this.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:34.900 align:middle line:84%
The word just means upright,
righteous-ed, balanced.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.690 align:middle line:84%
Humans means a member
of the species Homo

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.130 align:middle line:84%
sapiens, not animal,
divine, or machine.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.280 align:middle line:90%
Made means shaped or formed.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.660 align:middle line:84%
And perfect means complete,
fully developed, whole,

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.760 align:middle line:90%
or holy.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.720 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, we are
being told Sion is

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.660 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual place beyond
the physical realm that's

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:05.800 align:middle line:84%
inhabited by a separate race
of just humans made perfect.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:11.260 align:middle line:84%
Also, Sion godly inhabitants
are transformed or ascended

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:84%
humans, who live in the company
of angels in the heavenly city.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:20.560 align:middle line:84%
The good people of Sion,
or the New Jerusalem,

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.630 align:middle line:90%
are holy other worldly beings.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:29.050 align:middle line:84%
We should not be surprised
to learn that scholars now

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:84%
see the book of Hebrews as an
Essene influenced text, another

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.830 align:middle line:84%
of these mind maps, if you
will, ascension scripts,

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.690 align:middle line:90%
ascension simulation scripts.

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.480 align:middle line:90%


00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.050 align:middle line:84%
The book of Hebrews
explores the theme of Jesus

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:51.250 align:middle line:84%
as the high priest,
a celestial traveler,

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:56.080 align:middle line:84%
who came to Earth to
demonstrate a cosmic power

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.110 align:middle line:84%
and to take his brothers and
sisters through a portal,

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:04.360 align:middle line:84%
or stargate, to heaven and
to join a family of holy ones

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:90%
in the Celestial City.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.970 align:middle line:84%
And when we begin to view
the ascension story of Jesus

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.940 align:middle line:84%
from the Essene
perspective, we can see

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.560 align:middle line:90%
many elements coming together.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.160 align:middle line:90%


00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Let's begin on the morning
of Christ's resurrection,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.290 align:middle line:90%
Easter morning.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:25.450 align:middle line:84%
We begin here because
we are viewing

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.270 align:middle line:84%
Christ as the fulfillment
of the Essenes' mission

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:31.480 align:middle line:84%
to call in a high
celestial being, who

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:37.020 align:middle line:84%
is the exemplar of the mysteries
this teacher brought to Earth.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.090 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Gospel of Matthew,

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.360 align:middle line:84%
on the morning of the
resurrection, Mary Magdalene

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and the other Marys,
temple priestesses,

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:48.780 align:middle line:84%
Essene initiates
went to see the tomb.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:51.630 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, there was
a great earthquake

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:54.750 align:middle line:84%
for an angel of
the Lord descended

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:59.190 align:middle line:84%
from heaven rolled away
the stone and sat on it.

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.070 align:middle line:84%
His appearance was
like lightning.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:06.780 align:middle line:90%
And his clothing white as snow.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.440 align:middle line:84%
This angel of the Lord, who
must have come from Sion,

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:14.730 align:middle line:84%
told Mary that her beloved
was no longer here.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.230 align:middle line:84%
But shortly he reappeared
to Mary Magdalene.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:23.010 align:middle line:84%
Jesus refers to his impending
ascension in the Gospel of John

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:27.360 align:middle line:84%
when he tells Mary Magdalene
stop holding onto me,

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.490 align:middle line:84%
for I have not yet
ascended to the Father.

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:32.160 align:middle line:84%
But go to my brothers
and say to them,

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.770 align:middle line:84%
I am ascending to my
father and your father,

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:39.090 align:middle line:90%
to my God and your God.

00:22:39.090 --> 00:22:41.940 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Jesus made
multiple appearances

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:44.310 align:middle line:84%
in several locations
to his disciples

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:47.880 align:middle line:84%
for 40 days following
his resurrection.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.860 align:middle line:10%
These visits continued
long after, as we will see.

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:59.620 align:middle line:84%
His primary goal was to
transmit to them a sacred power.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:03.940 align:middle line:84%
He promised that when I go
and prepare a place for you,

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.990 align:middle line:84%
I will come again and
will take you to myself

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.680 align:middle line:84%
that where I am going
you may be also.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.320 align:middle line:90%
Think about what this is saying.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:18.770 align:middle line:84%
Jesus can manifest
as a light being

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:22.130 align:middle line:84%
and take us to another
realm with him.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.560 align:middle line:90%


00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.990 align:middle line:84%
The ascension of Jesus
occurred at Bethany

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.640 align:middle line:90%
on the Mount of Olives.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.910 align:middle line:90%
Several disciples were gathered.

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.340 align:middle line:84%
This illumination
from a 6th century

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Syrian manuscript,
the Rabbula Gospels,

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.730 align:middle line:84%
shows the ascension of Jesus
upon a feathered throne

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:84%
chariot, exactly like
the one Ezekiel saw.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:51.120 align:middle line:84%
Art historians note a great many
Western ascension images adapt

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.060 align:middle line:90%
the pattern seen in this image.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:59.040 align:middle line:84%
This became a common way
of portraying ascension.

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.440 align:middle line:84%
As the disciples
were looking on,

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.130 align:middle line:84%
Jesus was lifted
up in a cloud that

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:11.490 align:middle line:84%
resembles a portal or gateway
took him out of their sight.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:14.880 align:middle line:84%
And while the disciples were
gazing into heaven as he went,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.870 align:middle line:84%
behold, two men stood
by them in white robes

00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:21.930 align:middle line:84%
and said, "Men of
Galilee, why do you

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.120 align:middle line:90%
look standing into heaven?

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.510 align:middle line:84%
This Jesus who is taken
up from you into heaven

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:32.760 align:middle line:84%
will come in the same way as
you saw him go into heaven."

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.178 align:middle line:84%
This means that
Jesus comes and goes

00:24:35.178 --> 00:24:36.720 align:middle line:84%
through what we
would today interpret

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.520 align:middle line:90%
as a portal, or a gateway.

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:41.140 align:middle line:90%


00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, the Essenes were known
for their white linen garments.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.910 align:middle line:84%
So we have to ask,
were these the two men

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.460 align:middle line:84%
that were present in
the tomb on Easter?

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.370 align:middle line:84%
Were these the two
angels or men in white

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.440 align:middle line:84%
that were present
for the ascension?

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.830 align:middle line:90%
Were these Essenes?

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.970 align:middle line:84%
In very clear and
direct language,

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:06.940 align:middle line:84%
we are being told that on
Easter morning, a being whose

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.130 align:middle line:90%
body resembled lightning--

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.990 align:middle line:90%
in other words, a plasma being--

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.760 align:middle line:84%
manifested on Earth from
a celestial location.

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.020 align:middle line:10%
During this event, Jesus
transmuted his body

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:24.250 align:middle line:10%
to match theirs and
then ascended to heaven,

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:28.720 align:middle line:10%
or a place called Sion,
and promised to return.

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:31.800 align:middle line:10%
Then he ascended.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:37.330 align:middle line:84%
So what was that cloud
Christ ascended upon?

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's the Merkabah.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.120 align:middle line:84%
It's the Merkabah
throne chariot.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.450 align:middle line:10%
Or for sure, the
art of ascension

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.840 align:middle line:10%
is clearly based on
the Merkabah imagery

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.780 align:middle line:10%
of Ezekiel and the
other Merkabah mystics,

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:55.740 align:middle line:10%
including the Essenes.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.750 align:middle line:84%
But where did Jesus says
go once he ascended?

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:05.070 align:middle line:84%
The answer is he ascended to
a celestial throne, the New

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.740 align:middle line:90%
Jerusalem, or Sion.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:09.750 align:middle line:84%
Christian art
features this imagery

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:15.090 align:middle line:84%
in which the ascended Christ is
surrounded by just humans who

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.880 align:middle line:84%
have been made
perfect and now live

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.360 align:middle line:84%
at this throne in
the Celestial City.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.970 align:middle line:90%
I propose they're Essenes.

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.640 align:middle line:84%
One can only imagine
what is really

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.140 align:middle line:84%
going on in Jerusalem
during the Essene disclosure

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.090 align:middle line:90%
and afterwards.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:38.160 align:middle line:84%
But one thing is certain,
Rome was having none of it.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.270 align:middle line:84%
In the spring of 66 AD,
the Jews of Jerusalem

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.360 align:middle line:84%
revolted against
the Roman Empire.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.850 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes joined
them, seeing the revolt

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.090 align:middle line:84%
as the final end time
battle and a chance

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:55.680 align:middle line:84%
to reveal the Celestial
City to the world.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.250 align:middle line:84%
In retaliation for the revolt,
the tyrannical Roman emperor

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:02.790 align:middle line:84%
Nero dispatched Vespasian
and a massive relief

00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:06.300 align:middle line:84%
army of 60,000 highly
trained soldiers

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:11.500 align:middle line:84%
marched into Jerusalem to
crush the Jewish resistance.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:16.440 align:middle line:84%
The general appointed his son
Titus as his second in command.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.180 align:middle line:84%
Vespasian, the future
emperor of Rome,

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.120 align:middle line:84%
led the Roman war machine
to the center of the Earth,

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:25.870 align:middle line:84%
as Jerusalem was known,
on a two-fold mission.

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:30.490 align:middle line:84%
First, exterminate the
Jews, including the Essenes.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.100 align:middle line:10%
All of the Essene
communes, or outposts,

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.890 align:middle line:10%
spread throughout
Palestine, including Qumran,

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:39.340 align:middle line:10%
Mount Carmel, Masada, were
targeted for destruction

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.720 align:middle line:10%
by the empire.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.560 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Because of what Jesus
had demonstrated.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:50.020 align:middle line:84%
Second, his mission was to
destroy the Temple of Solomon.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And when Vespasian entered
the center of the Earth,

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:55.680 align:middle line:84%
he must have been
anticipating high strangeness.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:59.220 align:middle line:84%
Several historians
noted that in 66 AD,

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:03.690 align:middle line:84%
Jerusalem was filled with
bizarre lights and occurrences.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.730 align:middle line:84%
The Temple of Solomon
itself was also

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:08.850 align:middle line:84%
displaying some kind
of unusual light show.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:11.310 align:middle line:84%
Strange, loud voices
could be heard

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.470 align:middle line:90%
coming from its inner altar.

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:17.910 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish historian Josephus
says that during the night.

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:22.330 align:middle line:84%
so great a light shown around
the altar and the Holy House,

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:26.390 align:middle line:84%
that it appeared to
be bright daytime.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:28.610 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, but
Josephus recorded that

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.360 align:middle line:84%
before sun setting, chariots
and troops of soldiers

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:36.740 align:middle line:84%
and their armor were seen
running about among the clouds

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.740 align:middle line:90%
and surrounding of cities.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Another Roman
historian, Tacitus,

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.830 align:middle line:84%
commented that "in the sky
appeared a vision of armies

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.260 align:middle line:90%
in conflict of glittering armor.

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:52.940 align:middle line:84%
A sudden lightning flash from
the clouds lit up the Temple."

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:55.910 align:middle line:84%
More, a star that
resembled a sword was

00:28:55.910 --> 00:29:00.290 align:middle line:84%
seen in the sky along with a
comet that lasted for a year.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.600 align:middle line:84%
Strangely, Jesus
had warned about all

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:84%
of these signs saying,
"And great earthquake

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.310 align:middle line:84%
shall be in diverse
places and famines

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and pestilences and fearful
sights and great signs

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.330 align:middle line:90%
shall there be from heaven."

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:17.270 align:middle line:84%
Nero unleashed Vespasian
and the Roman army

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:20.870 align:middle line:84%
to put a stop to all this
supernatural nonsense and all

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.660 align:middle line:84%
this Essene talk about
the Celestial City

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:28.800 align:middle line:84%
and an empire greater than
Rome once and for all.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.420 align:middle line:10%
After destroying Jericho the
day before on June 21, 68 AD,

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:37.320 align:middle line:10%
5,000 Roman soldiers
converged on Qumran.

00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.510 align:middle line:90%
The Essene know what's coming.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:84%
And in preparation for the Roman
attack, they flee Jerusalem.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:47.460 align:middle line:84%
A scroll preservation
team, or teams,

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:50.790 align:middle line:84%
hastily gathers their sacred
manuscripts and scrolls

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:53.850 align:middle line:84%
from libraries throughout
Jerusalem, wrap them in linen,

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:56.700 align:middle line:84%
tuck them in hundreds of
heavy clay pottery jars,

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:00.780 align:middle line:84%
and bravely climb at the nearby
rugged and sheer mountains.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.780 align:middle line:84%
They stash their scrolls,
their precious manuscripts,

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:07.650 align:middle line:84%
that told of their
interactions with the angels.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And there, those scrolls
remained until their discovery

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:15.540 align:middle line:90%
in 1947.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:19.800 align:middle line:10%
We have just explored
an incredible story

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:23.520 align:middle line:10%
of a celestial city
that is inhabited

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.860 align:middle line:10%
of benevolent beings coming
to Earth to assist humanity

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.040 align:middle line:10%
in our transformation
into a celestial race,

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.790 align:middle line:10%
to bring us back onto the
main timeline, if you will,

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:38.920 align:middle line:10%
back into the real world.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.620 align:middle line:84%
And as the Essene
describe, they were

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.270 align:middle line:84%
met by what they called
the children of darkness,

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:47.460 align:middle line:84%
a force on this planet
that does not want to see

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.820 align:middle line:90%
us ascend into the heavens.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:54.300 align:middle line:84%
But the possibility is
there for you and me

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:59.700 align:middle line:84%
to become one of these just, or
righteous, humans made perfect,

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:04.320 align:middle line:84%
made more whole, more
holy, more compassionate.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.680 align:middle line:84%
We can only imagine
that today could

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:11.100 align:middle line:84%
be the time that the Essenes
were describing when they said

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.130 align:middle line:84%
and knew that their
mission, while it began

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:17.260 align:middle line:84%
at the time of Jesus,
would see its fulfillment

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.980 align:middle line:90%
in a later time.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.830 align:middle line:84%
As their scrolls were
revealed in 1947,

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:25.590 align:middle line:84%
and we're just now the
second and third generation

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:30.060 align:middle line:84%
to be able to have access to
these scrolls, seems to me

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:35.730 align:middle line:84%
that they have sent out a call
to us to answer this call,

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:39.630 align:middle line:84%
to transform our world, to lift
the vibration of our planet,

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:42.750 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond the veil of
our ordinary consciousness

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.480 align:middle line:84%
and begin to interact
with and perhaps even

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.800 align:middle line:84%
live with this advanced race
of celestial beings, the angels

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.690 align:middle line:84%
that the Essenes had
called in long ago.

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:59.403 align:middle line:90%
