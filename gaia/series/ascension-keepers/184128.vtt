00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.855 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm William Henry, and
this is "Ascension Keepers."

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.930 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.210 align:middle line:10%
About 200 to 300 years
before the Christian era,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.810 align:middle line:10%
a remarkable mystical
movement arose.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.260 align:middle line:84%
The core ideas of this movement
came from Alexandria, Egypt.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.800 align:middle line:84%
But it spread to Palestine,
where these mystics set up

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:90%
shop, so to speak.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.470 align:middle line:84%
In Egypt, these
mystics were called

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.080 align:middle line:90%
the Therapeutae, the healers.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.110 align:middle line:84%
They were known for their
flowing white robes.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.320 align:middle line:84%
They established an embassy
outside the walls of Alexandria

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:84%
on the shores of Lake
Mareotis near Alexandria.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.730 align:middle line:84%
In Palestine, they were
called Essenes and Nazarites

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.650 align:middle line:84%
or Nazarenes, meaning watchers,
because they were watching

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.620 align:middle line:84%
for a high celestial
being they believed

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.320 align:middle line:90%
was soon to visit Earth.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.950 align:middle line:84%
Although they were primarily,
but not exclusively Jewish,

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.970 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes were master weavers
of Egyptian, Iranian, Greek,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.880 align:middle line:90%
and Tibetan ascension practices.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, for three centuries,
beginning in 300 BC,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.250 align:middle line:84%
the forerunners of
this mystic tribe

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.190 align:middle line:84%
had been following
the way of the Magi,

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:84%
researching and merging
Babylonian, Egyptian, Iranian,

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.790 align:middle line:84%
Pythagorean, and Buddhist
alchemical philosophies

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and ascension practices
that feature humans opening

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.190 align:middle line:84%
holes in space and
ascending into heaven.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.170 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion,
they would heavily

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.370 align:middle line:84%
influenced the Essenes
and early Christianity.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.560 align:middle line:10%
From these teachings,
they began writing

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.160 align:middle line:10%
about translating
humans into angels,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:10%
opening gateways to
heaven, and the emergence

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.550 align:middle line:10%
of a new improved
child of light who

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.980 align:middle line:10%
would win a war over
the sons of darkness

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.530 align:middle line:10%
and inaugurate a
new era of light.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.680 align:middle line:90%


00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Calling themselves the perfect
ones, or the way of perfection,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.830 align:middle line:84%
or perfect light
humans, they seek

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.440 align:middle line:84%
to lead a revolution
in human evolution

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.910 align:middle line:84%
that would result
in the appearance

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.140 align:middle line:84%
of a new type of human, and
a different human experience

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.030 align:middle line:90%
in our world.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.480 align:middle line:84%
We will use this word, perfect,
as a sort of a golden needle

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.500 align:middle line:84%
to weave a thread through
various ascension traditions.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.890 align:middle line:84%
The word perfect means to become
more whole, more holy, more

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.730 align:middle line:90%
complete and cosmic.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.680 align:middle line:84%
According to mystical
Jewish tradition,

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.590 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Eve as archetypes
of the human race

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.770 align:middle line:84%
wore celestial garments of
light, which was actually

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.890 align:middle line:84%
a luminescent body that glows or
radiates light, like a rainbow.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.400 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes believed our
purpose and goal in life

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.330 align:middle line:84%
was to return to our
original divine state

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.850 align:middle line:84%
and recover our
garments of light.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Remembering our
light bodies would

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.150 align:middle line:84%
lead to a transformed
world, they believed.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.700 align:middle line:84%
Early sources say the
Essenes lived on Mount Carmel

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.560 align:middle line:84%
in northern Israel,
but they also

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.830 align:middle line:84%
operated a
hermetically-sealed compound

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.910 align:middle line:90%
at Qumran and elsewhere.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.550 align:middle line:10%
Calling themselves
the children of light,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.910 align:middle line:10%
the Essenes literally saw
themselves in a cosmic war

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.590 align:middle line:10%
against the children
of darkness,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.490 align:middle line:10%
who they believe were
incarnated as the Roman Empire.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.080 align:middle line:84%
They claimed they
were making the way

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.870 align:middle line:84%
for the arrival of a
high celestial being who

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.710 align:middle line:84%
would lead a revolution
in human evolution,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.920 align:middle line:84%
transforming Earth and
humanity into a golden planet

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.960 align:middle line:84%
of righteousness,
and the human race

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
and to its most
perfect state of being.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.270 align:middle line:84%
Many believe Jesus was
this celestial being.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Even more incredible
is the Essenes claim

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.140 align:middle line:84%
that they were living, living
with an advanced race of angels

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.180 align:middle line:90%
or extraterrestrials.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.940 align:middle line:84%
These angels, who
took human form,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.680 align:middle line:90%
were known as the watchers.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.790 align:middle line:10%
They were teaching the
Essenes the art of ascension,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.149 align:middle line:10%
or how to transform our earthly
flesh into a celestial flesh

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:22.730 align:middle line:10%
and ascend to a celestial
city they referred to

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.300 align:middle line:10%
as Zion, or the new Jerusalem.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.052 align:middle line:84%
Out to stop all this
mystical nonsense

00:04:28.052 --> 00:04:30.260 align:middle line:84%
are the children of darkness,
who the Essenes believe

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.590 align:middle line:84%
are incarnate in the mighty
Roman Empire, the reigning

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.700 align:middle line:90%
cabal on Earth.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.100 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.310 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, the accounts
of the Essenes' interactions

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.200 align:middle line:84%
with the celestials
are contained

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.060 align:middle line:84%
in the Dead Sea Scrolls,
the texts they left behind.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.340 align:middle line:10%
These extraordinary
texts affirm there

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.480 align:middle line:10%
was something truly unusual
and mystically special

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.980 align:middle line:10%
about the Essenes.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.560 align:middle line:84%
They are quintessentially
spiritual,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.570 align:middle line:84%
oriented towards
the celestial realms

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.060 align:middle line:84%
and its otherworldly
inhabitants.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.250 align:middle line:84%
Their goal was an alliance
with the upper world.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.810 align:middle line:10%
The scrolls describe cosmic
battles, beings, portals,

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.560 align:middle line:10%
hidden agendas, and
new super humans.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And cloaked behind it all is
the celestial city, the home

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and mother church of
their angelic teachers,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.190 align:middle line:84%
and the target of
their ascension

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.620 align:middle line:90%
and how humans can ascend there.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.608 align:middle line:90%


00:05:31.608 --> 00:05:35.270 align:middle line:84%
The dark side won a
major victory in AD 68,

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
when the Romans
decimated the Essenes

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.000 align:middle line:84%
in an early example
of ethnic cleansing

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.570 align:middle line:90%
or spiritual genocide.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.160 align:middle line:84%
With the destruction
of the Essenes

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.340 align:middle line:84%
and the murder of almost
a million of these souls,

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.010 align:middle line:84%
their ascension
teachings were lost,

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:84%
stashed in caves near Qumran,
but they were not forgotten.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.700 align:middle line:84%
Mystical luminaries sought
their teachings for ages.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.870 align:middle line:84%
Believing in reincarnation,
it's possible the Essenes knew

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.750 align:middle line:84%
that their disappearance
at the hands of the Romans

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.000 align:middle line:84%
was a temporary
state of affairs.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.520 align:middle line:90%
They would return.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.620 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes cache
of scrolls, in fact,

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:19.810 align:middle line:84%
was rediscovered
by chance in 1947.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.710 align:middle line:84%
In my view, these texts
describe the process

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.610 align:middle line:84%
by which all the Therapeutae or
members of the Essene community

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.050 align:middle line:84%
entered or ascended
into the angelic life.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.950 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes sought this bodily
and spiritual perfection

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.130 align:middle line:84%
in order to cross over
a veil or a boundary

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:41.320 align:middle line:84%
then and commune
with these beings

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.320 align:middle line:84%
and to stand united with
the angels before God

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.440 align:middle line:84%
and to live in a state of
perfect light for all eternity.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.980 align:middle line:84%
One scroll speaks directly
of this transformation.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:56.280 align:middle line:84%
"And thou hast cleansed the
perverse spirit from many sins

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.830 align:middle line:84%
that he might enter
into the station

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:84%
with the army of the saints
and enter into communion

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.530 align:middle line:90%
with the sons of heaven.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.380 align:middle line:84%
And thou hast cast an
everlasting destiny for man

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.750 align:middle line:84%
in the company of the
spirits of knowledge

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.530 align:middle line:84%
that he might praise thy name in
concord and recount thy marvels

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.860 align:middle line:90%
before thy works."

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.310 align:middle line:10%
In my view, the word sin simply
means to miss the marker,

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.010 align:middle line:10%
to fall short of perfection.

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.110 align:middle line:84%
It basically means
to be embodied

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.920 align:middle line:84%
in fallen and imperfect
human flesh, as opposed

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.640 align:middle line:84%
to our original and perfect
glorious light bodies

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.950 align:middle line:90%
of celestial flesh.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.920 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of cleansing
or perfecting the spirit

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.550 align:middle line:84%
and overcoming sin is so that
one may better serve God,

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.140 align:middle line:84%
but ultimately, it enables one
to enter the heavenly realms

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and live in communion
with the sons of heaven

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.433 align:middle line:84%
as perfect light beings
in the celestial city,

00:07:51.433 --> 00:07:52.475 align:middle line:90%
according to the Essenes.

00:07:52.475 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:90%


00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.710 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes have an aura of
profound mystery about them.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Writing in the first century
AD, the Roman writer Pliny

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.860 align:middle line:84%
mysteriously claimed that
they had existed for thousands

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.320 align:middle line:84%
of ages, hinting
that they are part

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:14.170 align:middle line:84%
of a forgotten eternal race that
he says exists outside of time.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:16.180 align:middle line:84%
This may be the
race later referred

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.240 align:middle line:84%
to as the immovable race
of perfect light humans,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.570 align:middle line:84%
or simply as the race in
the secret Book of John,

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.780 align:middle line:84%
a Gnostic text of
secret teachings.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.215 align:middle line:84%
Becoming perfect light
humans was clearly

00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:30.215 align:middle line:90%
the goal of the Essenes.

00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:32.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.020 align:middle line:84%
Philo, the famous first
century AD Jewish philosopher

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.080 align:middle line:84%
living in Alexandria, Egypt,
also briefly discussed

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.330 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes in his
works, "Every Good Man

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.450 align:middle line:90%
is Free" and "Hypothetica."

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.630 align:middle line:84%
Intriguingly, he
traced their origins

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.500 align:middle line:84%
to the time of Moses, the
Hebrew messiah or Magi

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.590 align:middle line:84%
who emerged as a radiant
being after a meeting

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.250 align:middle line:84%
with God and a burning bush
to lead his people to freedom,

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.710 align:middle line:84%
and who supervised the
construction or assembly

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.990 align:middle line:90%
of the Ark of the Covenant.

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.240 align:middle line:84%
The burning man or
angel he encountered

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.600 align:middle line:84%
was described as
luminous, humanoid,

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
and with a rainbow aura,
one of many such beings

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.680 align:middle line:84%
we will encounter
in our journey.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.470 align:middle line:90%


00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:18.520 align:middle line:10%
Says Philo, multitudes
of his disciples

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.310 align:middle line:10%
has the law-giver trained
for the life and fellowship.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:25.620 align:middle line:84%
These people are
called Essenes, a name

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.700 align:middle line:84%
awarded them doubtless in
recognition of their holiness.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.280 align:middle line:84%
And we have to
remember, holiness

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.570 align:middle line:84%
means to be luminous,
radiant, and angelic.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.360 align:middle line:84%
Others trace the Essenes
origins to Enoch,

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:41.330 align:middle line:84%
the incredible pre-flood
sage, the first human

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.220 align:middle line:90%
translated to heaven.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.650 align:middle line:10%
During his ascension,
the archangel Michael

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.290 align:middle line:10%
anointed Enoch's
body with an oil

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:51.770 align:middle line:10%
that dissolved his body into
rainbow-colored light that

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.320 align:middle line:10%
matched that of the angels.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.600 align:middle line:84%
Take note of the rainbow
angel connection.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.030 align:middle line:84%
It will recur
repeatedly, and is a key

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.640 align:middle line:84%
to understanding the
Essenes and their quest

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.710 align:middle line:90%
to become perfect light humans.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:09.670 align:middle line:84%
These statements make it clear
that the Essenes were ancient,

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:12.640 align:middle line:84%
they knew mystical
secrets, and these secrets

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.720 align:middle line:84%
had to do with
human transformation

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.190 align:middle line:84%
into celestial
beings and ascension.

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.170 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of the
Qumran community

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:26.950 align:middle line:84%
is precisely described in
the Call of Isaiah chapter

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.940 align:middle line:84%
40, verse 3, to prepare
the way for the Messiah

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.060 align:middle line:84%
in the desert
wilderness, to prepare

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:36.370 align:middle line:90%
a people to meet the Lord.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:39.760 align:middle line:84%
Simply, the Essenes
believed a high celestial

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.480 align:middle line:84%
being was on its way to
Earth, and they had a plan

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.560 align:middle line:90%
to manifest this event.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.320 align:middle line:84%
During this visitation,
says The Community Rule,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.860 align:middle line:84%
the high heavenly being would
reveal the mysteries of eternal

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:57.400 align:middle line:90%
being concealed from humankind.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:01.300 align:middle line:84%
At that time, the righteous
will be rewarded with healing,

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.180 align:middle line:84%
great peace, and a long life,
and fruitfulness together

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.020 align:middle line:84%
with every everlasting
blessing and eternal joy

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.200 align:middle line:84%
and life without
end, a crown of glory

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.990 align:middle line:84%
and a garment of majesty
and unending light,

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.580 align:middle line:90%
says The Community Rule.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.600 align:middle line:84%
The goal of the
Essene initiates was

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.960 align:middle line:84%
to attain this
crown and garment.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
And actually, they said it's the
goal of all humans in all ages.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.450 align:middle line:84%
The Community Rule
affirms the Essenes

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:35.350 align:middle line:84%
were a most holy community
who walk in perfection.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:37.030 align:middle line:84%
Their writings contain
their teachings

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.490 align:middle line:84%
about the perfection
of this garment

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.400 align:middle line:90%
of majesty, an unending light.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:84%
Actually, an angelic
light body composed

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:50.090 align:middle line:84%
of celestial flesh as opposed
to earthly or human flesh.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:53.500 align:middle line:10%
This is the state of being
of the perfect light humans

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:10%
mentioned earlier.

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:59.360 align:middle line:10%
In Essene philosophy,
the word perfection

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.070 align:middle line:10%
relates to wholeness, holiness,
compassion, and completion

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:08.270 align:middle line:10%
in preparation for ascension
to a celestial city they

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.400 align:middle line:10%
called the new Jerusalem.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.580 align:middle line:84%
Perfection is synonymous
with angelification

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.270 align:middle line:84%
or angelimorphism, as the
academics refer to it.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:22.430 align:middle line:84%
This is human transformation
into an angel.

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:25.490 align:middle line:84%
My research reveals that to
link the Essenes' understanding

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:27.680 align:middle line:84%
of perfection with
the Tibetan Buddhist

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.810 align:middle line:84%
concept of the great perfection,
or human transformation

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.930 align:middle line:90%
into the rainbow light body.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.780 align:middle line:84%
Tibetan sacred art portrays
this transformation

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:43.310 align:middle line:84%
as a flowing, vibrating,
pulsating robe of rainbow light

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.890 align:middle line:90%
enlightened with gold.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.700 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, this is
the same as the glory body

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.970 align:middle line:84%
or resurrection body of
Jesus, the high celestial

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:56.390 align:middle line:84%
being the Essenes
were calling in.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.840 align:middle line:84%
What I noticed is that the
symbols of the rainbow body

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.790 align:middle line:84%
gurus, including Padmasambhava,
include his crown of glory.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:08.450 align:middle line:84%
The resurrection stick and
radiating rainbow light

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.340 align:middle line:84%
are the same symbols as those
of the Israelite high priest.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.890 align:middle line:10%
And as we will see, it
links these two traditions

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.230 align:middle line:10%
and tells us there is an
esoteric meaning to the Essene

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.030 align:middle line:10%
teachings.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:24.010 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.850 align:middle line:84%
Ascension to the
Essenes is a process

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.100 align:middle line:84%
by which righteous
humans are taken

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.010 align:middle line:84%
to heaven and exist
in the presence of God

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:37.340 align:middle line:90%
and wear the robe of light.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.010 align:middle line:84%
Properly attired, they
were now ready to come

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.690 align:middle line:90%
into the presence of God.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:47.240 align:middle line:10%
And this is what the
Essenes termed resurrection.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Some maintain that
this resurrected

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.240 align:middle line:84%
state of being only
lasted a brief moment.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.730 align:middle line:84%
They suggest these
initiates and adepts would

00:13:55.730 --> 00:14:00.020 align:middle line:84%
enter into an otherworldly place
and experience a brief trial

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.430 align:middle line:84%
run encounter with
the higher realms,

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.630 align:middle line:84%
and then would come right
back into their physical body.

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:08.990 align:middle line:84%
Others maintained that the
resurrection or ascension

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:11.180 align:middle line:84%
and their transformation
into an angel

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.070 align:middle line:90%
was a permanent experience.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:16.440 align:middle line:90%


00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.740 align:middle line:84%
Before continuing,
we need to address

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.050 align:middle line:90%
a very important question.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.360 align:middle line:90%
Why were they called Essenes?

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:26.840 align:middle line:90%
Essene, what does the word mean?

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.010 align:middle line:84%
The answer takes us to the
heart of the Essenes' mission.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.650 align:middle line:84%
The most favorable
definition is the one

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:38.090 align:middle line:84%
given by Josephus, a historian
who was a one-time Essene,

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.750 align:middle line:84%
but turned into a Roman soldier
and servant of the empire.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.300 align:middle line:84%
In his "Antiquities
of the Jews,"

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:48.110 align:middle line:84%
he gave a description of the
vestments worn by the Israelite

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.610 align:middle line:90%
high priest.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:84%
Josephus explains that the outer
vestments was called the ephod.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And part of the
vestment, he says,

00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:00.020 align:middle line:84%
was the essen, a transliteration
of the Hebrew word hosen,

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.560 align:middle line:90%
meaning breastplate.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.220 align:middle line:10%
Hosen was translated into Greek
as essen, which means oracle,

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.170 align:middle line:10%
and breast piece of judgment.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:15.210 align:middle line:84%
This breast piece, he says,
is the origin of their name.

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:19.530 align:middle line:10%
Josephus's description
of the essen is alluring.

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:22.170 align:middle line:10%
It had 12 different
colored stones, each

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.560 align:middle line:10%
of them with the name of one
of the 12 tribes of Jacob,

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.990 align:middle line:10%
who famously ascended
on the ladder of heaven

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.330 align:middle line:10%
in the Book of Genesis
and returned to Earth

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:34.320 align:middle line:10%
to found the nation of Israel.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.120 align:middle line:10%
These stones were arranged
three to a row in four rows,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.810 align:middle line:10%
and when the sunlight
hit these stones,

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:45.270 align:middle line:10%
a high priest would have
radiated rainbow light.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:49.680 align:middle line:10%
The essen also contains an
additional two stones referred

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.960 align:middle line:10%
to as the Urim
and Thummim, which

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:58.110 align:middle line:10%
means revelation or truth, as
well as lights and perfections.

00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Later interpreters derived the
word from the root word light

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.935 align:middle line:84%
and related it to the root
be complete, finished, whole,

00:16:05.935 --> 00:16:06.735 align:middle line:90%
or perfect.

00:16:06.735 --> 00:16:10.100 align:middle line:90%


00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.110 align:middle line:10%
The essen is
therefore a key part

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.700 align:middle line:10%
of the garments the
high priest would

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:17.930 align:middle line:10%
don before crossing the veil
and entering the holy of holies

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:20.210 align:middle line:10%
of Solomon's temple.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.960 align:middle line:84%
This cube-shaped room whose
walls were lined with gold

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.140 align:middle line:84%
was a place where
extraordinary things occurred.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:32.010 align:middle line:84%
Mortals entered into this
golden cube as humans,

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.400 align:middle line:84%
stood on the footstool,
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.940 align:middle line:84%
ascended to a place of
illumination via this throne,

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:42.645 align:middle line:84%
were transformed into angels,
and returned from heaven alive.

00:16:42.645 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.640 align:middle line:10%
Scholars, led by
Dr. Margaret Barker,

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.520 align:middle line:10%
debate whether or
not this ascension

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:55.690 align:middle line:10%
was a literal experience
or simply metaphorical.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.020 align:middle line:84%
The garments worn by the
high priest were real,

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.750 align:middle line:84%
but the experience of
transformation into light

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:04.359 align:middle line:90%
was imagined, some believe.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:06.849 align:middle line:84%
I'm of the view that
the ascension was

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:10.030 align:middle line:84%
a literal transformation
of human flesh

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.280 align:middle line:84%
into celestial flesh, and that
the garments of the high priest

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.710 align:middle line:84%
were metaphorical,
symbolic, or imagined.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.869 align:middle line:84%
My research reveals
that the components

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:23.770 align:middle line:84%
of this garment, the crown,
the breastplate, the belt,

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:27.910 align:middle line:84%
and sandals are psychospiritual
attributes activated

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:30.910 align:middle line:84%
in the consciousness of the
high priests in preparation

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.810 align:middle line:84%
for their ascension
to higher realms.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.990 align:middle line:84%
Here, we see the high priest
Zechariah receiving word

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.140 align:middle line:84%
from the archangel Gabriel
that his aged wife will soon

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:42.720 align:middle line:84%
have a son, John
the Baptist, who

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.540 align:middle line:84%
many revere as the great
Essene master initiator.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:50.520 align:middle line:84%
In his "Antiquities
of the Jews,"

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Josephus hints at these
assumptions about ascension

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:58.050 align:middle line:84%
and the Urim and Thummim when
he says that on the essen, also

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.710 align:middle line:84%
there are stones, 12 in
number, of extraordinary size

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:84%
and beauty, an ornament
not procurable by man

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.720 align:middle line:84%
by reason of its
surpassing value.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.760 align:middle line:90%
Listen to that line again.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.020 align:middle line:84%
Not procurable by man by
reason of its surpassing value?

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:84%
If a human cannot
picture it, who can?

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:24.930 align:middle line:84%
How about God and the
angels, or humans who

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.650 align:middle line:84%
are more than human, but in
between God and the angels?

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:31.020 align:middle line:90%
That's the Essenes.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:32.620 align:middle line:84%
The breastplate
of righteousness,

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.740 align:middle line:84%
the essen and the Urim
and Thummim stones,

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:36.820 align:middle line:90%
did not operate on their own.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:10%
They were part of a kit of
tools, devices, or apps,

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:43.230 align:middle line:10%
if you will, of the high priest
that are further identified

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.830 align:middle line:10%
by the apostle, Paul, in his
letters to the Ephesians,

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:51.360 align:middle line:10%
written while he was in
prison in Rome in AD 62.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:54.930 align:middle line:84%
In the letter, Paul gives
advice on living a holy, pure,

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.860 align:middle line:90%
and Christ-inspired life.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.070 align:middle line:84%
In chapter 4, he
tells how to put

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:03.810 align:middle line:84%
on the new self, created to be
like God in true righteousness

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.790 align:middle line:90%
and holiness.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.370 align:middle line:84%
Therefore he says, each of
you must put off falsehood

00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:10.320 align:middle line:84%
and speak truthfully
to your neighbor,

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:84%
for we are all
members of one body.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.100 align:middle line:84%
In your anger, do
not sin, he said.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:18.030 align:middle line:10%
Do not let the Sun go down while
you are still angry, and do not

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:19.740 align:middle line:10%
give the devil a foothold.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.200 align:middle line:84%
Anyone who has been stealing
must steal no longer,

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:25.350 align:middle line:84%
but must work doing something
useful with their hands,

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:28.410 align:middle line:84%
that they may have something
to share with those in need.

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:33.990 align:middle line:10%
Then Paul warns of a coming, or
is it an ongoing cosmic battle.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.510 align:middle line:90%


00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.390 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, this
is why Paul is clearly

00:19:39.390 --> 00:19:42.540 align:middle line:84%
telling the Ephesians to
put on the essen as a way

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.350 align:middle line:84%
to overcome the
children of darkness.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.390 align:middle line:84%
He is clearly urging us
to augment or supplement

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.850 align:middle line:84%
the human body with
spiritual tools

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:54.480 align:middle line:84%
for a battle against an
other worldly dark force,

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.890 align:middle line:90%
or in order to ascend.

00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:00.530 align:middle line:84%
I understand this armor
to be metaphorical and

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:02.030 align:middle line:90%
psychospiritual.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.770 align:middle line:90%
It comes from within.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.280 align:middle line:84%
It's something that we
externalize, embody, or exude.

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:90%


00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:84%
As Paul says, the use of
this spiritual technology

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.440 align:middle line:84%
forms a shield of faith,
a suit of cosmic armor,

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.460 align:middle line:84%
or a second skin that seals
and protects us, and also

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:23.700 align:middle line:84%
permits access to realms
off limits to humans

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:26.580 align:middle line:90%
clothed only in ordinary skin.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Scholars have discovered that
Paul's letter to the Ephesians

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.220 align:middle line:90%
reflects Essene texts.

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.710 align:middle line:84%
They now see that this
letter was written

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.550 align:middle line:90%
for readers with Essene eyes.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:41.965 align:middle line:84%
So it's important to note that
Paul is writing to multitudes

00:20:41.965 --> 00:20:42.840 align:middle line:90%
of people in Ephesus.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.490 align:middle line:90%


00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.220 align:middle line:84%
Josephus records that
many of the Essenes

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.950 align:middle line:84%
had the ability to
predict the future.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.060 align:middle line:84%
Did they do so because they all
were wearing the breastplate?

00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.140 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.800 align:middle line:84%
Once again, this suggests
that more than one person

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.160 align:middle line:84%
wore this extraordinary
ensemble simultaneously.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:09.470 align:middle line:84%
In fact, they implore the entire
tribe of Essenes to be holy.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.190 align:middle line:10%
By definition, this means
to wear the spiritual armor

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.438 align:middle line:10%
or second skin.

00:21:15.438 --> 00:21:17.980 align:middle line:84%
In order for this to work, there
must have been more than one

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.020 align:middle line:90%
of these essen brass plates.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.440 align:middle line:84%
But again, the priestly
garb would be worn by all,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:27.160 align:middle line:84%
so are we to picture multiple
members of the Essene community

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.580 align:middle line:84%
wearing the 12 stones and
other items simultaneously,

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.640 align:middle line:90%
or is there another explanation?

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Indeed, there is.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.060 align:middle line:84%
According to
Josephus, the Essenes

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.880 align:middle line:84%
were trained to tell
the future, and they

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:84%
were training to become
angels or celestial beings.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.580 align:middle line:84%
If the breastplate is something
activated from within our body

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.030 align:middle line:84%
rather than material
objects placed upon it,

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.120 align:middle line:84%
then we would presume
that training manuals must

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.340 align:middle line:84%
exist for putting
on the breastplate

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.890 align:middle line:90%
and the other spiritual tools.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.680 align:middle line:84%
In fact, numerous
Essene texts are

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.670 align:middle line:84%
devoted to teachings about
how to put on the essen,

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and how to ascend to
the celestial temple.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.470 align:middle line:84%
The two go together like a NASA
astronaut reading a training

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.620 align:middle line:84%
manual while putting on a
spacesuit in preparation

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:18.850 align:middle line:90%
for launch into space.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.820 align:middle line:90%


00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.570 align:middle line:84%
One such text is called
Self-Glorification Hymn,

00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:28.570 align:middle line:84%
and tells how a member
of the Qumran community

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.080 align:middle line:84%
ascended to heaven for the
purpose of gaining knowledge.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.770 align:middle line:84%
Took an exalted place on God's
throne in the celestial temple.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:39.250 align:middle line:90%
And came back to Earth.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.180 align:middle line:84%
In fact, as Princeton scholar
Martha Himmelfarb documents,

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.520 align:middle line:84%
boundary crossing
of this nature was

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.220 align:middle line:90%
becoming common at this time.

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.930 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes taught
that humans who

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.330 align:middle line:84%
have completed the
ascension process,

00:22:52.330 --> 00:22:55.510 align:middle line:84%
referred to as apotheosis
and angelification,

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.650 align:middle line:90%
can also sit on the throne.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.380 align:middle line:10%
Heavenly ascent was
all but eliminated

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.280 align:middle line:10%
in the Bible, which views
heaven as God's domain,

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.004 align:middle line:10%
and off-limits to humanity
without an invitation.

00:23:10.004 --> 00:23:13.640 align:middle line:90%


00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.330 align:middle line:84%
The Self-Glorification
Hymn tells us

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.840 align:middle line:84%
the hero of the story, who
scholar Morten Smith identified

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:23.640 align:middle line:84%
as the Teacher of Righteousness,
is one among many humans

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.360 align:middle line:84%
who have been reckoned
with the gods or angels.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Again, reckoned
means made equal to,

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:34.080 align:middle line:84%
therefore, there must
have been multiple copies

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.990 align:middle line:84%
of the celestial
robe, or more likely,

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:40.170 align:middle line:84%
it was a state of being
attained by they who

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:90%
knew its secrets, the Essenes.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.470 align:middle line:10%
As Peter Schafer notes
in his book, "Origins

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:49.620 align:middle line:10%
of Jewish Mysticism,"
in certain respects,

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:10%
the speaker of this
hymn represents

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.680 align:middle line:10%
the members of the Earthly
community in heaven,

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.290 align:middle line:10%
and shares with them
his elevated status

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:00.600 align:middle line:10%
during their joint worship.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.020 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the speaker
transmits the vibration

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.360 align:middle line:84%
of heaven to the
Essenes on Earth.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.160 align:middle line:84%
A key point about the
scenes is that they

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.680 align:middle line:84%
claimed attainment
of a light body

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:17.420 align:middle line:84%
was a return to our
original state of being.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.480 align:middle line:84%
Whether we realize or
acknowledge it or not,

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Western civilization,
our culture,

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:26.120 align:middle line:84%
is based on the
Judeo-Christian premise

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.630 align:middle line:84%
that the actions of Adam
and Eve, the first humans,

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:33.290 align:middle line:84%
are responsible for our
current spiritual malaise.

00:24:33.290 --> 00:24:38.130 align:middle line:10%
This was wholeheartedly
believed by the Essenes.

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:40.800 align:middle line:84%
Our timeline begins
in Eden and ends

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:43.590 align:middle line:84%
with the Book of Revelation
and the appearance of Christ,

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.100 align:middle line:84%
who leads a mass ascension
to, or reunification

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:50.310 align:middle line:84%
with, a celestial realm,
the kingdom of heaven,

00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:54.330 align:middle line:84%
that completely transforms
Earth and introduces a time

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:84%
when all live with
righteous values,

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and hence, have expanded
spiritual capabilities,

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.930 align:middle line:84%
including the ability to
manifest the light body.

00:25:03.930 --> 00:25:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Further, the Essenes believed
Adam and Eve had shining bodies

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.580 align:middle line:84%
of light, and that our
goal was to reclaim

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
these bodies and the state
of being that goes with it.

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.400 align:middle line:84%
As the Zohar, a
later Jewish text,

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:20.310 align:middle line:84%
says, when Adam
dwelt in Eden, he

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:23.280 align:middle line:84%
was clothed in a
celestial garment, which

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.530 align:middle line:84%
is the garment of
heavenly light, light

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:29.410 align:middle line:84%
of that light which was
used in the Garden of Eden.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.500 align:middle line:84%
In my view, what this
means is that when

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:38.120 align:middle line:84%
humans lived in Eden, they,
we were in a different form.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:84%
We had perfect bodies
of light, which were

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:90%
symbolized by a robe of light.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.480 align:middle line:84%
Our soul lived in a
higher realm or plain

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness of pure
light and pure love,

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.090 align:middle line:90%
at one with all that is,

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:56.770 align:middle line:84%
Then, as the Book of Genesis
says, we disobeyed God's orders

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.710 align:middle line:84%
and ate the fruit, later
identified as an apple

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.650 align:middle line:84%
by the Greeks, guarded
by the serpent.

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.160 align:middle line:84%
After this encounter, we
were evicted from Eden.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:08.560 align:middle line:84%
Yahweh placed a gate
at the east of Eden

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.420 align:middle line:84%
with a flaming
sword at its center

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.430 align:middle line:84%
and flanked it
with two cherubim.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Then the Old Testament
God did something

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.660 align:middle line:84%
that many Christians
have forgotten about,

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.460 align:middle line:90%
but which affects all.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:84%
That is, God made garments of
skins for Adam and his wife

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.000 align:middle line:90%
and clothed them.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.030 align:middle line:84%
These were not animal
skins, as some profess.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.260 align:middle line:84%
Esoteric Jewish
tradition maintains

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:34.420 align:middle line:84%
Adam and Eve's garments
of skin where human skin

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:38.320 align:middle line:84%
that covered our
original light bodies.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.190 align:middle line:10%
As a result, our souls fell
into physical manifestation,

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.770 align:middle line:10%
or the Matrix of Maya.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:48.670 align:middle line:10%
We began to experience reality
through the ego, our lower

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:49.960 align:middle line:10%
nature.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.320 align:middle line:10%
We realized we were
naked and imperfect.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.810 align:middle line:84%
Both of these terms
mean we are no longer

00:26:55.810 --> 00:27:00.190 align:middle line:84%
in our original light body or
wearing our robes of light,

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:04.910 align:middle line:84%
but rather are now
in human bodies.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Jewish tradition says that
Adam and Eve's original garment

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:10.010 align:middle line:84%
was transported to
heaven, where it is now

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.080 align:middle line:90%
in the treasury of the heavens.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.570 align:middle line:84%
The Zohar affirms
this, saying, at first,

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.000 align:middle line:84%
they had coats of light,
which procured them

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.100 align:middle line:84%
in the service of the
highest of the high,

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:23.140 align:middle line:84%
for the celestial angels used
to come to enjoy that light.

00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.560 align:middle line:84%
After their sins, they
had only coats of skin,

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.450 align:middle line:84%
good for the body,
but not for the soul.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.720 align:middle line:84%
And something we
must keep in mind

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.120 align:middle line:84%
is that the Essenes
did not invent

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.150 align:middle line:84%
the idea of the robe of
light or the light body.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:41.750 align:middle line:84%
The oldest version of stories
referring to the robe of light

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.450 align:middle line:84%
come from Mesopotamian
religion, as do some

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:46.850 align:middle line:90%
of the oldest creation tales.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.370 align:middle line:84%
A garment called the
[NON-ENGLISH] was worn

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.310 align:middle line:84%
by the [NON-ENGLISH] priest and
was known for its whiteness,

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:54.650 align:middle line:90%
light, beauty, and force.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:57.680 align:middle line:10%
It made him awesome
and radiant, giving him

00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.450 align:middle line:10%
a supernatural sheen.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:03.900 align:middle line:84%
He was charismatic,
like the gods.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.010 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes wore bright
white robes of linen

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.400 align:middle line:84%
as the symbol of the
divine presence triggered

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:15.810 align:middle line:84%
by baptism, and as a remembrance
of the Eden time robe of light.

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:19.590 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly the same
as the [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:23.610 align:middle line:84%
It is also the garb of
the celestial beings.

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:26.970 align:middle line:84%
This is why ascension
or attainment

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:31.770 align:middle line:84%
of our original light body is
symbolized by this white robe.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:35.190 align:middle line:10%
The key thing to remember
is that this light body

00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:39.030 align:middle line:10%
or its teaching or
frequency was transmittable.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.030 align:middle line:84%
For example, in the story
of Elijah's ascension,

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:45.210 align:middle line:84%
we learned that as he was being
translated into his light body

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:49.440 align:middle line:84%
form and transported to heaven
via a celestial chariot,

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:52.320 align:middle line:84%
the chariot of the
gods, he transmitted

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:56.340 align:middle line:84%
his robe of righteousness
to his priest, Elisha.

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.250 align:middle line:84%
To the Essenes,
Elijah was a person,

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.410 align:middle line:90%
but also was a state of being.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.970 align:middle line:90%


00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:07.420 align:middle line:84%
They had eight stages in the
evolution of perfect purity

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.750 align:middle line:84%
and the attainment of the
spiritual powers of Elijah,

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.170 align:middle line:84%
purity of baptism, purity
from animal desire,

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:18.430 align:middle line:84%
spiritual purity, the purity
of a meek and gentle spirit,

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:22.390 align:middle line:84%
the purity of holiness, the
purity by which the body became

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:25.450 align:middle line:84%
a temple of the Holy
Spirit, the purity which

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:29.380 align:middle line:84%
gave the power of healing the
sick and of raising the dead,

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:31.840 align:middle line:84%
and then they attained
the mystic state

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.080 align:middle line:90%
of Elias or Elijah.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.710 align:middle line:84%
On Earth, this robe or the
state of being it symbolized

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:42.820 align:middle line:84%
enabled Elijah to perform these
miracles, to heal the sick,

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.460 align:middle line:84%
and to raise the
dead, and to ascend.

00:29:45.460 --> 00:29:48.710 align:middle line:84%
His acquisition of this glorious
body and luminous garment,

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:52.240 align:middle line:84%
which was passed down from
Adam to Enoch to Elijah,

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.670 align:middle line:84%
signals his transition
from an Earthly

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:58.080 align:middle line:84%
being to a holy one
or a celestial being.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.420 align:middle line:10%
And as they say, in order to
enter the heavenly realms,

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:05.140 align:middle line:10%
we must be dressed appropriately
in the robe of light.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.740 align:middle line:90%


00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:12.240 align:middle line:84%
The Jewish people believed that
one day, Elijah would return

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.330 align:middle line:84%
and would be the
herald of the Messiah.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:20.430 align:middle line:84%
Later, Jesus identified
Elijah, reincarnated as John

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:23.640 align:middle line:84%
the Baptist, the
Essene master initiator

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.390 align:middle line:84%
whose incarnation was announced
by the archangel Gabriel

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:32.910 align:middle line:84%
to John's father, Zechariah,
a temple high priest.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:36.960 align:middle line:84%
In Christian art, John
retained the robe of light,

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.470 align:middle line:84%
possibly having it given
to him by an angel,

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:44.010 align:middle line:84%
and then transferred it
to his cousin, Jesus,

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.940 align:middle line:84%
at the baptism, who demonstrated
what I call the light body

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:52.470 align:middle line:84%
effect at his transfiguration
when he morphed into light.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.050 align:middle line:90%


00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.380 align:middle line:84%
From this investigation,
the Essenes

00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.110 align:middle line:84%
emerge as these sort of
superheroes for ascension.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:05.410 align:middle line:84%
They know that these
incredible teachings

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:08.710 align:middle line:84%
that they have received from
the angels about the light body,

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:13.700 align:middle line:84%
about our true nature, about our
true history will serve them.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.800 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately,
they have a vision.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.330 align:middle line:84%
They have a vision for a new
humanity, a humanity that

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.990 align:middle line:84%
will live on a planet whose
base frequency or vibration

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.780 align:middle line:84%
is love, light,
and righteousness.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.820 align:middle line:84%
And they know that
while they may not

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.830 align:middle line:84%
have fulfilled it
in their lifetime,

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:33.580 align:middle line:84%
that in some future
time, perhaps even today,

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:37.750 align:middle line:84%
humanity will be able to
remember its true nature

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.270 align:middle line:84%
and ascend to the
heavens with the angels.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:43.320 align:middle line:90%
