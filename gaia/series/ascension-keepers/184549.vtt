00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.420 align:middle line:90%
>> I'm William Henry.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:90%
And this is "Ascension Keepers."

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.100 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.580 align:middle line:10%
After the genocide of
the Essenes in 68 AD,

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.880 align:middle line:10%
the 1st to 4th centuries
AD saw the Essene ascension

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.940 align:middle line:10%
teachings go underground
and reform as gnostic.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.490 align:middle line:10%
This religion was so
named because it depended

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.390 align:middle line:10%
upon personal, spiritual
revelation, the gnosis

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.480 align:middle line:10%
or knowledge of God.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:84%
Gnosis simply means knowledge,
especially of divine mysteries,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.270 align:middle line:84%
pointing to the mystical
desire of the gnostics

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.470 align:middle line:84%
to expand their consciousness
beyond ordinary perception

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.800 align:middle line:90%
and to see beyond the veil.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
This enables access
to the divine realm.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.350 align:middle line:10%
And according to some
scholars, the mystical path

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.260 align:middle line:10%
by which the gnostics
attained illumination

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.720 align:middle line:10%
is mapped and teachable.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.320 align:middle line:10%
This means anyone can follow
this path, whereas in the past,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.550 align:middle line:10%
ascending to God's throne and
seeing his face was prohibited.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.460 align:middle line:84%
And in my humble opinion,
thanks to the Essenes,

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.400 align:middle line:90%
now a shift had happened.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.220 align:middle line:84%
The gnostics, practicing
what they called Hekhalot

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.740 align:middle line:84%
and Merkabah
teachings, now began

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.290 align:middle line:84%
to emphasize the practice
of ascension and seeing God.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:84%
Through the choices one
makes in their life,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.110 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual practices,
mystical techniques,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.630 align:middle line:84%
personal deeds, and
inner awareness,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.800 align:middle line:84%
one can initiate an encounter
with an angel and journey

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.300 align:middle line:90%
to heaven.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.660 align:middle line:84%
We can get on our boat and
voyage out of this world

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.910 align:middle line:84%
to the Merkabah, the chamber
of God, the heaven of heavens,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.710 align:middle line:90%
said the gnostics.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.340 align:middle line:90%


00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
In preparation for
this ascension,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.340 align:middle line:84%
the gnostics embarked on a
process of self-purification,

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.490 align:middle line:84%
aimed at perfecting oneself
and gaining the higher

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.420 align:middle line:84%
spiritual vibrations of
purity, holiness, wholeness,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.760 align:middle line:90%
and righteousness.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.410 align:middle line:84%
Practices like yoga, fast,
diets, cleansing rituals,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.760 align:middle line:84%
singing songs, chanting of
hymns, prayers, incantations,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.450 align:middle line:84%
and repeating the divine
name, active visualization,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.770 align:middle line:84%
meditation, were all used
to expand the perception

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.670 align:middle line:90%
of the gnostic adept.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.860 align:middle line:84%
The effect of these
practices included

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.710 align:middle line:84%
ecstatic trance, a
sense of the soul,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.280 align:middle line:84%
deep meditation, dream
vision, hallucination,

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.430 align:middle line:84%
crossing into other
dimensions, and ultimately,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.810 align:middle line:84%
the dissolution of
the human into light.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.300 align:middle line:10%
All of the gnostic
spiritual practices

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.550 align:middle line:10%
were aimed at
preparing the mystic

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.720 align:middle line:10%
to enter the celestial chamber
of God, or the Merkabah throne,

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.990 align:middle line:10%
in an encounter
with the Mighty One.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.210 align:middle line:10%
After passing through
seven heavens,

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.870 align:middle line:10%
the mystic must penetrate
the seven resplendent palaces

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.080 align:middle line:10%
of the seventh heaven
itself before arriving

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.540 align:middle line:10%
at the throne of
glory, said Ezekiel.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.270 align:middle line:84%
And once there, the traveler
encounters God on his throne.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.520 align:middle line:84%
The visionary was taught
to expect God to be

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.920 align:middle line:90%
wearing a garment of light.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.320 align:middle line:84%
The vision of it includes
a mystical experience

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.390 align:middle line:84%
that transforms the body of
the visionary into light.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.860 align:middle line:84%
The gnostics believed
in a divine spark

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.880 align:middle line:84%
in man, deriving from the
eternal divine realm, fallen

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.130 align:middle line:84%
into this world
of matter and fate

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.540 align:middle line:84%
and needing to be awakened
by a divine counterpart.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.230 align:middle line:84%
They upheld the serpent
of Eden as a Savior figure

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.180 align:middle line:84%
who sought to provide humanity
with key knowledge to awaken.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.120 align:middle line:84%
As may be expected, the
traditional church fathers

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.610 align:middle line:84%
saw gnosticism as an
anti-Christian heresy.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.610 align:middle line:90%


00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.990 align:middle line:10%
Simply put, however,
gnosticism is the earliest form

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.579 align:middle line:10%
of Christianity.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.850 align:middle line:84%
The primitive Christiani,
the so-called heretics

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.620 align:middle line:84%
who preceded the historic
Christians, were all gnostics.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.810 align:middle line:84%
It was Roman
Catholicism that labeled

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.400 align:middle line:84%
them heretics in an effort to
consolidate its growing power.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.940 align:middle line:10%
In 1945, the gnostic
Gospels were discovered

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.040 align:middle line:10%
in Nag Hammadi, Egypt.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.240 align:middle line:84%
These astonishing manuscripts
contained the secret teachings

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.230 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus and the
earliest Christians.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.870 align:middle line:84%
Whereas orthodox
forms of Christianity

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.110 align:middle line:84%
found their dogmas and
doctrines almost exclusively

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.540 align:middle line:84%
upon the outer
teachings Jesus gave

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.450 align:middle line:84%
during his brief earthly
life and mission,

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.330 align:middle line:84%
gnostic Christianity
focuses primarily

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.690 align:middle line:84%
upon the inner and
secret teachings Jesus

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.020 align:middle line:90%
gave after the Resurrection.

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.310 align:middle line:84%
That is, Jesus appears to the
disciples in his light body

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.750 align:middle line:90%
form after his ascension.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
And gnostics thought
of themselves

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.700 align:middle line:84%
as the true interpreters
of these secret teachings

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.590 align:middle line:90%
of Jesus.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.910 align:middle line:10%
The Nag Hammadi texts--

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:10%
again, discovered
in Egypt in 1945--

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.480 align:middle line:10%
are Coptic, meaning they are
Egyptian Christian examples

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.450 align:middle line:10%
of these texts.

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.300 align:middle line:84%
Until 1945, most of what
we know about the gnostics

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.630 align:middle line:84%
came from they who
persecuted them.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.640 align:middle line:84%
The gnostics were
condemned as heretics

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.010 align:middle line:84%
by the bishops of the
early Christian church

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.500 align:middle line:84%
because they would not
accept the canon of the New

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Testament or the apostolic
creed or the authority

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:90%
of the new church.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.930 align:middle line:84%
But now, with the discovery
of the Nag Hammadi texts,

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:03.440 align:middle line:84%
we learn who the gnostics
truly were in their own words.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.950 align:middle line:84%
Among several highly utilized
but previously unknown

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.160 align:middle line:84%
gnostic texts was
the Gospel of Thomas,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.200 align:middle line:84%
which contained 114 sayings
attributed to Jesus.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Scholars believe it was
written during the second half

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.460 align:middle line:90%
of the 1st century AD.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.880 align:middle line:84%
And it's claimed in
the Gospel of Thomas

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.220 align:middle line:84%
that the sayings contained
within this gospel

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.390 align:middle line:90%
contain the secret of salvation.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.990 align:middle line:84%
Saying one says, "Whoever
finds the interpretation

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.760 align:middle line:84%
of the sayings will
not experience death."

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.850 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Thomas
begins with the premise

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.250 align:middle line:84%
that our individual
spirits once lived

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.170 align:middle line:84%
in the awe, the spiritual
universe of divine beings.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.810 align:middle line:10%
Then, through some
primeval catastrophe,

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.990 align:middle line:10%
the fall of humanity,
some human spirits

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.160 align:middle line:10%
became imprisoned in flesh
and blood human bodies

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.200 align:middle line:10%
and became trapped in
the material world,

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.670 align:middle line:10%
unaware or blind to
their true source.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.220 align:middle line:84%
But Jesus comes
along and saves them

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.480 align:middle line:84%
by revealing to them the
truth of who they are--

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:16.620 align:middle line:84%
divine light beings who
belong to another world.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.610 align:middle line:84%
This realization frees them from
the garments of their material

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.240 align:middle line:84%
bodies and puts them
on the way to acquiring

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.320 align:middle line:90%
their robe of light.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.690 align:middle line:10%
The doctrine of
the soul's ascent

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.730 align:middle line:10%
through the heavenly spheres was
a key teaching of gnosticism.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.800 align:middle line:84%
The ascension to
Heaven was equivalent

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.260 align:middle line:90%
to a spiritual resurrection.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And in the fulfillment
of the Essene's mission,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.920 align:middle line:90%
Jesus cleared the way.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.750 align:middle line:84%
In the gnostic
ascension teachings,

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.290 align:middle line:84%
strange beings called
Archons barred the way

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.720 align:middle line:90%
to the seven heavens.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.160 align:middle line:84%
And some maintain the Archons
sought to take human souls.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.980 align:middle line:84%
But we don't worry about
them because the gnostics

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.950 align:middle line:90%
had a remedy or a fix.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:06.530 align:middle line:84%
We could perfect
ourselves and put

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.610 align:middle line:90%
on a garment of perfect light.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:13.940 align:middle line:84%
In the Gospel of Philip, a
second-century gnostic work,

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.370 align:middle line:84%
transformation through
gnosis not only

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.980 align:middle line:84%
allowed the ascent of
the soul, but it also

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.950 align:middle line:84%
made us invisible
to the Archons, who

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:25.520 align:middle line:84%
some believe are actually
extraterrestrial beings.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Phillips says that
"Not only will they

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.500 align:middle line:84%
be unable to detain
the perfect man,

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.530 align:middle line:84%
but the Archons will
not be able to see him,

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.590 align:middle line:84%
for if they see him,
they will detain him.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.830 align:middle line:84%
There is no other way for a
person to acquire this quality

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:43.490 align:middle line:84%
except by putting on the
perfect light and he,

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:47.540 align:middle line:90%
too, becoming a perfect light."

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.190 align:middle line:84%
The mysteries of exactly how
to become a perfect light being

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:84%
formed the backbone of
the Essene revelation that

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:84%
was adopted into the
gnostic religion,

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:02.881 align:middle line:84%
especially a branch of
it called Manichaeism.

00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:07.080 align:middle line:10%
Most people may have never heard
of Manichaeism or its founder,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.780 align:middle line:10%
Mani, a Babylonian
prophet who has

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.890 align:middle line:10%
been called the last gnostic.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:16.100 align:middle line:84%
However, this secret
society of gnostics

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.090 align:middle line:90%
were fundamentally Christians.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Manichaeism fused early
Christianity and gnosticism

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.790 align:middle line:84%
and spread from
Iran to Egypt, Iraq,

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.880 align:middle line:90%
and throughout the Middle East.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:84%
This Chinese painting depicts
Jesus as a Manichean prophet.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.200 align:middle line:84%
The figure can be identified
as a representation of Christ

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:84%
by the small gold cross
that sits on the red lotus

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:47.760 align:middle line:90%
pedestal in his left hand.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.090 align:middle line:84%
This Chinese painting
depicts Manichean cosmogony

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:55.220 align:middle line:84%
with the realm of
light at the top.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:58.190 align:middle line:84%
A number of Manichean
hymns are addressed

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:02.720 align:middle line:84%
not to the historical Jesus,
called Jesus the Messiah,

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.550 align:middle line:84%
but to the light messenger
Jesus, referred to as Jesus

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.210 align:middle line:84%
the Splendor, a
magnificent, shining being

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.990 align:middle line:90%
who displays the robe of light.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.050 align:middle line:84%
According to Manichaeism,
Jesus the Splendor

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.140 align:middle line:84%
is sent to awaken Adam
and Eve to the source

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.170 align:middle line:84%
of the spiritual light trapped
within their physical bodies.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And the aim of the
Manicheans was the attainment

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:34.190 align:middle line:84%
of the light body, which they
called the beaming garment.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.810 align:middle line:84%
This immaterial or
flashing light body

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:42.730 align:middle line:84%
beamed, meaning it radiated
or displayed bursts of light.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:46.330 align:middle line:84%
It came from a light garment
that once belonged to Adam,

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:90%
believed the Manicheans.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.190 align:middle line:84%
It was also
instrumental in allowing

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:55.990 align:middle line:84%
Jesus to be instantaneously
transported, or beamed,

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.150 align:middle line:84%
through the wormhole,
or stargate, linking

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:03.220 align:middle line:84%
the world of spirit
and the material world.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:06.580 align:middle line:84%
Today's imagination is filled
with militaristic views

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.850 align:middle line:84%
of stargate travel, where
transport is affected

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.250 align:middle line:90%
by advanced technology.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:16.000 align:middle line:84%
And every day we find we live
in a bigger and bigger universe.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.260 align:middle line:84%
We find more and more planets
every day in new galaxies.

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
New theories on how the universe
began come out all the time.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.100 align:middle line:84%
Theories on physics
are changing.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.730 align:middle line:84%
You have M-theory,
string theory.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.280 align:middle line:10%
Multiple dimensions are debated
and verified by scientists.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And our sun is even now thought
to be a wormhole or a gateway

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:35.740 align:middle line:90%
to heaven.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Subatomic particles have now
been measured going faster

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.020 align:middle line:84%
than light, which was
thought to be impossible,

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.410 align:middle line:84%
opening the way for time travel,
or faster-than-light travel.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.110 align:middle line:84%
In this modern
context, the revelation

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.720 align:middle line:84%
of the existence
of a secret race

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:84%
or tribe of
transformed humans that

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.690 align:middle line:84%
have followed the way of life,
the Essene way of perfection,

00:11:56.690 --> 00:12:00.890 align:middle line:84%
and achieved the beaming
garment should not surprise us,

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.420 align:middle line:84%
nor should we be
surprised at how

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:05.540 align:middle line:90%
advanced these beings could be.

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.540 align:middle line:84%
A study by Eric Davis for
the US Air Force Research

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.990 align:middle line:84%
Laboratory of speculative
teleportation technologies

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:16.190 align:middle line:84%
showed that, to dematerialize
a human body by heating it up

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.530 align:middle line:84%
to a million times the
temperature of the core

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:23.090 align:middle line:84%
of the sun so that the
quarks lose their binding

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:26.750 align:middle line:84%
and become massless and can be
beamed at the speed of light

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:84%
in the closest physics
equivalent to the Star Trek

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:31.940 align:middle line:84%
teleportation or
beaming scenario,

00:12:31.940 --> 00:12:37.010 align:middle line:84%
would require the equivalent
of 330 megatons of energy.

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.560 align:middle line:84%
And he says that to meet
the information storage

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and transmission
requirements would

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.180 align:middle line:84%
require concurrent
computing capabilities

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.560 align:middle line:84%
to continue to improve by
a factor of 10 to 100 times

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.400 align:middle line:90%
per decade for 200 to 300 years.

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.930 align:middle line:84%
This gives us an idea
of just how advanced

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:01.820 align:middle line:84%
were the ancient perfect avatars
who put on the beaming garment

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.780 align:middle line:84%
and beamed through the wormhole
through spiritual rather

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.250 align:middle line:90%
than technological means.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.820 align:middle line:84%
The gnostics believed
that they who

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.360 align:middle line:84%
wear the light body, the light
body garment, the beaming

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.440 align:middle line:84%
garment, constitute a separate
race of advanced humanity

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.070 align:middle line:84%
composed of awakened
and enlightened souls

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.590 align:middle line:84%
from many time periods and
geographical locations,

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:30.165 align:middle line:84%
including our own, and one
can only hope, including us.

00:13:30.165 --> 00:13:33.060 align:middle line:90%


00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's continue
exploring the life of Mani,

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.490 align:middle line:84%
as there is much
to learn about him.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:45.190 align:middle line:84%
Mani was born in
Persia in April 216 AD.

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.620 align:middle line:10%
In this depiction of
him here, we clearly

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:51.910 align:middle line:10%
see that he is believed to have
manifested the rainbow light

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.240 align:middle line:10%
body.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.430 align:middle line:84%
Mani's father joined
the Elkesaites

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:01.200 align:middle line:84%
a white-robed Gnostic sect
that appeared around 100 AD

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.840 align:middle line:90%
in Syria.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.700 align:middle line:84%
The Elkesaites were
founded by Christians

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:10.020 align:middle line:84%
who believed their baptisms
connected them with Elkhasai,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.960 align:middle line:84%
meaning the hidden
power of God that

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.720 align:middle line:90%
originated with the Essenes.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.460 align:middle line:84%
The Elkesaites
may have also been

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:23.910 align:middle line:84%
called Katharoi, which literally
means the pure ones in Greek.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.480 align:middle line:84%
This may be the
earliest use of the word

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.820 align:middle line:84%
Cathar, the mysterious
French Gnostic group

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.730 align:middle line:90%
we will discuss later.

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:37.870 align:middle line:84%
And as we will see, they
too were followers of Mani.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:41.050 align:middle line:10%
At the age of 24, Mani
traveled to India,

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.230 align:middle line:10%
following in the footsteps
of the apostle Thomas,

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:46.480 align:middle line:10%
one of the Twelve Apostles,
and for whom we just

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.570 align:middle line:10%
discussed his Gospel of Thomas.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.690 align:middle line:84%
He was most certainly familiar
with the story of Thomas,

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.360 align:middle line:84%
also told in the
Gospel of John, most

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.600 align:middle line:84%
famous in the passage
of John 20 through 24

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.750 align:middle line:84%
through 29, where
the Saint doubts

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:05.860 align:middle line:84%
the Resurrection of Christ,
saying, unless I see the nail

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:09.430 align:middle line:84%
marks in his hands and put my
finger where the nails were

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:13.480 align:middle line:84%
and put my hand into his
side, I will not believe in.

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:15.970 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is in his light
body form, and Thomas

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.480 align:middle line:84%
has to experience it himself
in order to believe this.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.600 align:middle line:84%
So then Jesus comes
to Thomas a week later

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.530 align:middle line:84%
and invites Thomas
to do just that.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.280 align:middle line:84%
After Thomas incredulously
poked the Lord's wounds,

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:35.440 align:middle line:84%
he believed in the Resurrection
and the light body.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.470 align:middle line:84%
Thomas also missed the
ascension or assumption

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.210 align:middle line:90%
of the Virgin Mary.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.690 align:middle line:84%
But she appeared to him as an
apparition, as a light being,

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.840 align:middle line:84%
and transmitted to him
her holy robe or girdle.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Mani surely must
have contemplated

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.610 align:middle line:84%
the ascension mysteries
enfolded within these stories.

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.330 align:middle line:84%
And after his time in
India, Mani settled in Iran

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:03.280 align:middle line:84%
and began assembling
a community of adepts.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.890 align:middle line:10%
As I said the, gnostics
were called heretics

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:10%
because they did not
subscribe to the church's

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.350 align:middle line:10%
historical version
of the earthly life

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:middle line:10%
and death of Jesus.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.850 align:middle line:84%
The gnostics believed
instead that Jesus

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.850 align:middle line:84%
was an instrument of
divine power, referred

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.132 align:middle line:90%
to as the cosmic Christ.

00:16:21.132 --> 00:16:24.610 align:middle line:84%
And Mani learned from the
Elkesaites, his father's tribe,

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:29.680 align:middle line:84%
if you will, that Jesus was a
reincarnating prophet called

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.020 align:middle line:90%
the Illuminator.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Some of them saw Jesus, in
fact, as a reincarnation

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:40.450 align:middle line:84%
of Zarathrustra or Zoroaster,
the Iranian spiritual adept

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:84%
who taught self realization
somewhere between 2000 and 700

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:48.400 align:middle line:90%
BC.

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:51.580 align:middle line:84%
Zoroaster's ministry began when
he experienced a revelation

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:53.140 align:middle line:90%
at age 30.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.640 align:middle line:84%
While sitting on
the riverbank, he

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.500 align:middle line:84%
saw a shining being, who
revealed himself as Vohu Manah,

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.690 align:middle line:84%
meaning good purpose,
and taught him

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.960 align:middle line:84%
about Ahura Mazda,
the wise spirit,

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:09.520 align:middle line:84%
and five other radiant
figures called Kumaras.

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:13.089 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is very interesting,
as Kumara was also

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:18.030 align:middle line:84%
a term or title
applied to Melchizedek.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.450 align:middle line:84%
Ahura Mazda is portrayed
riding in a winged ring called

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.040 align:middle line:90%
the Faravahar.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.310 align:middle line:84%
In present-day
Zoroastrianism, the Faravahar

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.070 align:middle line:84%
is said to be a reminder
of one's purpose

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:33.120 align:middle line:84%
or mission in life, which
is to live in such a way

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.570 align:middle line:84%
that the soul progresses
towards Frashokereti,

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.300 align:middle line:84%
or perfect union
with Ahura Mazda.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.860 align:middle line:90%


00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.650 align:middle line:84%
Mani was also believed
to be the reincarnation

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:48.760 align:middle line:84%
of Lao Tzu, the Taoist master
and ascension keeper who

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.690 align:middle line:84%
lived around 500 BC, during
the time when the ascension

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:56.500 align:middle line:84%
teachings were in
full flow in Babylon.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.990 align:middle line:84%
In this life, he would
become the Buddha of Light.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.870 align:middle line:84%
It was Lao Tzu who taught the
practice of heavenly ascension.

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.830 align:middle line:84%
And Taoists believe the ability
to ascend to heaven, ideally

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:12.100 align:middle line:84%
in broad daylight, accompanied
by one's household,

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.490 align:middle line:84%
demonstrated one's achievement
of the most exalted state

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:90%
of transcendence and shen.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:24.700 align:middle line:84%
Shen is very close to
saiyon and essen, or Essene.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:28.270 align:middle line:84%
It's actually a Chinese word
for an enlightened person,

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.310 align:middle line:84%
translatable in
English as spiritually

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
immortal, transcendent,
superhuman, celestial being.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.380 align:middle line:90%
Wow.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:43.090 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, Lao Tzu is
another ascension keeper.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And we can further connect
him to the Essenes,

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:49.600 align:middle line:84%
not just by the phonetic
similarity of his title, shen

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.640 align:middle line:90%
and essen.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:10%
The oldest recorded shen
character has a rise up ascend

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.070 align:middle line:10%
phonetic, supposedly
because immortals

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.890 align:middle line:10%
could ascend into the heavens.

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.530 align:middle line:10%
According to the digital
dictionary of Buddhism,

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:10.780 align:middle line:10%
Chinese shen can also mean
Sanskrit rishi, an inspired

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.420 align:middle line:10%
sage in the Vedas.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:18.250 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the Essenes taught
the secrets of Raz, or the veil.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:84%
And as we have seen, Raz
is also rooted in rishi.

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So here is another important
tie-in between the Essenes

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.590 align:middle line:90%
and Lao Tzu.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.560 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes and Mani
would agree with Lao Tzu

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:84%
when he described the
perfect man as one who

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.370 align:middle line:84%
could ascend to the loftiest
height without fear,

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:44.620 align:middle line:84%
enter water and not get wet, or
enter fire and not get burned.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:49.090 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Taoism's perfect
man governs his inner self

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:50.980 align:middle line:90%
and embraces his destiny.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.600 align:middle line:90%


00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.300 align:middle line:84%
The wholeness and
completion, perfection,

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:58.670 align:middle line:84%
that we seek to
attain is actually

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:02.480 align:middle line:84%
a wholeness and a oneness
which we already have.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.110 align:middle line:10%
We simply need to get in touch
with that wavelength, taught

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:08.300 align:middle line:10%
the Manicheans.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.240 align:middle line:10%
The takeaway here is
that in Taoist tradition,

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.370 align:middle line:10%
Lao Tzu would reincarnate
among the non-Chinese people

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:19.490 align:middle line:10%
in order to teach
ascension and to spread

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:21.620 align:middle line:10%
universal enlightenment.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:25.850 align:middle line:84%
Mani was claimed to be the
latest incarnation of Lao

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:29.380 align:middle line:90%
Tzu, the new illuminator.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.800 align:middle line:84%
And in one of his writings,
the Book of King Shapur,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Mani tells that
the apostles of God

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:38.570 align:middle line:84%
have always been
here bringing wisdom.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.160 align:middle line:90%
Buddha was one of them.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.720 align:middle line:90%
So was Zoroaster.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.540 align:middle line:90%
So was Jesus.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:48.380 align:middle line:84%
Mani believed he was the latest
to receive the transmission

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:51.340 align:middle line:84%
and join the company of all
these ascension keepers.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.320 align:middle line:90%
So this was early Christianity.

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.130 align:middle line:84%
The Christ was a cosmic being,
the great celestial being

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:05.940 align:middle line:84%
of the Essenes, who
reincarnated at different times

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.975 align:middle line:84%
and even inhabited
the body of Jesus.

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:11.400 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.270 align:middle line:84%
But by the fourth century,
orthodox or traditional

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:20.290 align:middle line:84%
Christianity had forgotten
this or covered it up.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.010 align:middle line:10%
Mani's writings focus on
a meeting with an angel

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.740 align:middle line:10%
and a column of glory.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.910 align:middle line:84%
And every Manichean
expected to meet

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:33.460 align:middle line:84%
an angel clad in a white
robe at the moment of death.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:38.870 align:middle line:84%
The wise guide would then
take us into the afterlife.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:43.280 align:middle line:84%
Mani claimed to have met his
angel while still living.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.210 align:middle line:84%
He not only met this being,
but Mani merged with him,

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:51.560 align:middle line:84%
or became one, with
this holy entity.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Mani referred to this angel as
his light self, or his twin.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:01.820 align:middle line:84%
And from the moment he met this
twin, Mani was no longer human.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:90%
He bridged the worlds.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:08.560 align:middle line:84%
He was an apostle of
light, a perfected one.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.610 align:middle line:10%
In the Mani-Codex, Mani tells
how the angel came to him

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:15.670 align:middle line:10%
like a flash of lightning.

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:17.320 align:middle line:84%
It was sent by
the great fathers,

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:21.040 align:middle line:84%
it said, and came to reveal
great secrets and hidden things

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.490 align:middle line:84%
to Mani so that he could
reveal them to the world.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:29.810 align:middle line:84%
This is when Mani became
an ascension keeper.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:33.020 align:middle line:10%
Above all, the angel of
light sought for Mani

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:36.620 align:middle line:10%
to communicate secrets about
the greatness of humanity

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:40.100 align:middle line:10%
and our potential
for transformation.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.930 align:middle line:84%
The greatness of
man is not visible,

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.690 align:middle line:90%
he said, but lies in secret.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Because of this, he is
lord over the beasts, which

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.860 align:middle line:84%
are stronger and
greater than he,

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.610 align:middle line:84%
by the standard of the
visible and the hidden.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:55.610 align:middle line:84%
This is also written in
the Gospel of Philip.

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:57.650 align:middle line:10%
The angel of light
told Mani that we

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.800 align:middle line:10%
are lost sparks
of divinity, lost

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.150 align:middle line:10%
and wandering in an alien world.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.010 align:middle line:84%
And until we awaken
our light self,

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:10.580 align:middle line:84%
we cannot know our
true greatness.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.060 align:middle line:84%
But our true nature,
our true self,

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.690 align:middle line:84%
is a cosmic being clothed
with the elements,

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:19.610 align:middle line:90%
as with a garment.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:23.780 align:middle line:10%
It is a being of light,
and it still exists.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:28.130 align:middle line:84%
Our goal is to activate
our angelic light self

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.370 align:middle line:84%
and to be transformed
by this experience.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:35.420 align:middle line:84%
We do this by gaining
knowledge of our true nature.

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.210 align:middle line:84%
And our light self will
then take over from there.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:41.360 align:middle line:90%


00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.240 align:middle line:84%
As with many gnostic
traditions, the Manicheans

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.020 align:middle line:84%
taught that we do not seek
our angelic light self solely

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.390 align:middle line:90%
for our own benefit.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:55.910 align:middle line:84%
We seek it as a way to
heal all, to resurrect all.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.910 align:middle line:84%
Men and women were among the
elect, as they were called,

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:03.570 align:middle line:84%
who took on the task of
bringing in the light.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:05.970 align:middle line:10%
Mani implored us
to be constantly

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:08.610 align:middle line:10%
aware of our cosmic
situation, that we

00:24:08.610 --> 00:24:11.400 align:middle line:10%
are light beings from
a divine realm who

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.990 align:middle line:10%
have fallen into matter, and
that what we do in this realm

00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:20.120 align:middle line:10%
matters, because they believed
that if we make ourselves

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.580 align:middle line:10%
slaves to Earth life
and all its pleasures,

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.270 align:middle line:10%
we're sacrificing our true self.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:28.550 align:middle line:10%
For this reason, they
saw earthly things

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:34.160 align:middle line:10%
as a means to an end, rather
than the end goal itself.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.290 align:middle line:84%
Mani's ideas about
ascension show

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.380 align:middle line:84%
that he knew various works
from the gnostic tradition,

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.310 align:middle line:84%
especially the Apocryphon,
or Secret Book of John.

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:46.100 align:middle line:10%
Written around 180 AD
and found in the library

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.670 align:middle line:10%
at Nag Hammadi, Egypt,
the Secret Book of John

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:52.490 align:middle line:10%
is a collection of
secret teachings.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:55.610 align:middle line:84%
It was referred to by Irenaeus,
an early official church

00:24:55.610 --> 00:25:01.910 align:middle line:84%
father, as heretical
and was lost until 1945.

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:05.180 align:middle line:84%
It describes the resurrected
and ascended Jesus

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.870 align:middle line:84%
appearing and giving secret
knowledge, or gnosis,

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:middle line:90%
to the apostle John.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.040 align:middle line:84%
The author describes
this having occurred

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:18.050 align:middle line:84%
after Jesus "has gone back to
the place from which he came."

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:21.710 align:middle line:84%
This book is reputed to
bear this revelation.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.990 align:middle line:84%
The author John is
immediately specified

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:28.700 align:middle line:84%
as John, the brother of James,
who are the sons of Zebedee.

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.130 align:middle line:84%
Many Christians in
the second century

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:34.550 align:middle line:84%
hoped to receive a transcendent
personal revelation,

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.760 align:middle line:84%
such as Paul was able to report
to the church at Corinth,

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.880 align:middle line:84%
or that John experienced on the
Isle of Patmos, which inspired

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:90%
his Book of Revelation.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:44.840 align:middle line:84%
As the Book of
Acts narrates what

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.720 align:middle line:84%
happened after the time
Jesus ascended to heaven,

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.350 align:middle line:84%
so the Apocryphon of John
begins at the same point

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:54.620 align:middle line:84%
but relates how Christ
appeared to John.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.290 align:middle line:84%
The remainder of the book is
a vision of spiritual realms

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.760 align:middle line:84%
and of the prior history
of spiritual humanity.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.790 align:middle line:84%
This text represents the
gnostics' highest desire

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:08.190 align:middle line:90%
to encounter the beaming Jesus.

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:10.580 align:middle line:84%
And in the Apocryphon
of John narrative,

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.310 align:middle line:84%
John was at the
temple in Jerusalem

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:17.060 align:middle line:84%
when he's confronted by a
Pharisee named Arimanius.

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.840 align:middle line:84%
Like his brethren, Arimanius was
skeptical of John the Baptist

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:22.390 align:middle line:90%
and his cousin, Jesus.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:24.260 align:middle line:84%
He wants to know,
where is Jesus?

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.990 align:middle line:84%
And John tells him that
after his Resurrection,

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.280 align:middle line:90%
Jesus has returned.

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.190 align:middle line:84%
He's ascended to the
place from which he came.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:32.960 align:middle line:90%
He has ascended.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.900 align:middle line:84%
Arimanius responds by
accusing Jesus of misleading,

00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.990 align:middle line:84%
lying, and turning John and
others away from the ancestral

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.270 align:middle line:84%
Ascension, to these guys,
is heretical, remember.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:48.200 align:middle line:84%
The encounter spins John into
a whirlwind of questions.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.020 align:middle line:84%
He leaves the Temple of
Solomon and soon finds himself

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.490 align:middle line:84%
in deep contemplation
on a mountaintop.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.350 align:middle line:90%
Who was Jesus, anyway?

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:57.410 align:middle line:90%
And what was Jesus?

00:26:57.410 --> 00:26:59.930 align:middle line:84%
These questions
swirl in his mind.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.180 align:middle line:90%
Why was he here?

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.180 align:middle line:90%
And who sent him?

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.630 align:middle line:90%
And where did he go?

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:07.430 align:middle line:84%
And what did he mean by all
this talk about eternal life?

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.560 align:middle line:84%
All John learned from
Jesus is that he came

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.540 align:middle line:90%
from the imperishable realm.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.610 align:middle line:84%
While John was contemplating
these questions,

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.040 align:middle line:90%
suddenly, the heavens opened.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.650 align:middle line:84%
And the whole of creation
shone with a light from above.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.590 align:middle line:90%
And the world quaked.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:24.080 align:middle line:90%
A being appeared in the light.

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.270 align:middle line:84%
At first it looked
like a small child.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:28.310 align:middle line:84%
Then it morphed
into an older man.

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.440 align:middle line:84%
It morphed again,
becoming like a young man,

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.090 align:middle line:84%
just like in the
Revelation of the Magi.

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:38.320 align:middle line:84%
Then the being in the light
spoke to John, saying, John,

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.420 align:middle line:90%
why doubt?

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.917 align:middle line:90%
Why be afraid?

00:27:40.917 --> 00:27:42.000 align:middle line:90%
Don't you know this image?

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.840 align:middle line:90%
Be not afraid.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.910 align:middle line:90%
I am with you always.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.590 align:middle line:84%
This phrase, I am
with you always,

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.410 align:middle line:84%
is the last sentence
of Matthew 28:20,

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.950 align:middle line:84%
spoken by the risen
Jesus to the disciples.

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.380 align:middle line:84%
Then Jesus identifies himself
as the father, mother,

00:27:56.380 --> 00:28:00.000 align:middle line:84%
and the son, and also as
the incorruptible purity.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Then he tells John, "I have
come to teach you about what is

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:08.300 align:middle line:90%
and what was and what will be."

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.300 align:middle line:84%
In other words, Jesus
is going to tell him

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.960 align:middle line:84%
about the past, the
present, and the future.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.160 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus does so
in order for John

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.760 align:middle line:84%
to "understand," as Jesus
says, "the invisible world

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:23.020 align:middle line:84%
and the world that is visible
and the immovable race

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.100 align:middle line:90%
of perfect humanity."

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.970 align:middle line:84%
Next, Jesus encourages
John to lift up his face,

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:32.970 align:middle line:84%
listen, and understand
what he is saying,

00:28:32.970 --> 00:28:36.190 align:middle line:84%
and to proclaim it to
all your kindred spirits.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:40.320 align:middle line:84%
Those, says Jesus, who are
from the immovable race

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.510 align:middle line:90%
of perfect human.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Jesus then tells John
that understanding

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:48.640 align:middle line:84%
these concepts will be
difficult for those who are not

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.980 align:middle line:90%
part of this perfected race.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.400 align:middle line:84%
And Christ mysteries belong
to this race, he says.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:84%
He also tells John he
encouraged Adam and Eve to eat

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.660 align:middle line:84%
of the tree of knowledge
of good and evil.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:01.840 align:middle line:84%
Of course, the traditional
church assigns this role

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.390 align:middle line:90%
to the serpent of Eden.

00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:09.350 align:middle line:84%
As we can see, the gnostics
had a different and even more

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.480 align:middle line:84%
detailed version
of our ascension

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.520 align:middle line:90%
than the traditional church.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:17.170 align:middle line:84%
More revelations about
the gnostics are to come.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And what we have learned here
is that, after the Essene

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:24.710 align:middle line:84%
revelation, the Essene
mission continued.

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:27.200 align:middle line:84%
This is what they hinted to
us in the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.810 align:middle line:84%
that while they might
have disappeared

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.600 align:middle line:84%
from the scene
around 68 AD, they

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
were going to come
back again and again,

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:38.050 align:middle line:84%
until the revelation
was complete

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:40.640 align:middle line:90%
and the mission was complete.

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.510 align:middle line:84%
My research reveals that Mani
was very much like you and I.

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:46.040 align:middle line:90%
He was a researcher.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.900 align:middle line:84%
He got out of the
box, and he looked

00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.020 align:middle line:84%
at the Egyptian, the
Iranian, the early Christian,

00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.960 align:middle line:84%
in any tradition that he
could find that related

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.060 align:middle line:90%
to the concepts of ascension.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.060 align:middle line:10%
And he found a new way
to put it all together

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.120 align:middle line:10%
and inspired a whole generation.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.440 align:middle line:84%
The gnostics picked
up on this revelation

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.120 align:middle line:84%
and continue to run with
it, assuring humanity

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.270 align:middle line:84%
that our transformation
was underway,

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and that it was only a matter
of time before all of us

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.900 align:middle line:84%
would be able to fully embrace
these teachings and once

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.270 align:middle line:84%
and for all unite
heaven and earth.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.320 align:middle line:90%
