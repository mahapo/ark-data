00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.855 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm William Henry, and
this is "Ascension Keepers."

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.050 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.030 align:middle line:10%
The 11th through
13th centuries may

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.800 align:middle line:10%
be called the
Gnostic Renaissance

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.320 align:middle line:10%
in Europe, especially France.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.140 align:middle line:84%
They were marked by an
effervescent resurgence

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.250 align:middle line:84%
of spiritual movements of
clearly gnostic nature.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.260 align:middle line:84%
It was as if the as Essene soul
group reincarnated en masse.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.410 align:middle line:84%
Foremost among our ascension
keepers during this time

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.930 align:middle line:84%
were the Cathar mystics
who called themselves

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.680 align:middle line:84%
the Albigenses after the town
of Albi in southern France

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.420 align:middle line:90%
where they were centered.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.690 align:middle line:84%
They were also known as
the Good Christians or Bon,

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.420 align:middle line:90%
which is French for good.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.220 align:middle line:84%
Like the Essenes,
the Cathars are

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.300 align:middle line:84%
sought to return to our Edenic
state, our primordial state

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.550 align:middle line:90%
as light beings before the fall.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.790 align:middle line:84%
Their Italian name, Cathari,
is from the Greek root

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.480 align:middle line:90%
signifying the pure ones.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.160 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars were male
and female ascetics

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.880 align:middle line:84%
who claimed knowledge of how
to perfect the human body

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:84%
into a more pure or
illumined state of being

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.753 align:middle line:84%
and ascend to the Celestial
City of the Essenes.

00:01:30.753 --> 00:01:32.420 align:middle line:84%
They walked away from
the world in order

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.420 align:middle line:84%
to follow Christ and
Mary, both the mother Mary

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.140 align:middle line:84%
and the Magdalene, in their
transfiguration and ascension

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.810 align:middle line:84%
into an angelic or
spiritualized body

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.080 align:middle line:84%
and enter the heavenly
realm, a dimension inhabited

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.500 align:middle line:90%
by blessed spiritual beings.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.470 align:middle line:84%
Having traveled to their home in
the Languedoc region of France

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.800 align:middle line:84%
over a dozen times
since 1998, I can

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.680 align:middle line:84%
tell you there's a palpable
spiritual essence that

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.800 align:middle line:90%
is present in this holy land.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.110 align:middle line:84%
I find this to be true
of any sacred place

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.070 align:middle line:84%
where masses of humans have been
doing intense spiritual work.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.590 align:middle line:90%
But it's especially true here.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.770 align:middle line:84%
It's a place of rugged,
spiritual beauty,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.950 align:middle line:84%
mountainous peaks that jut
from the blanket of vineyards

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.990 align:middle line:90%
and evergreens.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.540 align:middle line:10%
And atop these
peaks, the Cathars

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.390 align:middle line:10%
built astounding castles.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.510 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, they symbolize
both the Garden of Eden

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.130 align:middle line:84%
and the Celestial
City of the Essenes.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.550 align:middle line:84%
Caribou, for example,
and Puialaurens,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.580 align:middle line:84%
these were sun chambers
of these mystics.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.920 align:middle line:90%
And I mean that literally.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.440 align:middle line:10%
The latest research
shows that Cathars

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.140 align:middle line:10%
constructed these places as
gateways or portals to heaven.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Montsegur has been
called the grail castle

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.580 align:middle line:84%
and the last refuge
of the Cathars.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.630 align:middle line:84%
According to Cathar belief,
one object of earth life

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.050 align:middle line:84%
was to make over or
perfect the human body

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.160 align:middle line:84%
as a pure and worthy vehicle
for the light of the Holy Spirit

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.950 align:middle line:90%
and the love of Christ.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.710 align:middle line:84%
Those who accomplished this
were known to the Cathars

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.460 align:middle line:84%
as the perfecti,
the perfected ones.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.560 align:middle line:10%
Following in the
footsteps of the Essenes,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.080 align:middle line:10%
who called themselves the
men of perfect holiness

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.600 align:middle line:10%
who were trying to build
a house of perfection,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.490 align:middle line:10%
both in their body and
in their community,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.590 align:middle line:10%
the Cathars can be thought of
as reincarnations of the Essenes

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.630 align:middle line:10%
in more than just their beliefs
and spiritual practices.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.840 align:middle line:10%
During the Cathars era, the
mainstream Roman Catholic

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:10%
church was still
finding its way.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.270 align:middle line:84%
Reading the Bible,
even in Latin,

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
was forbidden by the Church,
which sought total authority

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.540 align:middle line:90%
and control.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.870 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars, who freely
taught the way of love,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.910 align:middle line:84%
represented unwanted
competition,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.590 align:middle line:84%
particularly as they claimed
their brand of Christianity

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.610 align:middle line:84%
was original to Christ,
originating with the Essenes,

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:84%
and predated Rome's intercept
of Jesus's teaching.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.980 align:middle line:84%
As Catharism appealed to the
nobility of southern France,

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.519 align:middle line:84%
who reigned from a super-wealthy
kingdom in nearby Toulouse,

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.040 align:middle line:84%
the Church coveted
the Cathar wealth.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:90%


00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.260 align:middle line:84%
In a move to
consolidate its power,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.630 align:middle line:84%
in the early 12th
century, the Roman church

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.420 align:middle line:84%
launched the
Albigensian Crusade,

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.330 align:middle line:84%
an inquisition to
hunt and eradicate

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.910 align:middle line:90%
the Catholic heretics.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.210 align:middle line:10%
Hundreds of thousands of
men, women, and children

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.390 align:middle line:10%
Cathars and other citizens
of the Languedoc region

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.470 align:middle line:10%
of southern France were
exterminated in mass burnings

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.900 align:middle line:10%
and slaughtering at
the hands of the church

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:10%
in the first European
genocide in order

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.080 align:middle line:10%
to eradicate the teachings
of the perfect ones,

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.840 align:middle line:10%
of the Essenes, of Jesus.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.570 align:middle line:84%
Just like the Roman
Empire, or the children

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.090 align:middle line:84%
of darkness as the
Essenes called them,

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:07.360 align:middle line:84%
these ascension keepers
were wiped out en masse

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:90%
by a desperate opposition.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.830 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.690 align:middle line:84%
In the Languedoc,
the Cathars sought

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
to connect with Jesus
as an angel of light who

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.400 align:middle line:84%
had entered human affairs to
deliver a spiritual technology

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.630 align:middle line:84%
for escaping Earth and to
cross into the kingdom of light

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.180 align:middle line:90%
via the Tree of Life.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.180 align:middle line:84%
For the Cathars,
Christ was an emissary

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.880 align:middle line:84%
of the light sent into the world
to lead humanity back to God.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.980 align:middle line:84%
The church that
formed around it was

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.190 align:middle line:84%
known as amour, or love,
the church of love,

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.750 align:middle line:84%
which was opposed by
the Church of Roma.

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.590 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars believed
each individual possessed

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.610 align:middle line:84%
two parts, one, a
spark of divine light

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.755 align:middle line:84%
that was trapped in a
garment of earthly flesh.

00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:00.130 align:middle line:84%
Some believed the
purpose of this

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.120 align:middle line:84%
was to utilize our body as
some sort of an energy device

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.290 align:middle line:84%
for harvesting some form of
energy off of our bodies.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.760 align:middle line:10%
Again, it's a belief that
goes all the way back,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.600 align:middle line:10%
even into the Sumerian
times of our bodies

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.380 align:middle line:10%
originating from a divine
place and somehow being trapped

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.130 align:middle line:10%
into the material realm.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.270 align:middle line:84%
The other aspect of ourselves,
our true self they refer to it,

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.290 align:middle line:84%
dwells in heaven and is
the guide and guardian

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.190 align:middle line:90%
of our earthly part.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.900 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars devised
the Consolamentum,

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.620 align:middle line:84%
a practice that brings the
two parts back together

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.130 align:middle line:84%
in a mystical marriage that
allows the imprisoned earth

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.660 align:middle line:84%
spirit to escape or ascend
to heaven under the guidance

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.000 align:middle line:90%
of the heavenly counterpart.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.630 align:middle line:10%
In the text, this return
is described as an ascent

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:53.755 align:middle line:10%
through seven levels.

00:06:53.755 --> 00:06:56.980 align:middle line:90%


00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.620 align:middle line:84%
Our divine spark, our
souls, we're told,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.250 align:middle line:84%
once dwelled in heaven
in glorified light bodies

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:08.260 align:middle line:84%
or celestial bodies that
were left behind in heaven.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.740 align:middle line:84%
In effect, we're
all fallen angels.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:84%
Our earthly purpose
is to realize

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.710 align:middle line:84%
our spiritual predicament
and to reverse the fall,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.230 align:middle line:84%
uniting the earthly spark
and the glorified light body.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.060 align:middle line:84%
The body of the
perfected ones was

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.620 align:middle line:84%
said to have become
transmaterial or semi-angelic,

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.850 align:middle line:84%
fulfilling the teaching
of the Gospel of Luke.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.220 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Cathars, the mission

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.440 align:middle line:84%
of the perfecti, or
the perfect ones,

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.260 align:middle line:84%
was to assist and
show others the way

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.850 align:middle line:84%
to attain their angelic status,
release their divine spark

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:48.580 align:middle line:84%
from the cycle of
earthly incarnation,

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.580 align:middle line:84%
and to return to the
glorified light body.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.160 align:middle line:90%


00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.120 align:middle line:84%
As part of their ascension
plan, the Cathar perfect ones

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.630 align:middle line:84%
performed a ceremony
called the Consolamentum,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.950 align:middle line:84%
a spiritual baptism in
which Christ transmits

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:12.430 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Spirit or the holy fire
to the rank and file Cathars.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.990 align:middle line:84%
During this ceremony, which
evolved from Pentecost which

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:19.570 align:middle line:84%
occurred 50 days after
Christ's ascension

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:23.650 align:middle line:84%
when he sent a fire, frequency,
or vibration of the Holy Spirit

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:28.360 align:middle line:84%
to the Disciples, this spirit
would descend from heaven

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:34.750 align:middle line:84%
and transform the ordinary
Cathars into a perfect one.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.860 align:middle line:84%
Good Christian was the
term used by the Cathars

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.590 align:middle line:84%
to describe those
who have received

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:45.220 align:middle line:84%
the Consolamentum or the
fire, frequency, or vibration

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.200 align:middle line:90%
of the Holy Spirit.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.550 align:middle line:84%
They claimed that this frequency
or vibration was transmitted

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:55.120 align:middle line:84%
shoulder to shoulder
from the time of Christ

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:58.480 align:middle line:84%
to the time of the Cathars
in a continuous line

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.550 align:middle line:90%
of transmission.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.400 align:middle line:84%
And those who received
the Consolamentum

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.080 align:middle line:90%
could then pass it on to others.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.390 align:middle line:84%
The Consolamentum
removed all sin

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:15.230 align:middle line:84%
and restored the glorious
or angelic light body

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.290 align:middle line:90%
the garment of immortality.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.320 align:middle line:84%
To the Cathars,
a consoled person

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.530 align:middle line:90%
is an angel in the flesh.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:26.930 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, receiving
Consolamentum

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.390 align:middle line:84%
was similar but not
identical to what

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.420 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes had in mind
with their transformation

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:38.000 align:middle line:84%
into an angel and was
an extreme life-changer.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.180 align:middle line:84%
Once it was received, there
were strict prohibitions

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.570 align:middle line:84%
against having sex,
eating meat, and taking

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.390 align:middle line:90%
the life of any creature.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:49.700 align:middle line:84%
Fasting and
vegetarian diets were

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
required to maintain the
elevated frequency of the body.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.890 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
Consolamentum was usually

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:84%
taken by the catheters
at an advanced age.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.500 align:middle line:10%
The Consolamentum has been
referred to as the transmission

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.260 align:middle line:10%
of the book and the prayer.

00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:14.270 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars had only one
prayer, the Our Father.

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Our father, which art in
Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.880 align:middle line:90%
Thy kingdom come.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.420 align:middle line:84%
Thy will be done in
Earth as it is in Heaven.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Give us this day
our daily bread.

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And forgive us our
trespasses, as we forgive

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.220 align:middle line:90%
them that trespass against us.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:35.370 align:middle line:84%
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.440 align:middle line:84%
For Thine is the Kingdom, the
power, and the glory forever

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.400 align:middle line:90%
and ever.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:42.740 align:middle line:90%
Amen.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:84%
This was the only
prayer taught by Jesus

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:50.180 align:middle line:84%
and is revered as the
prayer spoken by the angels

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.970 align:middle line:84%
before the sapphire
throne of Christ.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.730 align:middle line:84%
It was sacred to the
Cathars and could only

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.830 align:middle line:84%
be said by the consoled or those
who had begun the Consolamentum

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.720 align:middle line:90%
initiation.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.770 align:middle line:84%
However, the Cathars
altered the Lord's Prayer

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.230 align:middle line:90%
in a profound way.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Instead of saying, "Give us
this day our daily bread,"

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:18.890 align:middle line:84%
the Cathars said, "Bread
beyond substance."

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:23.300 align:middle line:84%
This is a reference to the
star food or food of the angels

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.340 align:middle line:84%
that we see falling around Mary
in the images of Pentecost.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.450 align:middle line:84%
It appears that the attunement
the Consolamentum provided

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.650 align:middle line:84%
enabled those initiates
to perceive and enjoy

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:41.180 align:middle line:84%
what is thought of as this
higher dimensional substance.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:44.600 align:middle line:10%
Moses manifested this
otherworldly substance,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.650 align:middle line:10%
this star food, with his rod
or wand, which we are told

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.440 align:middle line:10%
was made from a branch that
grew from the Tree of Knowledge

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.630 align:middle line:10%
in Eden.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:58.310 align:middle line:84%
The second aspect of the
Consolamentum is the book.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:01.520 align:middle line:84%
This is widely assumed
to be the Bible.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.360 align:middle line:84%
However, other alternatives
are possible and suggested.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.840 align:middle line:84%
Its claimed the
Cathars possessed

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:14.240 align:middle line:84%
the true secret teaching of
Jesus, one composed of symbols

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:17.990 align:middle line:90%
and known as the Book of Love.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.810 align:middle line:84%
This mysterious
manuscript is attributed

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:23.810 align:middle line:84%
to Jesus, who gave
it or transmitted it

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:26.030 align:middle line:90%
to John the Divine.

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.550 align:middle line:10%
It was transmitted
through the centuries

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:34.020 align:middle line:10%
until the Knights Templar
and the Cathars adopted it.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.410 align:middle line:84%
In Christian art, we see
John receiving a download

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:42.090 align:middle line:84%
from Christ, who stands on top
of a holy mountain and points

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.960 align:middle line:84%
to Mary, who is seated
on a disk of light,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.360 align:middle line:84%
rising out of the clouds and
holding the Christ child.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:57.090 align:middle line:84%
A winged serpent being,
a Seraphim, observes.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.550 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Love
was the foundation

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:02.160 align:middle line:84%
of the Cathars Church
of Love or Church

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.840 align:middle line:84%
of a Amour, which is the reverse
of Roma, the Church of Rome.

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.350 align:middle line:84%
The existence of this
lost or hidden gospel

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.560 align:middle line:84%
was revealed when the
Catholic church subjected

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.420 align:middle line:84%
the Cathars and the
Knights Templar to torture.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:21.570 align:middle line:84%
Its contents were
a secret skill,

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:25.920 align:middle line:84%
said to grant one the ability
to control the forces of nature

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and to transform ordinary
human blood into that

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:33.900 align:middle line:84%
of the wise, holy, and
pure blood of Christ.

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.290 align:middle line:84%
There are several theories
concerning how the book of love

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.900 align:middle line:84%
came to France and
to the Cathars.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.500 align:middle line:84%
One theory says an unknown
master brought the Book of Love

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:47.190 align:middle line:84%
to the Cathars from the East,
where stories of meditation,

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.121 align:middle line:84%
soul travel, and
metamorphosis originate,

00:13:51.121 --> 00:13:53.430 align:middle line:84%
a man who is
described in a peasant

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.710 align:middle line:84%
story to the
Inquisition tribunal

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:59.790 align:middle line:84%
as having a strange persuasive
power, the feature of amour,

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:04.900 align:middle line:84%
and a strange blue
light around him.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.360 align:middle line:84%
In his book "Crusade
against the Grail,"

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:11.050 align:middle line:84%
the German mythologist Otto
Rahn said the laws of Minne,

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:15.280 align:middle line:84%
the laws of love, were given
to the first troubadour

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.380 align:middle line:84%
by a hawk that sat on a
branch of a golden oak tree.

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.730 align:middle line:84%
Many of the troubadours
were Cathars.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptian god Horus
that reincarnated Osiris,

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.620 align:middle line:84%
the god of resurrection,
was represented by the hawk

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.880 align:middle line:84%
and is one of the most
famous gods of ancient Egypt.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.980 align:middle line:84%
Horus was the god of the sky,
a symbol of divine kingship.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.660 align:middle line:84%
He could take human
shape with a falcon head.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.030 align:middle line:84%
We note that he has a
winged serpent symbol

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:52.070 align:middle line:90%
of the Seraphim on his arm.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.840 align:middle line:10%
Another theory says
the Book of Love

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.250 align:middle line:10%
was brought to the Catholics by
Papa Nicetas, the Bogomil saint

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.010 align:middle line:10%
who traveled from his
home in Constantinople

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.970 align:middle line:10%
to the Languedoc, France in
1167 for the first official

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.250 align:middle line:10%
congress of the heads
of the Cathars church.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:12.290 align:middle line:84%
He gave them the book, also
known as the Book of Nicetas,

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.435 align:middle line:90%
or the Book of Seven Seals.

00:15:14.435 --> 00:15:17.140 align:middle line:90%


00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:21.400 align:middle line:84%
The Bogomils were a Gnostic
sect founded in the 10th century

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and headquartered in Macedonia
who called for a return

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:29.590 align:middle line:84%
to early or original
Christianity.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.490 align:middle line:84%
They were heavily influenced
by the mysticism of Manichaeism

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:37.750 align:middle line:84%
and the ancient Iranian
Zoroastrianism and Ahura Mazda.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:42.250 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Bogomils are
followers of Mani, the Persian

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.490 align:middle line:90%
Gnostic we discussed earlier.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.980 align:middle line:84%
As a young man, Mani
lived in a community

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.220 align:middle line:84%
of Jewish Christian
Baptists who are closely

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:56.800 align:middle line:84%
associated with the Ebionites
but who decided to break away.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:16:00.490 align:middle line:84%
The Ebionites were founded by
an important but largely unknown

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.760 align:middle line:84%
figure in the early history
of Christianity, James

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.520 align:middle line:84%
the Righteous, or James
the Just, the younger

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.910 align:middle line:84%
brother of Jesus who
was the first bishop

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.540 align:middle line:84%
or archbishop of the Jerusalem
church in the decades

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.290 align:middle line:84%
after the Resurrection
and ascension of Jesus.

00:16:17.290 --> 00:16:21.610 align:middle line:84%
Scholars say the Ebionites
left Jerusalem in 70 AD

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:24.430 align:middle line:84%
after the destruction of
the Temple of Solomon.

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.900 align:middle line:84%
And they made their way
to Italy and Macedonia.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.930 align:middle line:84%
Eusebius quotes from a now lost
work of Clement of Alexandria

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.960 align:middle line:90%
called "Hyposposes."

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.420 align:middle line:84%
James the Righteous,
John, and Peter

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.470 align:middle line:84%
were entrusted by the Lord
after His Resurrection

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.670 align:middle line:90%
with the higher knowledge.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.270 align:middle line:84%
And they imparted it
to the other apostles,

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:51.630 align:middle line:84%
and the other apostles to the
70, one of whom was Barnabas.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:55.270 align:middle line:84%
The "Apocryphon of James,"
the lone surviving copy

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.120 align:middle line:84%
of which was found in the
Gnostic Nag Hammadi Library

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.430 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt and which
may have been written

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:04.420 align:middle line:84%
in Egypt in the third century,
tells the Ebionite story

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:09.339 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus eating bread with James
after the Resurrection, which

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:12.190 align:middle line:84%
indicates that the
Ebionites very much believed

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:16.569 align:middle line:84%
in a physical
Resurrection for Jesus.

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:19.150 align:middle line:84%
With the discovery of
the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:21.040 align:middle line:84%
biblical scholars
and theologians

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.819 align:middle line:84%
realized for the first time
that the true foundation

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:29.290 align:middle line:84%
of the teachings of Jesus
was Jewish Essene or Ebionite

00:17:29.290 --> 00:17:31.870 align:middle line:90%
gnosticism.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.570 align:middle line:84%
In addition to James,
the original disciples

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:38.140 align:middle line:84%
and other family members,
known as the Desposyni,

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.870 align:middle line:84%
meaning of or
belonging to the Lord,

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:46.060 align:middle line:84%
composed the original Jerusalem
church, as it was also known.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:49.330 align:middle line:84%
And despite the fact that
Ebionite Christianity,

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.300 align:middle line:84%
the Jerusalem church,
is the religion created

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:55.960 align:middle line:84%
by Jesus's family and
those who knew him,

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.530 align:middle line:84%
it's still considered
a heresy to this day.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.770 align:middle line:84%
Christian scholars are
insistent that the Ebionite

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.230 align:middle line:90%
had a secret book.

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:09.600 align:middle line:84%
Mohammed knew of the
Ebionite, calling them

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.930 align:middle line:84%
the people of Sabah in
the Quran, and their book,

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.010 align:middle line:84%
calling the Ebionites
the People of the Book.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:20.700 align:middle line:84%
As many considered the Ebionites
the same as the Nazarenes

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:24.150 align:middle line:84%
and the Essenes, with
the Cathar Book of Love,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:29.790 align:middle line:84%
we could be dealing with
a lost Essene scroll.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:33.890 align:middle line:84%
Another name for the Ebionite
Essenes is the Elchasaites.

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:37.170 align:middle line:84%
Elchasai is called
the Apostle of Light.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And this figure, as
we discussed earlier,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.210 align:middle line:90%
is successively reincarnating.

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.300 align:middle line:90%
His alternate name is Alexei.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.330 align:middle line:84%
Both forms of the name
go back to the Aramaic,

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.540 align:middle line:84%
which Epiphanius
translates as hidden power.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.810 align:middle line:84%
In the "Revelation of Elchasai,"
Gerald P. Luttikhuizen

00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:01.440 align:middle line:84%
refers to a book of Elchasai
as a Christian writing.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.370 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is said
to derive from Christ

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.440 align:middle line:84%
and is intended
to be a supplement

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.990 align:middle line:90%
to Christian teaching.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.880 align:middle line:90%
This book is now lost to us.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.070 align:middle line:10%
But scholars are attempting
to reconstruct it.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.290 align:middle line:84%
In "God kings of
Europe, the Descendants

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.480 align:middle line:84%
of Jesus Traced
through the Odonic,"

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.290 align:middle line:84%
Hugh Montgomery tells us that
Buddha was another incarnation

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:24.970 align:middle line:90%
of this Apostle of Light.

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:90%
So is Jesus.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.350 align:middle line:90%
James the righteous followed.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:32.260 align:middle line:84%
And 100 years after Jesus,
the Apostle of Light

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:35.740 align:middle line:90%
incarnated as Elchasai.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:84%
He is likely the same
as the mighty angel

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:42.100 align:middle line:84%
who gave John the book to eat
in the Book of Revelation.

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.670 align:middle line:84%
This may be one reason why
this lost book cannot be found.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:47.493 align:middle line:90%
It was consumed.

00:19:47.493 --> 00:19:48.910 align:middle line:84%
But another way
of looking at this

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:84%
is that this is not
a literal experience.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.700 align:middle line:84%
Even though we're told the book
was set to taste like honey,

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:57.520 align:middle line:84%
this could be an
allegorical term

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that says the person embodied
or began to live this teaching.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:07.120 align:middle line:84%
They consumed it and
actually became it.

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.730 align:middle line:10%
Montgomery tells the
Elchasaites were also called

00:20:09.730 --> 00:20:13.390 align:middle line:10%
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
which means shortcut,

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:17.770 align:middle line:84%
because they possessed
a shortcut to God.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.950 align:middle line:84%
He says they were also known
as Cathari, from which we

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.740 align:middle line:90%
get the term Cathar.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:26.650 align:middle line:84%
Montgomery rightly
connects the Cathars

00:20:26.650 --> 00:20:29.320 align:middle line:84%
to the Bogomils,
who, once again, can

00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:35.410 align:middle line:84%
be traced through Manichaeism
to the Ebionites to the Essenes.

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:37.700 align:middle line:84%
The Cologne Mani-Codex,
which is dated

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.920 align:middle line:84%
from the 4th century
of the current era,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.640 align:middle line:84%
describes the parents of Mani,
the founder of Manichaeism,

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:48.770 align:middle line:84%
as followers of the prophet
Elchasaous, which scholars

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.030 align:middle line:90%
have identified with Elchasai.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And the Book of Hidden
Power is supposed

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:56.030 align:middle line:84%
to have been given
to the Elchasaites

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.210 align:middle line:84%
by two angels called
the Son of God,

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:03.080 align:middle line:84%
or watchers, and
the Holy Spirit.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:05.780 align:middle line:90%
So is there a connection?

00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:07.910 align:middle line:84%
Is the Book of
Love of the Cathars

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.820 align:middle line:84%
and the Book of Hidden
Power of the Elchasaites

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.850 align:middle line:90%
and the Ebionites the same book?

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:16.970 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Love is strikingly
similar to the secret book

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:20.870 align:middle line:84%
of the Ebionites and
firmly places the Cathars

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:25.170 align:middle line:84%
in our timeline of
ascension keepers.

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:84%
So what is the hidden
power this book transmits?

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.440 align:middle line:84%
We know that although Jesus
taught His ordinary followers

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:39.150 align:middle line:84%
by scripture, parable, myth, and
precept, Luke's gospel tells us

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that to his inner
circle of disciples,

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.500 align:middle line:84%
he transmitted, meaning beamed
or gifted, spiritual power

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:49.230 align:middle line:84%
directly and passed
on his secrets

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.470 align:middle line:84%
so that they could
carry on his work.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.630 align:middle line:84%
This happened at
the Last Supper.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:58.440 align:middle line:84%
When Jesus had called the 12
together the 12 disciples,

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:03.390 align:middle line:84%
he gave them power and authority
to drive out all demons

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:04.800 align:middle line:90%
and to cure diseases.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And he sent them out to
proclaim the Kingdom of God

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.190 align:middle line:90%
and to heal the sick.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.930 align:middle line:84%
He told them, take nothing for
the journey, no staff, no bag,

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.390 align:middle line:84%
no bread, no money,
no extra shirt.

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.820 align:middle line:84%
Whatever house you
enter, stay there

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.710 align:middle line:90%
until you leave that town.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:22.560 align:middle line:84%
And if people don't welcome
you, leave their town,

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.390 align:middle line:84%
and shake the dust off your
feet as testimony against them.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:30.090 align:middle line:84%
So they set out and went
from village to village,

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:34.740 align:middle line:84%
proclaiming the good news and
healing people everywhere,

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.440 align:middle line:90%
so says the Gospel of Luke.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So let's now turn to a
contemporary of the Cathars

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:46.120 align:middle line:84%
who scholars believe not only
received the Consolamentum

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:53.440 align:middle line:84%
but also left us a roadmap
for doing so, Dante.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.880 align:middle line:84%
Dante's "Divine Comedy" is
about the soul's journey to God

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.770 align:middle line:84%
and how he changed his earthly
flesh into celestial flesh,

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:07.060 align:middle line:84%
prompting the first use
of the word transhuman.

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:10.600 align:middle line:84%
Dante's works, the "Paradisio"
and "The Divine Comedy"

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:15.490 align:middle line:84%
are actually a mind
map for ascension.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:19.630 align:middle line:84%
The Italian genius Dante studied
at Florence's Santa Maria

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.690 align:middle line:84%
Novella inside the
Spanish chapel.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.120 align:middle line:84%
The old chapter house
of the monastery

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.810 align:middle line:84%
shows the white robed chosen
ones entering the gate

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.990 align:middle line:90%
to the high mountain, Scion.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:37.330 align:middle line:84%
Dante conceives of purgatory
as an island with a mountain

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.820 align:middle line:90%
divided into three parts.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.120 align:middle line:84%
Ante-purgatory is a sort
of waiting area where

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:90%
souls wait to enter purgatory.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.900 align:middle line:84%
Their goal is to get past
the angel who is guarding

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.858 align:middle line:90%
the closed door to purgatory.

00:23:52.858 --> 00:23:54.400 align:middle line:84%
We note here in this
painting that it

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.150 align:middle line:84%
has seven terraces which
correspond with the seven

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:00.280 align:middle line:90%
deadly sins.

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.850 align:middle line:84%
The third part, the
top, is Eden at the apex

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.030 align:middle line:90%
of this cosmic mountain.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.760 align:middle line:10%
As the idea of a
waiting room for souls

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.580 align:middle line:10%
is not part of
Christian theology,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:17.410 align:middle line:10%
scholars propose that Dante is
drawing from another tradition

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.660 align:middle line:10%
in telling his story.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:23.950 align:middle line:84%
He's actually mapping out
the Cathar Consolamentum.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:26.470 align:middle line:84%
And in his ascension
journey, Dante

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.830 align:middle line:84%
receives the first part of
the Cathar Consolamentum.

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:33.790 align:middle line:84%
And then, to mark his invitation
into the second phase,

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:37.960 align:middle line:90%
he goes through the closed door.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Next, exactly as in
the Cathar sacrament,

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.350 align:middle line:84%
Dante tells of acquiring
a prayer and a book.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:84%
The prayer, again,
is the Lord's supper.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And the book, we
are led to believe,

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:56.260 align:middle line:84%
is the Book of Hidden
Power, the Book of Love.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Upon entering the door,
Dante sees a marble rock

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:02.300 align:middle line:90%
with inscriptions.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.410 align:middle line:84%
This corresponds with the
heavenly tablet or book

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.840 align:middle line:84%
given to the
initiate by the gods

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.160 align:middle line:84%
or the mighty angels on
the path of ascension.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Dante calls the writing on
the rock visible language,

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.580 align:middle line:90%
which suggests symbols.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:23.770 align:middle line:84%
Next, Dante hears souls
singing the Our Father, again,

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.560 align:middle line:84%
the only Cathar
prayer and the one

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:31.490 align:middle line:84%
said to be sung by angels
at the throne of Christ.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:35.510 align:middle line:84%
Now Dante is prepared to
traverse the seven levels,

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.970 align:middle line:90%
or circuits, of Paradise.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:40.760 align:middle line:84%
And finally, he
reaches Eden at the top

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.610 align:middle line:90%
of the mountain of purgatory.

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:84%
Here appears Beatrice,
who is on the other side

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.550 align:middle line:90%
of a river from Dante.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.980 align:middle line:84%
The river, of course,
symbolizes the expanse

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmic waters, the
great river, the Milky Way that

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.090 align:middle line:90%
separates Heaven and earth.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.940 align:middle line:84%
Dante faints, falls
into the river,

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:06.200 align:middle line:84%
and emerges on the other
side with Beatrice.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.350 align:middle line:84%
Suddenly, four
angels encircle them.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Their arms stretch
over his body,

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:16.500 align:middle line:84%
forming the shape of
a cross in a circle.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.090 align:middle line:84%
This is considered by scholars
to be a laying on of hands.

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:23.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the Consolamentum,
especially says scholar

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.270 align:middle line:90%
Maria Soresina.

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:28.910 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember what
the Cathars believed

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.220 align:middle line:84%
about the divine
spirit being divided

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:37.250 align:middle line:84%
into two parts, one that lives
on earth, the other in Heaven.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.490 align:middle line:10%
In the "Convivio,"
Dante writes, quote,

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:45.050 align:middle line:10%
"That blessed Beatrice who
lives in Heaven with the angels

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.510 align:middle line:10%
and on earth with my soul."

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:84%
This is precisely what
the Cathars believed.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:54.900 align:middle line:10%
Being the incarnation
of beatific love,

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:59.760 align:middle line:10%
as her name implies, it is
Beatrice who leads Dante

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.480 align:middle line:10%
into the beatific vision.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.480 align:middle line:10%
In Christian theology,
the beatific vision

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.450 align:middle line:10%
is the ultimate direct
self-communication

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:13.140 align:middle line:10%
of God to the individual person.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.780 align:middle line:10%
A person possessing
or experiencing

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:20.130 align:middle line:10%
the beatific vision, reaches,
as a member of redeemed humanity

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:23.700 align:middle line:10%
and the communion of
saints, perfect salvation

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:28.160 align:middle line:10%
in its entirety in Heaven.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.020 align:middle line:84%
Soresina believes that
Beatrice represents

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:35.250 align:middle line:84%
the part of Dante's soul
that remained in Heaven

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:38.640 align:middle line:84%
and acts as his
guide and protector.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.740 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the
Cathars taught we all

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:84%
have such an angelic soul that
remains in heaven and acts

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:47.160 align:middle line:90%
as our guide and protector.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.350 align:middle line:84%
And it was the
Cathar Consolamentum

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:54.030 align:middle line:84%
that reunited these two parts
with the aim of completing

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.850 align:middle line:84%
our ascension through
the seven heavens.

00:27:56.850 --> 00:27:59.680 align:middle line:90%


00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.810 align:middle line:84%
In Manichaeism, the
awakening of the initiate

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:84%
is characterized by the coming
of the Virgin of Light, leading

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.700 align:middle line:84%
the way heavenward and
revealing the spiritual image

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:90%
of the new man.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.660 align:middle line:90%
This is Beatrice.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:18.530 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the Pathways
After Death, Mani said,

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.260 align:middle line:84%
when death comes to
one of the elect,

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.950 align:middle line:84%
primal man sends him
a light-shining deity

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.860 align:middle line:90%
in the form of a wise guide.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.860 align:middle line:84%
And with him are three
deities with whom

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.490 align:middle line:84%
they are drinking the vessel,
clothing, head cloth, crown,

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:36.260 align:middle line:90%
and diadem of light.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.480 align:middle line:10%
There accompanies
them a virgin who

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.940 align:middle line:10%
resembles the soul of
that member of the elect.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.500 align:middle line:10%
The diadem, the
crown, the robe, this

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.070 align:middle line:10%
is exactly what the Essenes were
describing in their ascension

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.160 align:middle line:10%
as well.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:55.030 align:middle line:84%
Mani later describes
the garment as radiant

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:59.560 align:middle line:84%
and the diadem as the
jewel of sovereignty.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:03.160 align:middle line:84%
Mani is clearly writing
about the ancient tradition

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.560 align:middle line:90%
of the beloved woman.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.410 align:middle line:84%
She is shown as a
feminine light form

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:11.510 align:middle line:84%
and is identical in
form and function

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:16.690 align:middle line:84%
to Avalokiteshvara, the goddess
of compassion who is shown

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:20.050 align:middle line:90%
as a shining rainbow woman.

00:29:20.050 --> 00:29:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Now, scholars may argue that
Dante could not possibly

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.060 align:middle line:84%
have been thinking
of Avalokiteshvara,

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:29.680 align:middle line:84%
but the story has
exactly the same.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.380 align:middle line:10%
It is at this moment
that Beatrice explains

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:36.400 align:middle line:10%
to Dante that the universe
is a hierarchy with creatures

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.520 align:middle line:10%
of different degrees of
awareness and capacity

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:42.970 align:middle line:10%
all obeying the same
divine laws as far

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:44.950 align:middle line:10%
as they can perceive them.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:48.730 align:middle line:10%
And in the rainbow ring in
this depiction by Giotto

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:54.510 align:middle line:10%
is the ringed figure or
winged figure of love.

00:29:54.510 --> 00:30:00.540 align:middle line:84%
This rainbow light body being is
the angel shut deep within us,

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:04.470 align:middle line:84%
trapped within our
material body of flesh.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:07.860 align:middle line:84%
It is the pearl in the shell of
the Gnostic Hymn of the Pearl

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:90%
that Thomas sought in Egypt.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.790 align:middle line:84%
What drives us to
seek it is love.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.880 align:middle line:84%
The ascension path
that leads us to her

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.790 align:middle line:84%
is the path of
love, which is why

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:26.700 align:middle line:84%
the Cathars referred to their
religion as the Way of Love.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:30.690 align:middle line:10%
Having completed his ascension
through seven halls or holes

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:34.530 align:middle line:10%
in space, Dante arrives
in the Empyrean,

00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:39.060 align:middle line:10%
a region of pure light beyond
physical existence, time,

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:44.250 align:middle line:10%
and space, where he is enveloped
in a light that transforms

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:middle line:10%
his human flesh into the perfect
celestial flesh of the angels,

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.340 align:middle line:10%
rendering him dressed
appropriately to see God.

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Dante is practically
speechless at witnessing

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:01.090 align:middle line:84%
the transfiguration or
metamorphosis of his body

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.350 align:middle line:90%
into light.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:08.830 align:middle line:84%
He writes, words may not tell
of that transhuman change.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:12.280 align:middle line:84%
This is the first use
of the word transhuman.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.530 align:middle line:10%
And in the 24th
canto of "Paradisio,"

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:17.440 align:middle line:10%
Saint Peter speaks
directly to Dante.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.730 align:middle line:10%
He addresses him
as Good Christian.

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:25.900 align:middle line:84%
In Dante's time, this
could only mean one thing,

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Dante was a Cathar who had
received the Consolamentum

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:34.780 align:middle line:84%
and went through the ascension
experience of the Cathars,

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:40.700 align:middle line:84%
of the Essenes and connected
with his life being self.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.440 align:middle line:84%
What we have seen
in this episode

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.630 align:middle line:84%
is the incredible
story of the Cathars

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:48.560 align:middle line:84%
and how they updated
the ascension code.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.740 align:middle line:84%
Many do believe that
the Cathars were in fact

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:54.860 align:middle line:90%
reincarnations of the Essenes.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.110 align:middle line:84%
They certainly
suffered the same fate,

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:59.870 align:middle line:84%
this time at the hands
of the Church of Rome

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:02.240 align:middle line:90%
rather than the Roman Empire.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.680 align:middle line:84%
But the Cathar initiative is
the same as that of the Essenes,

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:10.280 align:middle line:84%
to awaken us to our
true divine nature,

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:13.520 align:middle line:84%
to our light being self
that resides in Heaven.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.210 align:middle line:84%
Their teachings,
their lost ideas all

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:23.330 align:middle line:84%
reflect this concept that we
can scale a ladder to heaven.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And if indeed he
was a Cathar, Dante,

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:29.120 align:middle line:84%
who is considered one of the
greatest geniuses of all time,

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and his works of poetry,
some of the greatest

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.760 align:middle line:84%
works of literature of
all time, may in fact

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.750 align:middle line:84%
encode the Cathar
Consolamentum and map out

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:41.420 align:middle line:84%
the pathway by
which all of us can

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.240 align:middle line:84%
ascend into the celestial
realms and connect

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.380 align:middle line:90%
with our divine selves.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.130 align:middle line:90%
