00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm William Henry, and
this is "Ascension Keepers."

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.140 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.180 align:middle line:84%
We have established
that the Cathars

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.850 align:middle line:90%
were keepers of ascension.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.030 align:middle line:10%
Like the Essenes, the
Cathars sought a return

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.980 align:middle line:10%
to our Edenic state--

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.700 align:middle line:10%
our primordial condition
before the fall.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.760 align:middle line:84%
Back then, we weren't
in a lesser state--

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.040 align:middle line:84%
a physical state--
as some believe.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.800 align:middle line:90%
We were in a supra-human phase--

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.990 align:middle line:90%
our light bodies.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.910 align:middle line:84%
These gnostics believe that Adam
and Eve were beings of light.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.140 align:middle line:84%
Then after the fall, we
were given coats of skin--

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.110 align:middle line:90%
human skin.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.379 align:middle line:84%
And according to the ascension
keepers, all of human history

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.160 align:middle line:84%
has been about transcending
the limitations of our flesh

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.120 align:middle line:84%
and blood bodies and
returning, transforming

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.450 align:middle line:84%
or ascending to our original
state of being as light beings.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.420 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars utilized
the ascension of Isaiah,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.770 align:middle line:84%
an early second to third century
AD gnostic Christian text

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.870 align:middle line:84%
that follows the
journey of the prophet

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.650 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah out of the
suffering of Earth life,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.490 align:middle line:84%
through the seven heavens,
to the throne of God,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.490 align:middle line:84%
where Isaiah gets
his robe of light.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.010 align:middle line:10%
Always, this robe
of light is present

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.500 align:middle line:10%
in these essential stories.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.540 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah saw quote "Enoch, and
all who were with him, stripped

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:90%
of their robes of the flesh.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.340 align:middle line:84%
And I saw them in
their robes above.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
And they were like
the angels who

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.860 align:middle line:90%
stand there in great glory."

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.260 align:middle line:84%
This ascension text
would help the Cathars

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.300 align:middle line:84%
to explain the consolamentum,
because the vision of Isaiah

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.180 align:middle line:84%
describes the place
in the seventh heaven

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.810 align:middle line:84%
for the righteous dead,
which would be all those who

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.110 align:middle line:90%
had received the consolamentum.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.130 align:middle line:84%
The vision of
Isaiah made its way

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.150 align:middle line:84%
into the oral tradition
of the Cathars.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.930 align:middle line:84%
At an interrogation by the
inquisition at Pamiers in 1321,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.650 align:middle line:84%
a witness testified that
a Cathar had told him

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.230 align:middle line:84%
that another Cathar
had once wanted

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.600 align:middle line:84%
to know whether he
was truly following

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.860 align:middle line:84%
the good faith and the
right way of the Cathars.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.260 align:middle line:84%
As he prayed to
understand this, an angel

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.100 align:middle line:84%
appeared and granted him
successive levels of vision,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.630 align:middle line:84%
exactly as described in
the vision of Isaiah.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.820 align:middle line:84%
The man discovered at
the end of the vision

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.100 align:middle line:84%
that he had been
away for 32 years.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.860 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.850 align:middle line:84%
Was this vision that he had
some kind of a time travel

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.820 align:middle line:84%
experience, or did it
mean something else?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.850 align:middle line:84%
No one is quite sure, but
it's quite an enigmatic line.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.850 align:middle line:90%


00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.450 align:middle line:84%
We will explore how this text
was used as a visualization

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.930 align:middle line:84%
tool to induce visions
of the afterlife

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.510 align:middle line:84%
and to connect the Cathars
with their future selves--

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.800 align:middle line:90%
their light body selves.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.240 align:middle line:10%
Through repeated chanting of the
text, the body of the Cathars

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.690 align:middle line:10%
began to know what
it felt like to be

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.820 align:middle line:10%
in heaven among the angels
and how to become them.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.460 align:middle line:84%
This is something the scenes
Essenes taught, as well.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
And today, feeling
it to manifest it

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.050 align:middle line:84%
is a principle of
quantum healing.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Before going deeper into
the vision of Isaiah,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.740 align:middle line:84%
I would like to connect the
dots between the Cathars

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:84%
and the ascension teachings
of the divine feminine.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.690 align:middle line:84%
Earlier, we briefly touched
on the Cathar's Book of Love

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.620 align:middle line:84%
and how it may be the same book
delivered by the rainbow angel

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.010 align:middle line:84%
and revealed to the Cathars
during the consolamentum.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.850 align:middle line:84%
At Montsegur, we
learned the legend

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.350 align:middle line:84%
of a book that has been guarded
and protected by the Cathars--

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.579 align:middle line:90%
the pure ones.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.100 align:middle line:84%
A manuscript, which
lies in a leaden

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.040 align:middle line:84%
casket in the
depths of a cavern.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.060 align:middle line:84%
This manuscript is
called the Book of Love.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.390 align:middle line:84%
Author Elizabeth Van Buren
tells us the Book of Love

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
is said to be the book given
to John the Divine by Jesus

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.930 align:middle line:84%
and is said to contain
sublime teachings--

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.460 align:middle line:84%
marvelous revelations,
the most secret words

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.320 align:middle line:84%
confided by our Lord Jesus
Christ to the beloved disciple.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.040 align:middle line:84%
Their power would be
such that all hatred,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.530 align:middle line:84%
all anger, all jealousy would
vanish from the hearts of men.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.080 align:middle line:10%
The divine love,
like a new flood,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.940 align:middle line:10%
would submerge all souls,
and never again would blood

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.960 align:middle line:10%
be shed on this earth.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.980 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, is the
goal of the Essenes, who

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.150 align:middle line:84%
sought to transform Earth
into a planet of righteousness

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:84%
and is the promise of the
rainbow body of light teaching.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.520 align:middle line:84%
Researchers claim the Book of
Love is written in symbols.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.460 align:middle line:84%
These symbols are the mystery
language of the Book of Love,

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.660 align:middle line:84%
and they are preserved in
curious designs inserted

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
into paper in the
form of watermarks.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.310 align:middle line:84%
After their extermination by the
Catholic church, the Cathars--

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.790 align:middle line:84%
those that survived--
became paper makers.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.250 align:middle line:84%
Scottish mythologist
Harold Bailey

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.140 align:middle line:84%
called these designs thought
fossils or thought crystals,

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.670 align:middle line:84%
in which lies the lost
teachings of the Book of Love.

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.430 align:middle line:84%
These symbols only
became visible

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.060 align:middle line:84%
when the paper was
held to the light.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.800 align:middle line:84%
Then, in a flash, came a signal
of hope and encouragement

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.850 align:middle line:84%
to continue on
the path of souls.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.100 align:middle line:10%
Antonin Gadal, known as a
Cathar perfect one, or Parfait,

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.070 align:middle line:10%
says the primary symbols
of the Book of Love

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:26.765 align:middle line:10%
included the light ship of
Isis, the Egyptian goddess.

00:06:26.765 --> 00:06:29.340 align:middle line:90%


00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.490 align:middle line:84%
Now this is very interesting,
as the light ship of Isis

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.960 align:middle line:84%
takes us to Egypt and the Ark
of the Millions of Years--

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.550 align:middle line:84%
the ascension craft-- the
wormhole shaped ascension craft

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.440 align:middle line:84%
that is the ship of the soul
of the ancient Egyptian gods.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Attached to this light
ship in this depiction

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.480 align:middle line:84%
from the Temple of
Hathor at Dendera

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.560 align:middle line:84%
is a pillar called
the Head of Osiris.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:84%
It is the ancient
Egyptian symbol

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.200 align:middle line:90%
for the hope for the afterlife.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.600 align:middle line:84%
The hieroglyph for
the Head of Osiris

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:90%
includes a serpent on a pole.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
This, of course, is the healing
Nehushtan pillar of Moses

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.790 align:middle line:84%
that enabled Moses
to make a seraphim

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.030 align:middle line:84%
and was the symbol
that was banished

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.170 align:middle line:84%
from the Temple of Solomon by
King Josiah during his purge.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.460 align:middle line:84%
It is the key symbol for the
divine feminine mysteries

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.280 align:middle line:84%
and represents the
raising of Kundalini

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.650 align:middle line:90%
in preparation for ascension.

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.470 align:middle line:84%
This is the most
intriguing symbol

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.620 align:middle line:90%
cataloged by Harold Bailey.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.160 align:middle line:10%
In this depiction--
this Cathar diagram--

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.430 align:middle line:10%
for symbols form a device.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.420 align:middle line:10%
We see an ox head, a
pillar, and a serpent,

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.900 align:middle line:10%
and three orbs, and a horn.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:10%
The ox is the symbol for the
Ark of the Covenant, which

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.410 align:middle line:10%
was carried on an ox cart.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.050 align:middle line:84%
From the serpent's mouth emerges
three circles bound together.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.430 align:middle line:10%
This symbol is
called the trefoil.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.100 align:middle line:10%
It's the emblem of the Trinity.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.620 align:middle line:10%
Notably, it is the symbol
for the fifth element--

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.420 align:middle line:10%
wood.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.730 align:middle line:10%
After earth, air,
fire, and water,

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.110 align:middle line:10%
there is the fifth element--

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.640 align:middle line:10%
wood-- also known as
quintessence, the Cintamoni,

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.140 align:middle line:10%
and the Elixir of Light--

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.820 align:middle line:10%
the Elixir of Immortality.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.500 align:middle line:84%
The word Christ means anointed
and comes from the Greek chrism

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.840 align:middle line:90%
and creo, to anoint.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.390 align:middle line:84%
Thus we have a creo,
a horn or a vessel,

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.280 align:middle line:84%
as part of this
collection of symbols.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.120 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is exactly
the same symbols

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.810 align:middle line:84%
that were found in the Holy
of Holies of Solomon's temple

00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:53.100 align:middle line:84%
before the purge of
Josiah erased them.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.180 align:middle line:84%
This shows the Cathars were
in the line of transmission,

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:59.670 align:middle line:84%
if you will, of
they who understood

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:06.300 align:middle line:84%
this symbolism and the secrets
of ascension it encoded.

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:11.160 align:middle line:84%
It tells me the Book of Love
is another term for the lost

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.830 align:middle line:90%
ascension wisdom tradition.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.180 align:middle line:84%
So now, on to the
ascension of Isaiah.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:23.210 align:middle line:90%
This journey is ancient.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.380 align:middle line:84%
It begins with what is known
as Isaiah's call vision,

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:32.270 align:middle line:84%
around 740 BC, when the Old
Testament prophet entered

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:84%
the Holy of Holies of Solomon's
temple, the most sacred place

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.610 align:middle line:84%
in Judaism, and saw
the Lord enthroned,

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:44.060 align:middle line:84%
and heard him speak
amidst the seraphim,

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and heard their voices
calling, holy, holy, holy.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:50.000 align:middle line:90%
He saw the Lord.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.066 align:middle line:84%
He heard the Lord and heard the
heavenly beings in the temple.

00:09:56.066 --> 00:10:00.290 align:middle line:84%
A seraph took a burning
coal from the incense altar

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.110 align:middle line:90%
and purified Isaiah's lips.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:08.230 align:middle line:84%
Then Isaiah embarked
on a cosmic journey.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.510 align:middle line:10%
This cosmic journey
is the journey

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:14.380 align:middle line:10%
that inspired the Essenes to
move out into the wilderness

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.510 align:middle line:10%
and to expect the arrival--

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:22.760 align:middle line:10%
as Isaiah described, the arrival
of a high celestial being.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.730 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah's ability to
enter the heavenly realms

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.000 align:middle line:84%
showed that it's possible
to transcend worlds,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.150 align:middle line:84%
especially from
Solomon's temple.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.300 align:middle line:84%
All could enter this
realm by actively

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:40.310 align:middle line:84%
following the path of Isaiah,
so the ascension keepers taught.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.430 align:middle line:84%
This may be one reason why
when the Church of Roma

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:46.790 align:middle line:84%
came to burn the Cathars
during the Albigensian Crusade

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.410 align:middle line:90%
and the inquisition.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.010 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars went
willingly into the fires.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:55.610 align:middle line:90%
They knew where they were going.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:58.460 align:middle line:10%
During his journey
in the second heaven,

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.400 align:middle line:10%
Isaiah is so
overcome with what he

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.550 align:middle line:10%
sees that he falls
on his face to adore

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:07.010 align:middle line:10%
the angel on the throne.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:08.990 align:middle line:84%
But his angelic
guide warns him not

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.610 align:middle line:84%
to adore the angel or the
throne of that heaven.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:13.420 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:17.810 align:middle line:84%
Adore him only of whom I will
tell you and in like fashion,

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.960 align:middle line:84%
adore him who is
above all angels,

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.770 align:middle line:84%
above thrones, and above the
garments and crowns which

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.050 align:middle line:90%
you will see hereafter.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.230 align:middle line:84%
Those garments and crowns
are the garments and crowns

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:33.440 align:middle line:90%
sought by the Essenes.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah also saw a human
form on the throne.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.060 align:middle line:84%
Quote "In the year
that King Uzziah died,

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.040 align:middle line:84%
I saw the Lord sitting upon
a throne high and lifted up.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.500 align:middle line:90%
And his train filled the temple.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.430 align:middle line:10%
Above him stood the seraphim."

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:55.760 align:middle line:84%
This throne is the
Merkabah throne--

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:58.610 align:middle line:84%
the celestial vehicle
of the higher beings,

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.700 align:middle line:84%
the throne that
the Essenes sought.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Merkabah, or throne literature,
describes the beings

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.640 align:middle line:84%
who dwell at the
heavenly throne room

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:12.930 align:middle line:84%
in the celestial Holy of
Holies in the celestial temple.

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.750 align:middle line:84%
The Hekhalot Zutarti
says quote "Their walking

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:19.300 align:middle line:84%
is like the appearance
of a lightning bolt.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.450 align:middle line:84%
A vision of them is like
a vision of a rainbow.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:25.690 align:middle line:84%
Their faces are like
a vision of a bride.

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:30.430 align:middle line:84%
Their wings are like the
radiance of the clouds of glory

00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:34.330 align:middle line:84%
on which God rode
in the heavens."

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:40.650 align:middle line:84%
This means these seraphim are
rainbow body plasma beings.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:44.940 align:middle line:84%
And in my opinion, they are the
same as the beings described

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.518 align:middle line:84%
in the Tibetan rainbow
light body tradition.

00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:50.330 align:middle line:90%


00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.760 align:middle line:90%
As Isaiah's vision continues--

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:56.780 align:middle line:84%
his journey continues--
each succeeding heaven

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.770 align:middle line:84%
is more glorious than
the previous one,

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:03.800 align:middle line:90%
and Isaiah is filled with joy.

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:84%
In the sixth heaven,
Isaiah is told that no one

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.980 align:middle line:90%
has seen what he has seen.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.100 align:middle line:84%
And he is promised his
place in the seventh heaven

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:18.110 align:middle line:84%
upon his death, when he
will receive his garment

00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:21.410 align:middle line:90%
and will be equal to the angels.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.090 align:middle line:84%
After seeing all
this, Isaiah doesn't

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.270 align:middle line:84%
want to return to the
material world of darkness.

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:29.990 align:middle line:10%
But his guide tells him that
the light of the seventh heaven

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.620 align:middle line:10%
is far greater and that
it's not Isaiah's time yet

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:37.790 align:middle line:10%
to take his place in
the seventh heaven.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:39.410 align:middle line:10%
In the seventh
heaven, though, Isaiah

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:10%
sees certain of the righteous
who, stripped of fleshly robes,

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:49.770 align:middle line:10%
were in heavenly robes and
standing in great glory.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.940 align:middle line:84%
These are their spiritual
bodies of light.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.950 align:middle line:84%
And the robes they
wear are the robes

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.850 align:middle line:84%
of light sought by the Essenes,
the Cathars, and all ascension

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:90%
keepers.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah has reached
Zion, which was thought

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.290 align:middle line:84%
to lie at the
center of the world

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and on top of Yahweh's
holy mountain,

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:13.280 align:middle line:84%
Zion, whose base was rooted in
the depths of the underworld

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.320 align:middle line:90%
and whose highest reaches--

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.750 align:middle line:84%
the heights of
Zaphon, says Isaiah--

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:22.290 align:middle line:84%
stretched into the
farthest heavens.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:25.620 align:middle line:84%
You have come to Zion, to
the heavenly Jerusalem,

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.800 align:middle line:84%
the city of the living God,
says the book of Hebrews.

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:31.740 align:middle line:84%
You have come to
thousands upon thousands

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.420 align:middle line:90%
of angels in joyful assembly.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.680 align:middle line:84%
In Montsegur and the
Mystery of the Cathars,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.830 align:middle line:84%
Jean Markale notes that
another Cathar text, the Secret

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:48.210 align:middle line:84%
of the Last Supper, claims that
the sixth and seventh heavens

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.990 align:middle line:84%
were places where the light
retained and perpetuated

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.870 align:middle line:90%
its integral integrity.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:57.570 align:middle line:84%
And the eyes of my
souls were opened,

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.880 align:middle line:90%
and I beheld the great glory.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.910 align:middle line:84%
And its luster was dazzling
that I could no longer

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:06.390 align:middle line:84%
see the angel who was with
me and all the angels I

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:09.510 align:middle line:90%
had spied praising the Lord.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Markale says that this
short passage indicates

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:15.990 align:middle line:84%
that the spiritual light
of the seventh heaven

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:20.950 align:middle line:84%
was so exceptional that it
banished all other lights.

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:24.750 align:middle line:84%
This is the elixir of
light we discussed earlier.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.080 align:middle line:84%
This is the light that
transformed Dante.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.130 align:middle line:84%
This is the light the Cathars
maintained they were beaming

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:36.700 align:middle line:90%
into their castles in the sky.

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:41.530 align:middle line:10%
The same ideas is expressed in
Percival by Chretien de Troyes,

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:45.340 align:middle line:10%
specifically in the description
of the light emanating

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:47.560 align:middle line:10%
from the Holy Grail.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.100 align:middle line:84%
As seen in this illumination
from the Lohengrin Grail Saga,

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.920 align:middle line:84%
it was a light that eclipsed
that of the candles,

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.610 align:middle line:90%
as well as the light of the Sun.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:02.260 align:middle line:84%
The idea to be grasped here is
that there exists somewhere,

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:04.420 align:middle line:84%
symbolically, at
the highest point

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.560 align:middle line:84%
in the heavens, a privileged
spot where the light is

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.530 align:middle line:90%
of absolute purity.

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.020 align:middle line:84%
This light can
not be apprehended

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:19.510 align:middle line:84%
by human consciousness without
being transduced or transposed

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:22.780 align:middle line:90%
into a palpable form.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.060 align:middle line:84%
Otto Rahn, the
German mythologist,

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:29.740 align:middle line:84%
argued in 1933 that the
Cathar castle, Montsegur,

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:34.600 align:middle line:84%
was Montsalvage and is
the castle of the Holy

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.290 align:middle line:90%
Grail, the link to Zion.

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:42.010 align:middle line:84%
We certainly can view
it as a gateway to Zion.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:45.100 align:middle line:84%
And in his book, Crusade
Against the Grail,

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:50.380 align:middle line:84%
Rahn accepted that the Grail is
a metaphor for the human soul.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:54.790 align:middle line:84%
But he also tells how Wolfram
Von Eschenbach's epic Parzival,

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.700 align:middle line:84%
which was contemporary
with the Cathars,

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:02.380 align:middle line:84%
is the story of how the Grail
is a stone or a book that

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.319 align:middle line:84%
fell from Lucifer's
crown to earth,

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:08.740 align:middle line:90%
and that it landed on Montsegur.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:13.500 align:middle line:10%
Christ recovered this stone.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.700 align:middle line:10%
The Cathars considered
the keep of Montsegur

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.329 align:middle line:10%
penetrated by the sun
on the summer solstice--

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:23.609 align:middle line:10%
in other words, by
light in its purest,

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:26.220 align:middle line:10%
freshest, and most
dazzling form--

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:30.210 align:middle line:10%
as a representative
of the seventh heaven.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:33.840 align:middle line:84%
It is Eden in Dante's
Divine Comedy.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.080 align:middle line:90%
It is a Sun or star chamber--

00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.800 align:middle line:84%
a stargate to the
seventh heaven,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.030 align:middle line:84%
a place where the Cathars
could open a hole in heaven

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:48.570 align:middle line:84%
and experience the
lost elixir of light

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.980 align:middle line:84%
of the seventh heaven and
total ecstasy and happiness.

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:84%
Montsegur, therefore,
was a place of ascension.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.170 align:middle line:84%
Scholars now recognize
that this Grail stone

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.860 align:middle line:84%
is also called the
Cintamani, or wish fulfilling

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.590 align:middle line:90%
gem, of the Buddhists.

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:13.740 align:middle line:10%
It's symbolized by three circles
in the pattern of a pyramid.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.290 align:middle line:10%
This is exactly
what we saw being

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.070 align:middle line:10%
spit from the mouth of the
serpent in the Cathar watermark

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.610 align:middle line:10%
on the true cross, suggesting
that they may, in fact, have

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.970 align:middle line:10%
possessed the Cintamani.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.400 align:middle line:84%
The Cintamani stone
is the cosmic stone

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.300 align:middle line:84%
that dropped from heaven
in Tibetan Buddhism.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.470 align:middle line:84%
It is the symbol for the
power of resurrection

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:84%
that instantly manifests
what ever thought we think.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:46.680 align:middle line:84%
It produces the
rainbow light body.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci's
lost Christ Pantocrator,

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:54.600 align:middle line:84%
or Savior of the world, shows
Jesus holding a crystal orb

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:90%
with three dots in a triangle.

00:18:57.030 --> 00:19:00.540 align:middle line:84%
Is this a coincidence,
or is Leonardo

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:05.770 align:middle line:84%
telling us something about
Jesus and the Cintamani stone?

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Mani, the Persian prophet
we've been discussing,

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.350 align:middle line:84%
took his name from
this grail stone--

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:17.030 align:middle line:90%
from the Cintamani stone.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.670 align:middle line:10%
The intriguing, yet
very speculative

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.720 align:middle line:10%
possibility that Padmasambava,
who brought the rainbow body

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:26.840 align:middle line:10%
teaching from India to
Tibet in the eighth century,

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.720 align:middle line:10%
provided the model
for Parzival himself

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.870 align:middle line:10%
is discussed by scholars.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Linda Harris, author of the
Secret Heresy of Hieronymus

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.950 align:middle line:84%
Bosch, has presented
a controversial theory

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:43.970 align:middle line:84%
that key elements of the
Cathar ascension teaching

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:49.100 align:middle line:84%
resurfaced in the early 16th
century, about 400 years

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:52.970 align:middle line:84%
after their genocide
by the Church of Rome.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.690 align:middle line:84%
She provides evidence that
this enigmatic Flemish painter,

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Hieronymus Bosch, inherited
the Cathar symbol code--

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:02.870 align:middle line:90%
the Book of Love--

00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:07.400 align:middle line:84%
and concealed it within his
extraordinary, dreamlike, and

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.340 align:middle line:84%
sometimes grotesque
paintings in an effort

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.740 align:middle line:84%
to preserve and advance or
transmit Cathar teaching.

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:17.450 align:middle line:84%
One of his most
well-known triptychs

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:20.240 align:middle line:84%
is the Garden of Earthly
Delights, housed today

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.410 align:middle line:90%
in the Prado in Madrid.

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:25.680 align:middle line:10%
The strange and haunting
imagery woven throughout this--

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.900 align:middle line:10%
and indeed, all
of Bosch's work--

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.560 align:middle line:10%
creates a consistent and
symbolic visual language

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.190 align:middle line:10%
unique to Bosch.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.040 align:middle line:10%
Unlike the punishing
Christian Purgatory,

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.970 align:middle line:10%
the Cathar bridge world,
called the New Earth,

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.250 align:middle line:10%
was viewed as a
garden of delight

00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:45.740 align:middle line:10%
where souls could
reorient themselves

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:50.980 align:middle line:10%
to their original
perfection, bliss, and joy.

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.560 align:middle line:10%
In his article, the Millennium
by Hieronymus Bosch,

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.470 align:middle line:10%
John Rickman suggests
another explanation

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.830 align:middle line:10%
is that the symbols are
mysterious precisely

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:04.120 align:middle line:10%
because they were intended to
be inaccessible except, perhaps,

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.540 align:middle line:10%
to a small audience of
initiates, such as the members

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:10.840 align:middle line:10%
of a secret Hermetic society.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.750 align:middle line:84%
He says a group known as
the Hominis Intelligentsia,

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.140 align:middle line:84%
or Brothers and Sisters
of the Free Spirit,

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.870 align:middle line:84%
has been suggested
by some historians

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.540 align:middle line:84%
as the possible patron
who commissioned

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.630 align:middle line:90%
Bosch's most intriguing works.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:30.230 align:middle line:84%
This group obviously sounds
like keepers of ascension to me.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.620 align:middle line:84%
This group was part of a
heretical movement that

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.810 align:middle line:84%
had spread throughout
Europe that

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.490 align:middle line:84%
sought to combat the all
powerful Church of Rome.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.620 align:middle line:84%
This coalition of
free thinkers was

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:45.850 align:middle line:84%
influenced by the Adamites, an
offshoot of the Carpocratian

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Gnostics of the second century,
who called their church

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:52.870 align:middle line:84%
Paradise and sought to
return humanity to Adam

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:57.130 align:middle line:84%
and Eve's original state of
innocence and perfection.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.950 align:middle line:84%
This means they,
too, were devoted

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.120 align:middle line:90%
to attaining the light body.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.790 align:middle line:84%
Lydia Harris points us to
one of Bosch's paintings

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.790 align:middle line:84%
from the flood
roundel at Rotterdam.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:12.810 align:middle line:84%
In the background, we see a
saved soul-- a Cathar soul--

00:22:12.810 --> 00:22:16.110 align:middle line:84%
receiving his robe of
light-- or beaming garment,

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:17.490 align:middle line:90%
as Mani called it--

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:19.950 align:middle line:90%
from an angelic messenger.

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:23.070 align:middle line:84%
Then this soul
kneels before Jesus,

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.550 align:middle line:84%
who is portrayed
as a beam of light.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.670 align:middle line:10%
In Bosch's phenomenal
triptych called the Altarpiece

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.730 align:middle line:10%
of the Hermits,
Saint Jerome kneels

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:38.320 align:middle line:10%
before a traditional Catholic
image of the crucifixion.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:42.340 align:middle line:84%
We see the dead Jesus
attached to the dead wood.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:48.130 align:middle line:84%
But in the lower left, we see
a strange glassy cylinder.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:53.680 align:middle line:84%
Mani called this the Column of
Glory, or the Christ Column.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:58.810 align:middle line:84%
Inside is a rising or
ascending Cathar soul--

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:84%
surely a being of
light ascending

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.660 align:middle line:90%
past the Sun and Moon.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.350 align:middle line:10%
It's possible, says
Harris, that this painting

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.110 align:middle line:10%
was inspired by
the Cathar version

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:14.650 align:middle line:10%
of the Vision of Isaiah,
the apocalyptic book whose

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.800 align:middle line:10%
text describes the prophet
Isaiah's visions of the seven

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.210 align:middle line:10%
heavens.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.720 align:middle line:84%
This text, as we noted, was
used as a meditation tool

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.660 align:middle line:84%
to induce visions of the
afterlife for the Cathars

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:31.030 align:middle line:84%
and served as a sort of roadmap
or mind map for ascension.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:34.750 align:middle line:84%
It's possible that Bosch
himself may have experienced

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:40.270 align:middle line:84%
this other worldly vision or
was given explicit descriptions

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.380 align:middle line:90%
by initiates--

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:47.560 align:middle line:84%
the keepers of ascension-- who
actually had this experience.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:49.650 align:middle line:84%
As described in the
vision of Isaiah,

00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:52.060 align:middle line:84%
Bosch's painting
shows the heavens

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.780 align:middle line:90%
are layered one upon another.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
And as we see in the detail, the
column in Bosch's Saint Jerome

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:04.000 align:middle line:84%
is divided into four layers that
rest upon a semi circular pink

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.170 align:middle line:90%
base.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.290 align:middle line:84%
This represents
the earthly world.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:10.390 align:middle line:84%
The pink bass is
then met by a seal

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:14.920 align:middle line:84%
of spiky entwined branches that
resemble the crown of thorns.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.420 align:middle line:84%
This represents the border
between Earth and Heaven.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.450 align:middle line:10%
And as the perfected
one, or Cathar soul,

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.600 align:middle line:10%
rises above this seal,
it infers that this

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.100 align:middle line:10%
is a perfected human who has
transcended the entanglements

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.010 align:middle line:10%
of material Earth life.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.130 align:middle line:10%
Above the crown of thorns,
the freed soul ascends

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.180 align:middle line:10%
to a dark layer
filled with stars--

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:40.840 align:middle line:10%
a stargate.

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:44.860 align:middle line:10%
This then leads to a blue
band, which could be Heaven.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:46.960 align:middle line:10%
But above that is
another layer--

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.300 align:middle line:10%
a layer of stars, a
crescent Moon, a bright

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.190 align:middle line:10%
and a radiant Sun.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
This is spiritual Zion
that produces this light

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:90%
beyond light.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.520 align:middle line:10%
As Lydia Harris writes,
this is metaphorically

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:03.790 align:middle line:10%
the shining head of Jesus.

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:06.010 align:middle line:10%
It is the soul's final goal--

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:11.920 align:middle line:10%
a kind of portal which
leads to the land of light.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.440 align:middle line:84%
Harris notes that the
Cathars identified Jesus

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.890 align:middle line:90%
with the Tree of Life--

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.340 align:middle line:84%
the tree or column
which reaches to Heaven,

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.070 align:middle line:90%
or the land of light, Zion.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.330 align:middle line:84%
Further she says, the
Cathars and the Manichaeans

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.620 align:middle line:84%
envision this as
a real channel--

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:31.330 align:middle line:84%
an actual stargate through
which the saved souls freely

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.100 align:middle line:90%
traveled.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.530 align:middle line:84%
I envision the Ark
of the Covenant

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:42.170 align:middle line:84%
as the ancient divine feminine
tool that opened this channel.

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is equated with
this column or pillar

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.810 align:middle line:90%
in Coptic Manichaean psalms.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.690 align:middle line:84%
In the Cathar work called
The Manichaean Treatise,

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.390 align:middle line:84%
we are told that the tree
of life and its fruits

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.850 align:middle line:90%
are found in the New Earth.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.270 align:middle line:84%
It also alludes to Jesus
as the Tree of Knowledge

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.960 align:middle line:90%
and the Column of Glory.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:10.380 align:middle line:84%
The spiritual sun of the new
Earth, Zion, never sets there.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.640 align:middle line:84%
The Column of Glory,
or Christ Column,

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.070 align:middle line:84%
of the Cathars and
Manichaeans is also

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:20.020 align:middle line:84%
represented in one of the most
haunting paintings ever known.

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.450 align:middle line:10%
It's usually called
Ascent to the Imperium

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:26.620 align:middle line:10%
and is the fourth of the
Afterlife Panels by Hieronymus

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.980 align:middle line:10%
Bosch in the Palazzo
Ducale in Venice

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:33.940 align:middle line:10%
and presents a visionary
scene of human souls ascending

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.280 align:middle line:10%
towards a tunnel--

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:41.290 align:middle line:10%
a portal leading to a
glowing heavenly paradise.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:43.390 align:middle line:84%
The depiction of
an awaiting world

00:26:43.390 --> 00:26:46.360 align:middle line:84%
of light accessed
through a tunnel of light

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.100 align:middle line:84%
is consistent with
the testimonies

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:51.910 align:middle line:84%
of people who have experienced
the near-death experience

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:55.720 align:middle line:84%
and returned from the
threshold of death.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.940 align:middle line:84%
In this extraordinary
painting, we

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:02.680 align:middle line:84%
see a number of souls ascending
to a stargate composed

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.880 align:middle line:84%
of concentric rings
suspended above the clouds.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.980 align:middle line:84%
As the soul rises, it appears
to become less and less dense,

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:16.720 align:middle line:84%
until it dissolves into a
radiant being of light once

00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.150 align:middle line:90%
inside the tunnel.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:21.760 align:middle line:90%
Waiting is a solitary figure--

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:25.810 align:middle line:84%
the Light Twin, the
Messenger, Dante's Beatrice,

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:27.970 align:middle line:90%
the Lady of Light.

00:27:27.970 --> 00:27:31.630 align:middle line:84%
This illustrates the Cathar
and Manichaean belief

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.920 align:middle line:90%
that the saved--

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:35.470 align:middle line:84%
the perfected ones, those who
are whole, wholly complete,

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:40.060 align:middle line:84%
and perfected-- would regain
their original immaterial light

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:45.500 align:middle line:84%
bodies before ascending to
the land of light, or Zion.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.810 align:middle line:84%
And as Linda Harris observes,
quote "The unearthly light

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:54.242 align:middle line:84%
at the end of Bosch's tunnel
is a place totally removed

00:27:54.242 --> 00:27:56.200 align:middle line:84%
from everything to do
with the physical world."

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:58.850 align:middle line:90%


00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:02.580 align:middle line:84%
And what we have
seen in this episode

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:08.220 align:middle line:84%
is that the Cathars were
clearly using stargate imagery.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.370 align:middle line:84%
They were utilizing
the vision of Isaiah

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:14.280 align:middle line:84%
as a mind map that would
enable them to rehearse their

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.920 align:middle line:90%
after life experience.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.420 align:middle line:84%
By rehearsing this over,
and over, and over again

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:27.330 align:middle line:84%
in their earthly minds, they
then created a material reality

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:30.240 align:middle line:90%
in their afterlife mind.

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.850 align:middle line:84%
We've all heard of this
quantum healing concept--

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:36.310 align:middle line:90%
feel it in order to manifest it.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:39.300 align:middle line:84%
And this is what the
vision of Isaiah was.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.620 align:middle line:84%
And what this scholarship shows
is that the Cathars clearly

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.400 align:middle line:84%
were tapping into the light
body teachings of the Tibetans,

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Manichaeans, of
the early Christians,

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:53.370 align:middle line:84%
and were ready and
willing to transform

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:58.390 align:middle line:84%
their bodies into light as they
scaled this ladder to heaven.

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:01.170 align:middle line:84%
And isn't it absolutely
incredible and intriguing

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.360 align:middle line:84%
that Hieronymus
Bosch may well have

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.850 align:middle line:84%
been the recipient of
these Cathar teachings,

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.490 align:middle line:84%
if he didn't experience
them himself,

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.340 align:middle line:84%
and has encoded them
within his paintings

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.790 align:middle line:84%
for us to use as
navigational or meditation

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.660 align:middle line:84%
tools in our own
journey to ascension.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:22.230 align:middle line:84%
So this means that
Hieronymus Bosch is another

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.560 align:middle line:90%
of our ascension keepers.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:30.219 align:middle line:90%
