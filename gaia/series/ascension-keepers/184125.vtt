00:00:06.818 --> 00:00:18.993 align:middle line:90%


00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:21.865 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm William Henry, and
this is "Ascension Keepers."

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:25.110 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.630 align:middle line:10%
In the second century
BC, the Essenes

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.900 align:middle line:10%
broke away from the
rest of humanity

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.060 align:middle line:10%
and took refuge at Mount Carmel
overlooking the Mediterranean

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.720 align:middle line:10%
Sea and in Qumran on
the Dead Sea, Palestine,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.150 align:middle line:10%
among other sanctuaries.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.190 align:middle line:84%
The Dead Sea Scrolls
of the Essenes

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.970 align:middle line:84%
show that they sought to attain
an elevated state of wholeness,

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.210 align:middle line:84%
or holiness, in order
to transform earth

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.090 align:middle line:84%
into a plane or planet
of righteousness,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.815 align:middle line:90%
a planet of angels.

00:00:53.815 --> 00:00:56.600 align:middle line:90%


00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.250 align:middle line:84%
This means Qumran was
more than just any refuge.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.290 align:middle line:84%
It was a command center for a
new humanity and a new earth.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.170 align:middle line:90%
And so too was Mount Carmel.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.990 align:middle line:10%
My research reveals that all
of the Essene communities

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.770 align:middle line:10%
were ascension centers
where celestial beings found

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.110 align:middle line:10%
safe harbor and
taught humans how

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.760 align:middle line:10%
to perfect themselves and
transform into angels.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.800 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they taught humans

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.690 align:middle line:84%
how to wear their robes
of light and to ascend.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.480 align:middle line:10%
The Essenes answered
the question

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.150 align:middle line:10%
"can a human become an angel?"

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.860 align:middle line:84%
with a specific plan for mass
perfection or transformation

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.870 align:middle line:90%
and ascension.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.420 align:middle line:84%
As we have seen,
ascension and perfection

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:84%
are interchangeable
terms for the Essenes.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.740 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
perfection, scholars

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.630 align:middle line:84%
refer to this transformation
as angelomorphism

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.640 align:middle line:84%
or human transformation
into an angel.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.180 align:middle line:84%
Becoming an angel and ascending
is the one goal, they believe,

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.759 align:middle line:84%
that takes care of all
other goals or intentions.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.220 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes claim they
possess this knowledge of how

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.150 align:middle line:84%
to make or transform
humans into holy ones

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.310 align:middle line:84%
and to change our
state of existence

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.650 align:middle line:90%
by illuminating the world.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.610 align:middle line:84%
And if we accept that
the Essenes were living

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.490 align:middle line:84%
among angels and
extraterrestrials,

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.540 align:middle line:84%
the next logical question
is, who were these angels?

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Or what kind of
angels were they?

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.060 align:middle line:10%
The answer is, they are known
as the angels of the Lord,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.400 align:middle line:10%
or the watchers.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.730 align:middle line:84%
Early mystical Hebrew sects
organized these angels

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.310 align:middle line:90%
into an archangel hierarchy.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.380 align:middle line:10%
This is the origins of the
spiritual hierarchy idea.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.230 align:middle line:84%
According to this
system, the watchers

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.980 align:middle line:84%
are the highest angels
possible and were ruled over

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.920 align:middle line:90%
by four of their own--

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.390 align:middle line:84%
the great angels known as
Michael, Gabriel, Rafael,

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.520 align:middle line:90%
and Ariel.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.910 align:middle line:10%
These are among the good
watchers we will discuss,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:10%
as is Metatron, who is actually
the transformed human, Enoch.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.940 align:middle line:10%
The watchers are the
mighty seraphim, the winged

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.010 align:middle line:10%
and fiery serpents,
as they were known,

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.380 align:middle line:10%
the burning ones who formerly
guarded the gate to Eden.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.080 align:middle line:10%
They came from God's
throne where they

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.440 align:middle line:10%
served on God's divine counsel.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.140 align:middle line:90%
But they decided to leave.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.870 align:middle line:84%
They crossed a
forbidden boundary

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.660 align:middle line:90%
and took on earthly bodies.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.920 align:middle line:84%
In Christian art, the seraphim
are portrayed as six-winged

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.890 align:middle line:84%
and covered with feathers and
eyes, an appropriate attribute

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.800 align:middle line:84%
of those who watch or
guard God's throne.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Their swirling
bodies are toroidal.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.120 align:middle line:84%
They are composed of
pure love and pure light.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.020 align:middle line:84%
In his famous vision, Isaiah
saw the seraphim enthroned

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:84%
above the Ark of the Covenant
in the Holy of Holies

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.810 align:middle line:90%
of Solomon's temple.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.630 align:middle line:84%
They stood above Yahweh as
he sat on his ark throne.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.790 align:middle line:84%
They are believed to be
the same as the cherubim

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.820 align:middle line:84%
of First Chronicles whose
wings were stretched

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.970 align:middle line:90%
above the Ark of the Covenant.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.980 align:middle line:10%
The root of seraphim comes
either from the Hebrew verb

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.010 align:middle line:10%
seraph, to burn,
or the Hebrew noun

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.340 align:middle line:10%
seraph, meaning a
fiery flying serpent.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.400 align:middle line:84%
And fiery serpents, says
Valencia [INAUDIBLE],,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.310 align:middle line:84%
was an epithet given
to Levite priests

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.880 align:middle line:84%
after they departed
from the law of Moses.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.240 align:middle line:84%
The Levitical priesthood
began with Aaron,

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.860 align:middle line:90%
the brother of Moses.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.730 align:middle line:84%
And it was they who carried
the Ark of the Covenant.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.210 align:middle line:84%
Many Essenes were Levite
priests and knew the secrets

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.730 align:middle line:84%
of the true Ark,
the one that was

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.055 align:middle line:84%
lost during the Jewish
exile in Babylon.

00:05:13.055 --> 00:05:15.890 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.680 align:middle line:10%
The seraphim are
described in scroll 4Q405.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.130 align:middle line:84%
It says-- the cherubim,
or seraphim, praise

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.120 align:middle line:84%
the vision of the throne-chariot
above the celestial sphere,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:84%
and they extol the radiance
of the fiery firmament

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.370 align:middle line:90%
beneath the throne of his glory.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.370 align:middle line:84%
And the holy angels come and
go between the whirling wheels

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
like a fiery vision of most
holy spirits, and around them

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.630 align:middle line:84%
streaming revolts
of molten fire,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.200 align:middle line:84%
like incandescent
bronze, a radiance

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.500 align:middle line:84%
of many brilliant
colors of exquisite hues

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.750 align:middle line:90%
gloriously mingled.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.350 align:middle line:10%
The spirits of the living
God move in constant accord

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.345 align:middle line:10%
with the glory of the
wonderful chariot.

00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:02.440 align:middle line:90%


00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.330 align:middle line:10%
In Jewish mysticism,
the complete physical

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.540 align:middle line:10%
characteristics of
these angels includes

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:10%
a humanoid body, a serpentine
face, a many-colored garment,

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:10%
rising up into the air like
whirlwinds, luminous or radiant

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.860 align:middle line:10%
bodies, feathered cloaks or
capes, many eyes, the ability

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.210 align:middle line:10%
to fluidly morph or change
form and to shapeshift.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.690 align:middle line:84%
And around them, stream
rivulets of molten fire

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.600 align:middle line:84%
like incandescent
bronze, a radiance

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:84%
of many brilliant colors
of exquisite hues,

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.150 align:middle line:90%
gloriously mingled.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Elsewhere, they are
described as lightning-like.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.100 align:middle line:84%
We are talking about a class
of beings that have the ability

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:57.040 align:middle line:84%
to fluidly morph or phase into
physical flesh and blood bodies

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.580 align:middle line:84%
and back into a higher state
of being where their bodies are

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:90%
composed of celestial flesh.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.170 align:middle line:10%
To be the most accurate,
images of the seraphim

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.370 align:middle line:10%
should portray them as
multicolored, or even

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.850 align:middle line:10%
rainbow colored.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.370 align:middle line:10%
They are light beings.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.530 align:middle line:10%
In my opinion, this
is why the description

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.050 align:middle line:10%
of their light bodies
precisely matches

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.740 align:middle line:10%
the description of the
Tibetan rainbow light body.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.760 align:middle line:90%


00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.820 align:middle line:84%
As we have previously
discussed, perfection

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.800 align:middle line:90%
was the goal of the Essenes.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.500 align:middle line:84%
And we have matched it to the
Tibetan rainbow light body

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.480 align:middle line:90%
teaching.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.840 align:middle line:84%
I can prove this connection
through a very important

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.600 align:middle line:90%
Greek word--

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.070 align:middle line:90%
oiketerion.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.620 align:middle line:84%
In the New Testament,
the watchers

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:53.130 align:middle line:84%
are the angels, which kept
not their first estate,

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.910 align:middle line:84%
but left their
original habitation

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:59.360 align:middle line:84%
and are now bound by
everlasting change of darkness,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.190 align:middle line:84%
awaiting the great day
of judgment, says Jude 6.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:09.580 align:middle line:84%
The Greek word translated here,
first estate, is oiketerion.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:84%
According to Strong's
Biblical Dictionary,

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.360 align:middle line:84%
it speaks to a dwelling place
or habitation of the body

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.100 align:middle line:84%
as a dwelling place
for the spirit.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.080 align:middle line:84%
It's an abode or
vessel for the soul.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.730 align:middle line:84%
The term oiketerion is used
in only one other place

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.080 align:middle line:90%
in the Bible--

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:34.720 align:middle line:84%
in 2 Corinthians 5:2 to refer
to the resurrection body

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.980 align:middle line:84%
or eternal spiritual
light body of Christ.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.720 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, this means that
the resurrection body of Jesus

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.030 align:middle line:84%
and the light body
of these angels

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.880 align:middle line:90%
is the same type of being.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:54.700 align:middle line:84%
In Christian art, the eternal
spiritual light body of Christ

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:90%
is shown as a rainbow body.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.580 align:middle line:84%
This tells me that
the bodies and state

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.120 align:middle line:84%
of being of the angels
who instructed the Essenes

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.410 align:middle line:84%
and the perfected body state of
being of the resurrected Christ

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.730 align:middle line:90%
are exactly the same.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.530 align:middle line:10%
And as we have seen,
there is good reason

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.620 align:middle line:10%
to compare the swirling
bodies of the seraphim

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.600 align:middle line:10%
with the rainbow light body.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.790 align:middle line:90%
Because they are the same.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.580 align:middle line:90%


00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.550 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, this is why
the ascended Jesus appeared

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.650 align:middle line:84%
as a seraph to Saint
Francis of Assisi

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:32.320 align:middle line:90%
in the early 13th century.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.120 align:middle line:84%
Again, it's because the seraphim
possessed the celestial flesh

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:44.010 align:middle line:84%
of ascended beings who dwell
in a higher phase of existence.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.060 align:middle line:84%
Jesus showed us what was
possible with oiketerion bodies

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:52.110 align:middle line:84%
of the angels during the 40
days between his resurrection

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:54.660 align:middle line:90%
and ascension to Zion.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.730 align:middle line:84%
Jesus turned up 12 different
times after the resurrections.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.560 align:middle line:10%
His followers claimed
not only to have

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:06.360 align:middle line:10%
seen him, but also to have
eaten with him, touched him,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.600 align:middle line:10%
and to have received a cosmic
essence, the Holy Spirit,

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:14.530 align:middle line:10%
from him while in
this new light body.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:10%
Jesus could pass through a wall.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.820 align:middle line:84%
He could manifest
as if out of thin

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
air, as he did during his
appearance to or meeting

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.800 align:middle line:84%
with Paul on the
way to Damascus.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:84%
Which some actually believe is
the Essene compound at Qumran

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.540 align:middle line:84%
during which the resurrected
Jesus spoke to Paul.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.690 align:middle line:84%
Jesus' next human
abilities correspond

00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.110 align:middle line:84%
to the yogic abilities,
or perfect powers,

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.460 align:middle line:90%
called the Ashta Siddhi.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Siddhi can be translated as
perfection or accomplishment.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.380 align:middle line:10%
These eight powers
of the perfected ones

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:10%
are the ability to make oneself
infinitely small in an instant,

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:10%
even to the size of atoms, the
power to grow infinitely large

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.940 align:middle line:10%
or to become giant at will,
levitation, or defying

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.390 align:middle line:10%
the law of gravity, the
power to have anything

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.800 align:middle line:10%
anywhere, the ability
to realize any dream,

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.370 align:middle line:10%
total control over the
elements, the ability

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:20.880 align:middle line:10%
to create or destroy matter,
and absolute lordship

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:27.840 align:middle line:10%
over all creation and instant
materialization of wishes.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.090 align:middle line:84%
Other powers mentioned
in the Eastern texts

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.080 align:middle line:84%
include mind reading, memories
of past lives, clairvoyance,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.582 align:middle line:84%
bilocation, materialization,
weather control,

00:11:37.582 --> 00:11:41.820 align:middle line:84%
ability to choose the womb
to be born in before birth,

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:45.540 align:middle line:84%
transforming one material into
another by the use of the sun

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:52.350 align:middle line:84%
or plasma rays, and morphing or
phasing into any desired form.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:middle line:84%
Earlier, we noted
that the Essenes

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.510 align:middle line:84%
were named after the breastplate
of the Israelite high priest

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:00.060 align:middle line:84%
that enabled them
to tell the future.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.570 align:middle line:84%
In effect, they were a
community of high priests.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.250 align:middle line:90%
Aaron was the first high priest.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.970 align:middle line:90%
And others say it was Adam.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.190 align:middle line:84%
This is because the
garb of the high priest

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:13.570 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the light
body of Adam and Eve.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.320 align:middle line:84%
And the Holy of Holies
of Solomon's temple

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.540 align:middle line:84%
where this garb was
worn is a recreation

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:19.670 align:middle line:90%
of the Garden of Eden.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:23.180 align:middle line:84%
With this in mind and
these powers in mind,

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.610 align:middle line:84%
let's look at what happened
to the high priest who

00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:29.330 align:middle line:84%
wore this breastplate when
he entered the Holy of Holies

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.380 align:middle line:90%
of Solomon's temple.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.080 align:middle line:90%


00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:37.520 align:middle line:84%
When the high priest, or cohen
gadol, went into the temple

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.160 align:middle line:84%
on the Day of Atonement,
he had already

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:84%
undergone elaborate
preparations for purification.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.830 align:middle line:84%
The experience was considered
awesome, even perilous.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.950 align:middle line:84%
Imminent danger, even death
as well as redemption,

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.170 align:middle line:90%
was at stake.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:10%
During this experience,
the high priest

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.640 align:middle line:10%
would intone the
name of God, which

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.400 align:middle line:10%
was inscribed on his crown.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.870 align:middle line:84%
The pronunciation
of the name was

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:07.760 align:middle line:84%
thought to bring him into
direct contact with the divine.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.590 align:middle line:84%
And through the
power of the name,

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.330 align:middle line:84%
he was able to experience
God as a consuming fire

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:17.870 align:middle line:84%
that shone like a
rainbow, says 3 Enoch.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:23.090 align:middle line:84%
This tells us the rainbow light
and the name are connected,

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.690 align:middle line:90%
if not the same thing.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.260 align:middle line:90%


00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.070 align:middle line:10%
The Marei Kohen is a
Jewish song or prayer

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:33.250 align:middle line:10%
that describes the sight
of the high priest emerging

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.400 align:middle line:10%
victoriously from the Holy
of Holies in the temple

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.000 align:middle line:10%
after successfully speaking
the name during the Atonement

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.800 align:middle line:10%
Ceremony.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.560 align:middle line:84%
Quote, "like the
lightning that emanates

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.480 align:middle line:84%
from the splendor
of the divine beings

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.030 align:middle line:90%
was the appearance of the cohen.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Like the blue thread and
the fringes of the four

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.060 align:middle line:84%
corners of the garments was
the appearance of the cohen.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.630 align:middle line:84%
Like the image of the
rainbow formed in the clouds

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.180 align:middle line:84%
was the appearance
of the cohen."

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.620 align:middle line:84%
Like the lightning, like
the image of a rainbow?

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.730 align:middle line:10%
Our question is, by
what means can a human

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.870 align:middle line:10%
enter a place, holy or
not, and be transformed

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:20.020 align:middle line:10%
into a lightning-like being,
radiant like a shining rainbow?

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.230 align:middle line:84%
Is the portal of Solomon's
temple a transformation

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:24.790 align:middle line:90%
chamber?

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.690 align:middle line:84%
Is this transformation
from human flesh to a light

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.840 align:middle line:84%
or lightning body a
literal, or is it just

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.140 align:middle line:90%
a metaphorical, experience?

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:39.110 align:middle line:84%
Lightning is plasma, the
same substance as the sun.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:43.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, 99.999% of
the universe is plasma.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.630 align:middle line:10%
The angels who were present
in the tomb of Jesus

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.320 align:middle line:10%
were also described as having
the appearance of lightning

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.450 align:middle line:10%
or lightning-like bodies.

00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Is this tradition telling
us that the high priest

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.030 align:middle line:84%
was transformed
into a plasma being

00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.870 align:middle line:84%
with the splendor of a rainbow,
meaning he was gloriously

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.070 align:middle line:90%
robed in multicolored light?

00:15:07.070 --> 00:15:10.820 align:middle line:84%
This transformation is one of
the great secrets of Solomon's

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.340 align:middle line:84%
temple and is the
ultimate knowledge

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.750 align:middle line:90%
possessed by the Essenes.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.080 align:middle line:84%
It was taught to
them by angels who

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.590 align:middle line:84%
existed in this state
of being and who

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.930 align:middle line:84%
brought the technology
and this teaching,

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.580 align:middle line:84%
including the Ark of
the Covenant, to earth.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.110 align:middle line:90%
But there is more to this story.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Importantly, the robe
of the high priest,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.120 align:middle line:84%
the garment of light, was
made from the same material

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:84%
as the veil that separated
the holy place from the most

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:48.950 align:middle line:90%
holy place in Solomon's temple.

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.650 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Margaret Barker is
the preeminent expert

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:55.210 align:middle line:84%
on this extraordinary
and supernatural veil.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.280 align:middle line:10%
And she says the
veil was the boundary

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.350 align:middle line:10%
between earth and heaven.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:07.040 align:middle line:10%
It was covered with stars
and images of the seraphim.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.760 align:middle line:10%
Philo says that the veil
separated the changeable parts

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.610 align:middle line:10%
of the world from the
heavenly region, which

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:18.560 align:middle line:10%
is without transient
events and is unchanging.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:10%
The people who passed through
the veil, notes Barker,

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.910 align:middle line:10%
were the mediators,
divine and human,

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:30.830 align:middle line:10%
clad in priestly garments,
who walked between the worlds

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:34.010 align:middle line:10%
in order to bring blessings
and the presence of God

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.330 align:middle line:10%
to their people.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:38.950 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes text 3
Enoch makes it clear

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:44.110 align:middle line:84%
that this transformation
was mental, physical,

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:46.030 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual.

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.970 align:middle line:84%
The high priest and all
others who experienced this

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.270 align:middle line:84%
shed human flesh
and were transformed

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:55.240 align:middle line:90%
into celestial flesh.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.540 align:middle line:10%
Josephus and Philo agree that
the four different colors

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.330 align:middle line:10%
from which this veil
was woven represented

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.690 align:middle line:10%
the four elements from which
the world was created--

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.540 align:middle line:10%
earth, air, fire, and water.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.500 align:middle line:84%
The scarlet thread woven
through it represented fire.

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.569 align:middle line:90%
The blue was the air.

00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:16.660 align:middle line:84%
The purple was the
sea, and that is water.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.819 align:middle line:84%
And the white linen
represented the earth

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.180 align:middle line:90%
in which the flax had grown.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:28.180 align:middle line:10%
In other words, says Dr. Barker,
the veil represented matter.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:33.310 align:middle line:10%
The high priests wore a vestment
woven from the same four colors

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.900 align:middle line:10%
and from this material.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.910 align:middle line:84%
And this is why
The Book of Wisdom

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:42.100 align:middle line:84%
says that Aaron's robe
represented the whole world.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.210 align:middle line:10%
The robe of light is
woven from the same cloth

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:50.170 align:middle line:10%
as the veil of the temple.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Dr. Barker points
us to the Epistle

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.670 align:middle line:84%
to the Hebrews, which
explores the theme of Jesus

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.880 align:middle line:84%
as the high priest after
the order of Melchizedek

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.910 align:middle line:84%
and this otherwise
enigmatic line

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:05.890 align:middle line:84%
that his flesh was the
veil of the temple.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:08.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the veil was matter

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.770 align:middle line:84%
which made visible
whatever passed through it

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:15.280 align:middle line:90%
from the world beyond the veil.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.890 align:middle line:10%
Those who shed the
earthly garments

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:20.710 align:middle line:10%
on the other side of
the veil were enrobed

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:22.990 align:middle line:10%
in garments of rainbow glory.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.590 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they became divine.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:31.180 align:middle line:84%
This means the veil was
a link to another realm

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.440 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes referred to as
Zion, or the new Jerusalem.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:40.180 align:middle line:10%
It is the substratum of
reality, the quantum realm.

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:44.310 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes called
this realm raz or reis.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:48.050 align:middle line:84%
And if one knows the
mysteries of the ras or reis,

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:54.370 align:middle line:84%
they become a raised person
beaming rays of light.

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:56.740 align:middle line:84%
This mysterious
reality beyond the veil

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.670 align:middle line:84%
is known in fragments of
wisdom texts found at Qumran.

00:19:00.670 --> 00:19:05.170 align:middle line:84%
The Hebrew words raz, reis, or
rasum, meaning divine heavenly

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:08.380 align:middle line:84%
mysteries-- raz nihyeh
the secret of the way

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:11.920 align:middle line:84%
things are, and pesher, meaning
interpretation or hidden layer

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.920 align:middle line:84%
of meaning, are used
in the Essenes Scrolls

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.580 align:middle line:90%
for these mysteries.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:21.520 align:middle line:84%
Raz occurs frequently in
two particular books found

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.440 align:middle line:90%
among the Dead Sea Scrolls--

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.710 align:middle line:84%
the Book of Mysteries and
the Secret of the Way Things

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.450 align:middle line:84%
Are, also called
the Sapiential Work.

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.000 align:middle line:84%
The assumption behind
the Book of Mysteries

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.840 align:middle line:84%
is that revelation or
apocalypse, not reason,

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.160 align:middle line:90%
is the key to wisdom.

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:41.890 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the word
apocalypse itself

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:45.070 align:middle line:90%
means the lifting of the veil.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.890 align:middle line:10%
The book is authored by
an unnamed teacher who

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:51.310 align:middle line:10%
claims to be the recipient
of such a revelation

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.680 align:middle line:10%
and is passing it
along to his students

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.010 align:middle line:10%
in preparation for an end time.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.140 align:middle line:84%
The end time described
by the author

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:01.990 align:middle line:84%
does not manifest itself
in the normal culmination

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.570 align:middle line:84%
of a battle, judgment,
or catastrophe,

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:09.190 align:middle line:84%
but rather as a steady increase
of light through which darkness

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:13.360 align:middle line:84%
is made to disappear or in
which iniquity dissolves

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:84%
and, just as the smoke rising
into the air, eventually

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.520 align:middle line:90%
dissipates.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Like many of the mysteries
we have been discussing,

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:26.150 align:middle line:84%
the word ras or reis
can be traced to India,

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:30.560 align:middle line:84%
where it also signified mystery,
secret learning or wisdom,

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.350 align:middle line:84%
or even a ray
emanating from the sun.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:38.150 align:middle line:84%
This is the source of the
title reshis or rishis,

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.480 align:middle line:84%
the great sages and
seers of Hindu mythology

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.850 align:middle line:84%
who are stellar
spirits or angels

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:48.140 align:middle line:84%
and are equated with the
seven stars of the Big Dipper.

00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:52.700 align:middle line:84%
Like the Essene raz masters,
the reshis, or rashis,

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.780 align:middle line:84%
sought to become raised persons
with rays of light beaming

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.550 align:middle line:90%
from their bodies.

00:20:58.550 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:84%
And by raised is
meant transmuted

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:03.110 align:middle line:90%
into a radiant and risen being.

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.750 align:middle line:90%


00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
Continuing with our wordplay,
the Sanskrit word for alchemy

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.560 align:middle line:84%
or transmutation from
one form to another

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.090 align:middle line:84%
is rasayana, literally
the abode of rasa,

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:20.230 align:middle line:90%
meaning essence or sap.

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:22.450 align:middle line:84%
Alchemy arises from
the premise that there

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:25.570 align:middle line:84%
is a perfect equation
between the human body

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.280 align:middle line:90%
and the universe.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.840 align:middle line:84%
That which exists
in the universe

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.290 align:middle line:84%
can be found in the human
body, and vice versa.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:36.340 align:middle line:10%
And by knowing the essence of
the substance, the raz that

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:42.730 align:middle line:10%
makes up the body, the essence
of the universe is also known.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:45.280 align:middle line:84%
Writing in the kabalistic
teachings of Jesus

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:49.030 align:middle line:84%
in the Gospel of Thomas,
academic scholar Lewis Keizer

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:49.960 align:middle line:90%
writes--

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.740 align:middle line:84%
raz is the term used
in Daniel and Enoch

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:57.760 align:middle line:84%
to describe messianic and
other sacred knowledge

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.490 align:middle line:84%
that could be revealed
to humankind only

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:05.200 align:middle line:84%
through the
intermediation of angels.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.140 align:middle line:10%
This is the full meaning
of the word apocalypse.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:10%
It is the lifting of the
veil of consciousness

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.200 align:middle line:10%
via the help of
an ascended being.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.980 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge of the raz enabled
one to pass through the veil

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:24.040 align:middle line:84%
to other realms, to return,
and to share it with others.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.670 align:middle line:10%
The raz is the teaching
of the seraphim.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.970 align:middle line:10%
The primary symbol of the divine
feminine and the ascension

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:34.480 align:middle line:10%
mysteries, the serpent on
a pole, or the Asherah,

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.730 align:middle line:10%
is also known as the Nehushta.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:39.610 align:middle line:10%
This is the symbol
of the seraphim.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Moses lifted this serpent
appealing in the wilderness.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:47.200 align:middle line:84%
When Moses lifted the
Nehushta, the key symbol

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.480 align:middle line:84%
of the divine
feminine Kundalini,

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.930 align:middle line:84%
it brought healing to
the Israelites, and also

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:56.380 align:middle line:84%
the manifestation of
seraphim and a demonstration

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.500 align:middle line:84%
of this knowledge of the
raz and Moses' ability

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:02.620 align:middle line:84%
to pass through the burning
bush into the dimension

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.560 align:middle line:90%
of the shining ones.

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.860 align:middle line:10%
Thomas Aquinas said the seraphim
have the quality of clarity

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.760 align:middle line:10%
or brightness, which signifies
that these angels have

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.760 align:middle line:10%
in themselves an
inextinguishable light

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.590 align:middle line:10%
and that they also
perfectly enlighten others.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:25.990 align:middle line:84%
This fire, frequency, vibration,
or presence is transmittable.

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.800 align:middle line:84%
It's symbolized by
a garment of light.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.230 align:middle line:10%
Exodus 34:29
states-- and it came

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.950 align:middle line:10%
to pass when Moses came down
from Mount Sinai with the two

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.680 align:middle line:10%
tablets of testimony
in Moses' hand,

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.920 align:middle line:10%
when he came down from the
mount, that Moses would not--

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.640 align:middle line:10%
that the skin of his face shone
while he talked with them.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And when Aaron and all
the children of Israel

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.000 align:middle line:84%
saw Moses, behold, the
skin of his face shone.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.390 align:middle line:84%
And they were afraid
to come nigh him.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.860 align:middle line:84%
Until Moses had done
speaking with them,

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.220 align:middle line:90%
he put a veil on his face.

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.100 align:middle line:84%
But when Moses went in before
the Lord to speak with him,

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.860 align:middle line:84%
he took the veil off
until he came out.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.920 align:middle line:84%
And he came out and spake
to the children of Israel

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.650 align:middle line:90%
that which he was commanded.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:13.600 align:middle line:84%
And the children of Israel
saw the face of Moses,

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.910 align:middle line:84%
that the skin of
Moses' face shone.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:17.800 align:middle line:84%
And Moses put the
veil upon his face

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.400 align:middle line:84%
again until he went
in to speak with him.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.910 align:middle line:84%
This tells us that before
he entered the burning bush,

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.990 align:middle line:90%
Moses' face did not shine.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:33.390 align:middle line:84%
After, he radiated so much light
it terrified the Israelites,

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:38.550 align:middle line:84%
prompting Moses to veil his
face to tone down this light.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:42.300 align:middle line:84%
Something happened to
Moses and the burning bush.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:47.130 align:middle line:84%
Something was transmitted to him
or activated from within him.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:50.040 align:middle line:84%
He became a burning
man, a burning one,

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.910 align:middle line:90%
or a Seraphim angel.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:57.150 align:middle line:84%
As notes scholar
CRA Morray-Jones,

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.970 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
stories of Moses' ascent

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:03.060 align:middle line:84%
into heaven from Mount
Sinai and the bodily

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:07.890 align:middle line:84%
metamorphosis that this entailed
is a very widespread Midrashic

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:12.270 align:middle line:84%
tradition that all the
Israelites, when they beheld

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:15.300 align:middle line:84%
the appearance of God's
manifest glory on the mountain,

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.260 align:middle line:84%
experienced a similar
transformation of their bodies

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:22.740 align:middle line:84%
and were translated
to angelic status.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:23.880 align:middle line:90%
We find, for example--

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.700 align:middle line:84%
continues Morrey
Jones-- that God adorned

00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.090 align:middle line:84%
the children of Israel from
the splendor of his glory,

00:25:30.090 --> 00:25:33.840 align:middle line:84%
vested them in royal robes,
gave them crowns and weapons

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.930 align:middle line:84%
engraved with the divine
name, all of which

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:41.450 align:middle line:84%
liberated them from
the power of death.

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:44.750 align:middle line:84%
The key point is that a
multiple number of chosen ones

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:48.650 align:middle line:84%
wore the robes
simultaneously and ascended

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.860 align:middle line:84%
and they possessed the
name or power of God,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.740 align:middle line:90%
the mysteries of the raz.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.620 align:middle line:84%
This scene is
exactly what we see

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:00.410 align:middle line:84%
in Benjamin West's depiction
of the Ark of the Covenant

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:02.150 align:middle line:90%
in operation.

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:03.890 align:middle line:84%
We see the pillar
of righteousness

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:07.820 align:middle line:84%
shoot from the ark, beaming
the righteous into heaven.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And we see a long line of
Israelites await their turn.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.770 align:middle line:84%
According to Rabbi
Eliezer, our Judah

00:26:16.770 --> 00:26:20.250 align:middle line:84%
says that whenever a man
puts on his fine clothes,

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:22.920 align:middle line:84%
he becomes beautiful in
his appearance, glory,

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.780 align:middle line:90%
and splendor.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Thus were Israel while they
were wearing that name.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.490 align:middle line:84%
They were as good as angels in
the presence of the Holy One.

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.860 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes believed
humans could

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.400 align:middle line:84%
transform into the
rainbow-colored seraphim.

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:42.270 align:middle line:84%
Moses did, and he took a
number of people with him.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:90%


00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.250 align:middle line:84%
One of the key takeaways
from this episode

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.330 align:middle line:84%
is our definition of
the word apocalypse.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.920 align:middle line:84%
In our contemporary
culture, apocalypse

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.800 align:middle line:84%
is confused with
the word armageddon.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.530 align:middle line:84%
People talk about this
apocalypse or that apocalypse.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And they understand it to
mean a total conflagration

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.490 align:middle line:84%
or destruction, an utter
cataclysm of some kind.

00:27:05.490 --> 00:27:07.920 align:middle line:84%
They're completely
misusing the word.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.900 align:middle line:84%
In order to get to the
ascension mysteries,

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.450 align:middle line:84%
we've got to go back to the
original meaning of the word

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:16.470 align:middle line:84%
apocalypse, which means
the lifting of the veil.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.700 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, we want
to focus on the understanding

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:25.500 align:middle line:84%
that the apocalypse is a
transition or a transformation

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.530 align:middle line:84%
of a human being into
a celestial being.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:30.210 align:middle line:84%
And that in fact,
the word apocalypse

00:27:30.210 --> 00:27:34.530 align:middle line:84%
refers to an angelic being
delivering to a human

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:39.090 align:middle line:84%
being the knowledge, the wisdom,
even the frequency or vibration

00:27:39.090 --> 00:27:42.450 align:middle line:84%
that will enable their
transformation into a celestial

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:43.980 align:middle line:90%
being.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.430 align:middle line:84%
And once again, we have seen
that these ascension mysteries

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:52.410 align:middle line:84%
do not belong to any one
particular group of mystics.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.600 align:middle line:84%
Our ultimate ascension
mysteries that we seek

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.820 align:middle line:84%
are going to be derived
from the Jewish tradition.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.070 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be derived
from the Indian tradition,

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.560 align:middle line:84%
from the Egyptian
tradition, from the Iranian.

And this is one of the
great concepts of ascension,

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.590 align:middle line:84%
that it's meant to
unify all the world's

00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:09.780 align:middle line:90%
religious and mystic traditions.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.120 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we've
been seeing over and over,

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.870 align:middle line:84%
in this episode and others,
that our ascension is going

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:19.590 align:middle line:84%
to require a unification
of our heart, our mind,

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.980 align:middle line:84%
of our earthly world with
the celestial realms.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.900 align:middle line:84%
And as we continue
our journey, we're

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:28.290 align:middle line:84%
going to see more and more that
these ascension mysteries were

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.470 align:middle line:84%
deliberately placed
in various cultures,

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.750 align:middle line:84%
all opening our mind
to the reality that

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:36.240 align:middle line:84%
behind the veil of
our consciousness

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.990 align:middle line:84%
is a phenomenal reality
that we are all now

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.470 align:middle line:90%
invited to step into.
