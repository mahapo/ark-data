00:00:09.272 --> 00:00:12.200 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:19.520 align:middle line:90%


00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm William Henry, and
this is "Ascension Keepers."

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.430 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:84%
It is the oldest and most
beautiful story ever told.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.320 align:middle line:10%
Far and away, in a pure
and heavenly place,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.550 align:middle line:10%
a baby soul, a soul
star, was born.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.940 align:middle line:84%
It lived in a perfect
world of light and love.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.480 align:middle line:84%
Then the soul star
received a call to action.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.740 align:middle line:84%
It disrobed from its
beaming robe of light,

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.310 align:middle line:84%
departed from its source,
from God, from home.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.230 align:middle line:84%
And it quested into the eternal
starry night of all that is.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.660 align:middle line:84%
Finally, the
wandering soul finds

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.850 align:middle line:84%
itself entangled in the
conscious matrix of earth,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.380 align:middle line:84%
in whose labyrinthine
womb it remains

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.730 align:middle line:84%
until it meets a divine angel,
an avatar, or messenger,

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and remembers its light robe
and begins the journey home.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.470 align:middle line:90%


00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.590 align:middle line:84%
The mythology and religious
traditions of many cultures,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.290 align:middle line:84%
even without physical
contact, feature

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.670 align:middle line:84%
tales of mystics who
phoned home and contacted

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.300 align:middle line:84%
a divine light being,
an avatar actually part

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.100 align:middle line:84%
of a tribe of perfect light
humans, and ascended to a purer

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.240 align:middle line:84%
or perfected realm beyond
this one out of which they

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.790 align:middle line:90%
and we emerge.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.970 align:middle line:10%
There are many names
for this purer realm--

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.520 align:middle line:10%
the pure land, the
field or dimension

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.320 align:middle line:10%
of the blessed, Aton,
Sion, and the real world

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.150 align:middle line:10%
are a few of them.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.030 align:middle line:84%
And there have been many
representatives or avatars

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.020 align:middle line:90%
from the real world.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.570 align:middle line:84%
Melchizedek, Amitabha Buddha,
Akhenaten, and Krishna

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.970 align:middle line:90%
are examples.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.630 align:middle line:84%
In the Gnostic tradition,
Christ is the perfect one

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.270 align:middle line:90%
who answered the call.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:84%
He incarnated in
human form, or walked

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
on the water of the human
body, which is over 70% water,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.080 align:middle line:84%
and entered human
consciousness to remind us

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.950 align:middle line:84%
of our robe of light and
to lead us on our return

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.520 align:middle line:90%
to the illumined realm.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:10%
Today, ascension seekers
have a new scientific way

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.580 align:middle line:10%
of explaining how the avatar is
contacted, the robe remembered,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.040 align:middle line:10%
and the journey home is made--

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.260 align:middle line:10%
quantum entanglement
and wormholes.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.530 align:middle line:84%
Quantum entanglement
tells us our ascension

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.920 align:middle line:84%
is far easier than we may
have previously imagined.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Entanglement occurs when
one set of quantum objects,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
such as photons or
particles of light,

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.470 align:middle line:90%
form at the same instant.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.980 align:middle line:84%
They share the same
existence, and information

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.370 align:middle line:84%
passes to entangled
particles instantly.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.410 align:middle line:90%
This is because they are one.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.930 align:middle line:84%
They are connected
to one another

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.630 align:middle line:84%
so that even if they are
separated by large distances,

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.000 align:middle line:84%
an action performed on one will
instantly and automatically

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.720 align:middle line:90%
affect the other.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.640 align:middle line:84%
Until a measurement is made
of one of the particles,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.810 align:middle line:84%
its state is undetermined,
say physicists.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.570 align:middle line:84%
It can be either A, a
wave, or B, a particle.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.520 align:middle line:84%
It can be regarded as being
in both states A and B

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.740 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously, and this
is known as superposition.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.380 align:middle line:84%
But if the particles
are entangled,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.350 align:middle line:84%
then this measurement
also determines the state

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.580 align:middle line:90%
of the other particle--

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.290 align:middle line:84%
again, even if they have become
separated by vast distance.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.120 align:middle line:84%
In an early
experiment, physicists

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.440 align:middle line:84%
entangled two diamonds
separated by 15 centimeters,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.140 align:middle line:84%
proving the concept
of quantum coupling.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.260 align:middle line:84%
The effect of the measurement
is transmitted instantaneously

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.980 align:middle line:90%
to the other particle.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.630 align:middle line:10%
And the act of measuring
collapses the superposition

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.570 align:middle line:10%
into just one of
the possible states.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.930 align:middle line:84%
Because of this weird
state of entanglement,

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:84%
quantum physicists
have proven information

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.480 align:middle line:84%
can be transferred
or transmitted,

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.890 align:middle line:84%
downloaded or channeled from
one to another instantly

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and without interruption
or interception.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.200 align:middle line:84%
The second entity,
another photon,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.460 align:middle line:84%
takes on the identity
of the first.

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:10%
Even more remarkable
is the possibility

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.670 align:middle line:10%
that two entangled subatomic
particles are themselves

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.290 align:middle line:10%
somehow connected by a
sort of quantum wormhole.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:84%
This would allow instantaneous
tunneling through space.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Entanglement is so complex that
nobody quite understands it,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.680 align:middle line:84%
suggesting that
it's beyond human.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.280 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Einstein thought
this phenomena was so spooky,

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.070 align:middle line:84%
as he termed it, that there
was no way it could be valid.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.000 align:middle line:84%
However, the quantum
entanglement revolution

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.240 align:middle line:90%
has only just begun.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.490 align:middle line:84%
Physicists believe
entanglement will

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.780 align:middle line:84%
lead to new quantum computers
so advanced and powerful,

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.380 align:middle line:84%
meaning completely
out of human control.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.200 align:middle line:84%
Why they would want to do this
when artificial intelligence is

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.160 align:middle line:84%
already beyond our control
is another question.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.700 align:middle line:10%
The implications of what
our further understanding

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.040 align:middle line:10%
of quantum
entanglement will bring

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.370 align:middle line:10%
are perhaps beyond our
present comprehension,

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.650 align:middle line:10%
and we're not even
at the furthest edge

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.140 align:middle line:10%
of the beginning of what is
possible in this revolution.

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.360 align:middle line:84%
It's becoming more
and more evident

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.860 align:middle line:84%
that we must morph or
transform into a higher

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.770 align:middle line:84%
phase of consciousness in order
to really get what is to come.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.310 align:middle line:84%
I call this tapping our
ascension intelligence.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.460 align:middle line:84%
We must begin to
think like the angels.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.480 align:middle line:84%
And as we have seen, one of
the capabilities of angels

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.270 align:middle line:90%
is beaming.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.850 align:middle line:84%
Teleportation and
beaming, as in beam me up,

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Scotty, are on the
what's next list

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.050 align:middle line:90%
in the entanglement revolution.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.010 align:middle line:84%
We've already teleported
bits of light over 300 miles

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.570 align:middle line:90%
into space.

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.700 align:middle line:84%
We're smashing
records for distances

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.330 align:middle line:90%
beamed on a yearly basis.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.570 align:middle line:10%
In theory, there are
no limits to how far

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.850 align:middle line:10%
we can beam information,
because distance is irrelevant.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.930 align:middle line:90%
Information is not moving.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.900 align:middle line:90%
It's being shared instantly.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.320 align:middle line:90%
Larger objects are next.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.490 align:middle line:84%
But since our human body
is bits of light, photons,

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:08.400 align:middle line:84%
it won't be long before
human particle teleportation

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.900 align:middle line:90%
or beaming is possible.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.410 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.050 align:middle line:90%
Well, maybe not.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.450 align:middle line:84%
The jury is not in,
so we just don't know,

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.570 align:middle line:84%
says physicist Dr. Kip
Thorne, a leading authority

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.850 align:middle line:90%
on black holes and wormholes.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:22.800 align:middle line:84%
But there are very
strong indications,

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.040 align:middle line:84%
he says, that wormholes that
a human could travel through

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.770 align:middle line:84%
are actually forbidden
by the laws of physics.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.030 align:middle line:90%
That's sad, he says.

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And that's unfortunate,
but that's the direction

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.890 align:middle line:90%
in which things are pointing.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.810 align:middle line:90%
I agree with Dr. Thorne.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.410 align:middle line:84%
And in my view, so would the
Essenes, Gnostics, Cathars,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.690 align:middle line:84%
and Jesus, and the
ascension keepers

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.790 align:middle line:84%
who taught that our
flesh-and-blood bodies will not

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:52.745 align:middle line:84%
beam, but our perfected
light body will.

00:07:52.745 --> 00:07:57.370 align:middle line:84%
In First Corinthians 15:50,
Paul says so directly.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:01.210 align:middle line:10%
"Flesh and blood cannot
inherit the Kingdom of God,

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.970 align:middle line:10%
nor does the perishable
inherit the imperishable."

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.840 align:middle line:84%
First Corinthians 15:51
then drops the quantum dime,

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.300 align:middle line:84%
saying, "Listen, I
tell you a mystery.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.300 align:middle line:84%
We will not all
sleep, but we will all

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:19.080 align:middle line:84%
be changed in an instant
in the twinkling of an eye

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.320 align:middle line:84%
at the last trumpet, for
the trumpet will sound,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.020 align:middle line:84%
and the dead will be
raised imperishable,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.750 align:middle line:90%
and we will be changed."

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Yes, we will be changed
in order to beam.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.830 align:middle line:10%
In entanglement terms,
our state of being

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.580 align:middle line:10%
will flip from superposition,
human position,

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.610 align:middle line:10%
to Christ position.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.670 align:middle line:10%
Then we can inherit
the Kingdom of God,

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.940 align:middle line:10%
flying the entangled
wormholes of the starry sky's

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:49.760 align:middle line:10%
eternal vastness.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:90%


00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.060 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Gnostics, in order

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.800 align:middle line:84%
to beam through all that is,
we need a chariot to ride upon,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:01.810 align:middle line:84%
a heavenly throne,
sometimes called

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.270 align:middle line:90%
a cloud or a Merkabah throne.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.330 align:middle line:84%
And we need to
change our position

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.720 align:middle line:84%
into a beaming garment, as it
was called in ancient Persia.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:90%
Remember?

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.520 align:middle line:84%
Then we can ride upon
the celestial chariot

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.190 align:middle line:90%
and sail through the wormholes.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.530 align:middle line:84%
It must have been
an amazing morning

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:24.460 align:middle line:84%
when Jesus told Mary Magdalene
the secret of immortality.

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.770 align:middle line:84%
He would also utter it
to a rich man who asked

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.650 align:middle line:90%
the secret of eternal life.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.580 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus told him it
was easier for a camel

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.955 align:middle line:84%
to go through the
eye of a needle

00:09:31.955 --> 00:09:34.750 align:middle line:84%
than for a rich man to
enter the Kingdom of God.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:37.240 align:middle line:84%
He tells him that if
he is to be perfect,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.330 align:middle line:84%
meaning whole, holy,
complete, and compassionate,

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:42.640 align:middle line:84%
to go and let go
of what he's got.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.280 align:middle line:84%
And then he could
come and follow Jesus

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:48.510 align:middle line:90%
into the real world.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.480 align:middle line:84%
Decoding Jesus's
ascension allegory,

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.710 align:middle line:84%
the camel is the cargo
we all carry, our body.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.740 align:middle line:84%
The eye of the needle is the
gate, the quantum wormhole

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.110 align:middle line:90%
to the real world.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.860 align:middle line:84%
And Jesus is affirming that
the flesh-and-blood body isn't

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:11.120 align:middle line:84%
going through the wormhole, but
our perfect light body will.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:16.720 align:middle line:84%
And for this journey, we
must weave our robe of glory.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.630 align:middle line:84%
During the transfiguration,
Jesus's flesh

00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.270 align:middle line:90%
momentarily turned to light.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:84%
The photons of his body
shown in a way he previously

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:28.150 align:middle line:90%
did not show them.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.280 align:middle line:90%
A bright cloud covered him.

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.840 align:middle line:90%
He was in the eye of the needle.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Jesus's teaching to love
our neighbor as ourself

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:41.540 align:middle line:84%
epitomizes quantum
entanglement and is the secret

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.360 align:middle line:90%
to weaving a garment of light.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.150 align:middle line:84%
Weaving, by the way,
is the key term.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.990 align:middle line:84%
We've mentioned
it several times,

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.830 align:middle line:84%
especially in reference
to the divine feminine.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:10%
Mary wove the veil of the
Temple of Solomon, for example.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.510 align:middle line:84%
We are implored to love
our neighbor as ourself

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:06.210 align:middle line:84%
because we are entangled or
interwoven with our neighbor.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.070 align:middle line:90%
We are one.

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:84%
We were created
at the same moment

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.890 align:middle line:90%
and are eternally entangled.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:18.090 align:middle line:10%
The illusion of
separateness is just that.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:21.420 align:middle line:84%
Meeting a stranger is like
meeting a lost part of yourself

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.310 align:middle line:90%
all over again.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Harming a stranger
brings harm to oneself.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.550 align:middle line:10%
That's called the golden
rule of entanglement.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.560 align:middle line:10%
The science of
quantum entanglement,

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.750 align:middle line:10%
or the idea that
two subjects are

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:40.550 align:middle line:10%
two halves of one object in
mystic and eternal union,

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.700 align:middle line:10%
is the basis of the
ascension spirituality

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.540 align:middle line:10%
or the ascension intelligence
of the avatars of light,

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:52.670 align:middle line:10%
the perfect light humans, and is
the basis for their technology

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.130 align:middle line:10%
of spiritual beaming.

00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.930 align:middle line:84%
In addition to
interpreting the robe

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of
quantum principles,

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.630 align:middle line:84%
my unique contribution
to this disclosure

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:07.430 align:middle line:84%
is the discovery that the
symbol for quantum entanglement,

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:10.910 align:middle line:84%
the symbol for the Holy Trinity,
and the symbol for the wheel

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:15.260 align:middle line:84%
of joy symbolizing the Tibetan
concept of human perfection

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:20.510 align:middle line:84%
or of a beaming light body
are the exact same symbol.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.500 align:middle line:84%
The three concepts
are, well, entangled.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.110 align:middle line:84%
And by making this
connection, we

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:33.400 align:middle line:84%
are able to entangle ourselves
with the angels and avatars.

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.660 align:middle line:84%
Known as the Borromean rings
after an aristocratic Italian

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.770 align:middle line:84%
family with ties to the de
Medicis and to Michelangelo,

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.100 align:middle line:84%
the modern entanglement
symbol depicts

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.160 align:middle line:90%
three rings linked together.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.210 align:middle line:84%
If any ring were removed,
they would all come apart.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.420 align:middle line:84%
But together, they can
achieve higher states

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:58.810 align:middle line:90%
than are possible individually.

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:84%
The Borromean me and
rings of entanglement

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:84%
are or is the logo
of the de Medici.

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:09.100 align:middle line:84%
As we noted,
Botticelli painted it

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.730 align:middle line:84%
on the transparent
robe of light of Athena

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:16.750 align:middle line:84%
because it symbolized the
ascension teaching recovered

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:19.330 align:middle line:90%
by the de Medici.

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:10%
What I'm suggesting to you is
that this ascension teaching

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.910 align:middle line:10%
was brought to Earth
by beings whose

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:28.060 align:middle line:10%
basic fundamental
intelligence rested

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.550 align:middle line:10%
on the principles of
quantum entanglement

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:36.333 align:middle line:10%
that we are now discovering
or rediscovering today.

00:13:36.333 --> 00:13:38.250 align:middle line:84%
In addition to being a
symbol for the strength

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.890 align:middle line:84%
and power of unity,
the Borromean rings

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:44.180 align:middle line:84%
can also represent the
karmic laws of the universe

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.520 align:middle line:84%
and the interconnectedness
of all life.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.320 align:middle line:84%
Just like the
butterfly effect, where

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:84%
everything is interconnected
and small causes

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.620 align:middle line:84%
can have big effects, one
should expect a reaction out

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.540 align:middle line:90%
of every action made.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.950 align:middle line:90%
That's the golden rule again.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:84%
But here's the thing, says
"MIT Technology Review."

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.770 align:middle line:84%
The Borromean bonds that emerged
from the topology of quantum

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:13.050 align:middle line:84%
mechanics are
entirely unworldly.

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.530 align:middle line:10%
While ordinary matter, the
stuff you wrap your knuckles on,

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.630 align:middle line:10%
is clearly confined
to three dimensions,

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.750 align:middle line:10%
the mathematics of
quantum mechanics

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:26.790 align:middle line:10%
exists in entirely different
sets of dimensions.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And it's in this space that
the Borromean rings come from.

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.770 align:middle line:84%
The result is a kind
of parallel physics,

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:36.480 align:middle line:84%
in which the laws
governing behavior

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.730 align:middle line:84%
in this parallel universe exert
an inescapable ghostly grip

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.800 align:middle line:90%
on our own universe.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.180 align:middle line:84%
This is exactly what the
Gnostics described in relation

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:51.060 align:middle line:84%
to the pure land
or the real world.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:54.930 align:middle line:84%
It exerts an influence
on our universe.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:57.090 align:middle line:10%
And they suggest,
these texts do,

00:14:57.090 --> 00:14:59.670 align:middle line:10%
that the angels and
extraterrestrials

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:01.230 align:middle line:10%
that they describe
in these texts

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:04.770 align:middle line:10%
come from other dimensions.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:08.820 align:middle line:84%
So it makes perfect sense
that the Borromean rings

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.970 align:middle line:84%
would come to symbolize
the state of being

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.395 align:middle line:90%
of these otherworldly beings.

00:15:13.395 --> 00:15:16.780 align:middle line:90%


00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.060 align:middle line:10%
It's well known that
the Borromean rings have

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:10%
an ancient history,
including how they symbolize

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:25.360 align:middle line:10%
the foundational
message of Christianity,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.670 align:middle line:10%
the trinity, and
the quantum idea

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:33.250 align:middle line:10%
that Christ is both God
and man simultaneously.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.830 align:middle line:84%
Mostly unknown is
that a variation

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.780 align:middle line:84%
of these mystical
rings is also found

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.930 align:middle line:84%
in the Tibetan wheel of
joy, which symbolizes

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:44.320 align:middle line:84%
a state of being called the
great perfection, in which

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.270 align:middle line:84%
the soul dissolves
the human body

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.420 align:middle line:84%
into its essential essence,
symbolized by wearing

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:52.300 align:middle line:84%
a robe of beaming
rainbow-colored light,

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.360 align:middle line:84%
and can then beam
throughout the cosmos.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.200 align:middle line:10%
And as we have discussed,
the rainbow light body

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.810 align:middle line:10%
and the born-again
body of Christianity

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.500 align:middle line:10%
are actually the
same state of being.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.930 align:middle line:84%
This is the state of
being that enables

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.390 align:middle line:84%
us to enter the
Kingdom of God, which

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:15.330 align:middle line:84%
from a quantum perspective
is a higher dimension.

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.990 align:middle line:84%
So what's different about
my or our study together

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.790 align:middle line:84%
is that we will begin
with the premise

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:23.820 align:middle line:84%
that the reason why the
symbol of the Borromean rings

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.790 align:middle line:84%
often accompanies tails of
the robe of light, the beaming

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:29.520 align:middle line:84%
garment, in beaming
to the invisible world

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.100 align:middle line:84%
of other dimensions
is because it's

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.890 align:middle line:84%
the logo of the
perfect light humans

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.890 align:middle line:90%
who brought this teaching here.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:39.780 align:middle line:10%
More, it suggests
that the purpose

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.440 align:middle line:10%
of quantum science or
certainly its next step

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.440 align:middle line:10%
is to show us how to wear the
beaming garment of the avatars

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:10%
and angels.

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:54.050 align:middle line:84%
Tibetans teach that just
seeing an image of the guru

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:57.140 align:middle line:84%
Padmasambhava in his
rainbow light body

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.380 align:middle line:90%
has an effect on our own.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:04.400 align:middle line:84%
The guru can transmit
or download to us

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.140 align:middle line:84%
the vibration of
the rainbow light

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.569 align:middle line:84%
body without being
physically present,

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:13.970 align:middle line:84%
because he is actually
present in the image.

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:84%
Because we are
entangled with the guru,

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.950 align:middle line:84%
we can access his
state of mind and state

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:27.650 align:middle line:84%
of being instantaneously
and become it.

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.010 align:middle line:84%
That's what quantum
entanglement says.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:35.360 align:middle line:84%
In my view, by following the
Borromean throughout history,

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.960 align:middle line:84%
we're following the path of
the perfect light humans.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.690 align:middle line:84%
We are receiving the
teachings for not only

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.290 align:middle line:84%
how to beam ourselves to the
pure place from which we came

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.350 align:middle line:84%
but also to dramatically
transform earth

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:52.340 align:middle line:84%
by developing incredible new
technologies and by beaming

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.170 align:middle line:90%
while we're still here.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Beamers use the power
of light and love

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:59.390 align:middle line:84%
to illuminate and
transform the dark material

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:03.770 align:middle line:84%
world, the real world, and
our bodies into its flip side.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.900 align:middle line:84%
Their goal, as the
Essenes stated,

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.910 align:middle line:84%
is to resurrect our world from
the dead to the living world.

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Their actions are
called miracles

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:18.020 align:middle line:84%
when the angels and avatars
perform their actions.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:22.580 align:middle line:84%
In reality, they're using
quantum entanglement.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.490 align:middle line:84%
If we wish to escape
from the material world

00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:28.838 align:middle line:84%
and ascend to the spiritual
world, the real world,

00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:30.380 align:middle line:84%
then we have to tap
the consciousness

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.150 align:middle line:90%
of the ascended beings.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:34.730 align:middle line:84%
We have to tap their
ascension intelligence.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.540 align:middle line:84%
This can be called beamer
gnosis, to coin a phrase.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:43.490 align:middle line:10%
These radiant light beings
who are beaming beings, who

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.760 align:middle line:10%
bear the rings of this
gnosis, were at least

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.870 align:middle line:10%
as quantumly savvy as we
are today, probably more so,

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.230 align:middle line:10%
as demonstrated
by their actions.

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:56.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we're just
now catching up

00:18:56.650 --> 00:19:00.730 align:middle line:84%
with their basic level
of cosmic understanding,

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:05.610 align:middle line:84%
which they have already
transcended long ago.

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:84%
Catching up with them begins
with the understanding

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.460 align:middle line:90%
of our true nature.

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.070 align:middle line:10%
And so I always take
beginning beamers,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.290 align:middle line:10%
affectionately
called beamers, us

00:19:16.290 --> 00:19:19.500 align:middle line:10%
most humble souls on
the path of ascension,

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.080 align:middle line:10%
as well as advanced
ascension practitioners back

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.500 align:middle line:10%
to the story of the
caterpillar and the butterfly.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.200 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that we're all
living in a pupal phase

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.680 align:middle line:90%
in our human body.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.480 align:middle line:90%
We're pupils.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.890 align:middle line:90%
We're students.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:36.870 align:middle line:84%
But within us is an
ascended face, a next level,

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.960 align:middle line:90%
symbolized by the butterfly.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:42.150 align:middle line:10%
And the problem is, we're kind
of like that cartoon I saw once

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:10%
of the two caterpillars
looking at the butterfly--

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:47.010 align:middle line:10%
the rainbow body
being, for example--

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.430 align:middle line:10%
and another one flies by.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:53.280 align:middle line:84%
And they say, you'll never get
me up in one of those things.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.580 align:middle line:84%
I know-- the idea that we are
to leave behind our caterpillar

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.500 align:middle line:84%
face and morph, or face, or
transform into an ascended form

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:06.000 align:middle line:84%
to become a celestial traveler,
a cosmic being, a beamer,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.070 align:middle line:90%
is a reach for many.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:09.570 align:middle line:10%
But the reason is
because we haven't

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.880 align:middle line:10%
been taught to imagine it.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Our culture has
not allowed this,

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.050 align:middle line:84%
and maybe some
religious hierarchies

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.500 align:middle line:90%
have not allowed it either.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.780 align:middle line:84%
We don't have a
concept of what it

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.640 align:middle line:84%
means to transform into our next
level of evolution and ascend.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.000 align:middle line:84%
We're trained to identify with
our earthly selves, in part

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.370 align:middle line:84%
because we don't
know any better.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:10%
And when our next level
is presented, some of us

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:37.700 align:middle line:10%
reject it because we don't
have a concept of how

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:41.850 align:middle line:10%
they're related, or maybe
we fear the next step.

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:84%
However, something
astounding happens

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.990 align:middle line:84%
when we are introduced to
images of our future self.

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:51.750 align:middle line:84%
Our present self
becomes activated

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:56.400 align:middle line:84%
by the image because, again,
we're entangled with the guru,

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.240 align:middle line:84%
be it Padmasambhava, or
Christ, or any other deity.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Our future self
responds to the image

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:07.780 align:middle line:84%
because it instinctively
knows, this is the way forward.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:11.190 align:middle line:84%
So what does our
ascended self look like?

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, I've extensively
studied the art of ascension.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.500 align:middle line:84%
And for centuries, highly
skilled and Illumined artists

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.690 align:middle line:84%
have been showing
us visualizations

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.000 align:middle line:90%
of our ascended selves.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.060 align:middle line:84%
And artists almost always
show the ascended human

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.860 align:middle line:90%
the same way.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.380 align:middle line:84%
It's a humanoid
form, a light being,

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.370 align:middle line:84%
a luminous, radiant being
often emitting rainbow light,

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:35.840 align:middle line:84%
often shown in a sphere,
a sphere of light.

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And that sphere
indicates a portal,

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.740 align:middle line:84%
a point that is a
face-on view of a pillar,

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.100 align:middle line:84%
in fact, an ascension
pillar, vertical pillar.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.130 align:middle line:84%
It indicates an ascension body
of some kind that ultimately

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.100 align:middle line:84%
manifests from
within our own body,

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.110 align:middle line:84%
like a caterpillar
morphing into a butterfly.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:56.460 align:middle line:84%
The being in the sphere
of light is our true self.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:22:01.370 align:middle line:84%
The images are a face-to-face
meeting with who we truly are.

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:06.010 align:middle line:84%
This ascension image is
Egyptian Christian, or Coptic,

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.050 align:middle line:84%
is from the fourth
century in Egypt.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Jesus wears the beaming garment
as he rides on his cloud

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.960 align:middle line:90%
vehicle, his throne.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:10%
Imagine light emitting from
every point on your body's

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.970 align:middle line:10%
surface, expanding
in all directions,

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:23.110 align:middle line:10%
radiating out and touching,
transforming everything

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.220 align:middle line:10%
it comes into contact
with, raising it

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:27.560 align:middle line:10%
to a higher level of existence.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is the beamer's
most important goal of all.

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.485 align:middle line:90%
Ascension is a state of being.

00:22:32.485 --> 00:22:34.760 align:middle line:90%
It's a state of awareness.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:39.110 align:middle line:84%
The illusion is that we actually
go somewhere when we ascend.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:40.790 align:middle line:84%
The truth is, is
that we simply change

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:43.250 align:middle line:90%
our awareness of who we are.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:90%
We change our quantum position.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.700 align:middle line:84%
And we begin to identify
with our pure self

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:51.660 align:middle line:90%
and the real world.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:56.550 align:middle line:84%
If we change the images we
are feeding our imagination,

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.610 align:middle line:84%
we will change the
awareness of who we are.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.710 align:middle line:84%
If we identify with
the caterpillar,

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:03.960 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get
more caterpillar.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.940 align:middle line:84%
If we identify
with the butterfly,

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.340 align:middle line:84%
we're going to get
more butterfly.

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.630 align:middle line:90%
That's the quantum principle.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:13.860 align:middle line:84%
It all depends on what
we look for in ourselves.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.680 align:middle line:84%
Or as St. Francis of
Assisi said, what you are

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.670 align:middle line:90%
looking for is what is looking.

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Quantum physicists call
this the observer effect.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:28.380 align:middle line:84%
The act of observation changes
the outcome of an experiment.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:33.390 align:middle line:84%
By observing something, in
quantum speak, we change it.

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.450 align:middle line:84%
We can scale up this
awareness to our higher self.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.440 align:middle line:84%
The act of observing ourself,
especially our higher self,

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.190 align:middle line:84%
or gaining awareness
of it through images

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
causes changes in
our Earthly lives.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.280 align:middle line:84%
In quantum gnosis,
as I've noted,

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.030 align:middle line:84%
we are entangled with
Christ or other avatars.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:58.700 align:middle line:84%
At least that's what the Gnostic
robe of glory says, anyway.

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:00.590 align:middle line:84%
The quantum premise
of the robe of glory

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:03.980 align:middle line:84%
is that you have a cosmic
twin, a larger divine

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:07.490 align:middle line:84%
spark, a photon, to whom
you have been intimately

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:11.390 align:middle line:90%
connected or entangled forever.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.970 align:middle line:90%
That twin is your true self.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.610 align:middle line:84%
No matter what happens
to one, you instantly

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.770 align:middle line:90%
mirror each other.

00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.200 align:middle line:10%
You are entangled
in a union that

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.200 align:middle line:10%
is so mystical that Einstein,
in awe, described it as spooky.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.180 align:middle line:84%
Gnostic and
alchemical traditions

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:33.760 align:middle line:84%
say our true self is
something beyond our body.

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.900 align:middle line:10%
In fact, this something
within us manifests our body

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.900 align:middle line:10%
and provides life
force for that body.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.120 align:middle line:84%
And when people say we are
spiritual beings having

00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.380 align:middle line:84%
a human experience, they are
referring to this something.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.415 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostics called
it the divine spark,

00:24:50.415 --> 00:24:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and there's
something of which we

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.450 align:middle line:84%
speak as a particle of
light, a photon, that

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:59.800 align:middle line:84%
is viewed as a star seed
crystal of creation.

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.880 align:middle line:84%
This term is more than New
Agey, or poetic, or symbolic.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.960 align:middle line:10%
Like the word light, it stands
for something in and of itself,

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.120 align:middle line:10%
as when God said
let there be light

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.880 align:middle line:10%
at the opening of the creation
and when Jesus proclaimed

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.780 align:middle line:10%
I am the light of the world.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:20.470 align:middle line:84%
Our divine spark is a
fractal of a greater soul.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:23.210 align:middle line:84%
If you think of God as an
ocean of love or light,

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:27.430 align:middle line:84%
this fractal-like star
seed crystal is a drop.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.560 align:middle line:84%
If you think of God
as light, this seed

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.430 align:middle line:84%
is a ray, a beam, or
particle of light.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.640 align:middle line:84%
This wave-particle duality
of the greater soul

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:40.840 align:middle line:84%
and the divine spark is mirrored
in photons, particles of light,

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.660 align:middle line:84%
which also possess these
two different properties

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:46.670 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.900 align:middle line:84%
So imagine your divine
spark as a photon.

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.810 align:middle line:84%
You're a tiny blip of energy
hurtling through the universe

00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.380 align:middle line:90%
on your own.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:57.440 align:middle line:84%
But you have a
twin, another photon

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.630 align:middle line:84%
to whom you have been
intimately connected

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.290 align:middle line:90%
since the day you were born.

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:04.520 align:middle line:84%
And no matter what
distance separates you,

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.470 align:middle line:90%
you mirror each other.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.110 align:middle line:10%
Whatever happens to your
twin instantaneously

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:12.450 align:middle line:10%
affects you, and vise versa.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.200 align:middle line:90%
So what shape are photons?

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.250 align:middle line:84%
In 2016, physicists created
a hologram of a single light

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.760 align:middle line:84%
particle, a feat previously
thought impossible due

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.650 align:middle line:84%
to the fundamental
laws of physics.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:28.730 align:middle line:84%
But they performed
this miraculous feat.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.360 align:middle line:84%
They created a hologram
of a single light photon.

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.800 align:middle line:90%
What does it look like?

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's shaped like a Maltese
or Knights Templar solar cross

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.430 align:middle line:90%
or the cross of Christ.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.890 align:middle line:10%
That's right-- a
single photon looks

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:45.140 align:middle line:10%
like a cross of light,
the symbol of Christ's

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.580 align:middle line:10%
resurrection.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:49.460 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it's the same
symbol seen on Christ's heart

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.047 align:middle line:90%
in this Coptic ascension image.

00:26:53.047 --> 00:26:55.130 align:middle line:10%
Should we be surprised
that the light of the world

00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:59.540 align:middle line:10%
is simultaneously thought of as
a man, a particle, and a god,

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.060 align:middle line:10%
or a wave?

00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:04.970 align:middle line:10%
In 2015, physicists took
the first-ever photo

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:08.090 align:middle line:10%
of light behaving both
as a wave and a particle.

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:10.250 align:middle line:10%
The researchers created
a standing wave of light

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:14.000 align:middle line:10%
after blasting a metal
wire with UV light.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.160 align:middle line:84%
They then shot
electrons at the wave,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.130 align:middle line:84%
trying to disturb
individual photons.

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:20.870 align:middle line:84%
When the two
particles interacted,

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:22.430 align:middle line:84%
the change in energy
made the photons

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.253 align:middle line:84%
slow down or speed up, depending
on how the connection occurred.

00:27:26.253 --> 00:27:27.920 align:middle line:84%
The interaction was
then able to be seen

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.560 align:middle line:90%
with a high-powered microscope.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.710 align:middle line:84%
Each photon is a segment
one wavelength long,

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.600 align:middle line:84%
and the entire wave
is a succession

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.210 align:middle line:90%
of distinct particles.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.160 align:middle line:84%
Because the wave is
really a succession

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.320 align:middle line:84%
of distinct particles,
the researchers

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.360 align:middle line:84%
were able to view
the standing wave,

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.400 align:middle line:84%
and the photons
that were disturbed

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:48.860 align:middle line:90%
were still seen as individuals.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Thus, witnessing light's
wave-particle duality

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.280 align:middle line:84%
became possible
for the first time.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And once the photons
were disturbed,

00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.050 align:middle line:84%
the researchers were then
able to imagine or image

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.420 align:middle line:90%
the quantum change in energy.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.140 align:middle line:84%
In my view, we can scale
this story up from photons

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:08.990 align:middle line:84%
to the metaphysical battle
between light and dark, matter

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.570 align:middle line:84%
and spirit, love and
fear, male and female

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:15.260 align:middle line:84%
that takes place in our thoughts
every moment we are alive.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.880 align:middle line:90%
They too are not distinct.

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.070 align:middle line:90%
They are the selfsame thing.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.820 align:middle line:84%
Light and dark are actually
light dark or light dark.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:29.450 align:middle line:84%
We are all hue, meaning
god, men, and female too.

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.160 align:middle line:84%
Complementarity
is the name given

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.620 align:middle line:84%
by Niels Bohr for the dualistic
nature of quantum entities,

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:38.660 align:middle line:84%
including, I'm suggesting,
our divine sparkicle,

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.310 align:middle line:90%
to coin a term.

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.000 align:middle line:90%
It's both a spark and a wave.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.340 align:middle line:84%
Quantum gnosis tells us that
good and evil are actually

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.930 align:middle line:90%
flip sides of the same thing.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.380 align:middle line:84%
And the reason why there's
evil in the world or God

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:56.720 align:middle line:84%
allows evil things to happen
is because all is God,

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.770 align:middle line:84%
or whatever you choose to
call the unity of all that is.

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Turning our awareness towards
visualizing this divine spark,

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.980 align:middle line:84%
or sparkicle, this wave
particle within us,

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.530 align:middle line:84%
has been the starting place
for converging with and tapping

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.660 align:middle line:90%
its powers and ascending.

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And one way to connect with this
pure self in the real world,

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.160 align:middle line:84%
as I've said, is
through sacred art,

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.560 align:middle line:84%
especially the sacred
art portraying ascension.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.920 align:middle line:84%
My work is based on the
neuroscientific hypothesis

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.890 align:middle line:84%
that images of divine
beings can awaken

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.610 align:middle line:84%
and even program
our higher self.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:34.870 align:middle line:84%
As the Gnostics taught, the
image will show us the way.

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:39.790 align:middle line:10%
We can become one with the
avatar of light via the image.

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:42.700 align:middle line:84%
Quantum entanglement
answers the question

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.880 align:middle line:90%
of how this is possible.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So here's the yellow
brick road that we took

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.210 align:middle line:90%
that led to this hypothesis.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:55.500 align:middle line:84%
High atop my list of the most
astounding ascension works

00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:57.810 align:middle line:84%
is the welcoming
descent paintings

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:01.590 align:middle line:84%
of Amitabha Buddha, the
Buddha of eternal life,

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.140 align:middle line:90%
such as this one.

00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:07.440 align:middle line:84%
The Amitabha Buddha, the
Buddha of infinite light,

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.830 align:middle line:84%
emerges in this painting
from the pure land.

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.530 align:middle line:84%
And here's what the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York City

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:18.060 align:middle line:84%
says about their fine
example of this style of art.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:19.980 align:middle line:10%
Like many of the
works of art created

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.500 align:middle line:10%
to represent the pure
land belief in salvation

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.220 align:middle line:10%
through faith, raigo, or
welcoming descent paintings

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.980 align:middle line:10%
like this one, were
indispensable religious

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.410 align:middle line:10%
paintings at the time of death.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.020 align:middle line:84%
Such paintings depict
the scene in which

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.930 align:middle line:84%
the Amitabha Buddha
and his attendants

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:39.810 align:middle line:84%
descend from heaven to
take the believer back

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:43.810 align:middle line:84%
to the western paradise
on a Lotus throne.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:47.440 align:middle line:84%
The scrolls were often hung
by the bedside of the dying

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.757 align:middle line:84%
to ensure the prospect
of rebirth in paradise.

00:30:50.757 --> 00:30:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Since traditionally the
dying lay with their heads

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:54.910 align:middle line:84%
to the north and their
faces turned west,

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.490 align:middle line:84%
these paintings usually depict
the Buddha and his entourage

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.980 align:middle line:84%
coming from the upper left
down to the lower right

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.230 align:middle line:84%
so as to meet the
gaze of the dying.

00:31:02.230 --> 00:31:08.620 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes silken cords were
attached to Buddha's hand,

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:84%
offering the dying physical
assistance during the journey

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.660 align:middle line:90%
to paradise.

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.620 align:middle line:90%
Think about this.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:21.120 align:middle line:10%
Think about the implications
of this description.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.990 align:middle line:84%
It is saying the
painting itself is

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:28.440 align:middle line:84%
a portal through which the
Buddha of infinite light

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:32.460 align:middle line:84%
can manifest, can descend
from the heavenly realm.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.770 align:middle line:10%
What kind of a
universe do we live

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:40.770 align:middle line:10%
in when a painting can become
a gateway to the divine realm?

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:43.590 align:middle line:10%
The answer is a quantum one.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:47.730 align:middle line:84%
The Amitabha Buddha rides on
a cloud into our consciousness

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:51.270 align:middle line:90%
just like Jesus rides a cloud.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:55.830 align:middle line:90%
He is present via the painting.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.140 align:middle line:84%
After all, what is a painting
but a perfect example

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:00.780 align:middle line:84%
of quantum
wave-particle duality.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.630 align:middle line:84%
It's a collection of particles
of paint splashed on a canvas

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.150 align:middle line:90%
that converge and emit waves.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:09.120 align:middle line:84%
Each dot is a quantum
entity flashing in and out

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.660 align:middle line:90%
of existence.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.270 align:middle line:84%
These dots are
constantly changing

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:15.690 align:middle line:84%
from producing waves of
light, refreshing from moment

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:18.180 align:middle line:84%
to moment at the quantum
level, converging from moment

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.660 align:middle line:90%
to moment in our imagination.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:26.250 align:middle line:84%
When you discover and observe
a painting, you are part of it,

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:90%
one with it.

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.630 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is because
you're creating it.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:33.930 align:middle line:84%
Like the universe, the
image is a magic mirror.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.030 align:middle line:84%
The waves and particles
that leap from the image

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:38.290 align:middle line:90%
unite in your imagination.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.500 align:middle line:84%
And there's no distinction
between the viewer

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:43.050 align:middle line:90%
and the subject of the image.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:47.490 align:middle line:84%
The observer and the
observed become one.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:51.300 align:middle line:84%
In this way, viewing a
welcoming descent painting

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:52.860 align:middle line:90%
is a cosmic convergence.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:55.960 align:middle line:90%


00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.480 align:middle line:84%
No matter where or
when a symbol appears,

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.060 align:middle line:90%
the meaning can be the same.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.950 align:middle line:84%
The wheel of joy
symbolizes the attainment

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.290 align:middle line:84%
of the great perfection
or our transformation

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:06.670 align:middle line:90%
into beings of light.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.800 align:middle line:84%
Its three blades
symbolize the three jewels

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.500 align:middle line:84%
of the chintamani that
produces the light body

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.770 align:middle line:84%
and the interconnectedness
or entangled state

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:16.720 align:middle line:84%
of the enlightened
Buddha, gnosis,

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.770 align:middle line:84%
in the community of
all ascension keepers.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:22.660 align:middle line:84%
As we noted and
showed, this symbol

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:24.550 align:middle line:90%
recurs throughout history.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:27.400 align:middle line:84%
And always, it is associated
with a higher order,

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.750 align:middle line:84%
another realm, a transcendent
realm beyond what we ordinarily

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.250 align:middle line:90%
see--

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:35.800 align:middle line:90%
the ascended realm.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.740 align:middle line:84%
This is what quantum
physics has discovered.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:41.950 align:middle line:84%
This is the space time where
our divine spark originates

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and seeks to return
in its ascension.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:48.610 align:middle line:84%
Will following this
symbol take us there?

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.890 align:middle line:84%
Will following this
symbol help us ascend?

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.690 align:middle line:90%


00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.510 align:middle line:10%
My hope in creating
this series is

00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:00.470 align:middle line:10%
to provide a sort of
a stairway for you.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.770 align:middle line:84%
Many of us today talk about
ascension, and some of us

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:06.980 align:middle line:84%
actually don't realize that
it has an ancient lineage.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:10.127 align:middle line:84%
It had a beginning
long, long ago.

00:34:10.127 --> 00:34:11.960 align:middle line:84%
And I hope that through
watching this series

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:16.940 align:middle line:84%
that we have provided a series
of steps, a solid platform,

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:20.540 align:middle line:84%
and that as we take a look
back at these ancient ascension

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.840 align:middle line:84%
keepers that perhaps you're
remembering something

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.920 align:middle line:84%
about yourself, maybe from
a past life, maybe something

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.440 align:middle line:84%
that you learned in the past
that you can now draw forward.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.370 align:middle line:90%


00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:37.580 align:middle line:84%
In presenting this, I'm creating
a stairway and a platform

00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:40.929 align:middle line:84%
but also the ideas, the
necessary qualities, people

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.060 align:middle line:84%
now you can connect
with, avatars

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:46.060 align:middle line:84%
from various traditions, and
can see that this is a very

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.340 align:middle line:90%
real and human phenomena.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:50.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, it is
the most human act

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.949 align:middle line:84%
that we can perhaps make
is to dedicate ourselves

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:58.150 align:middle line:84%
to our ascension, because
it is not a selfish act

because we recognize that when
we're on the path to ascension,

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.640 align:middle line:90%
