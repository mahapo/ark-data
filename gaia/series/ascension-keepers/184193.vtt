00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.865 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm William Henry, and
this is "Ascension Keepers."

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:25.790 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.310 align:middle line:10%
Just imagine if
suddenly, all you

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.460 align:middle line:10%
believed about higher
consciousness, ascension,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.070 align:middle line:10%
and your potential as a
spiritual being was ripped away

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.330 align:middle line:10%
from you and forbidden by the
decree of a king or a dictator.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.370 align:middle line:84%
Then you were exiled
to a foreign land

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.220 align:middle line:84%
and told that you could
never again see your home

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.250 align:middle line:84%
or practice your
wisdom tradition.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:84%
This happened to the
predecessors of the Essenes

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.330 align:middle line:84%
during the purge of
King Josiah in 586 BC

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.180 align:middle line:84%
and is a pivotal moment in
the timeline of the Ascension

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Keepers and in
our own ascension.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.810 align:middle line:84%
After this event, soul
groups, like the Essenes,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.090 align:middle line:84%
Gnostics and Cathars
were labeled heretics

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.880 align:middle line:84%
by orthodox or
mainstream religion.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.630 align:middle line:84%
In actuality, they were
more like reactionaries.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.470 align:middle line:84%
They weren't dissenters, as
the term heresy suggests.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.950 align:middle line:10%
They merely sought to retain
or recover the original wisdom

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:10%
tradition, which included
teachings about ascension,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.050 align:middle line:10%
brought to Earth by
celestial beings,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.860 align:middle line:10%
that the orthodox religions
replaced and labeled as heresy.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.010 align:middle line:84%
In this episode, we will reveal
the lost and secret history

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.760 align:middle line:84%
of this purge to see how this
became the motivating incident,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.750 align:middle line:84%
the necessary backstory for
the formation of the Essenes

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.090 align:middle line:84%
and how this impacts our
present day ascension program.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Our story begins with
the Temple of Solomon

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.140 align:middle line:84%
in Jerusalem, the ascension
site for Judaism, Christianity,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.810 align:middle line:90%
and Islam.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.530 align:middle line:10%
Originally built by King
Solomon at around 950 BC,

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.540 align:middle line:10%
this temple at the
center of the world

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.290 align:middle line:10%
was based on a plan given to
Solomon by his father, King

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.050 align:middle line:10%
David, by God.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.110 align:middle line:84%
David brought the Ark of
the Covenant to this site.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.690 align:middle line:84%
The temple was to be
the raised up place

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.570 align:middle line:84%
where the Ark would stay
and where the Old Testament

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.120 align:middle line:90%
God, Yaweh, dwelled.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.440 align:middle line:84%
It is said that Solomon built
the temple by magical means.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.070 align:middle line:84%
It sat on an artificial
hill or holy mountain,

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.100 align:middle line:84%
a gigantic, 37-acre
platform, actually,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.820 align:middle line:84%
called Moriah or
Zion, the city of God

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.110 align:middle line:90%
or the place that God loves.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And God is said to have named
it Jerusalem, a name that

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.260 align:middle line:90%
means to teach peace.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.650 align:middle line:84%
Moriah is called Even
haShetiya, the Foundation Stone.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.600 align:middle line:84%
According to Jewish
tradition, God

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.510 align:middle line:84%
began the creation
of the universe here.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Even up to the Middle
Ages, Jerusalem

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.760 align:middle line:84%
was shown on maps as
the center of the world.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.890 align:middle line:84%
The dust of Moriah is said to
have been used to create Adam.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.740 align:middle line:84%
And like all temples in
the ancient Near East,

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Solomon's Temple was the
architectural embodiment

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.730 align:middle line:84%
of the cosmic mountain
or the cosmic axis.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.660 align:middle line:84%
It may not be coincidental
that Moriah is phonetically

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.760 align:middle line:84%
similar to Meru, the cosmic
axis of Tibetan Buddhism

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.250 align:middle line:84%
and the route of Sumeru, where
the Tower of Babel was located.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.080 align:middle line:10%
The Essenes called the
Temple of Solomon, The Tower.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.010 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it was a link
between heaven and earth,

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.490 align:middle line:84%
with gods and divine
beings coming and going

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.990 align:middle line:84%
and humans ascending
from this place.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:84%
It was here that Abraham
met with Melchizedek,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.290 align:middle line:84%
a very powerful celestial
being, and where

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.470 align:middle line:84%
Jacob had his dream of
the ladder to heaven.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.250 align:middle line:84%
Melchizedek Muhammad
ascended from this place

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.840 align:middle line:84%
during the Mirage or Night
Journey around the year 621 AD.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.740 align:middle line:84%
Mohammed ascended into
heaven with the Angel Gabriel

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.680 align:middle line:84%
and met a different prophet
in each of the seven levels

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.380 align:middle line:84%
of heaven, first Adam, then
John the Baptist and Jesus,

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:84%
then Joseph, then Idris,
then Aaron, then Moses,

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.730 align:middle line:90%
and lastly, Abraham.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:84%
King Solomon himself was one
of the greatest magicians

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.920 align:middle line:90%
who ever lived.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.060 align:middle line:84%
He received wisdom
directly from God.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.380 align:middle line:84%
Legend claims that he used the
shamir, a worm or substance

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.220 align:middle line:84%
that had the power to cut
through or disintegrate stone,

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.290 align:middle line:90%
iron, and diamond.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.980 align:middle line:84%
Moses reputedly used
the shamir to engrave

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.350 align:middle line:84%
the priestly
breastplate stones that

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.830 align:middle line:84%
were inserted into the
breastplate of the Essen.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.500 align:middle line:84%
When the High Priest emerged
from the Holy of Holies

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.910 align:middle line:84%
of Solomon's Temple, and
sunlight hit the breastplate,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.050 align:middle line:84%
its multicolored stones
radiated rainbows.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Because the symbols of
the High Priest's outfit,

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.570 align:middle line:84%
the crown, the robe, the
Rod of Enlightenment,

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.150 align:middle line:84%
matched the crown, robe,
and resurrection stick

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.520 align:middle line:84%
of the Tibetan rainbow
light body tradition,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.250 align:middle line:84%
I have proposed it is
symbolic of the rainbow light

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.090 align:middle line:90%
body or perfect light body.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.690 align:middle line:84%
This connection is key to
understanding the goings

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.080 align:middle line:84%
on in the Holy of Holies
of Solomon's Temple

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.330 align:middle line:84%
and to what the Essenes were
doing at Qumran and elsewhere.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.170 align:middle line:84%
The name Moriah, the mount
upon which the temple sat,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.400 align:middle line:84%
actually comes from the root
raha, which means "to see."

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.770 align:middle line:84%
It was the place
where epiphanies

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.940 align:middle line:84%
from the Greek Epifania or
apparition or appearances

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.600 align:middle line:84%
or manifestations of
divine beings took place.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.770 align:middle line:84%
For over 300 years,
these manifestations

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.560 align:middle line:90%
took place inside this temple.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.680 align:middle line:90%
People saw God.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.380 align:middle line:84%
He or his throne was described
as luminous, radiating rainbow

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.610 align:middle line:90%
light.

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.940 align:middle line:84%
We will see this motif
returning again and again

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.550 align:middle line:90%
in our exploration.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.480 align:middle line:84%
This rainbow throne
is clearly mobile.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.570 align:middle line:84%
The depictions of thrones
on Sumerian and Babylonian

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.710 align:middle line:84%
cylinder seals became the basis
for Judeo-Christian images

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.510 align:middle line:84%
of God as a human on
a throne in the stars.

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And when that throne
landed, it did so

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle line:84%
in the Holy of Holies
of Solomon's temple.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:84%
These appearances
took place in the Holy

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.210 align:middle line:90%
of Holies of the temple.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.250 align:middle line:84%
A golden, cube-shaped room
with walls lined with gold

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.760 align:middle line:84%
and covered with
images of palm trees.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.280 align:middle line:84%
It was the Garden of
Eden or a recreation

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:90%
of the Garden of Eden.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.060 align:middle line:84%
The shiny golden walls
must have made it

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.330 align:middle line:90%
like being in a hall of mirrors.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.060 align:middle line:84%
In "Temple Mysticism,"
Dr. Margaret Barker

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:05.760 align:middle line:84%
describes it as a cube of
fire, alive with fiery beings.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.570 align:middle line:84%
The throne was flashing
fire within a fiery cloud,

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.390 align:middle line:84%
and from the fire came the
likeness of four living

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.860 align:middle line:90%
creatures.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel describes
the Holy of Holies.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Over this fire was a throne
with a human figure upon it,

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:90%
and he too was fiery.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:24.870 align:middle line:84%
This was the appearance
of the likeness

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.330 align:middle line:90%
of the glory of the Lord.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.090 align:middle line:84%
On his heavenly journey,
Enoch saw such fiery beings.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.110 align:middle line:84%
They were like flaming fire
and could take human form.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.050 align:middle line:84%
They took me to a
place in which those

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.780 align:middle line:84%
who were like flaming
fire, and when they wished,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.260 align:middle line:84%
they appeared as
men, said Enoch.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.530 align:middle line:84%
When the Temple of
Solomon was operational,

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.350 align:middle line:84%
human high priests would
enter the Holy of Holies

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.790 align:middle line:84%
by crossing over or
through a veil of stars.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.940 align:middle line:84%
This represented the
border between the human

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.160 align:middle line:90%
and the divine realms.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.980 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
Temple of Solomon

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.310 align:middle line:84%
was an intersection
between heaven and earth,

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:11.410 align:middle line:84%
where God or the angels
materialized or appeared.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:16.300 align:middle line:84%
Hence it was a place to be with
God and a source of salvation.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:21.250 align:middle line:84%
This veil was what the
Essenes termed the Raznahaya,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.830 align:middle line:84%
or the mystery of
existence or becoming,

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.220 align:middle line:84%
on which the wise
were to meditate.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.510 align:middle line:84%
This knowledge originated in
the temple's Holy of Holies

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:36.429 align:middle line:84%
and was revealed to those who
entered Heaven and ascended.

00:08:36.429 --> 00:08:40.059 align:middle line:84%
These people lived in harmony
and resonance with creation,

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:44.200 align:middle line:90%
and they lived with angels.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.130 align:middle line:84%
It's important to note the
meaning of the word Most Holy.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:51.250 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that
the cube-shaped room

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
and the objects
therein, including

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.790 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant, could
transmit holiness and make

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:02.380 align:middle line:84%
anyone and anything that came
into contact with this place

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.630 align:middle line:90%
holy.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.870 align:middle line:84%
This is why access to this
place was so important.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.860 align:middle line:84%
It was also a
place of ascension.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
Humans entering this
cube-shaped room

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:90%
ascended to the heavenly realms.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:22.240 align:middle line:84%
Clearly, we're talking about
this place as a stargate.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:26.890 align:middle line:10%
And it was in continuous
operation for over 300 years,

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:29.560 align:middle line:10%
until, in our
ascension timeline,

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.180 align:middle line:10%
two key events now
drive the story.

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:38.890 align:middle line:84%
One was the accession of
King Josiah, a boy king,

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:40.600 align:middle line:84%
who came to the
throne of Jerusalem

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.730 align:middle line:84%
in 640 BC and his purging
of the temple in 623 BC.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:48.790 align:middle line:10%
And the second event was
the Babylonian destruction

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:51.760 align:middle line:10%
of Jerusalem, including
the Temple of Solomon,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:58.060 align:middle line:10%
and the exile of her people
four decades later, in 597 BC.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.540 align:middle line:84%
As the Book of Chronicles
tells us, in 623 BC,

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.700 align:middle line:84%
during the 18th
year of his reign,

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.560 align:middle line:84%
Josiah was
refurbishing the Temple

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.190 align:middle line:84%
of Solomon, which the
previous kings had neglected.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.650 align:middle line:84%
During the restoration,
a high priest

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.390 align:middle line:84%
named Helikia discovered a
book, the Book of the Law,

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.850 align:middle line:90%
given to Moses.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.490 align:middle line:84%
When Josiah discovered
what he said,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.760 align:middle line:84%
he summoned all the subjects
of Jerusalem and Judah

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.630 align:middle line:84%
to the temple and read
for them the new law.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.450 align:middle line:84%
The new law book is called
The Book of Deuteronomy

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.400 align:middle line:90%
or the Book of the Covenant.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:38.050 align:middle line:84%
It was received by Moses, we're
told, in the burning bush.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.960 align:middle line:10%
At its heart are
the 10 Commandments,

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.500 align:middle line:10%
the laws of Yahweh.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.490 align:middle line:84%
Deuteronomy's laws
and ordinances

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.030 align:middle line:84%
were upheld as the new
wisdom and understanding.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.480 align:middle line:84%
It was completely different
from the older wisdom

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.310 align:middle line:84%
tradition, which was
now forbidden by Josiah.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.850 align:middle line:84%
We can begin to understand
this older wisdom tradition

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:03.610 align:middle line:90%
by following Josiah's actions.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
More than just a
book of the law,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.160 align:middle line:84%
Deuteronomy compelled
Josiah to go on a rampage,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.340 align:middle line:84%
destroying the shrines in
the high places of worship,

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.460 align:middle line:84%
the Asherah and images,
and removed their name

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.600 align:middle line:90%
from the land.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.880 align:middle line:90%
Then he purged the temple.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.180 align:middle line:84%
As we will see, the
Asherah is the symbol

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.220 align:middle line:90%
of the divine feminine.

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.350 align:middle line:84%
Deuteronomy forbade alien
religions, altars, pillars,

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.520 align:middle line:90%
ashrams, and images.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
All were to be destroyed,
smashed, and burned.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:37.750 align:middle line:84%
Worshipping celestial
beings, the Host of Heaven,

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.880 align:middle line:90%
became a capital offense.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.910 align:middle line:10%
Looking at the stars
was also forbidden,

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle line:10%
for fear the people would
once again worship the Host

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.840 align:middle line:10%
of Heaven, the angelic beings.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:53.260 align:middle line:10%
All forms of divination
were outlawed.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.940 align:middle line:84%
Punishment for disobedience
was death by stoning.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:00.040 align:middle line:84%
All of these
practices were later

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.010 align:middle line:84%
observed by the
Essenes, who claimed

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:08.260 align:middle line:84%
they were living with angels and
were able to tell the future.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:11.620 align:middle line:84%
At the core of the old
tradition was the breastplate

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.500 align:middle line:90%
of the high priest.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.380 align:middle line:84%
It was composed of 12 stones
and contained the ephod.

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:21.760 align:middle line:84%
Inside the breastplate where two
stones called Urim and Thummim.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.770 align:middle line:84%
These stones were called
lights and perfection,

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.180 align:middle line:84%
and it is the root
of the name Essenes.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.340 align:middle line:10%
The High Priest would
put on the breastplate

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:34.810 align:middle line:10%
when he entered the Holy of
Holies to speak with the Lord.

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.570 align:middle line:10%
These stones were
among five items

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.920 align:middle line:10%
that went missing during
the time of Josiah

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:43.540 align:middle line:10%
and the Babylonian
King Nebuchadnezzar.

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.090 align:middle line:84%
The other items were
the Ark of the Covenant,

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.090 align:middle line:84%
the flask of manna, the
cruet of anointing oil,

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.070 align:middle line:90%
and the rod of enlightenment.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:55.010 align:middle line:84%
All of these tools
worked together.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.240 align:middle line:10%
Returning to our
timeline, in 586 BC,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.110 align:middle line:10%
Nebuchadnezzar and
the Babylonians

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.640 align:middle line:10%
conquered Jerusalem.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.110 align:middle line:90%
Flattened its walls.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.020 align:middle line:84%
Stripped Solomon's Temple
of all its treasure,

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:09.230 align:middle line:84%
set the city ablaze, and
returned home to Babylon

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:11.870 align:middle line:84%
with the treasure of
the temple and a group

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.090 align:middle line:90%
of royal prisoners of war.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.070 align:middle line:10%
The great third
century book of Ezra

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:18.740 align:middle line:10%
tells us that the
Babylonians took

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.040 align:middle line:10%
all the holy vessels of the
temple, both great and small,

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.370 align:middle line:10%
and the Ark of God and
the King's treasures

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.830 align:middle line:10%
and carried them
away to Babylon.

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.760 align:middle line:84%
Thousands of Jews were exiled to
Babylon, including the prophets

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.340 align:middle line:90%
Daniel and Ezekiel.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.610 align:middle line:84%
Nothing is said in the Bible
about the Ark of the Covenant

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:84%
after the Jews
returned from Babylon.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.470 align:middle line:84%
The Apocrypha states
that the Ark could not

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:45.740 align:middle line:84%
be found when the Jewish people
rebuilt the temple at the time

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.230 align:middle line:90%
of Ezra and Zachariah.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.710 align:middle line:84%
Deuteronomy mentions
none of these items.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.310 align:middle line:84%
The reason why is because
they were associated

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.490 align:middle line:84%
with the original wisdom
tradition of the Divine

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:00.530 align:middle line:84%
Feminine practiced
by the Israelites

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.670 align:middle line:90%
at the Temple of Solomon.

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:05.840 align:middle line:84%
In Jewish tradition,
all of these items

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:09.140 align:middle line:84%
will be recovered by
her son, the Messiah,

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:13.550 align:middle line:84%
and returned to Jerusalem when
the Temple of Solomon is built.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:19.550 align:middle line:84%
This will occur, we are told, in
the end times or judgment day.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.750 align:middle line:84%
In their place was the
closed and empty golden box

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.630 align:middle line:84%
they called the Ark of
the Covenant and stories

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:31.250 align:middle line:84%
that the empty box went
to Ethiopia or elsewhere.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.850 align:middle line:84%
If this Ark were
compared to a computer,

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.250 align:middle line:84%
it would be a screen
minus the keyboard, mouse,

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.150 align:middle line:90%
power cord, and software.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:43.040 align:middle line:84%
In other words, a useless
piece of technology.

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.200 align:middle line:84%
This is why many researchers
typically present

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.450 align:middle line:84%
the Ark of the Covenant
as a golden box

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.390 align:middle line:84%
and do not mention
its other components.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:54.060 align:middle line:84%
They're just not
aware of its history.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.080 align:middle line:84%
But this was only the
beginning of Josiah's changing

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.490 align:middle line:90%
of the gods.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.140 align:middle line:84%
The mystic priests
of the temple were

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.440 align:middle line:84%
evicted, as they were
considered unclean or blemished.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.420 align:middle line:84%
These refugees fled
to Egypt, where

00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:09.620 align:middle line:84%
they built a copy of Solomon's
Temple at Elephantine Island.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.700 align:middle line:84%
They are also believed to have
fled to Arabia, Tibet, Russia,

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.170 align:middle line:90%
and China.

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:18.730 align:middle line:84%
One group who fled in particular
catches our attention.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.500 align:middle line:90%
They were called the Rechabites.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
While we may not be
familiar with them,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.150 align:middle line:84%
their story was widely
known to the Essenes

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.750 align:middle line:84%
and in early Gnostic
Christian ascension circles.

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.020 align:middle line:84%
Josiah tried to convert the
Rechabites to the new law,

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.370 align:middle line:90%
but they refused.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:35.960 align:middle line:84%
They were imprisoned,
but they were

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.980 align:middle line:84%
set free by angels, who took
them to a paradise place,

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.620 align:middle line:90%
where light was perpetual.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.320 align:middle line:84%
There, the Rechabites
lived with the angels

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.500 align:middle line:84%
and prayed for their
brethren left on earth.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.410 align:middle line:84%
Apparently, they were taken
in flesh and blood form,

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.110 align:middle line:84%
as as the story
goes, when they died,

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.650 align:middle line:84%
the angels buried them in
graves and took their souls

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:01.190 align:middle line:90%
in light body form up to heaven.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.690 align:middle line:84%
The history of the
Rechabites says

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.510 align:middle line:84%
they wore garments
of glory or light,

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:10.190 align:middle line:84%
just like the light bodies of
Adam and Eve before the fall.

00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.470 align:middle line:84%
These are the light bodies
we have been discussing

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:84%
and the object of
the Essene quest.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:19.820 align:middle line:84%
The name Rechabites means
"people of the chariot."

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:23.240 align:middle line:84%
Later, they were called the
Nazora, a word very similar

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.120 align:middle line:90%
to Nazarene, the watchers.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.830 align:middle line:10%
The chariot for
whom they were named

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.100 align:middle line:10%
is believed to be the
Merkaba, or Chariot Throne,

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:36.730 align:middle line:10%
that was present in the Holy
of Holies of Solomon's Temple.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.940 align:middle line:84%
This Chariot Throne
is the primary symbol

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.670 align:middle line:84%
of the old-time
ascension religion

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.700 align:middle line:90%
Josiah purged from the temple.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.640 align:middle line:84%
The book "Second Kings"
tells us explicitly

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.360 align:middle line:84%
that Josiah burned that
Chariots of the Sun.

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:55.210 align:middle line:10%
These are the chariots
of the gods, the Merkaba

00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.360 align:middle line:10%
chariot of Elijah.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.530 align:middle line:10%
Deuteronomy does not mention the
Golden Chariot of the cherubim

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:06.220 align:middle line:10%
that the Lord told David
to set in the temple.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.010 align:middle line:10%
Perhaps it is another of
the missing items that

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.589 align:middle line:10%
included the Ark of the
Covenant, the Rod of Aaron,

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:15.319 align:middle line:10%
the flask of manna, and
the jar of anointing oil.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:20.520 align:middle line:84%
It was the Essenes who called
this chariot the Merkaba Throne

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.490 align:middle line:90%
Chariot.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.349 align:middle line:90%
They remembered it.

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.420 align:middle line:84%
It was during the
Babylonian exile

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:29.200 align:middle line:84%
that mystical books like
3 Enoch were collected.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.020 align:middle line:10%
These books described
the chariot throne

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:10%
and are therefore
known as Merkaba Texts.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.220 align:middle line:10%
This story is important, as it
matches precisely the community

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:10%
rule of the Essenes, who
sought this very throne,

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:44.620 align:middle line:10%
plus the crown and the robe.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.850 align:middle line:90%


00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.740 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel, the tragedian,
shares the name

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.830 align:middle line:84%
of a high priest of the
Temple of Solomon, Ezekiel,

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:56.880 align:middle line:84%
which means he knew about
the workings of the temple.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.480 align:middle line:84%
We are told in a book that
bears his name that Ezekiel

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:06.180 align:middle line:84%
was near the banks of the River
Chebar on July 28, 593 BC,

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.530 align:middle line:84%
when suddenly a whirlwind, a
great cloud with brightness

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:12.780 align:middle line:90%
about it, appeared.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.820 align:middle line:84%
Inside the cloud were
four living creatures.

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.800 align:middle line:10%
He sees wheels within wheels
that have the ability to fly.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Above them was a throne,
and on the throne

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.620 align:middle line:90%
was the likeness of a man.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.740 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel describes the being
on the throne as something

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:32.540 align:middle line:90%
that seemed like human form.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:38.150 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel saw the chariot throne
leaving the temple of Solomon.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.500 align:middle line:84%
He saw first that a cloud filled
the inner court of the temple,

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.480 align:middle line:84%
and then that this
was the brightness

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.300 align:middle line:90%
of the glory of the Lord.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.730 align:middle line:84%
As the chariot
arrived in Babylon,

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:52.400 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel saw a great
cloud approaching,

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:90%
with brightness all around.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:57.830 align:middle line:84%
The brightness was like a
rainbow in a rain cloud.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:59.480 align:middle line:84%
And in the midst of
the bright clouds,

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:02.720 align:middle line:84%
said Ezekiel, was
a fiery human form.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.470 align:middle line:84%
The throne moved in a
cloud, in his vision,

00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:10.460 align:middle line:84%
which is often cited as
an ancient UFO encounter.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:17.110 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel is given a vision
of a new Temple of Solomon.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.510 align:middle line:84%
And Ezekiel's
story can easily be

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:21.910 align:middle line:90%
illustrated with Tibetan art.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.910 align:middle line:84%
Ezekiel saw the chariot
throne in its glory,

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.250 align:middle line:84%
returning from the
east, to the temple,

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.500 align:middle line:84%
exactly as he had
seen it depart.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:32.620 align:middle line:84%
And it was returning
to the rebuilt temple.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.580 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow was the sign of the
everlasting covenant mentioned

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.590 align:middle line:90%
in the book of Genesis.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.410 align:middle line:84%
The rainbow around
the chariot throne

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:45.730 align:middle line:84%
was the sign and seal of the
original, old-time wisdom

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:51.520 align:middle line:84%
tradition that was replaced
by the Book of Deuteronomy.

00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
This vision, which is at the
core of the Book of Ezekiel,

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:59.860 align:middle line:84%
became another key teaching of
the Merkaba mystics, especially

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.810 align:middle line:90%
the Essenes.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
While the word chariot is not
used in Ezekiel's account,

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.470 align:middle line:84%
mystics assume
that he is speaking

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:10.660 align:middle line:90%
of the chariot of the gods.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.940 align:middle line:84%
And while some might interpret
this as a hardware spaceship,

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes knew that it was
composed of consciousness.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.860 align:middle line:84%
Importantly, the
celestial chariot

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.330 align:middle line:84%
is also referred to
as the sacred boat.

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.500 align:middle line:10%
And these Merkaba
mystics claim to be

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.160 align:middle line:10%
able to duplicate Ezekiel's
experience of ascending

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.040 align:middle line:10%
to the heavens in this
chariot or sailing

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.460 align:middle line:10%
the stars in this boat.

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:38.800 align:middle line:10%
In addition to
Ezekiel, they favored

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:44.820 align:middle line:10%
Enoch, one of the founders of
the Essenes, as a wayshower.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:48.030 align:middle line:84%
Before Moses, the Jews,
including Ezekiel,

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.810 align:middle line:84%
focused their religion on
Enoch and his books, which

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:56.310 align:middle line:84%
tell how angels and righteous
ones initiated humans

00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:00.040 align:middle line:90%
in the secrets of heaven.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.650 align:middle line:84%
Enoch is a mysterious
pre-flood figure

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.320 align:middle line:84%
who is mentioned only
once in the Old Testament.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.320 align:middle line:84%
It says he walked
with God, which

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.880 align:middle line:84%
many assumed to mean he was
taken bodily into heaven.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.060 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes made a sort
of a superhero out of him,

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.470 align:middle line:84%
telling in detail how he was
the first translated man,

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:24.040 align:middle line:84%
the first man raised
from human to an angel.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.040 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he was transformed
into the Great Angel,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.470 align:middle line:84%
Metatron, whose name means
"next to the throne."

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.900 align:middle line:84%
In one episode,
told in First Enoch,

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.750 align:middle line:84%
we are told the Archangel
Michael came and took Enoch

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.100 align:middle line:90%
to Heaven.

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.380 align:middle line:84%
Along the way he
anointed his body

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.620 align:middle line:84%
with an oil that
dissolved Enochs body

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.100 align:middle line:84%
into rainbow-colored
light, so that it matched

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.640 align:middle line:90%
the light bodies of the angels.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.890 align:middle line:84%
And in Christian art, Michael
is shown wearing peacock wings.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.920 align:middle line:84%
The iridescent
peacock's feathers

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:01.660 align:middle line:84%
feature all of the
colors of the rainbow

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:07.060 align:middle line:84%
and are symbolic of the
light body of the angels.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Enoch's ascension story not
only told the Essenes and others

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.050 align:middle line:90%
what to do, but how to do it.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:17.410 align:middle line:84%
Get on the radar of Michael
and the other angels

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.570 align:middle line:90%
and find this oil.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:25.320 align:middle line:84%
This is the anointing oil kept
in the Ark of the Covenant.

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.380 align:middle line:84%
Importantly, John the
Revelator saw the rainbow

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.970 align:middle line:90%
around the throne.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.240 align:middle line:84%
And when he saw the mighty
angel coming from heaven

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.990 align:middle line:84%
with his little scroll,
he was wrapped in a cloud,

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:40.710 align:middle line:90%
with a rainbow around his head.

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.290 align:middle line:84%
Scholars like Dr.
Margaret Barker

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.440 align:middle line:84%
observed that Josiah's
destruction of the older wisdom

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.840 align:middle line:84%
tradition, the
ascension tradition,

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.820 align:middle line:84%
was more devastating
than even the loss

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.580 align:middle line:90%
of Solomon's temple itself.

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:57.360 align:middle line:84%
In contemporary terms, we
may say that Nebuchadnezzar

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.610 align:middle line:84%
destroyed the hardware
of the temple,

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.090 align:middle line:84%
but Josiah deleted or
attempted to delete

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:06.300 align:middle line:84%
the software of the
temple and its vital code.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.820 align:middle line:84%
It was a dismantling of the
original ascension teachings.

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.020 align:middle line:84%
What this means is that there
was another wisdom tradition

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.050 align:middle line:84%
practiced in Jerusalem
and the Temple of Solomon

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.660 align:middle line:90%
before it was destroyed.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:24.900 align:middle line:84%
It was this religion
that the Essenes later

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.110 align:middle line:90%
tried to recover and revive.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:31.680 align:middle line:84%
It is the ascension
tradition of Enoch, Ezekiel,

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.980 align:middle line:90%
and all the ascension keepers.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.960 align:middle line:84%
It is based on the
teachings of the angels, who

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.920 align:middle line:90%
are rainbow light beings.

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.050 align:middle line:84%
It was also during this
period, between Josiah's purge

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.810 align:middle line:84%
and the destruction
of the temple,

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:49.020 align:middle line:84%
that the Queen of
Heaven was abandoned.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Josiah dispatched the
angels from Jerusalem

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:84%
and centralized
power in his hands.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.090 align:middle line:10%
First Enoch tells how the Jews
worshipped the Queen of Heaven.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Images portray her as an
angelic-like figure with wings.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.820 align:middle line:84%
Deuteronomy forbade even
looking up to the heavens,

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:11.760 align:middle line:84%
lest people worship
these angels.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And some believe it was
because of the abandonment

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:20.250 align:middle line:84%
of the Divine Feminine
that Jerusalem was lost.

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.090 align:middle line:84%
This version of history is also
found in the Essenes Damascus

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:28.830 align:middle line:84%
Document, which was the
work of the refugee priests.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.900 align:middle line:84%
The Damascus
Document makes clear

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:34.380 align:middle line:84%
that the priests returning to
the rebuilt Temple of Solomon

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:37.350 align:middle line:84%
during the time of
the Essenes were not

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:40.950 align:middle line:84%
from the original
ascension wisdom tradition.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:45.300 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they were Josiah's
priests, if you will.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.460 align:middle line:84%
They rebuilt the
Temple of Solomon,

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.650 align:middle line:84%
and the Essenes had
a problem with them

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.810 align:middle line:84%
and the way they
were running things.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:54.690 align:middle line:84%
They wanted their
old-time wisdom tradition.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.680 align:middle line:84%
They wanted their
ascension teachings.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.570 align:middle line:84%
After the destruction
of the Essenes,

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:03.490 align:middle line:84%
these same Josiah
priests, if you will,

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.940 align:middle line:84%
were responsible for
rewriting Hebrew history

00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.220 align:middle line:84%
and calling the
Essenes heretics.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.900 align:middle line:84%
In fact, all those
who remembered

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.640 align:middle line:84%
the ascension wisdom teachings
were labeled as heretics.

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.840 align:middle line:84%
We can begin to recover
this spiritual tradition

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:23.220 align:middle line:84%
and early wisdom teachings
by accounting for the items

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.760 align:middle line:84%
Josiah purged from the
temple and/or destroyed.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:84%
We mentioned the
Ark of the Covenant,

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:34.610 align:middle line:84%
but foremost is the Asherah, the
symbol of the goddess Asherah,

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:38.330 align:middle line:84%
who is presented as an
alien entity, closely linked

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.790 align:middle line:90%
to the Host of Heaven.

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:45.500 align:middle line:84%
Asherah was the wife of El, the
head of the Canaanite pantheon,

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.860 align:middle line:84%
and probably the mother
of the gods in Canaanite

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.110 align:middle line:90%
and later Jewish tradition.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.660 align:middle line:84%
Some literary evidence
in ancient Israel

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:84%
even speaks of Asherah as the
consort of the Old Testament

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.870 align:middle line:90%
god Yaweh himself.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:03.170 align:middle line:84%
The removal of the Asherah,
the symbol of this goddess,

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.610 align:middle line:84%
and its destruction is
described in detail.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.930 align:middle line:84%
Josiah took it took it
to the Valley of Kidron,

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.540 align:middle line:84%
burned it, beat it
to dust or powder,

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.420 align:middle line:84%
and spread it over
the common graves.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:16.640 align:middle line:10%
When Josiah destroyed
the Asherah,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:20.700 align:middle line:10%
he also broke down the houses
of the male cult prostitutes who

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.390 align:middle line:10%
were in the House of the
Lord, the Temple of Solomon,

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:27.170 align:middle line:10%
where the women wove
hangings for the Asherah.

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.660 align:middle line:10%
These cult prostitutes
were actually

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:35.930 align:middle line:10%
angels, the women who wove the
linen clothing of the angels.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:41.000 align:middle line:84%
We can trace the Asherah to
Egypt, in the form of Hathor,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.550 align:middle line:84%
who was called the
Queen of Heaven

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:46.790 align:middle line:84%
and who was crowned
with the moon.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:49.520 align:middle line:84%
The Asherah Poles
are likely the same

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.640 align:middle line:84%
as the Hathor Pillars
of Egypt, especially

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:56.360 align:middle line:84%
those at Hathor's Temple, at
Dendera, the temple of love

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:90%
and joy in Dendera.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:27:02.900 align:middle line:84%
Dendera is the Greek name for
the Egyptian Ta-ynt-netert,

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.370 align:middle line:84%
which means She of
the Divine Pillar.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.570 align:middle line:84%
That name is a reference to
the Djed Pillar, this device

00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:14.780 align:middle line:90%
or World Tree.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:18.170 align:middle line:84%
Hathor is Asherah,
says the scholar,

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.200 align:middle line:84%
William Dever, and
other archaeologists,

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.060 align:middle line:84%
echoing a long known fact
known in goddess circles.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.030 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he calls
her Hathor Asherah,

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:32.780 align:middle line:84%
and on an Egyptian plaque, she
is listed as Qudshu, Hathor,

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:35.050 align:middle line:90%
Asherah, Anat, and Astarte.

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:39.760 align:middle line:90%
They are all the same goddess.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.080 align:middle line:84%
Qudshu is the Egyptian form
of the word Qetesh, Qedesh,

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.630 align:middle line:90%
Kadesh, or Kadesha.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:49.700 align:middle line:10%
It means Feminine Holy One, or
holiness in Hebrew, Canaanite,

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.910 align:middle line:10%
and Egyptian.

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:55.610 align:middle line:84%
In 1967, Raphael Patai
was the first historian

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.880 align:middle line:84%
to mention that the ancient
Israelites worshipped

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.473 align:middle line:90%
both Yahweh and Asherah.

00:28:02.473 --> 00:28:03.890 align:middle line:84%
In his book, "The
Hebrew Goddess,"

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.320 align:middle line:84%
he calculated that
the statue of Asherah

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.630 align:middle line:84%
was present in the
Temple of Solomon

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.750 align:middle line:90%
for no less than 236 years.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:17.300 align:middle line:10%
2/3 of the time, the Solomonic
temple stood in Jerusalem.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:21.020 align:middle line:84%
This worship, he asserts, was
part of the legitimate religion

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:26.150 align:middle line:84%
approved and led by the king,
the court, and the priesthood.

00:28:26.150 --> 00:28:28.280 align:middle line:84%
King Solomon
assuredly surely knew

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:34.140 align:middle line:84%
who or what Asherah denoted
and of its origins in Egypt.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.640 align:middle line:84%
And as Josiah learned, striking
this goddess from the Israelite

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.230 align:middle line:90%
mind was not easy.

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:43.490 align:middle line:84%
The image of the Asherah
would not go away,

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:48.480 align:middle line:84%
nor would the quest
for ascension.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.450 align:middle line:84%
What we have just learned from
this incredible historical

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.510 align:middle line:84%
investigation is
that there was once

00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:57.570 align:middle line:84%
an alternative, a parallel
mystery tradition,

00:28:57.570 --> 00:29:00.870 align:middle line:84%
based on the idea
of human ascension,

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:04.560 align:middle line:84%
that it had its focus place
at the Temple of Solomon,

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.900 align:middle line:90%
and that it was ultimately lost.

00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:10.260 align:middle line:84%
This had the effect, in a
way, of knocking humanity

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:11.340 align:middle line:90%
off its timeline.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.740 align:middle line:84%
It's as if we knew
for a very long time

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:16.890 align:middle line:90%
that our destiny was to ascend.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.650 align:middle line:84%
That we had an understanding
of the Hosts of Heaven,

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:21.870 align:middle line:84%
of extraterrestrial
beings, and of angels

00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:middle line:90%
who were here to assist us.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.580 align:middle line:84%
But then there was this
changing of the gods,

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.690 align:middle line:84%
for whatever reason, but perhaps
it has a benevolent purpose.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:34.200 align:middle line:84%
We lost our connection
to these stellar beings,

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:36.690 align:middle line:84%
to these star beings,
and this understanding

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:38.940 align:middle line:90%
of our quest for perfection.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.400 align:middle line:84%
Inserted in its
place was a religion

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.950 align:middle line:84%
that has certainly benefited
hundreds of millions of people.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:50.130 align:middle line:84%
But within these religions
of Judaism and Christianity,

00:29:50.130 --> 00:29:51.930 align:middle line:84%
there are always
these references

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:56.220 align:middle line:84%
to the old-time mysteries and
to the mysteries of ascension.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.230 align:middle line:84%
And the value in
going on this quest

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.470 align:middle line:84%
is that we can reorient
the human species.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:05.460 align:middle line:84%
We can bring it back to its
original ascension timeline,

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:08.880 align:middle line:84%
reach into the stars, and
achieve our fullest destiny.
