00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.865 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm William Henry, and
this is "Ascension Keepers."

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:25.020 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.890 align:middle line:10%
We saw how in 586 BC,
the ascension-minded Jews

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.140 align:middle line:10%
were exiled to Babylon.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.900 align:middle line:10%
They took their ascension
wisdom with them.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.320 align:middle line:84%
These events were the beginning
of the Essene movement

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.440 align:middle line:84%
and that of other
ascension keepers.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.170 align:middle line:84%
While in Babylon, these
forerunners of the Essenes

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.800 align:middle line:84%
followed the way of the
Magi, researching and weaving

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.920 align:middle line:84%
Babylonian, Mesopotamian,
Egyptian, Iranian

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.120 align:middle line:84%
or Zoroastrian, and Pythagorean
alchemical philosophies

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.830 align:middle line:84%
and ascension
practices that feature

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.970 align:middle line:84%
humans opening holes in space
and ascending to heaven.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.250 align:middle line:90%


00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.550 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras is a central
figure in our story.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.550 align:middle line:84%
This sixth century BC
wonder philosopher, master

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.920 align:middle line:84%
mathematician, and
scientist deeply

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.140 align:middle line:84%
influenced the great
Greek philosophers,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.980 align:middle line:84%
Plato and Aristotle, and
hence, Western philosophy.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.020 align:middle line:84%
Some even claim Pythagoras
was an Essene or Therapeutae.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.090 align:middle line:10%
While it's difficult
to say with certainty

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.830 align:middle line:10%
that Pythagoras was an Essene.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.410 align:middle line:10%
More easily proven is that
the Essenes were Pythagoreans.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he is considered
to be a candidate

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.390 align:middle line:90%
for the father of the Essenes.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.460 align:middle line:84%
For this reason,
Pythagoras's story

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.710 align:middle line:90%
is more than worth a look.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.490 align:middle line:84%
Born between 580 and 570
BC in southern Italy,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.520 align:middle line:84%
many fascinating stories
are connected to Pythagoras,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.000 align:middle line:84%
including a belief that he
was immaculately conceived,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.950 align:middle line:84%
or even was an
extraterrestrial being.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.870 align:middle line:84%
The god of healing,
Apollo, is said

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.110 align:middle line:84%
to have incarnated in
Pythagoras's human body

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.120 align:middle line:84%
in order to instruct
the human race.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.940 align:middle line:10%
He is known for having a golden
thigh, the ability to bilocate,

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.270 align:middle line:10%
and for teaching
humanity about the nature

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.660 align:middle line:10%
and the fate of the soul.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.840 align:middle line:84%
One apocryphal tale told in
Porphyry's "Life of Pythagoras"

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.540 align:middle line:84%
tells how, as a boy,
Pythagoras lived

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.330 align:middle line:84%
with a star child
named Astraeus,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.060 align:middle line:84%
who is adopted by
his father and raised

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.890 align:middle line:90%
as a brother of Pythagoras.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.370 align:middle line:84%
The star child
instructed Pythagoras.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.430 align:middle line:84%
According to his biographer,
Iamblichus, Pythagoras

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.530 align:middle line:84%
spent his youth
in Egypt, where he

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.580 align:middle line:84%
was instructed in the secret
teachings of the priests.

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.260 align:middle line:84%
It may be more
than a coincidence

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.430 align:middle line:84%
that his name rings of peuta,
as do so many other key elements

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.920 align:middle line:84%
to our story, including the
Therapeutae or Therapeuta.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras next went
to Babylon, where

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.710 align:middle line:84%
he learned the teachings
of the Zoroastrian magi.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.610 align:middle line:10%
Then he went to India,
where he learned

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.680 align:middle line:10%
the Hindu mystery
teachings about the Devas,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.380 align:middle line:10%
benevolent spiritual
beings, supernatural beings

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:10%
in the Vedic-era literature,
with Indra as their leader,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.820 align:middle line:10%
and ascension to India's
heaven as their goal.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Buddha descended from
heaven at this time.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.610 align:middle line:84%
The Buddha himself
chose to ascend

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.105 align:middle line:84%
to the heaven of the 33 gods
in order to preach to the gods.

00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:30.680 align:middle line:90%


00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.870 align:middle line:84%
At Mount Carmel in
northern Israel,

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.650 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras was trained by the
Hebrew prophets, who presumably

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.000 align:middle line:84%
knew the secret of how Elijah
ascended to heaven just

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.210 align:middle line:90%
200 years before.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Mount Carmel, in fact, became
the site of an important Essene

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.890 align:middle line:90%
community.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.820 align:middle line:84%
And some believe
Jesus was closely

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.060 align:middle line:84%
associated with the
Essenes of Mount Carmel.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.190 align:middle line:10%
Pythagoras taught
that if someone

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.010 align:middle line:10%
can purify his light
body, which he taught

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.160 align:middle line:10%
was made of an intangible
substance, like light,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.400 align:middle line:10%
he can journey to
the stars and beyond.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.150 align:middle line:84%
This light body of the
gods is within our flesh.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.370 align:middle line:84%
And by certain
musical sounds, said

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.985 align:middle line:84%
Pythagoras, it rides on
beams of light to the stars.

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:15.870 align:middle line:90%


00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.360 align:middle line:84%
The Pythagoreans were
divided in their schools

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.899 align:middle line:90%
into novices and perfectae.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:84%
They separated themselves
from other humans,

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.680 align:middle line:90%
as did the Essenes.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.630 align:middle line:10%
They lived in monasteries,
practiced vegetarianism,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.390 align:middle line:10%
greeted the rising Sun,
shared property communally,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.570 align:middle line:10%
and wore white garments as
a symbol for their quest

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.250 align:middle line:10%
to attain purity, perfection,
and the body of light.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.330 align:middle line:10%
Many of these key Buddhist
and Pythagorean philosophies

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.480 align:middle line:10%
were later mixed into the
foundations of the Essene

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.490 align:middle line:10%
lifestyle.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.860 align:middle line:84%
The bridge between
Babylon and the Essenes

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.670 align:middle line:90%
went through Alexandria, Egypt.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.060 align:middle line:84%
After the time of Exile,
some of the Jewish mystics

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.980 align:middle line:90%
stayed in Babylon.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.040 align:middle line:10%
Others returned to
Jerusalem, while still others

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.090 align:middle line:10%
resettled in Alexandria, where
an ascension revolution is

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.020 align:middle line:10%
in full swing.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.530 align:middle line:10%


00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.880 align:middle line:10%
Founded by Alexander
the Great in 331 BC,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:10%
Alexandria, like
Plato's Athens, was

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.110 align:middle line:10%
a crossroads of the world, where
Macedonians and Greeks lived

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.450 align:middle line:10%
with Egyptians and
Jews, and scholars

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.680 align:middle line:10%
dreamed of gathering
with other scholars.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.350 align:middle line:84%
At the center of the
Alexandrian Ascension

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.310 align:middle line:84%
Academy was the
Library of Alexandria,

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.550 align:middle line:84%
the largest collection of
ancient texts ever assembled.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Alexandria was
considered the capital

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.050 align:middle line:84%
of knowledge and
learning, in part

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.740 align:middle line:84%
because of this great library
and its ascension texts.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.090 align:middle line:84%
This library was
conceived by Ptolemy Soter

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:01.210 align:middle line:84%
I, a Greek Macedonian general
under Alexander the Great, who

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.960 align:middle line:84%
became the ruler of
Egypt around 323 BC,

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.990 align:middle line:84%
and became the founder of
both the Ptolemaic kingdom,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.500 align:middle line:90%
and the Ptolemaic dynasty.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.010 align:middle line:84%
The library they created was
part of a larger research

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.730 align:middle line:84%
institution called the
Musaeum of Alexandria,

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.550 align:middle line:84%
where many of the most famous
thinkers of the ancient world

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.700 align:middle line:84%
studied, and which functioned
as a sort of research institute.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.380 align:middle line:84%
Mystics and scholars from Italy,
Greece, Anatolia, the Levant,

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.360 align:middle line:84%
as well as from
North Africa, Arabia,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
and even from Persia and India,
came together in this place.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.090 align:middle line:84%
It was an ascension
convergence unlike any other

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.510 align:middle line:84%
before, or maybe
even perhaps since.

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.030 align:middle line:84%
The Septuagint translation
of the Old Testament

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:54.650 align:middle line:84%
was written in Greek at
Alexandria in 285 BC.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.050 align:middle line:84%
Alexandria flourished
under the patronage

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.510 align:middle line:84%
of the Ptolemaic
dynasty, and functioned

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.790 align:middle line:84%
as a major center
of scholarship,

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.445 align:middle line:84%
until the Roman conquest
of Egypt in 30 BC.

00:07:04.445 --> 00:07:07.200 align:middle line:90%


00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.760 align:middle line:84%
Ptolemy I introduced Serapis
as the official deity

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.610 align:middle line:90%
of Alexandria and Egypt.

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.420 align:middle line:10%
Serapis was a combination
of Isis and Osiris.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.600 align:middle line:84%
Serapis was devised
on his orders

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:29.390 align:middle line:84%
as a means to unify the Greeks
and Egyptians in his realm.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.880 align:middle line:84%
The temple to Serapis,
that Serapeum,

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.790 align:middle line:84%
became the center of
worship in Alexandria.

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.460 align:middle line:90%


00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.190 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting that
the named Therapeutae

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.650 align:middle line:84%
was a Greek cultic term
for worshippers of Serapis.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.910 align:middle line:84%
And it is from their name
that we get the words

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.000 align:middle line:90%
therapy and therapeutic.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.550 align:middle line:10%
This enigmatic group
of healers were

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.300 align:middle line:10%
known for wearing
white linen robes,

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.800 align:middle line:10%
and at the temple of
Isis in Herculaneum

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:04.640 align:middle line:10%
was found several mural frescoes
dating from 100 BC to 62 AD.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:08.630 align:middle line:10%
One shows Osiris, the
Egyptian god of resurrection,

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.710 align:middle line:10%
with the serpent of Serapis.

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
A second one portrays a
scene in the worship of Isis

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.860 align:middle line:90%
by Alexandrian goddesses.

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:21.680 align:middle line:84%
Before the door, at
the head of the stairs,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
stands a Therapeutic priest
with the shaven crown

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.820 align:middle line:84%
of the Alexandrian priesthood,
holding with both hands

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:33.559 align:middle line:84%
an urn breast high, while behind
him are two others, one of whom

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:35.360 align:middle line:90%
is probably a woman.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.030 align:middle line:84%
This is as close to a
photograph of an Essenes

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.659 align:middle line:90%
that we will ever get.

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.960 align:middle line:10%
Philo of Alexandria, who
described the group in his

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.910 align:middle line:10%
"On the Contemplative
Life," written

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:50.420 align:middle line:10%
around 10 of the current
era, compared the Therapeutae

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.300 align:middle line:10%
to the Essenes,
as both sects were

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.120 align:middle line:10%
known for their exemplary
religious devotion

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.760 align:middle line:10%
and ascetic practices.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.820 align:middle line:84%
In his book, Philo
described the Therapeutae

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.900 align:middle line:84%
as quote, "citizens of
heaven and of the universe,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and truly acceptable to
the Father and creator

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.670 align:middle line:90%
of the world."

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.290 align:middle line:10%
Eusebius, the eminent theologian
of the third century AD

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:17.480 align:middle line:10%
and the father of
Christian history,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.860 align:middle line:10%
regarded the Therapeutae as
the first Christian church

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.430 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt.

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:28.600 align:middle line:84%
700 years later, the Christian
Gnostics of Alexandria

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.920 align:middle line:84%
were still seeking spiritual
knowledge from this deity.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.440 align:middle line:84%
Christian Gnostics
made no distinction

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.540 align:middle line:90%
between Christ and Serapis.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.500 align:middle line:84%
This will explain the Roman
Emperor Hadrian's odd remark

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.800 align:middle line:84%
that Christians and the
worshippers of Serapis

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.450 align:middle line:90%
are the same.

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:51.450 align:middle line:84%
Those devoted to
Serapis call themselves

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.145 align:middle line:90%
the bishops of Christ.

00:09:53.145 --> 00:09:55.920 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.070 align:middle line:84%
In order to get the full
picture of the Therapeutae

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.950 align:middle line:84%
and what was being
discussed in Alexandria,

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:05.730 align:middle line:84%
we should know that in addition
to the Library of Alexandria

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.030 align:middle line:84%
and the Temple of Serapis,
the Ptolemies rebuilt

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:13.500 align:middle line:84%
the major temples of upper
Egypt, including Dendera

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.980 align:middle line:84%
and the Temple of Hathor,
the goddess of love and joy,

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:20.820 align:middle line:84%
Edfu, the Temple of
Horus, the god of light,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.250 align:middle line:84%
Philae, the Temple of Isis,
Esna, the Temple of Khenoum,

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.890 align:middle line:90%
a creator god.

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:31.440 align:middle line:84%
And the walls of these
temples feature the Ptolemies

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.880 align:middle line:90%
and their ascension at Kom Ombo.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.610 align:middle line:84%
They are portrayed receiving
the ascension mysteries

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.480 align:middle line:84%
from Horus, who holds the
symbol for the hundreds

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.620 align:middle line:84%
of thousands of years,
or eternal life.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.680 align:middle line:84%
In this scene, it is
the cat goddess, Bast,

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.100 align:middle line:90%
who does the initiating.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Besides the Ptolemies, we
always find their mark or sign.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:02.250 align:middle line:84%
It is the magical knot symbol
of the Egyptian goddess, Neith,

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:07.170 align:middle line:84%
the weaver goddess who created
all that is in the world.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.650 align:middle line:84%
It resembles the Egyptian
symbol of the ankh or key

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.630 align:middle line:90%
of life symbol.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.990 align:middle line:84%
This tells us all we need
to know about the intentions

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.550 align:middle line:90%
of the Ptolemies.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:21.870 align:middle line:84%
They associated themselves with
the divine feminine weavers.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.660 align:middle line:84%
And they sought, and
likely possessed,

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.640 align:middle line:90%
the secrets of ascension.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.150 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
I have to mention that those
incredible 80-ton granite

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.480 align:middle line:84%
boxes in the Serapeum
of Saqqara, Egypt

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.360 align:middle line:84%
were said to have been built
by the Ptolemaic devotees

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.620 align:middle line:84%
of Serapis, for whom
the complex is known.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:48.780 align:middle line:84%
We are told that these massive
boxes were tombs for bulls.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.980 align:middle line:84%
They are hermetically-sealed,
perfectly machined.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.230 align:middle line:84%
It would take 20
or more men just

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:58.230 align:middle line:84%
to squeeze themselves
into this space just

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:03.030 align:middle line:90%
to move the lid of one of these.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.610 align:middle line:84%
Some authors believe
Jesus made contact

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:08.940 align:middle line:84%
with the Therapeutae community,
which later would produce some

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.160 align:middle line:84%
of the leading
philosophical scholars

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:14.040 align:middle line:84%
of early Christian
gnosticism, who went on

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.160 align:middle line:84%
to create different schools,
the most important of which

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.470 align:middle line:84%
were hermeticism, neoplatonism,
and gnosticism, all of which

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:25.350 align:middle line:90%
we will discuss later.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Where the Therapeutae came from
and where exactly they lived

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.910 align:middle line:84%
and what exactly they believed
and what happened to them

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:35.010 align:middle line:90%
are all a mystery.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.950 align:middle line:84%
However, many
scholars now believe

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.790 align:middle line:84%
they were infused with knowledge
from Buddhist missionaries who

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.230 align:middle line:90%
came from India.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.580 align:middle line:84%
Specifically, some scholars have
proposed that the Therapeutae

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.020 align:middle line:84%
may have been influenced by,
or were even descendants of,

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:56.720 align:middle line:84%
Emperor Ashoka's
Buddhist missionaries,

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.580 align:middle line:84%
who he dispatched to spread
the gospel of Buddha.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.640 align:middle line:84%
Shortly after the Exile
of the Jews to Babylon,

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.580 align:middle line:90%
the Buddha was born in India.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:11.150 align:middle line:84%
As part of the Shakyamuni,
or Children of the Sun,

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:16.150 align:middle line:84%
Buddha was shown as a star
child in Buddhist art.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:84%
The first century Indian
poet, Ashvaghosha,

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:22.810 align:middle line:84%
in his "Buddhacarita" describes
the birth or appearance

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:27.690 align:middle line:84%
of Buddha, the son of the
Virgin Maya, on Earth.

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:32.070 align:middle line:84%
When born, he was so lustrous
and steadfast that it

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.030 align:middle line:84%
appeared as if the young
Sun had come down to Earth.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.660 align:middle line:84%
And yet, when people gazed
at his dazzling brilliance,

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.690 align:middle line:84%
he held their eyes
like the Moon.

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:47.820 align:middle line:84%
More, his limbs shown with a
radiant hue of precious gold

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and lit up the space all around.

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.750 align:middle line:84%
This remarkable birth
legend certainly

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.890 align:middle line:84%
connects Buddha and his
clan to the idea of light,

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:03.400 align:middle line:90%
light beings, and illumination.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.310 align:middle line:84%
During the two centuries
after Buddha's transition,

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:10.330 align:middle line:84%
Buddhism split into two
schools or streams, Theravada

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:11.740 align:middle line:90%
and Mahayana.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.910 align:middle line:84%
These are known as the great
and small chariots or vehicles

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:18.230 align:middle line:90%
of enlightenment.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.020 align:middle line:84%
These mysteries of
the chariot will soon

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.450 align:middle line:84%
dovetail with the
Essene Merkaba,

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:28.250 align:middle line:90%
or throne-chariot mysteries.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:32.840 align:middle line:84%
Mahayana Buddhism often includes
veneration of celestial beings,

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:84%
other Buddhas and bodhisattvas,
ceremonies, religious rituals,

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.570 align:middle line:84%
magical rites, and the
use of icons, images,

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:43.940 align:middle line:84%
and other sacred
objects and symbols,

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:47.590 align:middle line:84%
including the
Buddha's footprints.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.540 align:middle line:84%
The other stream,
Theravada, which

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.080 align:middle line:84%
comes from the Pali term thera,
meaning elders, plus vada,

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.140 align:middle line:84%
or doctrine, is the
doctrine of the elders,

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:59.020 align:middle line:90%
or the way of the elders.

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.910 align:middle line:84%
It's the school of
Buddhism that follows

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:05.230 align:middle line:84%
the original teachings of
Buddha known as the Pali Canon.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:09.670 align:middle line:84%
They strive to become arhats,
or perfected saints who

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:15.250 align:middle line:84%
have attained enlightenment,
shining bodies, and nirvana.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:17.950 align:middle line:84%
Among the famed
Edicts of Ashoka,

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.750 align:middle line:84%
or rock inscriptions
that can still

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.390 align:middle line:84%
be found marking Ashoka's
empire in modern day

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.090 align:middle line:84%
India and Pakistan,
are statements

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle line:84%
about how the great Buddhist
king sent missionaries

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.620 align:middle line:84%
throughout the known
world, including Alexandria

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.060 align:middle line:84%
specifically, to proselytize
the Buddhist faith to which he

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.640 align:middle line:90%
himself had converted.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:84%
As a result of this, a steady
stream of Buddhist monks

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.410 align:middle line:84%
made their way to
Alexandria in 250 BC,

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:49.630 align:middle line:84%
where they integrated
with the philosophers

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:54.800 align:middle line:84%
and mystics of the great
city of the philosophers.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.870 align:middle line:84%
Among them were the Therapeutae,
from the Pali term theraputa,

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.010 align:middle line:84%
literally meaning
son of the elders.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.640 align:middle line:84%
We note that this name is
very close to Theravada,

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.940 align:middle line:90%
the doctrine of the elders.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:13.340 align:middle line:84%
These mysterious
Buddhist mystics,

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.950 align:middle line:84%
who were known for their
flowing white robes,

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.730 align:middle line:84%
established an embassy outside
the walls of Alexandria

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:23.440 align:middle line:84%
on the shores of Lake
Mareotis near Alexandria.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.290 align:middle line:84%
And from the Therapeutae,
it is quite possible

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.120 align:middle line:84%
a Buddhist influence spread
to both the Essenes, who

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.490 align:middle line:84%
were operating a similar
monkish order in Palestine,

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:36.890 align:middle line:90%
and to the Gnostics.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.950 align:middle line:84%
The similarities between
the monastic practices

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:43.640 align:middle line:84%
of the Therapeutae and
Buddhist monastic practices

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.570 align:middle line:84%
have led to suggestions that
the Therapeutae were, in fact,

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.980 align:middle line:84%
Buddhist monks who had
Alexandria, being descendants

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.140 align:middle line:84%
of Ashoka's emissaries
to the west,

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:57.890 align:middle line:84%
and who influenced the early
formation of Christianity.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:00.710 align:middle line:90%


00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.010 align:middle line:84%
The Gnostic idea of liberating
the soul from entrapment

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:07.369 align:middle line:84%
in matter is not dissimilar
to the teachings embodied

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:10.490 align:middle line:84%
in "The Four Noble
Truths of the Buddha."

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:15.099 align:middle line:84%
In Buddhism, mankind is seen as
trapped in suffering by desire.

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
Its cessation is
said to be realized

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:19.819 align:middle line:84%
by an eightfold path
of right thought,

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:24.020 align:middle line:84%
right deed, right
attitude, among others.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.430 align:middle line:84%
Rather than salvation,
nirvana is postulated.

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.750 align:middle line:84%
And before he passed
into Mahaparinibbana,

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:36.560 align:middle line:84%
Buddha Shakyamuni prophesied
that in eight or 12 years,

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:84%
he would send an emanation
to continue his activity,

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.420 align:middle line:84%
protecting the teachings and
turning the wheel of Vajrayana,

00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:48.260 align:middle line:90%
the third aspect of Buddhism.

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:50.540 align:middle line:84%
The adherents of
the Mahayana sect

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.030 align:middle line:84%
are known as bodhisattvas,
who are instructed

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.630 align:middle line:90%
to become Buddha ultimately.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:58.130 align:middle line:84%
And they have chosen to
reincarnate on Earth in order

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:90%
to lead all others to nirvana.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.410 align:middle line:84%
Paramita, meaning
perfection or completeness,

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:08.480 align:middle line:84%
is a Pali term for
the qualities that

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:84%
must be filled by a
bodhisattva during the course

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.860 align:middle line:90%
of their spiritual development.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, the
Sanskrit word paramita

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.370 align:middle line:84%
means from beyond,
gone to the beyond,

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.610 align:middle line:84%
or to cross over
to the other shore.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:29.000 align:middle line:84%
It is derived from
para and ita, meaning

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.670 align:middle line:90%
a cross, over, or beyond.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.310 align:middle line:84%
The idea of an ascension
portal as the way

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.200 align:middle line:84%
to go beyond to other
supernatural realms

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:90%
is suggested.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:46.780 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes called themselves
the house of the perfect ones.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.980 align:middle line:84%
Their goal was
also to go beyond.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.850 align:middle line:84%
Paramita may also be
translated perfect realization,

00:18:54.850 --> 00:18:59.370 align:middle line:90%
or reaching beyond limitation.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it
refers to the achievement

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of a transcendental
state, which I believe

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:08.160 align:middle line:84%
is equatable with the
Essene concept of angels,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.245 align:middle line:90%
or ascended celestial beings.

00:19:10.245 --> 00:19:13.300 align:middle line:90%


00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:16.390 align:middle line:84%
With the infusion of
the Buddhist stream

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.560 align:middle line:84%
into the Jewish stream, we
are witnessing an escalation

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.800 align:middle line:84%
or acceleration of
the ascension program

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:26.860 align:middle line:84%
that will culminate
with the Essenes calling

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.710 align:middle line:84%
in a high celestial
being who will further

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:33.570 align:middle line:90%
demonstrate these mysteries.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Many believe that
figure was Jesus,

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.550 align:middle line:84%
who demonstrated the light body
effect by turning his flesh

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.840 align:middle line:84%
and blood body into
celestial flesh.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.160 align:middle line:10%
Before Jesus arrived,
however, another figure also

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:52.380 align:middle line:10%
demonstrated this
transformation,

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.470 align:middle line:10%
and he may have been the one
that illuminated the Essenes'

00:19:55.470 --> 00:20:00.010 align:middle line:10%
understanding of perfection.

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.130 align:middle line:10%
According to Tibetan
tradition, Garab Dorje,

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.800 align:middle line:10%
whose name means
indestructible joy,

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.090 align:middle line:10%
is a miracle child who brought
the great perfection or rainbow

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:17.320 align:middle line:10%
body teaching from the celestial
realms between 184 BC and 57

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.760 align:middle line:10%
BC.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.610 align:middle line:84%
This coincides
precisely with the time

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:25.060 align:middle line:84%
when the Essenes were
operating full-blown

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:28.480 align:middle line:90%
in Alexandria and Jerusalem.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Garab Dorje is considered to
be an emanation of the Buddha

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Vajrasattva, who taught
the great perfection

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:37.330 align:middle line:90%
in the heavens.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:41.470 align:middle line:84%
He became the first human
vichara, a Sanskrit word

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:44.700 align:middle line:90%
meaning knowledge holder.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.010 align:middle line:10%
Having attained the great
perfection, a rainbow

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:49.470 align:middle line:10%
body of light,
Garab Dorje's story

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:53.160 align:middle line:10%
is semi-historical, but
completely phenomenal

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:10%
in the way it connects
with the Essene symbolism.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.450 align:middle line:84%
He is said to have spent
32 years meditating

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.700 align:middle line:84%
in the residence
of a mountain god.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.150 align:middle line:84%
Here, he achieved realization
and a rainbow body,

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.510 align:middle line:90%
and the earth shook seven times.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:11.650 align:middle line:84%
When word of his feet
traveled to the Hindu king,

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.510 align:middle line:84%
soldiers were dispatched
to apprehend him.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.560 align:middle line:84%
And when the king's
soldiers arrived,

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.980 align:middle line:84%
Garab Dorje ascended
into the sky and escaped.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.000 align:middle line:90%


00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.060 align:middle line:84%
Having reached complete
enlightenment and attainment

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.450 align:middle line:84%
of the rainbow body of light
through the great perfection,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Garab Dorje transmitted
the teachings

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:35.650 align:middle line:84%
to his retinue of
exceptional beings.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:38.650 align:middle line:84%
The earth quaked and
miraculous sounds were heard

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.970 align:middle line:90%
when Garab Dorje ascended.

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:42.940 align:middle line:84%
The cloud of rainbow
light obviously

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:47.020 align:middle line:84%
connects to the
rainbow light body.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.300 align:middle line:84%
During the years
following Garab Dorje is

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:53.350 align:middle line:84%
when the mystical Essenes
penned the story of Enoch,

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:58.150 align:middle line:84%
the messiah initiate of
the Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.900 align:middle line:84%
the story of a man who is
translated or transferred

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.190 align:middle line:84%
into a glorious rainbow-like
celestial being by the watcher

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:10.120 align:middle line:84%
angel Michael, who anointed him
with an oil that transformed

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:84%
his body into glorious light
that matches the perfect body.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:19.630 align:middle line:84%
And in my humble opinion,
the perfection of the Essenes

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.090 align:middle line:84%
is the great perfection of the
Tibetan rainbow light body.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And we can make that
connection through Garab Dorje.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.190 align:middle line:10%
The possibility
Theravada Buddhism

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.430 align:middle line:10%
had an influence on Greek
and early Christian thought,

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:37.180 align:middle line:10%
as well as the person known
as Jesus, Isa, or Yeshua

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.110 align:middle line:10%
is very real.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.950 align:middle line:90%


00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:45.180 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes then spent
nearly 200 years,

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:52.140 align:middle line:84%
from 150 BC to 70 AD, fusing
esoteric Buddhist, Zoroastrian,

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:56.010 align:middle line:84%
Egyptian, and Judaic teachings
about human transformation

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.230 align:middle line:84%
or perfection into
celestial beings

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.870 align:middle line:84%
into a practice
aimed at transmuting

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:05.250 align:middle line:90%
the human body into light.

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.070 align:middle line:84%
These practices were enhanced
with knowledge derived

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.110 align:middle line:84%
from the Essenes'
close encounters

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.750 align:middle line:84%
with angels or celestial
beings who they

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.930 align:middle line:90%
claimed were living with them.

00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.930 align:middle line:84%
Jesus embodied these
advanced practices

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:23.490 align:middle line:84%
and modeled them in his own
perfection and resurrection.

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:25.920 align:middle line:84%
In one story, Jesus
told a rich man,

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.130 align:middle line:84%
"if thou will be perfect--"
meaning whole, holy,

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:30.430 align:middle line:90%
and complete--

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.070 align:middle line:84%
"go and sell what
you have and give it

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:35.430 align:middle line:84%
to the poor, and thou shalt
have treasure in heaven,

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.240 align:middle line:84%
and then you can
come and follow me."

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.750 align:middle line:84%
In the Gnostic
Gospel of Philip, it

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:43.070 align:middle line:84%
says we must become perfect
before leaving this world.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.750 align:middle line:90%


00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.090 align:middle line:84%
What I noticed is that
all of these statements

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:52.800 align:middle line:84%
can be read as references to
the Tibetan rainbow light body.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:55.710 align:middle line:84%
Only now, we can see that
the rainbow light body

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:59.350 align:middle line:84%
teaching is the product of a
concerted effort of ascension

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.150 align:middle line:90%
keepers.

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.960 align:middle line:90%


00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.880 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion,
this is why we can

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.240 align:middle line:84%
see how the Essenes fused
the ancient Egyptian star

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:13.080 align:middle line:84%
religion with esoteric
Buddhism and Jewish mysticism

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:18.690 align:middle line:84%
into a full-blown revelation
of extraterrestrial contact.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:21.210 align:middle line:84%
Going beyond close
encounters of the first

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.370 align:middle line:84%
through the fifth
kind, the Essenes

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:27.990 align:middle line:84%
claimed to be taken up to heaven
and transformed into angels.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:31.330 align:middle line:84%
These are close encounters
of the eighth and ninth kind.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:37.460 align:middle line:84%
In this story, we introduced
the Jewish mystical teachings

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:40.310 align:middle line:84%
about the Merkaba or
throne-chariot as their vehicle

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:43.370 align:middle line:84%
ascension, and traced the
origins of this practice

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:46.440 align:middle line:90%
to India and Egypt.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.550 align:middle line:84%
We have been asked to
understand the true nature

00:24:49.550 --> 00:24:53.540 align:middle line:84%
of the incredible goings
on in ancient Alexandria.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.490 align:middle line:84%
Many of us have heard of this
wonderful library and its lost

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.080 align:middle line:84%
texts, but now, by
pulling together

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.870 align:middle line:84%
the story of Pythagoras
and of the Buddhists

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:05.660 align:middle line:84%
coming into Alexandria,
we can understand

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:09.770 align:middle line:84%
that there was this tremendous
undercurrent of knowledge that

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.870 align:middle line:90%
was coming forward.

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:15.860 align:middle line:10%
Just imagine what it must have
been like at that library,

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.920 align:middle line:10%
to have these missionaries
coming in from India, to have

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.420 align:middle line:10%
these Magi coming in from
Iran and Iraq and elsewhere,

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:26.060 align:middle line:10%
and the mystics from
Egypt, all getting

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:31.830 align:middle line:10%
together and formulating a
new way for humanity to live,

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:37.040 align:middle line:10%
enabling all of future humanity
to tap into inner resources

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.870 align:middle line:10%
that we are only just now
beginning to fully understand.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:46.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to recognize that the
Ptolemies were among the most

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:84%
formidable of generals,
being the generals that

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:84%
succeeded Alexander the Great,
his hand-picked successors.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.930 align:middle line:84%
They're among the greatest
builders in the world.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.650 align:middle line:10%
When people visit Egypt today
and go to the five jewel

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:05.260 align:middle line:10%
temples of Dendera, and
Esna, and Philae, and others,

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.970 align:middle line:10%
they're walking in the
footsteps of the Ptolemies.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
But now, through
our investigation,

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.390 align:middle line:84%
we understand that
the Ptolemies were

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:13.640 align:middle line:84%
walking in the
footsteps themselves

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.680 align:middle line:84%
of some of the greatest
ascension keepers in history.

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.960 align:middle line:84%
We one day hope to
be able to recover

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.310 align:middle line:84%
even more of the knowledge
of the Library of Alexandria,

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:27.140 align:middle line:84%
just as the Essenes
did in their time.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.650 align:middle line:84%
And that day will be
absolutely extraordinary.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.500 align:middle line:84%
It will be a revelation
of cosmic knowledge

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:36.170 align:middle line:84%
and cause a blossoming
of our understanding

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.140 align:middle line:84%
of our true nature
and ascension,

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.760 align:middle line:84%
maybe such that we haven't
seen since the time

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.370 align:middle line:84%
of the great Library
of Alexandria itself.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.420 align:middle line:90%
