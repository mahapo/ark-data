00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.250 align:middle line:10%
As we have seen, the veil
of the Temple of Solomon

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.970 align:middle line:10%
was thought of as a portal
between heaven and earth.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.210 align:middle line:84%
Passing through this
veil transformed a human

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.360 align:middle line:84%
into a radiant angel,
a luminous being.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.870 align:middle line:84%
The Temple priestesses
who wove that veil,

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.600 align:middle line:84%
when the Temple was rebuilt
at the time of Jesus,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.450 align:middle line:90%
were known as the Marys.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.630 align:middle line:84%
My research reveals that these
highly mysterious females

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.990 align:middle line:84%
not only wove the starry veil
separating the holy place

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.570 align:middle line:84%
from the most holy place
of Solomon's Temple,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.090 align:middle line:84%
but they also were
specially trained

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.240 align:middle line:84%
as vessels to give birth
to the high celestial

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.000 align:middle line:84%
being the Essenes
were expecting.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.150 align:middle line:84%
One of these Temple
priestesses is known to history

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.400 align:middle line:84%
as the Virgin Mary
or Mary the Mother.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.950 align:middle line:84%
Later, we will explore the
extraordinary Renaissance

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.850 align:middle line:84%
story of the arrival of the star
child, the high celestial being

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.070 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes were
awaiting, as well as

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.830 align:middle line:84%
the apparitions of
this Mary in which she

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.520 align:middle line:90%
appears as a luminous being.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.680 align:middle line:84%
We should not be
surprised that Mary

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.840 align:middle line:90%
transformed into a light being.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.885 align:middle line:84%
She was, after all, the
first Christian to ascend.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.710 align:middle line:84%
According to the
Dead Sea Scrolls,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.660 align:middle line:84%
these Essenes
alienated themselves

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.300 align:middle line:84%
from the rest of society
at their monasteries

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.830 align:middle line:84%
at Mount Carmel and Qumran and
elsewhere to perfect themselves

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.460 align:middle line:84%
in order to prepare and
make way for this visitation

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.650 align:middle line:84%
of a high celestial
being and to lead

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.460 align:middle line:84%
a revolution in human evolution
by transforming themselves

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.210 align:middle line:84%
into angels and the Earth into
a planet of righteousness.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.500 align:middle line:84%
The Essene Community Rule
tells us this high heavenly

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.320 align:middle line:84%
being would reveal the
mysteries of eternal

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.290 align:middle line:90%
being concealed from humankind.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.510 align:middle line:84%
And at that time,
the righteous will

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.210 align:middle line:84%
be rewarded with
healing, great peace,

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.400 align:middle line:84%
and a long life, and
fruitfulness, together

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.820 align:middle line:84%
with every everlasting
blessing, an eternal joy

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.690 align:middle line:84%
in life without end, a crown of
glory, and a garment of majesty

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.060 align:middle line:90%
in unending light.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.060 align:middle line:84%
In the Dead Sea
Scrolls, the Essenes

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.420 align:middle line:84%
said this star being would lead
a revolt against the Children

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.730 align:middle line:84%
of Darkness, who they
said were incarnate

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.730 align:middle line:84%
in Rome and symbolic
of the material world

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.340 align:middle line:84%
and would deliver the
righteous children of the light

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.760 align:middle line:84%
from the evil powers
of earthly despots.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:84%
The arrival of this star
being fulfills the prophecy

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.170 align:middle line:84%
of the star coming out of
Jacob in the book of Numbers

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.540 align:middle line:84%
and would result in a
transformation of humanity.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.360 align:middle line:84%
The angels who were
living with the Essenes

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.380 align:middle line:84%
were assisting in the
fulfillment of this prophecy.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.050 align:middle line:84%
And the Essenes' mission
crossed over generations

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.780 align:middle line:84%
and so presumably
did the assistance

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.490 align:middle line:84%
of the angels the Essenes
claimed they were living with.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Many, of course,
know that angels

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.730 align:middle line:84%
were involved in the
conception and birth of Jesus.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.090 align:middle line:84%
The Annunciation, as
it's known, is the moment

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.630 align:middle line:84%
when the archangel Gabriel,
one of the watcher angels,

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:37.910 align:middle line:84%
announces to Mary that she
will bear the Christ child.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is exactly what we
see in the Annunciation scenes

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.580 align:middle line:90%
from Christian art.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.580 align:middle line:10%
One of the elements of
theology that was debated

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.530 align:middle line:10%
was the precise way in which
Mary actually became pregnant.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.200 align:middle line:84%
In this "Annunciation" by
Filippo Lippi in the National

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.070 align:middle line:84%
Gallery in London, Mary
is in the Holy of Holies

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.690 align:middle line:90%
of the Temple of Solomon.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.270 align:middle line:90%
Gabriel appears.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.180 align:middle line:84%
In annunciation
paintings such as this,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.600 align:middle line:84%
we see Gabriel
with Peacock wings.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.880 align:middle line:84%
Here, the hand of God appears
at the top center of the image.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.920 align:middle line:84%
God's hand emerges from a
vortex that rains golden manna,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.250 align:middle line:84%
the dew of Resurrection,
also referred to as the star

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.870 align:middle line:84%
food of the angels, while
the Dove of the Holy Spirit

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.090 align:middle line:84%
emerges from the corkscrewing
vortex, close to Mary's knees

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.370 align:middle line:84%
and anointing Mary with the
cosmic energy of the Milky Way.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.660 align:middle line:84%
There is a gap in Mary's
dress in front of her stomach

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.110 align:middle line:84%
from which small
golden rays project.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.590 align:middle line:84%
My research reveals that
Mary became pregnant

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:90%
through the stomach.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.770 align:middle line:84%
It is significant that the
Annunciation celebrates

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.790 align:middle line:84%
Mary's transformation into
the Theotokos, the god

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.880 align:middle line:90%
bearer or Christ bearer.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.130 align:middle line:84%
In Gnostic tradition,
it represents

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.490 align:middle line:84%
her awakening, or
her enlightenment,

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.000 align:middle line:84%
and her transformation
into a vessel

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.180 align:middle line:84%
or actually the new Ark of the
Covenant, as she was called,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.270 align:middle line:84%
capable of housing
this cosmic being.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.960 align:middle line:90%


00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.260 align:middle line:84%
In the traditional or
orthodox story of Mary,

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.730 align:middle line:84%
her conception of
Jesus is passive.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.150 align:middle line:10%
In the Essene and Gnostic
version, her role is active.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.690 align:middle line:10%
She was trained to
conceive the Christ

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.220 align:middle line:10%
child, this mysterious cosmic
being the Essenes were calling

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.260 align:middle line:10%
in.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.420 align:middle line:84%
We can be assured
from this that Mary

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.980 align:middle line:84%
was well-prepared to carry
this pure light being

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.560 align:middle line:90%
sent from the cosmos.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we know
that the Essenes were

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.320 align:middle line:90%
obsessed with ritual purity.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.680 align:middle line:84%
The reason for the Essenes'
strict insistence on purity

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.950 align:middle line:84%
is that they claimed they
were living with angels

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
and would be joining them
in the celestial realms.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.470 align:middle line:84%
These angels are portrayed as
super-high vibrational beings.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:14.610 align:middle line:90%
They don't eat meat.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.090 align:middle line:84%
They don't drink
alcohol or have sex.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.060 align:middle line:90%
So neither did the Essenes.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.330 align:middle line:84%
And their rules were
strictly enforced.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.820 align:middle line:10%
Men and women seeking
to join the Essenes

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:29.750 align:middle line:10%
had to go through three years
of probationary training

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.960 align:middle line:10%
and could not eat or drink
with the other members

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.110 align:middle line:10%
until their purity was assured.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.610 align:middle line:10%
This was for
everyone's protection.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.730 align:middle line:84%
One of the ritual points
emphasized by the Essenes,

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.780 align:middle line:84%
as noted in the Dead Sea Scroll
known as the Halachic Letter,

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.390 align:middle line:84%
is the contamination
of pure water

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:54.890 align:middle line:84%
by pouring it into
an impure vessel.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.930 align:middle line:84%
And the vessel we're
speaking of, of course,

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.310 align:middle line:90%
is the human body.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.110 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes believed that
even if the vessel containing

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.780 align:middle line:84%
the water was pure and even
if the water itself was pure,

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:84%
if it was poured
into an impure vessel

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.870 align:middle line:84%
the water would not
only become impure,

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.900 align:middle line:84%
but the vessel
containing the pure water

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.830 align:middle line:90%
would itself become impure.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.170 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
impurity, they believed,

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.980 align:middle line:84%
would transfer up
the flow of water

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.090 align:middle line:84%
into the pitcher, contaminating
everything in its path.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:34.670 align:middle line:90%


00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.230 align:middle line:10%
In some paintings like "The
Annunciation" by Barthel Bruyn,

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.870 align:middle line:10%
archangel Gabriel
conducts the Holy Spirit

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:46.610 align:middle line:10%
into the ear of Mary
with the caduceus wand.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.660 align:middle line:84%
This is important as, in
mythology, the caduceus wand

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.440 align:middle line:84%
is the alchemical
talisman, or device, that

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.490 align:middle line:84%
enables messenger beings
to travel back and forth

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.010 align:middle line:90%
from the realm of the gods.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.590 align:middle line:84%
The caduceus is the symbol
of the transformation,

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.650 align:middle line:84%
or perfection, of
the star walkers

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.880 align:middle line:84%
into pure beings of light, and I
equate it with the Resurrection

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.370 align:middle line:84%
stick that we've seen with
the rainbow light body beings.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.660 align:middle line:90%


00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.880 align:middle line:84%
Actually, Jesus is not the first
virgin or angel-assisted birth

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.340 align:middle line:90%
upheld by the Essenes.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.060 align:middle line:84%
The first was recorded
by Melchizedek.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:32.250 align:middle line:84%
The Second Book of
Enoch of the Essenes

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.730 align:middle line:84%
contains a section called
Exaltation of Melchizedek,

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.850 align:middle line:84%
which says that
Melchizedek was born

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:44.610 align:middle line:84%
of a virgin named Sopanim, the
wife of Nir, a brother of Noah.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:47.190 align:middle line:84%
This is important because
Jesus was referred

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.250 align:middle line:84%
to by the Essenes
as a priest forever

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.530 align:middle line:90%
after the order of Melchizedek.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.680 align:middle line:90%


00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.410 align:middle line:84%
40 days later,
Melchizedek was taken

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.170 align:middle line:90%
by the archangel Gabriel--

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.370 align:middle line:84%
or Michael, in
some manuscripts--

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.910 align:middle line:84%
to the Garden of Eden and was
thus preserved from the deluge

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:10.210 align:middle line:84%
without having to
be in Noah's Ark.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.080 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Gnostics told of
the intervention of the angels

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:18.190 align:middle line:84%
in the birth of not only Jesus
and Melchizedek, but also

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.790 align:middle line:90%
of the Virgin Mary.

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:25.050 align:middle line:84%
In traditional Catholicism,
her parents, Joachim and Anne,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:27.000 align:middle line:90%
were childless.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.520 align:middle line:84%
But the Gnostic
Protoevangelium of James

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.210 align:middle line:84%
tells the story of the
archangel Gabriel appearing

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:36.540 align:middle line:90%
to Anne, the mother of Mary.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.810 align:middle line:10%
Suddenly, an angel of the Lord
stood in front of her saying,

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:41.610 align:middle line:10%
"Anne!

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:42.420 align:middle line:10%
Anne!

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.330 align:middle line:10%
The Lord God has
heard your prayer.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:10%
You will conceive
and give birth,

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.650 align:middle line:10%
and your child will be spoken
of everywhere people live."

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.630 align:middle line:10%


00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.510 align:middle line:10%
In my view, Gabriel's
appearance to Anne

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:04.420 align:middle line:10%
shows that genetic
alteration was generational.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.000 align:middle line:84%
It also tells us
that Mary was far

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:84%
from a simple peasant
girl as portrayed

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.890 align:middle line:90%
in Orthodox Christianity.

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:16.240 align:middle line:10%
No, she was a highly
trained Essene initiate

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.570 align:middle line:10%
on the path of perfection.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.720 align:middle line:84%
So who exactly is
this iconic figure

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.510 align:middle line:84%
who has attained such
exalted titles, as well

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:29.540 align:middle line:90%
as a unique heavenly position?

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.520 align:middle line:10%
From early days, Mary was known
as Blessed Virgin, Holy Mother,

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.210 align:middle line:10%
Mother of God, Bride of
Christ, Bride of the Spirit,

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:10%
and Queen of Heaven.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.700 align:middle line:10%
Where did she come from, and
how did she progress from human

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.460 align:middle line:10%
to near-divine?

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.110 align:middle line:84%
In his book, "The
Virgin Goddess--

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:53.550 align:middle line:84%
Studies in the Pagan and
Christian Roots of Mariology,"

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.880 align:middle line:84%
scholar Stephen Benko traces the
development of the Cult of Mary

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:02.920 align:middle line:84%
from Greek and Roman mythology
through to recent times.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.570 align:middle line:84%
Benko traces Mary's roots to the
Pagan, pre-Christian, heavenly

00:11:07.570 --> 00:11:12.100 align:middle line:84%
Queens of Greece, Rome, and
the wider Mediterranean.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Queen of
Heaven was a title

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:18.310 align:middle line:84%
given to a number of ancient
sky goddesses worshipped

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.440 align:middle line:84%
throughout the ancient
Mediterranean and Near

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.200 align:middle line:84%
East during ancient
times, including

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.040 align:middle line:90%
by the ancient Israelites.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.770 align:middle line:84%
Goddesses known to have been
referred to by this title

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:37.490 align:middle line:84%
include Inanna, Isis,
Astarte, Asherah, Athena,

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.560 align:middle line:84%
the Greek goddess
of virgin birth.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.910 align:middle line:84%
Christianity, Benko notes,
did not add a new element

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:84%
to religion when it introduced
into its theology such concepts

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.490 align:middle line:90%
as Virgin and mother.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.910 align:middle line:84%
Rather, it sharpened
and refined images

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.500 align:middle line:84%
that already existed in numerous
forms in Pagan mythology.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.250 align:middle line:90%


00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.150 align:middle line:84%
Going back to the Assyrian and
Babylonian stories of the gods,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.780 align:middle line:84%
we find relationships
between gods and goddesses

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.200 align:middle line:84%
resulting in other
gods and goddesses.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:16.320 align:middle line:10%
One such story is that
of Enki and Damkina,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.170 align:middle line:10%
who were assisted
by Abzu giving birth

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.140 align:middle line:10%
to the god Marduk, the sun god.

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:25.020 align:middle line:84%
We find the same concept
in the story of Gabriel,

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.590 align:middle line:90%
an angel assisting Mary.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Gabriel is a celestial
being assisting

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:39.960 align:middle line:84%
another high celestial
being, Mary, in conception.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.410 align:middle line:84%
So it's no coincidence
that Mary was also

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:48.300 align:middle line:84%
identified as the new Eve,
as early as the latter half

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:54.120 align:middle line:84%
of the second century, and that
Christ was called the new Adam.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.670 align:middle line:84%
These titles, the new
Eve and the new Adam,

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:00.060 align:middle line:84%
tell us that these
figures were either

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:05.220 align:middle line:84%
new models of humans, which
is what the Essenes intended,

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:08.610 align:middle line:84%
or that they shared something
in common with these earlier

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.410 align:middle line:90%
figures.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.520 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes believed that
Adam and Eve were angels

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:19.200 align:middle line:84%
with light bodies and that
we can, and must, return

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.990 align:middle line:84%
to our original
state of perfection,

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:27.960 align:middle line:84%
when we would be made new
again like Mary and Christ.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.740 align:middle line:84%
This, once again, points us in
the direction of the Essenes

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.420 align:middle line:84%
mission to transform humanity
from its earthly flesh

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:41.040 align:middle line:84%
to its original celestial
flesh and to become new beings.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:90%


00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:48.240 align:middle line:84%
The Virgin Mary-- her
father, Joseph, died shortly

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.450 align:middle line:90%
after her birth in about 17 BC.

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Her mother, Anne, also died
at about the same time,

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.150 align:middle line:84%
both of them having
been executed by Herod.

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
Mary was then raised in
the Temple of Solomon.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.980 align:middle line:84%
In fact, according to the
second century Protoevangelium

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:12.240 align:middle line:84%
of James, Mary was consecrated
as a Temple virgin,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.450 align:middle line:84%
or priestess, at
the age of three

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.890 align:middle line:84%
and lived in the Temple
precincts till the age of 14,

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:24.090 align:middle line:84%
when she was married
to St. Joseph.

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:28.950 align:middle line:84%
This order or school of
Temple virgins in Jerusalem

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.210 align:middle line:84%
formed an altar guild that
fulfilled the necessary tasks

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:35.670 align:middle line:90%
of the Temple of Solomon.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.860 align:middle line:84%
This included
sewing and creating

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.870 align:middle line:84%
the vestments of
the high priest,

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:43.410 align:middle line:84%
weaving the veil of the
Temple, and, most importantly,

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.355 align:middle line:90%
liturgical prayer.

00:14:44.355 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:90%


00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.290 align:middle line:10%
There are three
scriptural accounts

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.350 align:middle line:10%
that are used by Catholics
to demonstrate that there

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.230 align:middle line:10%
were special women
who ministered

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.020 align:middle line:10%
at the Temple of
Solomon complex.

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.650 align:middle line:84%
Exodus 38:8 mentions
women who watch

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.400 align:middle line:84%
at the door of the
Tabernacle, the holy place.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.320 align:middle line:90%
The second is in first Samuel.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.250 align:middle line:10%
Now Eli was very
old, and he heard all

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:13.920 align:middle line:10%
that his sons did to
all Israel and how

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.230 align:middle line:10%
they lay with the
women that waited

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:19.920 align:middle line:10%
at the door of the Tabernacle.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.530 align:middle line:84%
In both of the verses
above, the Hebrew verb

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.890 align:middle line:84%
for watch and
waited is the same.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.200 align:middle line:84%
They are watching and
waiting at the door

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.700 align:middle line:90%
of the Temple of Solomon--

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.000 align:middle line:84%
actually the door to
the Holy of Holies.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.400 align:middle line:84%
The third reference to
these liturgical females

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.680 align:middle line:90%
is in Second Maccabees.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.680 align:middle line:84%
"And the virgins also
that were shut up

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.040 align:middle line:84%
came forth, some to
the High Priest Onias,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:47.160 align:middle line:84%
and some to the walls,
and others looked out

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.450 align:middle line:90%
of the windows.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.450 align:middle line:84%
And all holding up their
hands towards heaven,

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.490 align:middle line:90%
made supplication.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.070 align:middle line:84%
Here are the virgins
that are shut up.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle line:84%
In the Greek, it is the shut
up ones of the virgins."

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.620 align:middle line:10%
In this passage, the
Holy Spirit refers

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.590 align:middle line:10%
not to all the
virgins of Jerusalem,

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:10.200 align:middle line:10%
but to a special
set of virgins--

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:15.000 align:middle line:10%
that is, those virgins who had
the privilege and the right

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.680 align:middle line:10%
to be in the presence of the
high priest and to address him.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.870 align:middle line:84%
There is further testimony
of Temple virgins

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:90%
in the Traditions of the Jews.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.160 align:middle line:84%
In the Mishnah, it is
recorded that there

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.430 align:middle line:84%
were 82 consecrated virgins who
wove the veil of the Temple.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:38.080 align:middle line:84%
Quote, "The veil of the Temple
was a palm-length in width.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:41.860 align:middle line:84%
It was woven with
72 smooth stitches,

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.050 align:middle line:90%
each made up 24 threads.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.210 align:middle line:84%
The length was of 40 cubits
and the width of 20 cubits.

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.520 align:middle line:90%
82 virgins wove it.

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Two veils were made each
year, and 300 priests

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.410 align:middle line:84%
were needed to carry
it to the pool."

00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:00.580 align:middle line:90%
That's very exact.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.210 align:middle line:84%
To say there's 300 priests that
are used to carry this veil,

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.339 align:middle line:84%
that's an extraordinary
number and points

00:17:06.339 --> 00:17:11.150 align:middle line:84%
to the incredible
mystery of this veil.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.069 align:middle line:84%
We find another
reference to the women

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:17.000 align:middle line:84%
who made the veils for the
Temple and baked the shoe bread

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.680 align:middle line:90%
and prepared the incense--

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.920 align:middle line:84%
this according to the
Babylonian Talmud.

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.470 align:middle line:10%
This shoe bread is
extremely mysterious,

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.010 align:middle line:10%
as it's also known as manna
star food, white powder

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.580 align:middle line:10%
gold, or ormus to some.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:10%
Originally, it was made by
Bezalel, the Goldsmith who

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.950 align:middle line:10%
made the Ark of the Covenant.

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.760 align:middle line:10%
And it is believed by some
that this manna, or star food,

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:10%
was a highly energetic substance
that feeds the light body.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.300 align:middle line:84%
All of these references tell us
that the virgins of the temple,

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:56.570 align:middle line:84%
including Mary, were special
and highly trained priestesses.

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.760 align:middle line:84%
Taken literally,
they tell us they

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.760 align:middle line:84%
were weavers of
cosmic energies that

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:06.260 align:middle line:84%
could produce a veil or conduit
linking heaven and earth.

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And from this same
material, they

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.370 align:middle line:84%
wove the bodies of
light, or robes of light,

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.170 align:middle line:90%
like the angels.

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.010 align:middle line:90%


00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:17.440 align:middle line:84%
Rabbinic Jewish
sources also record

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.700 align:middle line:84%
how, when the Romans
sacked Jerusalem in AD 70,

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.970 align:middle line:84%
the Temple virgins
leapt into the flames

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:29.140 align:middle line:84%
so as not to be abducted
by the heathen soldiers.

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:31.990 align:middle line:84%
Jesus mysteriously
parted this veil

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:84%
that they had woven
during the crucifixion.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.710 align:middle line:84%
Says Matthew, "And behold,
the veil of the Temple

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.100 align:middle line:84%
was rent in twain from
the top to the bottom,

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.560 align:middle line:84%
and the earth did quake,
and the rocks rent."

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.300 align:middle line:84%
The Gospel of Matthew
further relates

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.980 align:middle line:84%
that immediately
after the crucifixion,

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:57.150 align:middle line:84%
the earth shook and an angel
of the Lord, a Watcher,

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:middle line:84%
came down out of heaven whose
appearance was like lightning--

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.540 align:middle line:90%
plasma?

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And his clothing
was white as snow.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.510 align:middle line:84%
There was also darkness
and an eclipse.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:12.000 align:middle line:84%
The star-covered veil
in Solomon's temple

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.350 align:middle line:84%
was torn in two and many
people rose from the dead

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.250 align:middle line:84%
and walked about in Jerusalem
and were seen by many people

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.830 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:25.860 align:middle line:84%
The importance of
the veil is that it

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.550 align:middle line:84%
marked the division
between earth and heaven

00:19:29.550 --> 00:19:35.070 align:middle line:84%
and hid the throne and its
meaning from mortal eyes.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.350 align:middle line:84%
Knowledge of these
secrets meant one

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:42.030 align:middle line:84%
was capable of manipulating the
elements or forces of creation,

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:84%
and this is why
their secrets were

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:48.060 align:middle line:84%
withheld from ordinary
humans who might misuse them.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:52.860 align:middle line:90%
But Mary knew these secrets.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:56.850 align:middle line:10%
Central to my thesis is Dr.
Margaret Barker's proposal

00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:00.000 align:middle line:84%
that this veil that
Mary wove was viewed

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.300 align:middle line:84%
as a boundary between
heaven and earth,

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:07.050 align:middle line:84%
the visible and the
invisible world, between time

00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.640 align:middle line:90%
and eternity.

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.360 align:middle line:84%
And parting this wall
of light took one

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:18.210 align:middle line:84%
beyond the material world and
into the immaterial world.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.160 align:middle line:84%
The mysteries of this veil
were central to the Essenes.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And as we have noted,
they were called the Raz.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.330 align:middle line:84%
Philo says that the veil
separated the changeable parts

00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.880 align:middle line:84%
of the world from the
heavenly region, which

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.320 align:middle line:84%
is without transient
events and is unchanging.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.040 align:middle line:84%
And the people who pass through
this veil, notes Dr. Barker,

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.780 align:middle line:84%
were the mediators, divine and
human, clad in the priestly

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:48.690 align:middle line:84%
garments that match
the rainbow light body,

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and who walked
between the worlds

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:55.020 align:middle line:84%
in order to bring blessings
and the presence of God

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.760 align:middle line:90%
to their people.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.970 align:middle line:84%
We can easily tie this veil
into the rainbow light body.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.340 align:middle line:84%
It is made of the same
material as the clothing

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.600 align:middle line:90%
of the high priest.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.300 align:middle line:84%
And the high priest's
clothing, we have seen,

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.180 align:middle line:84%
matches the symbolism of
the rainbow light body.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.510 align:middle line:84%
These are the ultimate
secrets that the Virgin

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:19.620 align:middle line:90%
Mary would have been privy to.

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.910 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes sought this bodily
and spiritual perfection

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:26.940 align:middle line:84%
of the light body in
order to cross over

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.650 align:middle line:84%
this veil, or boundary, and
commune with the angelic beings

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.130 align:middle line:84%
and to stand united with
the angels before God

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.910 align:middle line:84%
and, as the scrolls say, to
live in a state of perfect light

00:21:38.910 --> 00:21:42.580 align:middle line:90%
for all eternity.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.660 align:middle line:84%
So this takes us to the
root of the knowledge

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.530 align:middle line:84%
the priestesses, including
Mary, would have possessed,

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:55.310 align:middle line:84%
and it precisely matches the
aims and goals of the Essenes.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:58.460 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we're
talking about Mary

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:02.180 align:middle line:84%
as an advanced
adept or avatar who

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.970 align:middle line:84%
incarnated on earth
to participate

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.120 align:middle line:90%
in a profound cosmic mission.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.970 align:middle line:84%
As shown at Lourdes
in southern France,

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.450 align:middle line:84%
she is more properly thought
of as the leader of a group

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:18.020 align:middle line:90%
of illumed initiates and Magi.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.320 align:middle line:84%
This is one of my favorite
depictions of Mary.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.830 align:middle line:84%
One reason is because with
the flame of illumination

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:27.590 align:middle line:84%
coming from the top of
her head, she highly

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:33.350 align:middle line:84%
resembles the depictions of
Kuan Yin, goddess of compassion.

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:38.840 align:middle line:84%
Mary and Kuan Yin are a
perfect fit for one another.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Mary's primary vision
was to bring to earth

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:48.920 align:middle line:84%
a star child whose incarnation
would fulfill the Essenes' aim

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.490 align:middle line:84%
to bring a high celestial
being to earth in order

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:56.360 align:middle line:90%
to transform the human race.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.810 align:middle line:84%
Incarnation, the
appearance of this being,

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:05.600 align:middle line:84%
literally means "embodied in
flesh or taking on flesh."

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.470 align:middle line:84%
It refers to the conception
and birth of a sentient being

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:middle line:84%
who is the material
manifestation

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.510 align:middle line:84%
of an entity, a
god, or force whose

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.260 align:middle line:90%
original nature is immaterial.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.750 align:middle line:84%
In its religious context,
the word incarnation

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.330 align:middle line:84%
is used to mean the
descent from heaven

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:29.600 align:middle line:84%
of a god, deity, or divine
being in human form on earth.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And that was Mary's
role, was to incarnate,

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:38.250 align:middle line:84%
to manifest into flesh,
this high celestial being.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.380 align:middle line:84%
The New Testament's
Book of Revelation

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:43.440 align:middle line:84%
describes the Woman
of the Apocalypse

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.910 align:middle line:84%
who would bring
forth this child.

00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.120 align:middle line:84%
Then God's Temple in
heaven was opened, it says,

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.720 align:middle line:84%
and the Ark of his Covenant
was seen within his temple.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.450 align:middle line:84%
And there were flashes
of lightning, voices,

00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:00.770 align:middle line:84%
peals of thunder, an
earthquake, and heavy hail.

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:04.370 align:middle line:84%
And there appeared a
great wonder in heaven--

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:09.740 align:middle line:84%
a woman, Mary, clothed with the
sun and the moon under her feet

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:13.190 align:middle line:84%
and upon her head a
crown of 12 stars.

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:17.030 align:middle line:84%
She is a plasma being
with a plasma crown.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:20.810 align:middle line:84%
She is pregnant and about
to give birth to a son,

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:23.750 align:middle line:84%
Jesus, who will fulfill
the Essene mission

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.030 align:middle line:84%
and will rule, the Book
of Revelation says,

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.980 align:middle line:90%
with the rod of iron.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:33.020 align:middle line:84%
And her child was caught up
unto God and to his throne.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.380 align:middle line:84%
The Woman of the
Apocalypse, they call Mary.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.980 align:middle line:84%
Remember, the word apocalypse,
used to describe Mary,

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.740 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
Greek apokalypsis,

00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:46.880 align:middle line:84%
meaning an uncovering,
a lifting of the veil,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.850 align:middle line:84%
or the disclosure of
something hidden--

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.620 align:middle line:90%
a surprise.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.800 align:middle line:90%
To be veiled means to weave.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And there is that concept
appearing, once again,

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.160 align:middle line:84%
of weaving, the role
of the divine feminine.

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.800 align:middle line:84%
And we know that Mary
herself was a weaver.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.330 align:middle line:84%
According to esteemed Yale
divinity scholar John J.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.130 align:middle line:90%
Collins--

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
writing in his book, "The
Apocalyptic Imagination,

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.460 align:middle line:84%
An Introduction to Jewish
Apocalyptic Literature"--

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:21.830 align:middle line:84%
apocalypse is a genre
of revelatory literature

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:23.780 align:middle line:84%
with a narrative
framework in which

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:28.430 align:middle line:84%
a revelation is mediated
by an other-worldly

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:32.480 align:middle line:90%
being to a human recipient.

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Its purpose is to disclose
a transcendent reality which

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:40.070 align:middle line:84%
is both temporal, in so far
as an eschatological salvation

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.000 align:middle line:84%
or an end-time scenario, and
spatial, he says, in so far

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.690 align:middle line:84%
as it involves another
supernatural world.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:51.650 align:middle line:10%
One of the most distinctive
features of the apocalyptic

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.110 align:middle line:10%
literature-- says Christopher
Roland in his book,

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.260 align:middle line:10%
"The Open Heaven, A Study
of Apocalyptic and Judaism

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:59.420 align:middle line:10%
in Early Christianity"--

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.270 align:middle line:10%
is the conviction
that the seer--

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.290 align:middle line:10%
in this case, Mary--

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.740 align:middle line:10%
could pierce the vault
of heaven and look

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:11.900 align:middle line:10%
upon the glorious world
of God and His angels.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:16.340 align:middle line:84%
This is expressed by the term
"the heavens opened," as,

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.760 align:middle line:84%
for example, during
the ascension of Jesus

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.690 align:middle line:84%
or the belief that
a door opened.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.410 align:middle line:84%
As the Woman of the
Apocalypse, Mary, once again,

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.250 align:middle line:84%
would have known that
the high celestial being,

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:34.490 align:middle line:90%
the star child was on his way.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.800 align:middle line:84%
She would have pierced
the veil, looked

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:84%
into the celestial
realms, and known

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.180 align:middle line:90%
this being was soon to arrive.

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:45.640 align:middle line:84%
She would have seen
beyond the veil.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So while many seek
the star of the Magi

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.670 align:middle line:84%
in traditional
Christian teaching,

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Gnostic writers believe that
the Magi, who sought the Christ

00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:02.440 align:middle line:84%
child, were actually seeking
not a star, but a star child.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.980 align:middle line:84%
This perfectly aligns
with the Essenes' belief

00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:11.100 align:middle line:84%
that they were calling in
a high celestial being.

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:14.490 align:middle line:10%
This is the premise of
"Revelation of the Magi,"

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:18.840 align:middle line:10%
an extraordinary eighth century
Gnostic manuscript resurrected

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.010 align:middle line:10%
from the Vatican archives by
Dr. Brent Landau, who provided

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:26.040 align:middle line:10%
a first ever English translation
and critical analysis

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.890 align:middle line:10%
of this remarkable text--

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:31.740 align:middle line:10%
and one that is largely unknown.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:35.190 align:middle line:84%
This book tells the familiar
story of the three kings,

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:39.210 align:middle line:84%
or Magi, who follow a star
in search of the Christ child

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:42.120 align:middle line:84%
but from a completely
different perspective.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.940 align:middle line:84%
It's from the Essene
or Gnostic perspective.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.320 align:middle line:84%
And in this story, the star
child, the celestial being,

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.290 align:middle line:84%
appears in the sky,
descends from the heavens--

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.040 align:middle line:84%
which open like a
great star gate--

00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:01.740 align:middle line:84%
and enters a cave, inviting
the Magi to come inside.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.560 align:middle line:90%
In the cave, a gate opens.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:09.570 align:middle line:10%
And the star takes the form of
a small and humble human being

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:12.180 align:middle line:10%
and tells the Magi
that such a form

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:14.970 align:middle line:10%
is necessary for the
inhabitants of the world

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.330 align:middle line:10%
to see the son of the
Father, indicating

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:23.850 align:middle line:10%
that this star child is none
other than Christ himself.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Christ then tells
the Magi that he

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.830 align:middle line:84%
has been sent from the
Father for their salvation

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.550 align:middle line:84%
of all humanity and
instructs the Magi to follow

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:38.760 align:middle line:84%
the star to Bethlehem to
see his birth in human form.

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.460 align:middle line:10%
The star upon which
he rode is also

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.220 align:middle line:10%
described in the
Protoevangelium of James

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:49.320 align:middle line:10%
as being "very great and
so bright in the skies

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:52.200 align:middle line:10%
that it dimmed all
the other stars

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:55.380 align:middle line:10%
so that they appeared not."

00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.110 align:middle line:84%
It's clear that the
"Revelation of the Magi"

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.740 align:middle line:84%
is describing the arrival
of the high celestial

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:06.840 align:middle line:84%
being the Essenes were awaiting
and that this being could take

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.990 align:middle line:84%
on human flesh and blood
form, but could also

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:15.840 align:middle line:84%
transform or morph back into
its original angelic light body.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.920 align:middle line:90%


00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.000 align:middle line:10%
Psalm 110 describes
this child's birth

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.670 align:middle line:10%
and how he becomes a priest
forever like Melchizedek.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:34.460 align:middle line:84%
With this birth, Mary's job
would have only just begun.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:37.730 align:middle line:84%
However, it is clear from
what we have discussed

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.590 align:middle line:84%
that she would have
been instructed

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:42.350 align:middle line:84%
in the secrets of
the veil, or the Raz,

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:45.860 align:middle line:84%
as the Essenes called
it and much, much more.

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And undoubtedly, she would have
initiated or trained her child

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.970 align:middle line:90%
in these mysteries.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.330 align:middle line:84%
What I have just
presented about Mary

00:29:56.330 --> 00:30:00.050 align:middle line:84%
is a radical departure
from traditional Christian

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.450 align:middle line:90%
understanding of Mary.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:06.320 align:middle line:84%
However, it is perfectly
consistent with what

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.810 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes were
teaching and is based

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.900 align:middle line:84%
on literary and
artistic traditions that

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.020 align:middle line:90%
go back centuries.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:19.760 align:middle line:84%
As always, it's our job
to do our own research

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.580 align:middle line:84%
to get the truths of
the ancient world.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.340 align:middle line:84%
And in my humble
opinion, those truths

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:30.950 align:middle line:84%
are far more incredible
than most realize.

00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:33.760 align:middle line:84%
What we can take away
from this investigation

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:41.110 align:middle line:84%
is that Mary was a truly special
adept or even an avatar--

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:45.610 align:middle line:84%
part about long chain or
line of such priestesses

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.940 align:middle line:84%
who have been specially
trained through the ages

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:52.600 align:middle line:84%
in order to infuse the
human genome with something

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.890 align:middle line:84%
new, something special,
something cosmic.

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.760 align:middle line:84%
And we can see how the Essenes
would have gladly awaited

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.320 align:middle line:84%
the arrival of this
being, but they

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:05.890 align:middle line:84%
would have needed the
priestesses like Mary to assist

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.590 align:middle line:84%
in the revelation
of this being--

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:12.430 align:middle line:84%
to assist by willingly
transforming their body,

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:16.450 align:middle line:84%
by becoming purer than
the ordinary person.

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:18.767 align:middle line:84%
As we have seen, the
purity was a prerequisite

00:31:18.767 --> 00:31:20.350 align:middle line:84%
because the Essenes
believed that they

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.720 align:middle line:90%
were living with angels.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And we saw that
incredible testimony

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:26.980 align:middle line:84%
that the Essenes believed
that purity could even

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.990 align:middle line:90%
go back upstream.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.720 align:middle line:90%
That is an incredible concept.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.990 align:middle line:84%
By looking at Mary
from this perspective,

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:39.970 align:middle line:84%
we gain not only a new light
on the incarnation of Christ,

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:44.320 align:middle line:84%
but also a new light on
the incredible teachings

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.690 align:middle line:84%
that Mary must have
embodied and what

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:48.730 align:middle line:90%
she would have passed along.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.520 align:middle line:84%
And as men and women, we
can admire those teachings,

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.970 align:middle line:84%
but we ourselves can
also participate in them.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.900 align:middle line:84%
We participate by
learning her true story

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.450 align:middle line:84%
and learning of our
cosmic connections.
