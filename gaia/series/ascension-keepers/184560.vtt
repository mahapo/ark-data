00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.570 align:middle line:10%
One of the most profound,
if not the most profound,

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:10%
of the numerous post-ascension
appearances of the risen Jesus

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.970 align:middle line:10%
occurred in Assisi, Italy
in the 13th century.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.780 align:middle line:84%
When he appeared to the man
we now call Saint Francis.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.890 align:middle line:10%
And who is known as the founder
of the Franciscan Order.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.070 align:middle line:84%
Dante, Giotto, Michelangelo
are Franciscans.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.130 align:middle line:10%
A son was born into the world.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
With these words in
The Divine Comedy,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.950 align:middle line:90%
Dante alludes to Francis' birth.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.820 align:middle line:84%
His contemporaries viewed
him in messianic terms.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.950 align:middle line:84%
Thinking that he blazed a trail
of light for our ascension.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.820 align:middle line:84%
Born Giovanni di Piertro
di Bernardone, Francis

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
was raised in
wealth and privilege

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.380 align:middle line:84%
by a father who
was a cloth trader.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.560 align:middle line:84%
He awoke from the dream
of his upbringing.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.100 align:middle line:84%
And like Jacob, traded
his rich clothes

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.830 align:middle line:84%
and began the quest
for the right clothes

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.980 align:middle line:90%
to scale the ladder to heaven.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.930 align:middle line:84%
He was known as the
gentle saint who

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.290 align:middle line:84%
spoke with birds,
tamed wolves, and who

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.260 align:middle line:90%
turned Europe upside down.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.510 align:middle line:84%
Pope Benedict called him
a giant among holy men.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.380 align:middle line:84%
His life arc took him from a
life of wealth and privilege

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.960 align:middle line:90%
to self-chosen material poverty.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.120 align:middle line:84%
And on to the highest
spiritual heights.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.860 align:middle line:84%
Francis became known as Jesus'
brother and the second Christ

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.960 align:middle line:90%
to his followers.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:84%
One reason why is
because it is claimed

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.830 align:middle line:84%
that he lived the Sermon on the
Mount better than anyone else.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.360 align:middle line:84%
The Sermon on the Mount is the
most famous sermon Jesus gave

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.970 align:middle line:90%
and his most esoteric.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.050 align:middle line:84%
In it, he delivers the
Beatitudes or eight ascending

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.700 align:middle line:84%
steps towards attaining the
blessedness of a divine life.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.120 align:middle line:84%
The eight Beatitudes as
recorded in Matthew are,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.300 align:middle line:84%
blessed are those who mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.580 align:middle line:84%
Blessed are the poor
in spirit, for theirs

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.260 align:middle line:90%
is the kingdom of heaven.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.710 align:middle line:84%
Blessed are the meek, for
they shall inherit the land.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.160 align:middle line:84%
Blessed are they who hunger
and thirst for righteousness,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.170 align:middle line:90%
for they will be satisfied.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.590 align:middle line:84%
Blessed are the merciful,
for they will be shown mercy.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.100 align:middle line:84%
Blessed are the pure of
heart, for they will see God.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Blessed are the
peacemakers, for they will

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.360 align:middle line:90%
be called the children of God.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And blessed are they
who were persecuted

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.800 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of
righteousness, for theirs

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.130 align:middle line:90%
is the kingdom of heaven.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.010 align:middle line:84%
The Beatitudes describe
the qualities of perfection

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.570 align:middle line:84%
that all who seek
ascension should embody.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.220 align:middle line:84%
The thing is scholars now
know the Beatitudes found

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.390 align:middle line:84%
in this sermon were
derived from these scenes.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.360 align:middle line:10%
Scroll 4Q525 reads, "Blessed
is with a pure heart

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.940 align:middle line:10%
and does not slander
with his tongue--

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.760 align:middle line:10%
blessed are those,
who hold to her,

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.410 align:middle line:10%
or wisdoms precepts do not
hold to the ways of iniquity.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:84%
Blessed are those,
who rejoice in her

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.050 align:middle line:84%
and do not burst forth
in ways of folly.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.540 align:middle line:84%
Blessed are those, who
seek her with pure hands

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.140 align:middle line:84%
and do not pursue her
with a treacherous heart.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.990 align:middle line:10%
Blessed is a man, who
has attained wisdom

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.210 align:middle line:10%
and walks in the law
of the most high."

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.110 align:middle line:84%
The words of Jesus'
Beatitudes are attributed

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.900 align:middle line:84%
to those of the Teacher
of Righteousness,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.230 align:middle line:84%
the founder of the Essenes,
who they recognized

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.870 align:middle line:90%
as their long-awaited messiah.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.700 align:middle line:84%
And as the "Dead Sea Scrolls"
were written before the New

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.630 align:middle line:84%
Testament, Jesus is clearly
quoting this Essene messiah.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.240 align:middle line:84%
This was the figure
the Essenes referred to

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.769 align:middle line:84%
as the high celestial
being they were calling in.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.290 align:middle line:84%
The content of the
Beatitudes can also

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.520 align:middle line:84%
be found in the credo
or credo of the Essenes.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.740 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly,
scholars understand

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.100 align:middle line:84%
the sermon for both Jesus'
original speaking and Matthew's

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.770 align:middle line:84%
writing is designed as an oral,
memorizable meditation device.

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.280 align:middle line:84%
By repeating it over
and over and over,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.600 align:middle line:84%
we anchor the ascension
energies of this teaching

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.820 align:middle line:84%
and begin to tune
into our future self

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.420 align:middle line:90%
that lives the Beatitudes.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.270 align:middle line:84%
As one who climbed the
mountain of ascension

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.430 align:middle line:84%
by living the sermon
better than others,

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.850 align:middle line:84%
we may say that
Francis of Assisi

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.630 align:middle line:84%
lived the Essene way better than
anyone else during his time,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.740 align:middle line:90%
or maybe even since the Essenes.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.190 align:middle line:10%
That is a very powerful and
underacknowledged statement

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.680 align:middle line:10%
about Francis.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.530 align:middle line:84%
We should also not be surprised
to learn that Saint Francis was

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.560 align:middle line:90%
known as God's troubadour.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.970 align:middle line:84%
It is certain that he knew about
the Cathars and the Troubadours

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.670 align:middle line:84%
through either of them or
through the Troubadours

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.070 align:middle line:84%
he encountered as a
young man in Assisi

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.030 align:middle line:84%
or while he was a prisoner
for a year in Peruggia.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.550 align:middle line:84%
The Troubadours
were Cathars, who

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.100 align:middle line:90%
were on the path of ascension.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.960 align:middle line:84%
And Francis, it
is well known, was

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.600 align:middle line:84%
a great lover of
French Troubadour songs

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.100 align:middle line:90%
and traditions.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.520 align:middle line:84%
Though he lived and taught
within the Catholic church,

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.790 align:middle line:84%
elements of Cathar and
Troubador spirituality

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.670 align:middle line:84%
can be seen in his
own radiant ministry--

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:84%
his love of nature, particularly
the sun and the moon,

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.470 align:middle line:84%
his vision of a divine
woman, and his relationship

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.350 align:middle line:84%
with Saint Clair,
which was very much

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.830 align:middle line:84%
in the tradition of the chaste
lover-beloved relationship

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.310 align:middle line:90%
of the Troubadours.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.920 align:middle line:84%
Connecting Francis
with the Troubadours

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.110 align:middle line:84%
gives us a lot of room to
superimpose a Cathar lens

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.160 align:middle line:90%
on his story.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.700 align:middle line:84%
However, the recorded
story of his life,

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.030 align:middle line:84%
the history of his
life is explicit enough

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.420 align:middle line:84%
in telling us that Francis'
extraordinary spiritual

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:38.070 align:middle line:84%
experiences matched those, which
were the goal of the Essenes.

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.760 align:middle line:10%
He not only lived a life
based on the Beatitudes, which

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.920 align:middle line:10%
were based on Essene teaching.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.070 align:middle line:84%
But he also had an
encounter with a Seraphim,

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.276 align:middle line:84%
the same angels the Essenes
claimed to be living with.

00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:55.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Francis' title,
the second Christ,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.370 align:middle line:84%
was bequeathed upon him by
a contemporary biographer

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.820 align:middle line:84%
after he became the
first person to receive

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.760 align:middle line:84%
the stigmata, the five wounds
of the crucified Christ.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
This happened through a
profound mystical encounter

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.720 align:middle line:84%
with an apparition of
Jesus, who appeared

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.770 align:middle line:90%
to Francis as a seraph angel.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:25.570 align:middle line:84%
During this encounter, Jesus
beamed five rays of light

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.920 align:middle line:84%
into Francis' flesh, one
for each of the five wounds

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.940 align:middle line:84%
Jesus endured during
the crucifixion.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.190 align:middle line:84%
Adding to the
intrigue of this event

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.740 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that
the Franciscans have

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.470 align:middle line:84%
been named as the protectors
of the Arma Christi,

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:45.200 align:middle line:90%
or the artifacts of Jesus.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.010 align:middle line:10%
To me, Jan van Eyck's
version of the stigmatization

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.890 align:middle line:10%
of St. Francis, which
we're looking at here,

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:55.940 align:middle line:10%
is perhaps the most stunning.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.920 align:middle line:84%
As we have discussed,
the seraphim

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.030 align:middle line:84%
exist in the exact same state
of being as the resurrected

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Christ.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:90%
They are light beings.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.720 align:middle line:84%
The Seraph Jesus is strikingly
similar to this fourth

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.590 align:middle line:84%
or possibly 10th century
Egyptian Christian image

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:19.270 align:middle line:84%
from the Nubian Museum
in Aswan, Egypt.

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.020 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's from the
4th or 10th century,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.340 align:middle line:90%
it doesn't matter.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.280 align:middle line:84%
This is evidence that
some early Christians,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.760 align:middle line:84%
before the time of Francis of
Assisi in the 13th century,

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.280 align:middle line:90%
saw the risen Jesus as a Seraph.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:90%
So why not Francis?

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.830 align:middle line:90%


00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.500 align:middle line:84%
We will return to Francis
of Assisi's encounter

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.570 align:middle line:84%
with Jesus as a
Seraph in a moment.

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.310 align:middle line:84%
For now, we will note that
this encounter didn't just

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.800 align:middle line:90%
happen spontaneously.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:55.340 align:middle line:84%
No, Francis spent his entire
adult life preparing for it.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.500 align:middle line:84%
Here's the back story
to this encounter.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.780 align:middle line:90%
The year is 1205.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.150 align:middle line:84%
And the air of France
in northern Italy,

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.600 align:middle line:84%
where Francis lives, is thick
with the ascension teachings

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.940 align:middle line:84%
of Jewish and Sufi
mysticism that

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.850 align:middle line:84%
focuses on attaining
the light body

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:14.580 align:middle line:84%
and ascending to
the throne of God.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.190 align:middle line:84%
The Cathar heresy
is on the rise.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And Francis is deeply
affected by it.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.630 align:middle line:10%
Preaching from their lofty
monasteries in southern France,

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.200 align:middle line:10%
the Cathars lived by
the vision of Isaiah,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.500 align:middle line:10%
which describes Isaiah's
vision of a stairway to heaven

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.620 align:middle line:10%
and his encounter with a Seraph.

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:38.640 align:middle line:84%
Isaiah is seen encountering
a Seraph in this vision.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.470 align:middle line:84%
One could make the
argument that Francis

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.960 align:middle line:90%
followed the path of Isaiah.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.260 align:middle line:84%
And it led him to this
same ultimate experience,

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.110 align:middle line:84%
the encounter with the
Seraph, in this case,

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:51.930 align:middle line:90%
Jesus as a Seraph.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Life is a training ground
for this experience

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.020 align:middle line:84%
and the ascension that is
required in order to partake

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.930 align:middle line:90%
in it or so the Cathars taught.

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.300 align:middle line:84%
They claimed to possess
the secret asenscion

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.010 align:middle line:90%
teachings of Jesus.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.730 align:middle line:84%
They are violently opposed
by the Church of Rome

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.600 align:middle line:84%
and Pope Innocent III, who
seeks to eliminate the Cathar

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.760 align:middle line:84%
heresy in France and its
so-called ascension secrets.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.640 align:middle line:10%
At that time, the
church knew it needed

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.160 align:middle line:10%
an infusion of new spirit,
to put it politely.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.450 align:middle line:84%
Little did Innocent III know,
but a second ascension front

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:34.790 align:middle line:84%
was about to open in his own
backyard in Italy in Assisi.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.180 align:middle line:84%
The person opening
the door was Francis.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.230 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.230 align:middle line:84%
Assisi has a pure
spiritual essence

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:90%
that is palpable to visitors.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.050 align:middle line:90%
It is a truly holy place.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.970 align:middle line:84%
And one wonders if the place
possessed this Holy Spirit

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:55.750 align:middle line:84%
before Francis arrived or
if maybe he left it there

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:59.410 align:middle line:90%
for us to imbibe and to enjoy.

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:02.410 align:middle line:10%
As I said, Francis was
raised by wealthy parents.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.970 align:middle line:10%
And it's fair to
say that he lived

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:07.240 align:middle line:10%
the life of an Italian prince.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.450 align:middle line:84%
But in 1202, he left
his life of luxury

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.630 align:middle line:84%
to march off to battle
against the city of Peruggia,

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.350 align:middle line:84%
seeking military glory like
most young men would do.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.800 align:middle line:10%
He was taken prisoner
during the battle.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.360 align:middle line:84%
And when he finally
went home a year later,

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.600 align:middle line:84%
he spent another
year convalescing.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.300 align:middle line:10%
During this time, Francis
began to experience

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.210 align:middle line:10%
dreams and visions.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.460 align:middle line:84%
His journey up the
ladder to heaven

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.010 align:middle line:84%
took a dramatic turn
when he found himself

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.390 align:middle line:84%
alone in the Church of
St. Damian near Assisi.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.540 align:middle line:84%
He looks up at the
painted crucifix.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.560 align:middle line:84%
The face is compassionate,
radiating hope.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.940 align:middle line:84%
The hair has triple
locks, like three rays.

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.140 align:middle line:84%
Above his crown is a
portrayal of the ascension,

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:00.280 align:middle line:84%
Christ emerging from a red
circle, an orb of light holding

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.800 align:middle line:90%
a golden cross, his rod.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.970 align:middle line:84%
He is greeted by
other perfected ones.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.800 align:middle line:84%
In a vision, the image of Christ
in the crucifix miraculously

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:16.510 align:middle line:84%
begins to speak to Francis,
saying, go repair my church,

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.520 align:middle line:84%
which you see has fallen
completely in ruin.

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.580 align:middle line:10%
Now art, especially sacred
art, has extraordinary, even

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.790 align:middle line:10%
supernatural power.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.100 align:middle line:10%
And the idea that a piece of
art, in this case, a painted

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.700 align:middle line:10%
crucifix, could
transmit a holy message

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.120 align:middle line:10%
or a sacred spiritual energy,
in this case, to Francis,

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.300 align:middle line:10%
is the core idea of what
is known as Arcanum,

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.820 align:middle line:10%
the sacred art of ascension.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:46.420 align:middle line:84%
Francis may or may know
about this ability of art

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.560 align:middle line:90%
to speak to us.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.190 align:middle line:84%
But he thinks he is
charged with rebuilding

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.100 align:middle line:84%
the dilapidated
church at St. Damien.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.750 align:middle line:84%
But he soon realizes it is the
Catholic church that Francis

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.630 align:middle line:90%
is charged with rebuilding.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.560 align:middle line:84%
This puts him on a collision
course with Pope Innocent III.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:84%
And strangely or perhaps not,
in 1207, Pope Innocent III

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.970 align:middle line:90%
himself had a dream.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:16.720 align:middle line:10%
In it, he saw the Basilica of
Saint John Lateran, the mother

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.620 align:middle line:10%
of all churches in
Rome, collapsing

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:23.320 align:middle line:10%
and one small and
insignificant religious brother

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.660 align:middle line:10%
supporting the church
on his shoulders

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.450 align:middle line:10%
to prevent it from falling.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.980 align:middle line:84%
Two years later, Francis of
Assisi would come calling.

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.480 align:middle line:84%
When Francis finally meets
Innocent III in 1209,

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.570 align:middle line:84%
it had to have been an
extraordinary meeting.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.600 align:middle line:10%
But Pope Innocent
III agrees to work

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.410 align:middle line:10%
not in opposition to
Francis, but in communion

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.500 align:middle line:10%
with him, the
power of his dream.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:56.080 align:middle line:84%
Francis is allowed to
open the Franciscan order.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.680 align:middle line:84%
And after his encounter
with the talking crucifix,

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Francis began selling his
personal and family possessions

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.750 align:middle line:90%
in order to repair the church.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.960 align:middle line:84%
When his father learned
of this, he was furious.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.060 align:middle line:84%
He dragged Francis
before a local bishop

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.110 align:middle line:84%
to force his son into stopping
this bizarre behavior.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Francis responded by
taking off his clothes

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.680 align:middle line:84%
and swearing his devotion to
the father, who art in heaven

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.470 align:middle line:90%
rather than his Earthly father.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:30.430 align:middle line:84%
He walked out of the
cathedral to become a hermit.

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:33.640 align:middle line:10%
The talking crucifix
episode is just

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:39.260 align:middle line:10%
the beginning of Francis'
mystical encounter with Christ.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:42.340 align:middle line:10%
In 1208, now in his
mid 20s, Francis

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.180 align:middle line:10%
hears mass on the
feast of Saint Matthew

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.800 align:middle line:10%
and is impressed by
Jesus's instruction

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.050 align:middle line:10%
given in this gospel.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Take no gold nor silver
nor money in your belt,

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.530 align:middle line:84%
no bag for your journey,
not two tunics, no sandals,

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:58.920 align:middle line:90%
nor a staff.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.980 align:middle line:84%
Francis had his first
glimpse of his future.

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.790 align:middle line:90%
He had his first vision.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.860 align:middle line:10%
And for him, the road to
heaven is paved with poverty.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.590 align:middle line:84%
Later in the book of
Matthew, Jesus directly

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.110 align:middle line:84%
references human
perfection when he

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:84%
tells a rich man,
who had asked Jesus

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:19.110 align:middle line:84%
what he needed to do in
order to attain eternal life.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:23.800 align:middle line:84%
Jesus replies, if you want to
be perfect, meaning whole, holy,

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:26.430 align:middle line:84%
and complete, go and
sell what you've got.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:27.690 align:middle line:90%
Give it to the poor.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:32.490 align:middle line:84%
And thou shall have treasure in
heaven and come and follow me.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:36.900 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is talking about following
him to the heavenly realm.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And our stuff isn't
coming with us.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.590 align:middle line:84%
Jesus then says to his
disciples, I say to you,

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.220 align:middle line:84%
it's easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.340 align:middle line:84%
than for a rich man to
enter the Kingdom of God.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.080 align:middle line:84%
And when the
disciples heard this,

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.060 align:middle line:84%
they were astonished and
said, then, who can be saved?

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.140 align:middle line:10%
When we see Jesus in a
rainbow-colored mandorla,

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:04.170 align:middle line:10%
the gate or eye of heaven,
this is the eye of the needle

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.330 align:middle line:10%
that he's referring to.

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:09.090 align:middle line:84%
And in Christian tradition,
it's the Seraphim,

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:12.480 align:middle line:84%
who guard the eye of the
needle-shaped mandorla,

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.760 align:middle line:90%
or gateway to heaven.

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.190 align:middle line:84%
In Christian art, the
gateways to heaven

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.740 align:middle line:84%
resemble what modern
science calls wormholes,

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.550 align:middle line:84%
theoretical tunnel-like
constructs that connect

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.100 align:middle line:90%
two distant regions in space.

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.460 align:middle line:84%
These cosmic shortcuts
can take us from point A

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.120 align:middle line:84%
to point B as if there
is nothing in between.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:36.630 align:middle line:84%
Several papers, one published
by two noted physicists, Leonard

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:40.840 align:middle line:84%
Susskind and Juan Maldacena,
posit that tiny wormholes

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:44.070 align:middle line:84%
act as umbilical cords
to entangled particles,

00:16:44.070 --> 00:16:49.450 align:middle line:84%
allowing them to exchange data
at faster than light speeds.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.540 align:middle line:10%
So what they're
saying is wormholes

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.000 align:middle line:10%
are umbilical
cords, which thread

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.070 align:middle line:10%
their way through the cosmos.

00:16:56.070 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:84%
The cord and the thread
are the same thing.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.580 align:middle line:84%
The message Francis
heard was that in order

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.220 align:middle line:84%
to thread the needle,
open the wormhole

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.190 align:middle line:84%
and go through the eye of the
needle to the heavenly realm,

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.790 align:middle line:84%
we will have to travel
lightly and give up everything

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:14.609 align:middle line:90%
we know of Earth life.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:16.170 align:middle line:84%
The additional
message here, again,

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:84%
is that our stuff, including
emotional and physical

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:22.140 align:middle line:90%
is clearly not going with us.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:24.690 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, it is
what is in front of us

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.300 align:middle line:90%
perhaps in our ascension.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.100 align:middle line:84%
What is preventing
us from picking up

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.240 align:middle line:84%
the needle and thread and
sowing our cloak of many colors

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:36.060 align:middle line:84%
or our garment of light
is this emotional stuff.

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Combined, these
statements tell us

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.260 align:middle line:84%
that in order to enter
the heavenly realm,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:42.630 align:middle line:90%
a transformation is required.

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.790 align:middle line:84%
We must perfect
or raise ourselves

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:47.430 align:middle line:84%
to the level of
consciousness of Christ

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:52.640 align:middle line:84%
or Christ consciousness
and the perfected ones.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.310 align:middle line:84%
As the saying goes,
behind every great man

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.260 align:middle line:90%
is an even greater woman.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:59.660 align:middle line:84%
In Jesus' life, it
was Mary Magdalene.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.720 align:middle line:84%
And Padmasambhava's life,
it was Yeshe Tsogyal,

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.340 align:middle line:90%
his female disciple.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:84%
In Francis' life,
this was Clare.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.730 align:middle line:84%
The luminous one,
Saint Clare of Assisi

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.940 align:middle line:84%
was also born into a
wealthy Italian family,

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.390 align:middle line:84%
but soon also shunned
her luxurious upbringing

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:21.620 align:middle line:84%
to embrace the life of
piety and enlightenment.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.290 align:middle line:84%
When Clare was 18,
Francis of Assisi

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.130 align:middle line:84%
came to preach in the Church
of Saint Giorgio at Assisi.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.090 align:middle line:84%
Inspired by his words, Clare
asked Francis to help her

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.220 align:middle line:90%
in dedicating her life to God.

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.560 align:middle line:90%
And he vowed to do so.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.540 align:middle line:84%
The following year,
Clare's parents

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.120 align:middle line:84%
chose a wealthy young
man for Clare to marry.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.760 align:middle line:84%
But she pointedly
refused, fleeing soon

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.600 align:middle line:84%
after to the Porziuncola Chapel,
where Francis received her.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.230 align:middle line:84%
She took vows dedicating
her life to God.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.590 align:middle line:10%
And that moment occurring
on March 20, 1212

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:10%
marked the beginning of the
Second Order of Saint Francis.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.820 align:middle line:10%
The group became known for their
austere and devout lifestyle

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.950 align:middle line:10%
and for their power
of their prayer, which

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:08.630 align:middle line:10%
is credited with saving
Assisi from invaders twice.

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Stories tell how
Francis and Clare

00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.770 align:middle line:84%
would retire to the
woods near Assisi

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.720 align:middle line:90%
to converse with each other.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.260 align:middle line:84%
The villagers of Assisi, seeing
a red glow over the forests,

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.150 align:middle line:84%
ran with buckets
of water to douse

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.790 align:middle line:90%
what they assumed was a fire.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:25.190 align:middle line:84%
Instead, they found
Francis and Clare

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:28.010 align:middle line:84%
seated in a clearing,
wrapped in conversation

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.360 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by a holy fire.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.990 align:middle line:10%
So now, let's return
to the story of how

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.870 align:middle line:10%
Francis received the Stigmata.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:41.140 align:middle line:10%
Saint Bonaventure, in his
"LIfe of Saint Francis,"

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.860 align:middle line:10%
describes Francis as being
more inflamed than usual

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.620 align:middle line:10%
with the love of God as
he began a special time

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:52.510 align:middle line:10%
of solitary prayer at La
Verna in September of 1224.

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:55.510 align:middle line:10%
His unquenchable fire of
love for the good Jesus,

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:00.370 align:middle line:10%
Bonaventure writes, was fanned
into such a blaze of flames

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:05.560 align:middle line:10%
that many waters could not
quench so powerful a love.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.150 align:middle line:90%
Bonaventure goes on.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.150 align:middle line:10%
While Francis was praying
on the mountainside,

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:16.090 align:middle line:10%
he saw a Seraph with six
fiery and shiny wings descend

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:10%
from the height of heaven.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.730 align:middle line:84%
And when, in swift
flight, the Seraph

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:26.140 align:middle line:84%
had reached a spot in the
air near the man of God,

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.600 align:middle line:84%
there appeared between
the wings the figure

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.240 align:middle line:84%
of a man crucified
with his hands

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.510 align:middle line:84%
and feet extended in
the form of a cross

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:37.450 align:middle line:90%
and fastened to a cross.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Two of the wings were
lifted above his head.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:41.830 align:middle line:90%
Two were extended for flight.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:45.880 align:middle line:90%
And two covered his whole body.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:49.510 align:middle line:84%
While Francis saw this,
he was overwhelmed.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:54.220 align:middle line:84%
And his heart was flooded with
a mixture of joy and sorrow.

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.470 align:middle line:84%
He rejoiced because
of the gracious way

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.220 align:middle line:84%
Christ looked upon him under
the appearance of a Seraph.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.830 align:middle line:84%
But the fact that he
was fastened to a cross

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.055 align:middle line:84%
pierced his soul with the
sword of compassionate sorrow.

00:21:06.055 --> 00:21:08.680 align:middle line:90%


00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.590 align:middle line:10%
It is said that whoever
lays eyes on a Seraph,

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:14.140 align:middle line:10%
he would be
instantly incinerated

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.320 align:middle line:10%
due to the immense
brightness of the Seraph.

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:19.360 align:middle line:90%
That may be true for some.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:23.740 align:middle line:84%
For others, especially the
awakened, contact with a Seraph

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.740 align:middle line:84%
results not in
incineration but rather

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:32.110 align:middle line:84%
transference of a divine
energy and transformation

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.880 align:middle line:90%
into a Seraph.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:10%
This is what
Francis experienced.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:41.470 align:middle line:10%
In fact, Renaissance thinkers,
taking up Francis' mantle

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:46.150 align:middle line:10%
believed humans can transform
into Seraphim by meditating

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.070 align:middle line:10%
on the love of the Creator.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:53.230 align:middle line:10%
In fact, that is our
highest human aspiration.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.490 align:middle line:84%
In a moment of what scholars
call seraphic ecstasy,

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Francis, who had sought to
imitate Christ in all things

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:08.020 align:middle line:84%
actually received the marks
of crucifixion on his body.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.530 align:middle line:10%
As Saint Bonaventure
acknowledges and lends supports

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:15.610 align:middle line:10%
for, writing in his book "The
Major Legend of Saint Francis,"

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:19.660 align:middle line:10%
through the Stigmata,
the true love of Christ

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:25.550 align:middle line:10%
transformed the
lover into his image.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.380 align:middle line:84%
When the vision
disappeared, writes

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Bonaventure, Francis was
left with a marvelous

00:22:31.460 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:90%
ardor in his heart--

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.880 align:middle line:84%
a new frequency,
a new vibration.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.750 align:middle line:84%
And at the same time, there were
imprinted on his body markings

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:43.820 align:middle line:90%
that were no less marvelous.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.890 align:middle line:84%
These markings
were the Stigmata.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.230 align:middle line:10%
And after receiving
the Stigmata,

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:10%
Francis became known
by his contemporaries

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.385 align:middle line:10%
as the second Christ.

00:22:52.385 --> 00:22:55.050 align:middle line:90%


00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:57.270 align:middle line:84%
One needs to analyze
their own heart

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.370 align:middle line:84%
and what happens to their
heart when they truly

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:04.530 align:middle line:84%
love something or someone
to comprehend the statement.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.620 align:middle line:84%
The true love of Christ
transformed the lover

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.170 align:middle line:90%
into his image.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.950 align:middle line:84%
One can only presume
to imagine the ecstasy

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:18.180 align:middle line:84%
a holy man like Francis must
have felt, where he touched

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.930 align:middle line:84%
by the full spectrum rainbow
light body or Resurrection

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:24.150 align:middle line:90%
body of Jesus.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.510 align:middle line:84%
It makes no difference whether
he imagined the experience,

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:31.590 align:middle line:84%
hallucinated it, or
physically experienced it.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.230 align:middle line:84%
An exchange of
energy took place.

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:40.760 align:middle line:84%
A transformation occurred as
a result. That's what counts.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.720 align:middle line:84%
In Bartholomew
Carducci's visualization,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Francis is lifted off the ground
in a shaft or pillar of light,

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:52.040 align:middle line:84%
emanating from an opening in
the heavens in which Christ

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:55.000 align:middle line:90%
as a fiery Seraph hovers.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.620 align:middle line:84%
This gives new meaning to
the term, beam me up, Scotty.

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:03.700 align:middle line:84%
For some, accepting this
story requires too big

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.260 align:middle line:90%
a leap of the imagination.

00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:08.100 align:middle line:84%
Some church authorities
have not recognized

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:12.040 align:middle line:84%
Saint Francis' Stigmata
as divine intervention.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:16.530 align:middle line:84%
Pope Benedict XIV in the 18th
century said he was doubtful.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.110 align:middle line:10%
Saint Francis de Sales in
the 16th century at first

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.990 align:middle line:10%
believed the marks were the
result of heavenly action

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:26.800 align:middle line:10%
but later came to judge them as
a product of strong compassion

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.130 align:middle line:10%
in a person's thinking
about Jesus' suffering.

00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.880 align:middle line:84%
Pope Pius in the 19th century,
like many of his predecessors,

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.480 align:middle line:84%
believed that Saint' Francis'
Stigmata were historically

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.110 align:middle line:84%
certain but not an
article of faith.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.230 align:middle line:10%
The church's opinion is
that this phenomena only

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:48.850 align:middle line:10%
occurs in ecstatics, persons
in a state of ecstasy,

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:52.240 align:middle line:10%
reportedly a common denominator
in all Stigmata claims

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.340 align:middle line:10%
of which there are many.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:58.720 align:middle line:84%
Ecstasy is described as an
intensely emotional state

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.070 align:middle line:84%
in which rational thought
and self-control are absent.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:07.000 align:middle line:84%
And artists have attempted
to portray Francis swooning

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.520 align:middle line:90%
in this ecstatic state.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:13.270 align:middle line:84%
Sassetta has Francis
gazing at the inner sky.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.490 align:middle line:10%
The front of his
altarpiece is a triptych

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.700 align:middle line:10%
and depicts Saint
Francis in ecstasy.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.030 align:middle line:84%
Standing on top of
a man with a sword,

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Saint Francis is
surrounded by an orb,

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.670 align:middle line:90%
a portal of fiery angels.

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:31.210 align:middle line:84%
His stance is representative
of the crucified Christ.

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:34.310 align:middle line:84%
His face is transfigured
with ecstasy.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.210 align:middle line:84%
He glances upwards toward
the three mystical women

00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:40.900 align:middle line:84%
of poverty, chastity,
and obedience.

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.350 align:middle line:84%
Below Saint Francis'
feet are three characters

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.620 align:middle line:84%
that represent the worldly
pleasures he gave up

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.460 align:middle line:84%
in his quest for
enlightenment and ascension.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.090 align:middle line:84%
The man in armor
that he stands upon

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.850 align:middle line:84%
represents insubordination
or violence.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.350 align:middle line:84%
The fair lady
looking into a mirror

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:59.960 align:middle line:84%
represents luxury
or sexual desires.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.540 align:middle line:84%
And the nun represents
the strong desire

00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.120 align:middle line:84%
for wealth, all
of which represent

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.940 align:middle line:84%
his lifelong
progression from nature

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:13.850 align:middle line:84%
to grace to glory towards the
final realization and ecstasy.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:84%
We need to know
that Francis is also

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:19.790 align:middle line:84%
connected with an
astounding Merkabah story.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:23.210 align:middle line:84%
Once he traveled into
Assisi while his brethren

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.330 align:middle line:84%
remained at a hut in
the outskirts of town.

00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:29.720 align:middle line:84%
Late that evening while Francis
was praying at an isolated

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.180 align:middle line:84%
garden within the
town, the friars

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.800 align:middle line:84%
back in the countryside
witnessed an astonishing sight.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.440 align:middle line:84%
At about midnight,
a fiery chariot

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.040 align:middle line:84%
with a globe of light resting
above suddenly appeared.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.830 align:middle line:84%
This bright chariot of
fire took two or three

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.900 align:middle line:84%
laps here and there
about the room,

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.450 align:middle line:84%
twisting around and
about in their hut.

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:53.840 align:middle line:84%
It rested on a large globe,
shining like the sun,

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.890 align:middle line:90%
illuminating the dark night.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.130 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously similar to
the Merkabah about chariot

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:05.380 align:middle line:84%
of Ezekiel, of Elijah, and
Jesus, who we have previously

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.510 align:middle line:90%
discussed.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.790 align:middle line:10%
The friars were
amazed by not only

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:13.690 align:middle line:10%
the light that enters the body
but also in the spirit, which

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.690 align:middle line:10%
had extraordinary effects.

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:20.710 align:middle line:84%
The brilliant light astoundingly
made their hearts and souls

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.860 align:middle line:90%
completely clear to each other.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:26.410 align:middle line:84%
They all glanced about
and immediately developed

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.720 align:middle line:84%
a wonderful understanding
that although

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.580 align:middle line:84%
their spiritual father,
Francis, was physically absent,

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:38.710 align:middle line:84%
he was miraculously present
in this dazzling apparition.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:42.220 align:middle line:84%
Stories like this of Francis
popping into his light body

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and riding a Merkabah
chariot must have circulated

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.920 align:middle line:90%
around Italy in Europe.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.640 align:middle line:84%
This would, in part, explain
why the Franciscan Order

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.520 align:middle line:90%
grew so rapidly.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.180 align:middle line:84%
More, Francis' ascetic way
of life, his deep respect

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.910 align:middle line:84%
for nature, and his
devotion to the poor,

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:05.140 align:middle line:84%
reflect absolutely the
Cathar way of life.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.330 align:middle line:84%
It greatly appealed to
the people of Italy,

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:13.090 align:middle line:84%
as tens of thousands
quickly joined Francis' way.

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.340 align:middle line:84%
Francis had for them
a simple formula

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.270 align:middle line:84%
for saving mankind,
the imitation of Christ

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:22.240 align:middle line:90%
and brotherly love.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.520 align:middle line:84%
Francis went on to
transform the church

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:29.980 align:middle line:84%
by refocusing Christians on
the gospel, not on the church.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.490 align:middle line:84%
He taught his followers to obey
the gospel, the words of Jesus

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:37.450 align:middle line:84%
to care for the suffering, to
preach, and to embrace poverty

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.680 align:middle line:90%
as their bride--

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:84%
again, to embrace the
promise of the light body

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.540 align:middle line:84%
rather than the promise
of Earthly pleasures.

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:49.900 align:middle line:84%
As the Mahayana Buddhists have
the six paramitas or practices

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that lead to perfection, being
generosity, morality, patience,

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:57.130 align:middle line:84%
diligent effort,
contemplation, and insight, so,

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:59.830 align:middle line:84%
too, did Francis have
six practices that

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.960 align:middle line:90%
lead to ascension.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.030 align:middle line:90%
The first is friendship.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:06.730 align:middle line:84%
The second was
embracing the other.

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:10.570 align:middle line:84%
He saw the sacred in
everyone and everything.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.100 align:middle line:90%
He advocated poverty.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.950 align:middle line:84%
He renounced wealth,
power, and control.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:19.870 align:middle line:84%
Being poor Francis' way meant
to reduce the effects of karma

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.150 align:middle line:90%
on one's ascension.

00:29:22.150 --> 00:29:25.240 align:middle line:84%
Spirituality--
Francis showed people

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:31.020 align:middle line:84%
how to live spiritual lives all
the time, not just in church.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:35.020 align:middle line:84%
Care-- Francis taught
that all of God's creation

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.570 align:middle line:90%
must be cared for.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.730 align:middle line:84%
He poetically called
the sun his brother

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:42.090 align:middle line:90%
and the moon his sister.

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.920 align:middle line:84%
He is the subject of the
prayer of Saint Francis.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.768 align:middle line:10%
Lord, make me an
instrument of your peace.

00:29:48.768 --> 00:29:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And it's for this reason
that he has become

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:90%
today's environmental Saint.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.260 align:middle line:84%
Death-- Francis
taught his followers

00:29:56.260 --> 00:30:01.390 align:middle line:84%
to welcome death, the promise
of the afterlife, the afterlife

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:03.610 align:middle line:90%
in a light body.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.070 align:middle line:84%
When Francis died,
one of the brethren

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:08.590 align:middle line:84%
saw his soul,
which was now freed

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:12.610 align:middle line:84%
from his body winging its
way towards heaven surrounded

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.040 align:middle line:90%
by a white cloud.

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.400 align:middle line:84%
He said it looked like
a bright shining star.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.340 align:middle line:84%
This is a perfect description
of the Merkabah throne

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:24.640 align:middle line:90%
or ascension throne of Christ.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.100 align:middle line:84%
After his death, Clare
continued his work

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.650 align:middle line:90%
and broadened her own influence.

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:33.130 align:middle line:84%
She died in 1253 and was
canonized two years later

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:36.220 align:middle line:90%
by Pope Alexander IV.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:40.360 align:middle line:84%
Works such as Giotto's
"Apotheosis of Saint Francis"

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:43.330 align:middle line:84%
or Vasari's "Saint
Francis in Glory"

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:46.990 align:middle line:84%
illustrate the belief
that he ascended to heaven

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:50.890 align:middle line:84%
and now sits on the
ascension throne.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.380 align:middle line:84%
This means that
Francis of Assisi

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:58.070 align:middle line:84%
fulfill the ultimate mission
of the Essenes, the Cathars,

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:01.060 align:middle line:84%
the Manichaeans and
all the other ascension

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.210 align:middle line:90%
keepers we've been discussing.

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:09.100 align:middle line:84%
Francis' story is a powerful
story of transformation.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:11.620 align:middle line:10%
He was an ordinary
person like you

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.650 align:middle line:10%
and I, who received a
revelation, in this case,

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.460 align:middle line:10%
through a work of art, followed
the path of this message,

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.220 align:middle line:10%
and gradually,
step by step, began

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:25.330 align:middle line:10%
to embrace the transformative
powers of that original message

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:28.510 align:middle line:10%
and embraced his ascended self.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.450 align:middle line:84%
All of us might not need
to go to the extremes

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.070 align:middle line:90%
that Francis took.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:35.590 align:middle line:84%
In his life, he made a
very powerful statement

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:38.685 align:middle line:84%
about taking off any
of the robes of wealth.

00:31:38.685 --> 00:31:40.060 align:middle line:84%
But maybe in our
time we're meant

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:43.210 align:middle line:84%
to use this incredible
abundance that our world has

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:47.590 align:middle line:84%
offered to us as a stepping
stone to our own ascension.

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.460 align:middle line:10%
And in this way,
Francis' message

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.000 align:middle line:10%
is that no matter what
our life circumstance,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.120 align:middle line:10%
whether we come from poverty
or from great wealth, we

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.830 align:middle line:10%
all can embrace the
path of ascension,

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:00.310 align:middle line:10%
which is the way
of love, and ascend

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:01.750 align:middle line:10%
into the celestial realms.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:05.100 align:middle line:90%
