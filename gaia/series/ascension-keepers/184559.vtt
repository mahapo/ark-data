00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.480 align:middle line:10%
Throughout the Pyrenees
Mountains of southern France

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.970 align:middle line:10%
where the Cathars
lived, legends tell

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.720 align:middle line:10%
of the appearance of a
lady in white who rides

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.820 align:middle line:10%
the skies in an orb of light.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.950 align:middle line:10%
In French mythology or
folklore, Dames Blanches,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.150 align:middle line:10%
meaning literally white
ladies, were female spirits

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.970 align:middle line:10%
or supernatural beings.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.860 align:middle line:84%
She's believed by many
to be the Virgin Mary.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:10%
If we view these legends
from the viewpoint

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.190 align:middle line:10%
that the white lady is
the ascended Virgin who

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.530 align:middle line:10%
has attained her light
body and that she

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.400 align:middle line:10%
is the exemplar of the
Essene ascension practices,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.940 align:middle line:10%
these stories take
on a new dimension.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.910 align:middle line:84%
It suggests that Mary is phasing
in and out of this reality

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.930 align:middle line:84%
as a light beam, maybe shifting
her density from a higher

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.730 align:middle line:84%
vibrational world into
the density of Earth life.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.340 align:middle line:84%
Some may not be aware
that Mary is believed

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.720 align:middle line:90%
to have ascended at all.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.400 align:middle line:84%
However, in Christian tradition,
going all the way back

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.420 align:middle line:84%
to the apostles, it
is accepted as a fact.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.390 align:middle line:84%
What is disputed is when
this ascension occurred.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.060 align:middle line:84%
Believers in the Assumption
of Mary into heaven,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.750 align:middle line:84%
mainly Catholics and
Eastern Orthodox Christians,

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.660 align:middle line:84%
say her body was
taken up into heaven

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.810 align:middle line:90%
at the end of her earthly life.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Having completed
her earthly mission,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.130 align:middle line:84%
she was assumed, body and
soul, into heavenly glory

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.850 align:middle line:84%
in a resurrected
body just like Jesus.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.900 align:middle line:84%
This indicates a change
in her state of being.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.380 align:middle line:84%
She has gone from earthly
flesh to celestial flesh

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.390 align:middle line:90%
or a resurrection body.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.920 align:middle line:10%
The question is, was she
still alive when she ascended,

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.140 align:middle line:10%
or had she died?

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.430 align:middle line:10%
If she was alive, it suggests
that like Enoch and Jesus,

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.010 align:middle line:10%
her body was transformed.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.590 align:middle line:84%
To me, this would
mean she attained

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.530 align:middle line:90%
the rainbow body of light.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.880 align:middle line:10%
Others subscribe to the
Dormition or falling asleep

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.620 align:middle line:10%
of the Virgin.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.110 align:middle line:84%
In this scenario, she is asleep
when Jesus comes for her soul.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:middle line:84%
No matter what one believes, the
icons, especially Russian icons

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.610 align:middle line:84%
of Mary's ascension
from Earth are

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.300 align:middle line:84%
stunning in their mystical
learnings and their connections

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.600 align:middle line:90%
to our story.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.240 align:middle line:84%
In this ascension icon, Mary is
shown either asleep or deceased

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.570 align:middle line:90%
on a bed surrounded by saints.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.130 align:middle line:84%
Jesus appears through an open
portal or gateway, a blue light

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.090 align:middle line:90%
surrounded by angels.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.530 align:middle line:84%
I'm of the view that some kind
of interdimensional travel

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.020 align:middle line:90%
is indicated.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.530 align:middle line:84%
According to orthodox
tradition, the Virgin Mary

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.200 align:middle line:84%
died in the presence
of all the apostles

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.500 align:middle line:90%
except Thomas, who is in India.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.420 align:middle line:10%
He returned to Jerusalem to
attend the Assumption of Mary,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.610 align:middle line:10%
but he was late to
arrive and visualize

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.030 align:middle line:10%
that Mary's body had
been taken by angels.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.160 align:middle line:84%
Suffering from
doubts at that time,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.350 align:middle line:84%
the doubting Thomas,
as he was known,

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.400 align:middle line:84%
requested Mary to give him
a sign in her memory, which

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.290 align:middle line:84%
caused her chariot to stop
in midair and for Mary

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.290 align:middle line:90%
to get her girdle to him.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.210 align:middle line:84%
Thomas is shown
receiving this girdle,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.260 align:middle line:84%
and then he showed it to
the other disciples of Jesus

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.030 align:middle line:90%
and convinced them.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.230 align:middle line:84%
And then he took this girdle
on his subsequent journeys.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.290 align:middle line:10%
These images that feature
the ascension of Mary

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.170 align:middle line:10%
and the transmission
of her girdle to Thomas

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.150 align:middle line:10%
are among the most amazing
of all Christian images.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.240 align:middle line:84%
Jesus is always
portrayed emerging

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.320 align:middle line:84%
from a portal or
a gate of light.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:10%
And the chariot
that Mary rides upon

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.390 align:middle line:10%
is clearly the Merkabah
or throne chariot

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.560 align:middle line:10%
of the Essene mystics,
indicating that Mary herself

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.490 align:middle line:10%
was a Merkabah rider.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.060 align:middle line:10%
Just before she disappears
into another dimension,

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.540 align:middle line:10%
she transmits her girdle or
this umbilical cord to Thomas.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.000 align:middle line:84%
The Book of Revelation
tells us that Mary

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.320 align:middle line:84%
will return as the
woman of the apocalypse

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.370 align:middle line:84%
or the woman clothed
with the sun, a view held

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.970 align:middle line:90%
by the ancient Christian Church.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.150 align:middle line:84%
In an earlier episode, we
saw how Dante and the Cathars

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.880 align:middle line:84%
venerated a beautiful woman
or lady of light, Beatrice.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.100 align:middle line:84%
In Dante's story,
she is the symbol

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.030 align:middle line:84%
of the transcended part of our
spirit, the better part of us

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.850 align:middle line:90%
that remains in heaven.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.930 align:middle line:10%
The white lady is this divine
feminine aspect of ourselves

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.360 align:middle line:10%
who guides us upward and even to
ascend on the Merkabah throne,

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.100 align:middle line:10%
as we saw Mary do
just a moment ago.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.120 align:middle line:84%
All the great ascension
keepers from Ezekiel, to Enoch,

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.720 align:middle line:84%
to Isaiah, to Jesus,
and Dante included

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.040 align:middle line:84%
have cleared the path that
leads us to her and from her

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:90%
to the throne.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.280 align:middle line:90%
The white lady is Beatrice.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.580 align:middle line:84%
And all the women sung
by the troubadours,

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.630 align:middle line:84%
says Dante scholar
Maria Soresina.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.070 align:middle line:84%
Every love song these mystical
poets, the troubadours wrote,

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.900 align:middle line:84%
every love poem is
ultimately about her.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.260 align:middle line:84%
They believed the
cosmic white lady was

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.830 align:middle line:90%
in every lady and every man.

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.220 align:middle line:10%
And by loving a
special lady on Earth

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.550 align:middle line:10%
or by loving another
person on Earth,

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.640 align:middle line:10%
we were actually loving
that great divine lady.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.680 align:middle line:84%
So now we will explore the
story of Esclarmonde de Foix,

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
who is considered the high
priestess of the Cathars

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.540 align:middle line:84%
and who took the
mantle of white lady.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.160 align:middle line:84%
Her name, Esclarmonde,
means light of the world.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.830 align:middle line:84%
She embodied the
Cathar teachings.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And her story reveals
a profound trail for us

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.670 align:middle line:84%
to follow in our own quest
to recover the teachings

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.040 align:middle line:90%
of these ascension keepers.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Our story takes us
to Toulouse, France.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.120 align:middle line:84%
In the 12th century, Toulouse or
Tolosa, as it was called then,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.730 align:middle line:84%
was the most prestigious city
in Europe after Venice and Rome.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.390 align:middle line:10%
It was sort of like a more
modern day Alexandria.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.360 align:middle line:10%
The counts of Toulouse
ruled over a vast area

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.840 align:middle line:10%
that was not under the rule of
laws of the kingdom of France.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.350 align:middle line:90%
Toulouse made its own laws.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.850 align:middle line:90%
It made an island out of itself.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.150 align:middle line:10%
And the rules that
bound and constricted

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.610 align:middle line:10%
mainland European
society, especially

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.520 align:middle line:10%
the rules of the
Church, did not apply

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.010 align:middle line:10%
to the citizens of
Occitan or the Languedoc,

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.390 align:middle line:10%
as they were known.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:45.100 align:middle line:84%
In stark contrast
to other cultures,

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:50.700 align:middle line:84%
women held positions in
society equal to those of men.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:10%
And the division between
the social classes

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.980 align:middle line:10%
did not prohibit
an aspiring soul

00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.840 align:middle line:10%
from proving his or her worth
through admirable deeds.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.480 align:middle line:84%
We should therefore not
be surprised to learn

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.470 align:middle line:84%
that here, ascension scholars
from three different cultures,

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.580 align:middle line:84%
Jewish, Muslim, and
Christian, gathered

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.260 align:middle line:84%
to learn from each
other and lived together

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.630 align:middle line:90%
in harmony and friendship.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.220 align:middle line:10%
And it was from Toulouse
that the Cathars flourished.

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:23.850 align:middle line:10%
From out of this gathering
stepped the troubadours,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.900 align:middle line:10%
a traveling ministry of
musicians, poets, and ascension

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.400 align:middle line:10%
keepers.

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.490 align:middle line:10%
Many of the troubadours
may have themselves

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:38.840 align:middle line:10%
been Cathars or for certain were
influenced by Cathar teachings.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.720 align:middle line:10%
And among their highest
aims was to awaken the soul,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:46.230 align:middle line:10%
to revive the ascension
teachings of the past,

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:51.360 align:middle line:10%
and to elevate women
and the divine feminine.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.850 align:middle line:84%
Their courts of love,
as they were known,

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.400 align:middle line:84%
were established by the
troubadours, in which women

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:84%
transcended their imposed
low status resulting

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.940 align:middle line:84%
from the curse of Eve and
were all elevated to queens.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Courtly love was a conscious,
spiritual practice.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:15.210 align:middle line:84%
The ideal in courtly love was
to embody the archetypal forces

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.210 align:middle line:90%
of lover and beloved.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:22.840 align:middle line:84%
The beloved was
usually the woman.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.610 align:middle line:84%
She was to embody the ideal of
the divine feminine, Sophia,

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.500 align:middle line:90%
divine wisdom.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:34.210 align:middle line:10%
She was to be ever slightly
out of reach, but within sight.

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.610 align:middle line:10%
Her presence was
to draw the lover

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.760 align:middle line:10%
with her presence, her
goodness, her purity,

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.160 align:middle line:10%
her feminine divinity.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.250 align:middle line:10%
She was to be a beacon, a light.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:48.760 align:middle line:10%
And in striving to embody
this for her lover,

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.600 align:middle line:10%
she was to merge with
the divine she embodied.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:57.480 align:middle line:10%
Ultimately, this meant the
merger with the divine realm.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.090 align:middle line:90%
The lover was usually the man.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.670 align:middle line:90%
His was the more active role.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:08.250 align:middle line:84%
He was to seek his beloved,
his idealized lady of light.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.680 align:middle line:84%
He had to prove
himself worthy of her,

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.960 align:middle line:84%
face great obstacles
with humility

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.350 align:middle line:90%
and perseverance in her name.

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:19.920 align:middle line:84%
In the lover's intense
passion for his beloved,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
his constant focusing
on her, he was

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.490 align:middle line:84%
to ultimately become a
perfect lover of the divine

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.675 align:middle line:84%
and unite with the divinity he
saw embodied in his beloved.

00:10:30.675 --> 00:10:33.690 align:middle line:90%


00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.320 align:middle line:84%
The troubadours were
known for their red cloaks

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.190 align:middle line:84%
that were embroidered at the
shoulder with a white dove.

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:43.010 align:middle line:84%
The dove was a primary
symbol of the hidden church

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.300 align:middle line:84%
of the Grail or the Holy Spirit
and especially represented

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.860 align:middle line:90%
the divine feminine.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.530 align:middle line:10%
They also wore cloaks
emblazoned with the triple dot

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.650 align:middle line:10%
symbol of the Chintamani,
the wish-fulfilling gem

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.110 align:middle line:10%
that produces the light body.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.650 align:middle line:10%
This means they lived under
the dove of the Holy Spirit,

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.240 align:middle line:10%
and they indeed
sought the light body.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.940 align:middle line:84%
The troubadours traveled from
court to court all over Europe,

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.690 align:middle line:84%
carrying with them a secret
hermetic knowledge which they

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.650 align:middle line:84%
embodied in the Grail legends
in which they called "La Gai

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.680 align:middle line:90%
Science" or "La Gaie Savoir."

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.670 align:middle line:84%
Gaie or Gau in the Provencal
dialect meant cock,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.070 align:middle line:84%
and the cock was one
of the main symbols

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.310 align:middle line:84%
of the hermetic teachings,
partly because it announced

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.350 align:middle line:84%
the coming of the dawn and
partly because it recalled

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.690 align:middle line:84%
the denial of Christ by Peter
on the eve of his crucifixion,

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.380 align:middle line:84%
Peter, who became the founder
of the Christian or Catholic

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.700 align:middle line:90%
Church.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.980 align:middle line:84%
This tells us that
the troubadours

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.520 align:middle line:84%
were reviving the secrets
of ascension hidden

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:50.250 align:middle line:84%
in the text of the
ascension keepers

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.740 align:middle line:90%
of the hermetic tradition.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.840 align:middle line:10%
The Church of Rome despised the
troubadours for this reason.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.750 align:middle line:10%
And while they did not
call themselves Cathars,

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:10%
the troubadours
lived amongst them.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.630 align:middle line:90%
They both did the same thing.

00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:09.450 align:middle line:84%
They sought the
ultimate same end,

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:15.000 align:middle line:84%
attainment of the light body
through the divine white lady.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.150 align:middle line:84%
The troubadours were highly
influential in the life

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.320 align:middle line:84%
of the greatest Cathar Parfaits,
or perfected ones, if not

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.750 align:middle line:84%
the greatest Cathar
high priestess

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:28.530 align:middle line:84%
or even popess
Esclarmonde de Foix,

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:31.830 align:middle line:84%
a beautiful and
well-educated noblewoman

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:38.140 align:middle line:84%
who gave up a life of privilege
to further the Cathar cause.

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:41.440 align:middle line:84%
She was born in 1154
to Countess Zebelia

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Trencavel of Carcassonne and
her husband, Roger Bernard.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.030 align:middle line:84%
They named her Esclarmonde,
which in Occitan

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:52.330 align:middle line:90%
means light of the world.

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:56.500 align:middle line:84%
Her parents' court was a
portal of esoteric thinking

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.450 align:middle line:90%
and the mysticism of ascension.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:02.560 align:middle line:84%
In her parents castle,
which looks like something

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.660 align:middle line:84%
out of a fairy
tale, she would have

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.680 align:middle line:84%
missed nothing of the visits
of these wandering minstrels,

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.580 align:middle line:84%
the troubadours, and also the
quiet, black-robed priests

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:17.110 align:middle line:84%
who accompanied them, priests
who were called the bonhommes,

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.140 align:middle line:84%
and whose teachings spread
like wildfire from court

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.800 align:middle line:84%
to court and village to
village in this part of France.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.040 align:middle line:90%
They were the Cathars.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:31.180 align:middle line:10%
Just imagine the
conversations that Esclarmonde

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:36.730 align:middle line:10%
could have had with both the
troubadours and the Cathars.

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.710 align:middle line:10%
When she was 12, destiny
called with a visit in 1167,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.040 align:middle line:10%
possibly arranged by the
Knights Templar of papa

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.820 align:middle line:10%
Nicetas, the Bulgarian
bishop of Constantinople

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:53.170 align:middle line:10%
and also patriarch
of the Cathar Church.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:57.430 align:middle line:84%
Papa Nicetas consecrated many
children of the Cathar nobility

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.950 align:middle line:84%
to the Holy Spirit at
the great synod that

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.860 align:middle line:90%
was organized to receive him.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Esclarmonde and her
brother, Raymond or Roger,

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.240 align:middle line:84%
later count of Foix were
two of these children.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.690 align:middle line:84%
The light in
Esclarmonde was lit.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.920 align:middle line:84%
And by the time she
was in her teens,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.710 align:middle line:84%
she was celebrated
in poetry and song

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.940 align:middle line:84%
for her beauty, her
intelligence, and her learning.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.390 align:middle line:84%
As scholar Anne Baring
observes, for the troubadour,

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.060 align:middle line:84%
a chosen beloved woman
such as Esclarmonde

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:34.360 align:middle line:84%
herself was the earthly image
of the divine wisdom or Sophia.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.530 align:middle line:84%
His one desire was to
serve this divine wisdom.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.260 align:middle line:84%
With his poetry and his
music, the troubadour

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.680 align:middle line:84%
invoked not only the
image of Sophia herself,

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:47.380 align:middle line:84%
the Holy Spirit
and consort of God,

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.950 align:middle line:84%
but also the wisdom
of his own soul,

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.890 align:middle line:84%
the wisdom of the
archetypal feminine

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:57.280 align:middle line:90%
within every human being.

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.060 align:middle line:84%
He strove to awaken his own
soul to the hidden wisdom

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.430 align:middle line:84%
of the feminine,
seeing it reflected

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:06.280 align:middle line:84%
in a chosen woman
whose beauty and gifts

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.940 align:middle line:84%
seemed to incarnate the
qualities of Sophia.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:13.360 align:middle line:84%
Sophia was the
image of the wisdom

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:16.120 align:middle line:84%
of God inherent in
the creative world,

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:22.630 align:middle line:84%
the imminence of divine spirit
in all creation, in all of us.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.450 align:middle line:84%
After 25 years of marriage
during which Esclarmonde monde

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:28.420 align:middle line:84%
had six children, three
girls and three boys,

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.260 align:middle line:90%
her husband died.

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:34.430 align:middle line:84%
She lived in a city called
Pamiers not far from Foix.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:36.502 align:middle line:90%
Her husband was a Catholic.

00:15:36.502 --> 00:15:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And it was believed that
the marriage was challenging

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:41.590 align:middle line:84%
because of their different
religious allegiances,

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.440 align:middle line:84%
but her husband was said to
have respected her beliefs

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.830 align:middle line:84%
and even defended her against
the charge of heresy that was

00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:50.530 align:middle line:90%
repeatedly made against her.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:54.220 align:middle line:84%
Esclarmonde was now 50,
an older age in a time

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:57.420 align:middle line:84%
when people
typically died at 30.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.060 align:middle line:84%
This is attributed to
her religious teachings

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.450 align:middle line:84%
and her devotion
to the Cathar way.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Her children at this time
were grown up and married,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.770 align:middle line:84%
so she decided to return to
her childhood home at Foix.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:12.570 align:middle line:84%
Forsaking a life
of ease and comfort

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
with her family at
their estate, she

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.950 align:middle line:84%
entrusted her entire
fortune to her children

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.590 align:middle line:84%
and went to live and work
in Pamiers to better serve

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:23.070 align:middle line:84%
her beliefs and the needs and
lives of the local inhabitants.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.460 align:middle line:84%
Under her leadership, convents
for perfect ones and schools,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.150 align:middle line:84%
where poor children were taught
the new spirit, were founded.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Led by her, the perfect
ones went to every home.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.500 align:middle line:84%
They assisted outcasts
and took care of the sick.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.170 align:middle line:10%
Unconstrained, the
people were won over

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.110 align:middle line:10%
by their caring, charitable
ways and their pure form

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.850 align:middle line:10%
of mysticism.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:47.670 align:middle line:10%
Esclarmonde was constantly
traveling and visiting

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:50.190 align:middle line:10%
members of the nobility,
trying to persuade

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:51.990 align:middle line:10%
them to stop their
feuding, instead

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:54.420 align:middle line:10%
to prepare for the
coming genocide that was

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.150 align:middle line:10%
to be unleashed by the pope.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:01.290 align:middle line:84%
She was ordained an ancient
or Parfait, a perfected one,

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.990 align:middle line:84%
as the Cathar priests and
priestesses were called,

00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:07.260 align:middle line:90%
and also an archdeaconess.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:11.400 align:middle line:84%
It is interesting that alone
among the Christian sects,

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.730 align:middle line:84%
the Cathars were the first
group since the gnostics

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:17.550 align:middle line:84%
in the third century
to ordain women

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:22.680 align:middle line:84%
as bishops, archdeaconesses,
and priestesses.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.290 align:middle line:10%
As Baring observes,
this may be one reason

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:28.089 align:middle line:10%
why the movement was
so popular with women

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:30.840 align:middle line:10%
and why so many married
men, once they had reached

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.170 align:middle line:10%
middle age, asked their
husbands to release them

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.270 align:middle line:10%
from their marriages
so they could

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:40.350 align:middle line:10%
become active members
of the Cathar Church.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.110 align:middle line:84%
The Cathars evidently
succeeded in giving women

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:48.000 align:middle line:84%
a respected and active social
role as teacher, priestess,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.710 align:middle line:90%
and healer.

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:53.310 align:middle line:10%
There were even women surgeons,
for the Cathar ancients

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:58.600 align:middle line:10%
were trained above all
in the arts of healing.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.170 align:middle line:10%
In 1208, Pope Innocent
III initiated the crusade

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:03.700 align:middle line:10%
against the Cathars.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.160 align:middle line:10%
And as Esclarmonde
refused to submit herself

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.770 align:middle line:10%
to the dominion of the
Roman Catholic Church,

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:11.350 align:middle line:10%
the pope put a bounty
on her capture,

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:15.430 align:middle line:10%
and the crusader knights
named her the Fox of Foix.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.310 align:middle line:84%
They never succeeded
in capturing her,

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:23.290 align:middle line:84%
and ordinary people began to
call her Esclarmonde the Great.

00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:26.260 align:middle line:84%
She became, in this
way, the symbol

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:30.120 align:middle line:84%
of the resistance
against the crusade.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.190 align:middle line:84%
According to some
legends, Esclarmonde

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:35.220 align:middle line:84%
was on the run for
another 30 years,

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.560 align:middle line:84%
sometimes sleeping
in caves and barns,

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.490 align:middle line:90%
hunted like a wild animal.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:46.530 align:middle line:84%
In 1240, Esclarmonde died
at the great age of 85.

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Again, it says a lot for
the Cathar way of life.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:53.100 align:middle line:84%
As I said, life
expectancy was 30.

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.190 align:middle line:10%
No trace of her body
has ever been found,

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.680 align:middle line:10%
but it was believed that she
was buried in a cave beneath

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:03.420 align:middle line:10%
Montségur or possibly in one
of the caves of the Sabarthes,

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.090 align:middle line:10%
where there was another
castle, Monreal,

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:10%
the royal mountain also
associated with the Grail.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.830 align:middle line:10%
Esclarmonde was identified by
the German mystic Otto Rahn

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:19.000 align:middle line:10%
as a historical precedent of
the protector of the Grail

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.420 align:middle line:10%
in Eschenbach's "Parzival,"
which included the Grail

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.330 align:middle line:10%
and the mountain of Mont
Sauvage or Montségur,

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.540 align:middle line:10%
the home of the Cathars.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:30.340 align:middle line:84%
In "Parzival," the
whiteness of this character,

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.840 align:middle line:84%
"Repanse de Schoye," the
Grail queen, is emphasized.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.600 align:middle line:84%
Quote, "So radiant
was her countenance

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.130 align:middle line:84%
that everyone thought
the dawn was breaking."

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
As Anne Baring notes, the coat
of arms of the Sabarthes area

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:50.290 align:middle line:84%
ruled by the counts of Foix
shows the motto [LATIN],,

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.870 align:middle line:90%
guardians of the heights.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:55.090 align:middle line:84%
The device is strange and
interesting, she says.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:59.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a 16-rayed sun with a
winged cup at its center,

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.480 align:middle line:84%
surrounded by a crown
of thorns and backed

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.420 align:middle line:90%
by a pair of crossed spheres.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.660 align:middle line:84%
It's impossible not to connect
it with the cup of the Grail,

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.610 align:middle line:90%
she says.

00:20:09.610 --> 00:20:12.910 align:middle line:84%
Interestingly, King
Arthur's wife, Guinevere,

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:16.720 align:middle line:84%
whose name means white
spirit, is the continuation

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:20.440 align:middle line:84%
of this white goddess
lineage or transmission.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:24.040 align:middle line:10%
Scholars say the original Welsh
form of the name Gwenhwyfar,

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.640 align:middle line:10%
which seemed to be cognate
with your Irish name Findabair,

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:10%
can be translated as the white
enchantress, or the white fae,

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle line:10%
or ghost, having some connection
with a specter, or a phantom,

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.470 align:middle line:10%
or a supernatural being.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.700 align:middle line:84%
We notice that with
these white ladies,

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.550 align:middle line:84%
we are once again talking
about light beings.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.430 align:middle line:84%
Then of course, no
discussion of the white lady

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.140 align:middle line:84%
could be complete
without mentioning

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.510 align:middle line:90%
the White Tara of Buddhism.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:55.100 align:middle line:10%
She is considered
to be the goddess

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.530 align:middle line:10%
of universal compassion,
who represents

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:01.550 align:middle line:10%
virtuous and
enlightened activity.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:05.210 align:middle line:84%
Esclarmonde de Foix was
without doubt the inspiration

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:09.650 align:middle line:84%
of the Cathar Church and
the heart of its resistance.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:12.080 align:middle line:84%
She has been immortalized
in the memory of the people

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.620 align:middle line:84%
of the Ariege in the Pyrenees,
where the ruins of the castle

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:20.420 align:middle line:84%
of Montségur still exist, as the
same dove that was the symbol

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.980 align:middle line:84%
of the Church of the Holy
Spirit now symbolizes her.

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.550 align:middle line:10%
This is where our story
dovetails with the white lady

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:32.600 align:middle line:10%
myths of the Pyrenees because
the early 20th century

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.700 align:middle line:10%
mythologist, Andre Mazano,
discovered 36 versions

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.000 align:middle line:10%
of this tale in the Pyrenees.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.130 align:middle line:84%
They all go back to the
last day at Montségur when

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:50.210 align:middle line:84%
Esclarmonde's fellow Cathars
perished in the fires of 1244.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.910 align:middle line:84%
Since then, her
spirit, in the form

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:57.200 align:middle line:84%
of a pure white woman or a
dove, has been reportedly seen

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.630 align:middle line:84%
by numerous Pyrenees
inhabitants, mostly children.

00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:05.270 align:middle line:10%
Is she the white lady
of these legends?

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.000 align:middle line:90%
Did Esclarmonde ascend?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.280 align:middle line:90%
Or is it the Virgin Mary?

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.710 align:middle line:10%
One of these encounters
with the white lady

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.640 align:middle line:10%
led to the emergence of the
world's most visited healing

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.560 align:middle line:10%
site.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:22.670 align:middle line:10%
On February 11, 1858, a
young 14-year-old girl

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:25.520 align:middle line:10%
named Bernadette Soubirous
living in the Pyrenees

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:30.500 align:middle line:10%
in Lourdes, witnessed the first
of 18 visions of her blessed

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.890 align:middle line:10%
Virgin Mary at a
grotto near Lourdes.

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:39.290 align:middle line:10%
Like Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and
we may say Esclarmonde de Foix,

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:10%
is considered an
ascended being who

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.660 align:middle line:10%
is capable of
phasing or appearing

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:47.460 align:middle line:10%
in our light spectrum.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.380 align:middle line:84%
These appearances are
referred to as apparitions,

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
from the French word
meaning unclosing of heaven.

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.730 align:middle line:84%
Apparition is used in
reference to an epiphany.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:01.190 align:middle line:84%
An epiphany is the
revealing of the Christ

00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:05.000 align:middle line:84%
child to the wise men, but
it's also the appearance

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:90%
of a celestial being.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.890 align:middle line:84%
The first apparition
appeared when

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.820 align:middle line:84%
Bernadette was gathering wood
with her sister and a friend.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.580 align:middle line:84%
Bernadette heard a noise
like a gust of wind

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.860 align:middle line:84%
and looked up
towards the grotto.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.530 align:middle line:90%
She described what she saw.

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.140 align:middle line:90%
I saw a lady dressed in white.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.000 align:middle line:84%
She wore a white dress,
an equally white veil,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.960 align:middle line:84%
a blue belt, and a
yellow rose on each foot.

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Upon seeing the lady
who had a rosary draped

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:39.200 align:middle line:84%
over her right arm, Bernadette
began praying the rosary.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.740 align:middle line:84%
And when the prayer ended,
the lady suddenly vanished.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:47.790 align:middle line:84%
On a subsequent visit to
the grotto, the lady spoke.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.610 align:middle line:84%
Bernadette asked the lady
to write down her name.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:54.990 align:middle line:84%
And the lady replied, it's
not necessary, and then added,

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:58.440 align:middle line:84%
I do not promise to make
you happy in this world,

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.260 align:middle line:90%
but in the next.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Would you be kind enough to come
here for a fortnight, she said.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.480 align:middle line:10%
In the weeks that
followed, there

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:11.920 align:middle line:10%
were several more apparitions
of the lady at the grotto.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.830 align:middle line:84%
Mary would then
direct Bernadette

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
to dig in the earth
for a sacred spring.

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.080 align:middle line:84%
Even though no such
water source was

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.230 align:middle line:84%
known to exist at this
location, the girl

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.120 align:middle line:84%
scratched a few
times in the ground

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:29.530 align:middle line:84%
to bring forth the first drops
of an unsuspected gusher that

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:35.510 align:middle line:84%
would soon produce some 25,000
gallons of water every day.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.600 align:middle line:84%
After five months of one-on-one
meetings with the Blessed

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.970 align:middle line:84%
Virgin, the teenager
was subjected

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.570 align:middle line:84%
to rigorous civil and clerical
inquiry by the Church.

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:47.480 align:middle line:84%
Popular sentiment on behalf
of Bernadette's credibility

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.980 align:middle line:84%
accelerated until the Catholic
Church officially admitted

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.730 align:middle line:84%
to the validity of her claims
and recognized the cult

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.850 align:middle line:90%
of Our Lady of Lourdes.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:00.860 align:middle line:84%
The scene of her
otherworldly encounters

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.310 align:middle line:90%
was a grotto, a Delphic womb.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:07.460 align:middle line:10%
The white lady told Bernadette
that a regular procession

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.920 align:middle line:10%
should be instituted
to the grotto,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:13.760 align:middle line:10%
reminiscent of the processions
at the Grail castle

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.970 align:middle line:10%
and at Delphi in Greece.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.490 align:middle line:10%
A chapel to the cult
of Our Lady at Lourdes

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.940 align:middle line:10%
was erected at the grotto,
just as the original Oracle

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.710 align:middle line:10%
of Apollo in Greece
was worshipped

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.130 align:middle line:10%
at a shrine near the
watery Korykion cave

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:31.520 align:middle line:10%
after Kore, the Virgin.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.130 align:middle line:84%
Both Bernadette and
the Delphic Pythia

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:38.240 align:middle line:84%
were naive young virgins
who fell into ecstasies

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.670 align:middle line:84%
during which they
uttered words attributed

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:43.880 align:middle line:84%
to a supernatural
being of light.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.070 align:middle line:84%
According to
Bernadette, and one day

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:50.090 align:middle line:84%
she told me to eat a plant that
was growing at the same spot

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:53.210 align:middle line:90%
where I was to drink only once.

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.310 align:middle line:10%
These instructions
from the white lady

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.860 align:middle line:10%
were identical to
a ritual procedure

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.670 align:middle line:10%
at Delphi, where the
Pythia chewed a laurel leaf

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.310 align:middle line:10%
and drank only once
from the holy spring

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.700 align:middle line:10%
before Apollo spoke through her.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.680 align:middle line:84%
The white ladies
almost always live

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.350 align:middle line:84%
near water, the energy
and the spirit of water

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:13.940 align:middle line:90%
being deeply feminine.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.130 align:middle line:84%
Or less frequently
they live underground,

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:17.840 align:middle line:84%
for the caves and
grottos represent

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.000 align:middle line:84%
the eternally safe
mother's womb.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:84%
Today, Lourdes is a
world-renowned healing center.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.320 align:middle line:84%
Millions of people
visit every year

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.930 align:middle line:84%
in search of
miraculous healings.

00:26:31.930 --> 00:26:35.140 align:middle line:84%
I have personally witnessed
powerful healing experiences

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.750 align:middle line:84%
by guests on our
tours to Lourdes.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in February 2018
a miracle was officially

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.650 align:middle line:84%
recognized, the
70th Lourdes miracle

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:47.840 align:middle line:84%
recognized by the
Catholic Church.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.290 align:middle line:10%
While there have been more than
7,000 miraculous recoveries

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.860 align:middle line:10%
attributed to the intercession
of Our Lady at Lourdes,

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.940 align:middle line:10%
the white lady, only 70 cases
have been officially recognized

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.890 align:middle line:10%
by the Catholic Church.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:02.840 align:middle line:84%
A miraculous recovery
must generally

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.920 align:middle line:84%
be a complete, spontaneous,
and immediate healing

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:09.680 align:middle line:84%
from a documented
medical condition.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.530 align:middle line:10%
Most recent miraculous
event involved a French nun,

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.860 align:middle line:10%
sister Bernadette Moriau,
who went on a pilgrimage

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:19.720 align:middle line:10%
to the shrine of Our
Lady at Lourdes in 2008.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.360 align:middle line:84%
She had been suffering from
spinal complications which

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.490 align:middle line:84%
had rendered her
wheelchair bound

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:27.760 align:middle line:90%
and fully disabled since 1980.

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:29.500 align:middle line:84%
She also said she
had been taking

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.080 align:middle line:90%
morphine to control the pain.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.350 align:middle line:84%
When Sister Moriau visited the
Lourdes shrine almost a decade

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.620 align:middle line:84%
ago, she said she never
asked for a miracle,

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.900 align:middle line:84%
according to the
Associated Press.

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:44.260 align:middle line:84%
However, after attending
a blessing for the sick

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.440 align:middle line:84%
at the shrine, something
began to change.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.850 align:middle line:84%
She says, I felt a surge of
well being throughout my body,

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:55.270 align:middle line:90%
a relaxation, warmth.

00:27:55.270 --> 00:27:57.040 align:middle line:90%
I returned to my room.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.490 align:middle line:84%
And there, a voice told me
to take off your braces,

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.420 align:middle line:84%
recalled the now
79-year-old nun.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:90%
Surprise, she said.

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:08.650 align:middle line:84%
I could move, noting
that she instantaneously

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:14.050 align:middle line:84%
walked away from her wheelchair,
braces, and pain medications.

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:16.990 align:middle line:84%
The idea that the
waters of Lourdes

00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:19.930 align:middle line:84%
are infused with a
healing frequency

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:24.740 align:middle line:84%
is more than interesting
to us who seek ascension.

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.350 align:middle line:84%
In fact, this surge
is what happened

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:29.030 align:middle line:84%
with the baptism
of Jesus, according

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:31.220 align:middle line:90%
to the Gospel of Mark.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.870 align:middle line:84%
And it came to
pass in those days

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.570 align:middle line:84%
that Jesus came from
Nazareth of Galilee

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.930 align:middle line:84%
and was baptized by John, the
Essene master in the river

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:40.670 align:middle line:90%
Jordan.

00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.160 align:middle line:84%
According to the
prophecies of Isaiah,

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.020 align:middle line:84%
before the Messiah
or Christ could

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.690 align:middle line:84%
manifest, as the
Essenes believed,

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.490 align:middle line:90%
two things must occur.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.910 align:middle line:84%
One, a group of people
must prepare the way,

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.790 align:middle line:84%
make straight the path,
and prepare the people.

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:59.660 align:middle line:10%
And two, the eighth
century BC prophet Elijah

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:02.120 align:middle line:10%
must reappear and
prepare the way,

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:04.670 align:middle line:10%
and announce the
coming of the messiah.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:08.300 align:middle line:84%
The Essenes believed they
were this group of people

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.700 align:middle line:84%
and John the Baptist,
the Essene initiate,

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:15.170 align:middle line:90%
was the reincarnation of Elijah.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:19.100 align:middle line:10%
Importantly, the exact spot on
the bank of the Jordan River

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.700 align:middle line:10%
where John baptized Jesus
is the exact same spot

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:27.710 align:middle line:10%
where Elijah ascended into
heaven in the chariot of fire.

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.740 align:middle line:84%
As Elijah was ascending
in his whirling chariot,

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:34.970 align:middle line:84%
he transmitted his holy garment
to his disciple Elisha, who

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.240 align:middle line:90%
carried on Elijah's teaching.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.670 align:middle line:10%
Was it an actual
garment, or was it

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:44.450 align:middle line:10%
perhaps a frequency or
a vibration that Elijah

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.850 align:middle line:10%
transmitted to Elisha?

00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:49.040 align:middle line:84%
In his article,
clothing metaphor

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:52.990 align:middle line:84%
is a means of theological
expression in Syriac tradition.

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.930 align:middle line:84%
Scholar Sebastian Brock tells
how fourth to seventh century

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:01.100 align:middle line:84%
Syriac writers claimed
Adam's lost robe of glory

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:08.540 align:middle line:84%
was deposited by Christ at his
baptism in the Jordan waters.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.460 align:middle line:84%
If this, in fact,
is a frequency,

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.310 align:middle line:84%
it is telling us
that these avatars

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:17.390 align:middle line:84%
can infuse earthly
waters with the frequency

00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:18.515 align:middle line:90%
of the light body.

00:30:18.515 --> 00:30:22.250 align:middle line:84%
And this is where I get my
surmise that perhaps Mary did

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:23.540 align:middle line:90%
the same thing at Lourdes.

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.130 align:middle line:90%


00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:28.020 align:middle line:10%
In the basilica at
Lourdes is a scene

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:33.460 align:middle line:10%
that ties together the Essene,
gnostic, and Cathar view.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:37.090 align:middle line:90%
Mary is shown in ecstasy.

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.490 align:middle line:84%
She is shown in the center
of a ring of initiates

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.980 align:middle line:84%
with flames coming from
the top of their head,

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:45.190 align:middle line:84%
indicating their
illuminated consciousness.

00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:47.680 align:middle line:90%
They are Essenes.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:52.450 align:middle line:84%
Manna or star food is falling
from the sky, perhaps, or more

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:56.200 align:middle line:90%
likely summoned by Mary.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.790 align:middle line:90%
One thing is sure.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:00.160 align:middle line:84%
It takes a heightened
state of awareness

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.520 align:middle line:84%
to perceive this celestial
substance, this star

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.510 align:middle line:90%
food of the angels.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:09.850 align:middle line:84%
And as we can see, it emanates
from the illuminated dove,

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:14.990 align:middle line:84%
the dove of the Holy
Spirit above Mary's head.

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:18.680 align:middle line:84%
This image is a wonderful,
open eye meditation

00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.600 align:middle line:84%
on the expansion
of consciousness

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:23.120 align:middle line:90%
the Essenes experienced.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.760 align:middle line:84%
It informs us once
again that there

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:29.090 align:middle line:84%
is a hidden or
esoteric side to Mary

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:33.020 align:middle line:84%
that those with eyes
to see can perceive.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:36.710 align:middle line:84%
This Mary is an illuminator
of the secrets of ascension

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:38.180 align:middle line:90%
and the light body.

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.520 align:middle line:84%
This Mary is an
ascension keeper.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.090 align:middle line:90%


00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:44.980 align:middle line:84%
What our investigation
shows us is

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:48.070 align:middle line:84%
that we are part
of this long line,

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:51.370 align:middle line:84%
this continuous transmission
of these seekers

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.460 align:middle line:84%
of the light body,
these ascension keepers.

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.400 align:middle line:84%
We can go to
southern France today

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:02.260 align:middle line:84%
and walk in the path of the
Cathars, go to their castles,

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:05.380 align:middle line:84%
feel the vibration of
these incredible places.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.500 align:middle line:84%
We can go to Lourdes
and bathe in the waters,

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.380 align:middle line:84%
perhaps with the intention
of healing our physical body

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:15.430 align:middle line:84%
or connecting our physical
body to our light bodies.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.650 align:middle line:84%
This is not an ancient
story any longer.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:20.650 align:middle line:90%
It is the calling of our times.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:23.100 align:middle line:90%
