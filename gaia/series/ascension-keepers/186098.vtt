00:00:19.032 --> 00:00:22.100 align:middle line:84%
>> I'm William Henry, and
this is "Ascension Keepers."

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.350 align:middle line:90%


00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.120 align:middle line:10%
After the genocide
of the Cathars

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.570 align:middle line:10%
in France by the
Catholic Church in 1244,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.759 align:middle line:10%
teachings about
ascension once again

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.650 align:middle line:10%
went sub rosa, this time
for another 200 years.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.190 align:middle line:84%
As happened to the Essenes in 70
CE, so happened to the Cathars.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.980 align:middle line:84%
In the 15th century,
the ascension fires

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.870 align:middle line:90%
were lit once again.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.380 align:middle line:84%
And an astounding revival
of lost ascension teachings

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.210 align:middle line:90%
emerged.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.130 align:middle line:10%
The surviving writings
of a tradition

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.060 align:middle line:10%
known as the Corpus Hermeticum,
the hermetic body of writings,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.180 align:middle line:10%
which were lost to the
West after classical times

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.150 align:middle line:10%
but survived in eastern
Byzantine libraries,

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.210 align:middle line:10%
were rediscovered and
translated into Latin

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.660 align:middle line:10%
during the late 15th century
by the Italian Renaissance

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.600 align:middle line:10%
court of Cosimo de Medici.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.780 align:middle line:84%
The hermetic tradition, named
after Hermes, the Greek god

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.570 align:middle line:84%
of alchemy and
gateways, represents

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.380 align:middle line:84%
a non-Christian lineage
of Hellenistic or Greek

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.420 align:middle line:90%
gnosticism.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.270 align:middle line:84%
As shown here,
Hermes wears a cloak

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.940 align:middle line:84%
with a triple dot symbol
of the Chintamani,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.190 align:middle line:84%
the Tibetan symbol of
the wish fulfilling gem

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.440 align:middle line:90%
that manifests the light body.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.940 align:middle line:84%
He holds the caduceus wand, the
symbol of the seraphim angels.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.290 align:middle line:84%
His headgear that may represent
the cap of invisibility that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.170 align:middle line:84%
enabled the wearer to become
invisible to other supernatural

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.240 align:middle line:84%
entities, in my view, functions
sort of like a cloud or a mist

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.580 align:middle line:84%
that the gods would
surround themselves in

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:90%
to become undetectable.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.280 align:middle line:84%
It's something that the
gnostics and the Essenes sought,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.675 align:middle line:90%
this invisibility cloak.

00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:07.150 align:middle line:90%


00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.750 align:middle line:84%
Egypt is considered by many
to be the spiritual home

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.020 align:middle line:90%
of Western ascension teachings.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.640 align:middle line:10%
And it was the discovery
of the Corpus Hermeticum

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.940 align:middle line:10%
during the Renaissance that
led European intellectuals

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:10%
to the conclusion that the Greek
god Hermes and the Egyptian god

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.450 align:middle line:10%
Thoth were the same being.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.700 align:middle line:10%
Thoth was the Egyptian god
of alchemy and transformation

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.430 align:middle line:10%
with his new Greek name, Hermes.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.830 align:middle line:84%
Renaissance ascension
keepers came

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.010 align:middle line:84%
to believe that the
ascension teachings of Jesus

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.720 align:middle line:84%
were also hermetic, or derived
from Hermes and his line.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.260 align:middle line:84%
It is therefore no
coincidence that Jesus also

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.430 align:middle line:84%
wears a cloak with the triple
dots of the Chintamani.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.860 align:middle line:84%
The hermetic traditions
and its writings

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:84%
date to at least the
first century BC.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.770 align:middle line:84%
This is the time
when the Essenes

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.790 align:middle line:84%
were in Alexandria, Egypt and
were collating the ascension

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.640 align:middle line:84%
teachings from all the
enlightened civilizations

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.560 align:middle line:84%
of the Mediterranean,
including Greece.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.030 align:middle line:84%
Their revival provided
a seminal force

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.340 align:middle line:84%
in the development of
Renaissance thought

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.530 align:middle line:90%
and culture.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.050 align:middle line:84%
As we move forward, we
will explore the de Medici

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.840 align:middle line:84%
quest for the lost
teachings of the gnostics

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.720 align:middle line:84%
and the lost teachings
of Jesus and the Essenes

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and how they formed an academy
that instructed the world's

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.460 align:middle line:84%
greatest artists, including
Botticelli, Raphael, Leonardo

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.330 align:middle line:84%
da Vinci, Michelangelo,
and others

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.220 align:middle line:84%
in the art of encoding
these teachings--

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.750 align:middle line:84%
these ascension teachings-- in
the Renaissance masterpieces.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.860 align:middle line:84%
But our story begins
with a little known man

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.240 align:middle line:84%
named Rene d'Anjou, one of the
key figures of the Renaissance.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.870 align:middle line:84%
In fact, he is claimed to
be the man who launched it.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.970 align:middle line:84%
At nine years old,
Rene d'Anjou was

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.870 align:middle line:84%
installed as grand master of
that notorious organization

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.430 align:middle line:84%
the Priori of Sion, named
after the Celestial City.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.800 align:middle line:10%
This is the secret
society credited

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.530 align:middle line:10%
with creating the Knights
Templar as their military arm,

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.870 align:middle line:10%
an organization dedicated to
the mystical bloodline of Jesus

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.930 align:middle line:10%
and Mary Magdalene and
the sacred teachings that

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.320 align:middle line:10%
were passed down to their
descendants, which included

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.650 align:middle line:10%
the Merovingian kings of
France and their many offshoots

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.160 align:middle line:10%
scattered throughout
the royalty of Europe.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.710 align:middle line:84%
These mystical
teachings, of course,

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.740 align:middle line:90%
have to do with ascension.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.960 align:middle line:84%
Rene was the man
that rode at Joan

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.350 align:middle line:84%
of Arc's side in her
crusade to Orelans.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.930 align:middle line:84%
Rene is the man that Christopher
Columbus acknowledges

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.630 align:middle line:84%
in his journals as
the man that gave him

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:90%
his first ship's commission.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.990 align:middle line:84%
But Rene claimed descent from
Jesus and Mary Magdalene.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the d'Anjou dynasty
had adopted Mary Magdalene

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.360 align:middle line:84%
as their special saint, probably
since Charles II of d'Anjou,

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.520 align:middle line:84%
a relative of Rene, had found
her tomb in 1279 at St. Maximin

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.370 align:middle line:90%
la Sainte Baume in Provence.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.050 align:middle line:84%
He, Charles, then founded
the massive gothic basilica

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.800 align:middle line:84%
at Sainte Marie de
Madeleine and 1295.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.850 align:middle line:84%
It's famously reported that
Rene had a red porphyry

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.180 align:middle line:84%
cup, which he told people was
used at the Wedding of Cana.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.930 align:middle line:84%
This was the moment when
Jesus turned water into wine,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.880 align:middle line:90%
one of his many miracles.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.610 align:middle line:84%
It's fair to say that
Rene's family was

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.910 align:middle line:84%
obsessed with finding
the artifacts of the Holy

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.500 align:middle line:90%
Family, his family.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:84%
As noted in the two centuries
before Rene's birth,

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.740 align:middle line:84%
others who claimed descent from
the bloodline of Jesus and Mary

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.320 align:middle line:84%
Magdalene, including
the Cathars,

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.600 align:middle line:84%
had been exterminated
during the Inquisition

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.170 align:middle line:84%
by the church in the
first European genocide.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:84%
This is when the secret
knowledge went underground, sub

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.860 align:middle line:90%
rosa.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.250 align:middle line:84%
But Rene's family
was seeking it.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.320 align:middle line:84%
After the dust
settled, so to speak,

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.700 align:middle line:84%
we find Rene doing exactly the
same thing as his ancestors--

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.810 align:middle line:84%
excavating and
looking for tombs.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.470 align:middle line:84%
It's interesting to further note
that Nostradamus' grandfather,

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.830 align:middle line:84%
Leonardo da Vinci's father,
and Christopher Columbus

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.790 align:middle line:84%
were in Rene's employ
during this time.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.490 align:middle line:84%
An ancestor of his
had already discovered

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.260 align:middle line:90%
Mary Magdalene's tomb.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:37.260 align:middle line:84%
So who or what was Rene
actually searching for?

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.790 align:middle line:84%
Actually, it could
be that he was

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.740 align:middle line:90%
looking for the family relics.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle line:84%
However, this had to include the
secrets of the robe of light.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.760 align:middle line:84%
So did Rene find what
he was looking for?

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:53.190 align:middle line:10%
Rene was known for
his love of the arts

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.550 align:middle line:10%
and was obsessed with the
legend of the Holy Grail,

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:10%
creating an aura of a fairy
tale within his own court,

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.310 align:middle line:10%
sort of like the troubadours.

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.020 align:middle line:10%
He assuredly knew the grail
vessel is the human body

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.930 align:middle line:10%
and that the stone connected
to the grail mysteries,

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:12.300 align:middle line:10%
or inside of the
grail itself, was

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.260 align:middle line:10%
the Chintamani that produced
the light body or the garment

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.960 align:middle line:10%
of light.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.890 align:middle line:84%
An accomplished
painter, Rene learned

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.980 align:middle line:84%
to paint while imprisoned
in Burgundy in France.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.250 align:middle line:84%
His teacher was none
other than Jan Van Eyck,

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.730 align:middle line:84%
who is known as one of the
greatest mystics and spies, as

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.930 align:middle line:90%
well as painters, of all time.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.600 align:middle line:84%
Rene was also a
writer, composing poems

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.250 align:middle line:90%
and mystical allegories.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.720 align:middle line:90%
One was titled The Book of Love.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.520 align:middle line:90%
Remember that?

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.580 align:middle line:84%
That was the Cathar lost
text, The Book of Love,

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:49.600 align:middle line:84%
that could suddenly transform
a human into a being of light.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.810 align:middle line:84%
Rene's masterpiece, Le
Livre du Coeur d'Amour

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Epris, or The Book of
Love, was written in 1457.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.510 align:middle line:84%
Folio 15, often thought of as
denoting a theme of Arcadia

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.610 align:middle line:90%
in a lost idyllic realm.

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.200 align:middle line:84%
And its iconic
tomb and stream was

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.040 align:middle line:84%
featured in his painting
of The Book of Love, which

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.840 align:middle line:84%
shows a grail knight before
a black stone or a tomb

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.790 align:middle line:84%
with a bursting sun
gate in the sky above.

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:22.280 align:middle line:90%
Lots of coded imagery here.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.610 align:middle line:84%
Using his numerous
Italian possessions

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.900 align:middle line:84%
as a base of operations, Rene
spent many years in Italy

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.760 align:middle line:84%
and became the
greatest Enlightenment

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.909 align:middle line:90%
salesman of all time.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:38.080 align:middle line:10%
He inspired sponsorship from the
ruling Sforza family of Milan,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.340 align:middle line:10%
the patrons of
Leonardo da Vinci,

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.340 align:middle line:10%
and his friend Cosimo de Medici.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.740 align:middle line:84%
And he got them to
send their agents

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:49.510 align:middle line:84%
all over the world in a quest
for ancient manuscripts.

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:52.600 align:middle line:84%
These had to include the
lost books of the Cathars

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.280 align:middle line:90%
and the Essenes.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.120 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, in
1444, Cosimo de Medici

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.570 align:middle line:84%
opened Europe's
first public library.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.500 align:middle line:84%
The Library of San Marco made
available for the first time

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.940 align:middle line:84%
the ascension ideas that had
been suppressed for centuries.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.690 align:middle line:84%
Translations of platonic,
neoplatonic, pythagorean,

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:19.610 align:middle line:84%
gnostic, and hermetic thought
were now readily accessible.

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:23.240 align:middle line:10%
The first public library
celebrated the Renaissance,

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.190 align:middle line:10%
but it was actually
a celebration

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.170 align:middle line:10%
of ascension teachings.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.840 align:middle line:84%
It was frequented by
everyone from Botticelli

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.740 align:middle line:90%
to Leonardo to Michelangelo.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.170 align:middle line:84%
Cosimo de Medici
commissioned Fra Anjelico

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.690 align:middle line:84%
to paint the frescoes
within San Marco,

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:43.520 align:middle line:84%
illustrating the life of
Jesus, including his birth,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.420 align:middle line:84%
his descent into limbo, and
especially the coronation

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.230 align:middle line:84%
of Mary during which she
received her crown of glory

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:90%
and her robe of light.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.810 align:middle line:10%
Cosimo de Medici
financed the search

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.690 align:middle line:10%
for ancient manuscripts,
especially the secrets

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:02.960 align:middle line:10%
of human transformation
into angels.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.730 align:middle line:84%
As we noted, these
were the secrets

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:06.980 align:middle line:84%
the Essenes and the
Cathars possessed.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.810 align:middle line:84%
And he was bringing
them together

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.520 align:middle line:84%
in Renaissance
Italy and Florence.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.110 align:middle line:90%


00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Cosimo sought to overcome
this idea of a rich man

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.380 align:middle line:84%
not being able to enter
the kingdom of heaven.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.720 align:middle line:10%
And the de Medici family's
rise to prominence

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.180 align:middle line:10%
during the early part
of the 15th century

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:26.760 align:middle line:10%
was greatly facilitated
by his desire

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.010 align:middle line:10%
to create lavish works
of art commissioned

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.160 align:middle line:10%
from local painters and
sculptors and architects that

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.040 align:middle line:10%
would leave a lasting
testimony to his understanding

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.930 align:middle line:10%
of the secrets of ascension.

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:39.850 align:middle line:84%
The tradition of
visible spending

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.040 align:middle line:84%
that would affect the
welfare of the city

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.670 align:middle line:84%
was pioneered by Cosimo, who
very soon after his death

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.900 align:middle line:84%
was being celebrated as
the father of the country.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.590 align:middle line:10%
The word Cosimo's contemporaries
applied to his spending on art

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:57.800 align:middle line:10%
was "magnificence," taken
from a treatise by Aristotle

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.760 align:middle line:10%
and used with wide approval.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.700 align:middle line:84%
In his long and detailed
biography of Cosimo,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.970 align:middle line:84%
Vespasiano da Bisticci
makes it clear

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:11.410 align:middle line:84%
that Cosimo was very much aware
that buildings and works of art

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:14.080 align:middle line:84%
would perpetuate family
identity in a way

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.990 align:middle line:84%
that nothing could,
in a way, sort

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.480 align:middle line:90%
of assuring his immortality.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.820 align:middle line:84%
Cosimo once said that the
great mistake of his life

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle line:84%
was that he did
not begin to spend

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:25.960 align:middle line:90%
his wealth 10 years earlier.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.360 align:middle line:84%
Because knowing well
the nature of his city,

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.540 align:middle line:84%
Florence, he was sure that
in the lapse of 50 years,

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.480 align:middle line:84%
no memory would endure
of himself or his house,

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.870 align:middle line:84%
save the few remains
he might have built.

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.660 align:middle line:84%
Cosimo also believed
his art patronage

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.940 align:middle line:84%
would help assure his
salvation, his ascension.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.830 align:middle line:84%
And during his lifetime,
Cosimo focused his spending

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.060 align:middle line:84%
on building a massive and
handsome palace or fortress

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.060 align:middle line:84%
that became one of the show
pieces of Renaissance Florence.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.730 align:middle line:84%
Many objects that were
once part of the palace's

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:84%
interior decoration and
their private apartments

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.730 align:middle line:84%
have been dispersed and are
now held in the collections

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.610 align:middle line:90%
of museums around the world.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:84%
One aspect of early
de Medici patronage

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.930 align:middle line:84%
was the creation of a
princely, or wholly identity,

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.320 align:middle line:84%
for the family by connecting
it to the lay confraternity

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.830 align:middle line:84%
of the Compagnia de'Magi,
a social group composed

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:24.940 align:middle line:84%
of well-to-do Florentines that
met at the San Marco complex

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.310 align:middle line:90%
near the de Medici palace.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.280 align:middle line:84%
Dedicated to social benefit
and acts of charity,

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.460 align:middle line:84%
they associated themselves
with the three kings

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.560 align:middle line:84%
who came from afar to honor
the birth of the Christ child.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.070 align:middle line:84%
They inferred that they, in
fact, were reincarnations

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.670 align:middle line:90%
of the magi, if you will.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:48.310 align:middle line:10%
In fact, the meaning
of "Medici" in Italian

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:54.450 align:middle line:10%
is medical doctor, although
some believe it means magic.

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.640 align:middle line:84%
On the east wall in the
entourage of the magi,

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:84%
Caspar is an ideal portrait
of Lorenzo de Medici,

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:04.600 align:middle line:90%
the future Magnifico.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.610 align:middle line:84%
A stunning round
painting commissioned

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.580 align:middle line:84%
by either Cosimo de
Medici or his son Piero,

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:11.680 align:middle line:84%
was on view in the
Florentine palace

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.950 align:middle line:84%
according to a 14-92
palace inventory.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.880 align:middle line:84%
From all evidence, it was the
most prized work in the de

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:22.540 align:middle line:84%
Medici collection, painted
during the 1440s and late

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:27.580 align:middle line:84%
1450s, begun by Fra Angelica
and finished by Filippo Lippi,

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:30.970 align:middle line:84%
the tondo shows the
newborn Christ child being

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.970 align:middle line:90%
honored by the three magi.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:37.540 align:middle line:84%
The magi are depicted in a
magnificent procession that

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.840 align:middle line:84%
was meant to bring to mind the
processions of the Compagnia

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.870 align:middle line:84%
de'Magi through the
streets of Florence,

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:46.570 align:middle line:84%
an event held every five
years under the auspices

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:50.970 align:middle line:84%
and with the financial
support of the de Medici.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.930 align:middle line:84%
The richness and extravagance
of the magi entourage

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:58.710 align:middle line:84%
seems intended to echo the
magnificence with which the de

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.870 align:middle line:90%
Medici surrounded themselves.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.510 align:middle line:84%
On the roof of the shed in
the center of the painting

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.780 align:middle line:84%
are a peacock, an ancient
symbol of immortality

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.300 align:middle line:84%
and the light body,
a type of hawk,

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.910 align:middle line:84%
the goshawk, shown
with its prey,

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:17.590 align:middle line:84%
signifying superiority
and victory over enemies.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.800 align:middle line:84%
The blunt message is
that the de Medici family

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.130 align:middle line:84%
is destined for
longevity, immortality,

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.670 align:middle line:90%
and triumph, meaning ascension.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.730 align:middle line:84%
Throughout its long history,
the de Medici family

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:34.480 align:middle line:84%
was adept at using symbols
as a way of making reference

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.980 align:middle line:90%
to themselves.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.440 align:middle line:84%
The peacock and the
goshawk and the adoration

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:43.990 align:middle line:84%
of the magic condo stand as
an important early example.

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:47.260 align:middle line:84%
The magi were
regarded as saints.

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.130 align:middle line:84%
And so in the tondo, they
have either unusual halos

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:55.330 align:middle line:84%
of gold dots, unlike the
discs of the holy family.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:15:00.290 align:middle line:84%
And the magi's hat
is laced with gold.

00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:03.060 align:middle line:84%
A Botticelli magi tondo
in the National Gallery

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:07.380 align:middle line:84%
in London from around 1470
to 75 has a comparable scene

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.600 align:middle line:84%
of ruined antique
buildings running

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.460 align:middle line:84%
behind the main figures, as
well as a peacock, of course.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.340 align:middle line:84%
The other dimensional
light of the Holy Spirit

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.430 align:middle line:90%
showers this scene.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:23.580 align:middle line:84%
The Adoration of the Magi
includes several generations

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:26.940 align:middle line:84%
of the family and
their retainers.

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:30.180 align:middle line:84%
16-year-old Lorenzo is to
the left with his horse

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.075 align:middle line:84%
prior to his departure on a
diplomatic mission to Milan.

00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:36.200 align:middle line:90%


00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.190 align:middle line:84%
Cosimo de Medici used a group
of three rings interlaced

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:44.150 align:middle line:84%
with the Borromean fashion
to symbolize his family.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.940 align:middle line:90%
And here is that family medal.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.390 align:middle line:84%
This symbolism was
adopted by Christianity

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.330 align:middle line:90%
as the symbol for the trinity.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, the de Medici
used it as their logo.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:02.510 align:middle line:84%
Three dots in a triangle pattern
symbolizes the trinity as well

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.330 align:middle line:84%
as the secret of the
transmutation of the human body

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.420 align:middle line:84%
into light, the
Chintamani stone.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:11.240 align:middle line:10%
This is very interesting,
because these three dots

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.335 align:middle line:10%
in a triangle pattern symbolize
the Chintamani stone, the wish

00:16:15.335 --> 00:16:18.710 align:middle line:10%
fulfilling filling gem of
Tibetan Buddhism that produces

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.840 align:middle line:10%
the rainbow light body.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.780 align:middle line:84%
This compelling
connection further

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.930 align:middle line:84%
allows us to view the
de Medici as seekers,

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and perhaps even finders, of
the lost ascension teachings.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.440 align:middle line:10%
In French legend, an angel
delivered the triple flower

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.040 align:middle line:10%
of life symbol to Clovis,
the Merovingian king.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.380 align:middle line:84%
God burst through
a hole in heaven

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.690 align:middle line:84%
to give the triple ray,
or flower of light,

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:46.670 align:middle line:90%
symbol to an angel.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:48.650 align:middle line:84%
The triple ray of
the flower of light

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:51.770 align:middle line:84%
is symbolically equivalent
to the triple dot

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:56.960 align:middle line:84%
symbol of the Chintamani
and the Holy Spirit.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Lorenzo de Medici was Cosimo's
grandson and a major patron

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.320 align:middle line:90%
of Renaissance artists.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.920 align:middle line:84%
He established a group called
the Shepherds of Arcadia.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.640 align:middle line:84%
It included artists such as
Andrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.780 align:middle line:84%
da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli,
Domenico Ghirlandio,

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:17.089 align:middle line:84%
and Michelangelo
Buonarroti, who were

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:21.200 align:middle line:84%
the core artists in the
15th Century Renaissance.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.520 align:middle line:84%
Michelangelo was so identified
with the de Medici movement

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.369 align:middle line:84%
that he had his tomb
in San Marco decorated

00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:31.650 align:middle line:90%
with the Borromean rings.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.730 align:middle line:10%
Botticelli's Madonna
of the Magnificat

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.870 align:middle line:10%
shows Lorenzo's mother,
Lucrezia, as the Madonna,

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.410 align:middle line:10%
as the Virgin Mary,
surrounded by her children

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:46.820 align:middle line:10%
with Lorenzo holding a pot
of ink in the lower left.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:52.220 align:middle line:84%
The angels place a
plasma-like crown on Mary.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.270 align:middle line:84%
The Magnificat fused
Botticelli's Christian beliefs

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:01.800 align:middle line:84%
with Renaissance naturalistic
style and ascension symbolism.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.700 align:middle line:84%
The Virgin Mary wears
her cloak of many colors.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.310 align:middle line:84%
The title of the painting
derives from the word

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.270 align:middle line:84%
"magnificat," which is written
in the book held by the two

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:14.530 align:middle line:90%
angels.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Mary is completing the last
words of the prayer as her son

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.800 align:middle line:90%
guides her hand.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.610 align:middle line:10%
In my view, this
brief examination

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:28.300 align:middle line:10%
of the de Medici's triple rings
symbolism and its connection

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.030 align:middle line:10%
to the light body and
the great perfection

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.910 align:middle line:10%
supports the thesis that
this family pursued,

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.890 align:middle line:10%
and may have
discovered, the greatest

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.020 align:middle line:10%
secret of all human history--

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.360 align:middle line:10%
the secret of human
transformation

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.530 align:middle line:10%
into a light body.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.220 align:middle line:90%


00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about the
Corpus Hermeticum, the subject

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:90%
of their great search.

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:56.330 align:middle line:10%
In 1460, 14 books called
Corpus Hermeticum were covertly

00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:59.360 align:middle line:10%
bought by a monk who
miraculously escaped

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:04.460 align:middle line:10%
a Byzantium siege in 1453 to
the court of Cosmo de Medici,

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.350 align:middle line:10%
the ruler of Florence.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.810 align:middle line:84%
The central texts of
the Corpus Hermeticum

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.720 align:middle line:84%
were lost to the West
in Classical times.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.740 align:middle line:90%
And Cosimo sought to find them.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.690 align:middle line:84%
The Corpus Hermeticum texts
dwell upon the oneness

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.280 align:middle line:90%
and goodness of God.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:21.920 align:middle line:84%
They urge purification
of the soul

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.580 align:middle line:84%
and defend religious practices
such as the veneration

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:30.170 align:middle line:84%
of images, which were prohibited
in The 10 Commandments.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.380 align:middle line:84%
The image itself will
show you the way,

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.950 align:middle line:90%
says the Corpus Hermeticum.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:39.640 align:middle line:84%
In my opinion, this means
the images themselves--

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.780 align:middle line:84%
rather than a priest or a
pope or the Holy Bible--

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:47.320 align:middle line:84%
were considered a path
to transfiguration

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.370 align:middle line:84%
or human transformation
into an angel.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.310 align:middle line:10%
Written by unknown authors
and ascension keepers

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:57.190 align:middle line:10%
in Egypt sometime before
the end of the third century

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.980 align:middle line:10%
of the current era,
the Corpus Hermeticum

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.940 align:middle line:10%
were part of a once-substantial
literature attributed

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.680 align:middle line:10%
to the so-called mythic
figure of Hermes Trismegistus,

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.050 align:middle line:10%
a Hellenistic fusion
of the Greek god Hermes

00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:14.170 align:middle line:10%
and the Egyptian god Thoth.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:17.620 align:middle line:10%
Hermes bears the rod of
the gods in this Greek vase

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.350 align:middle line:10%
from around 480 BC.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.960 align:middle line:84%
The Egyptians called
him Thoth, the bird

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.960 align:middle line:84%
headed god of divine
magic and alchemy

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.200 align:middle line:84%
who also wielded a
magic wand or rod.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.190 align:middle line:90%


00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:84%
Upon its discovery and
delivery to Florence,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Corpus Hermeticum was translated
by Marsilio Ficino, the teacher

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.540 align:middle line:90%
of Lorenzo de Medici.

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:46.380 align:middle line:84%
A high priest, physician,
musician, magician, astrologer,

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:52.840 align:middle line:84%
Christian, Marsilio Ficino was
the original Renaissance man.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.200 align:middle line:84%
He is featured in Domenico
Ghirlandio's An Angel Visits

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Zachariah, found in Santa
Maria Novella in Florence.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:04.800 align:middle line:84%
Zachariah is the father
of John the Baptist,

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.960 align:middle line:84%
who later would become the
master Essene initiator.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.140 align:middle line:10%
For Ficino, Jesus
was the exemplar

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.080 align:middle line:10%
of ultimate human potential--

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.560 align:middle line:10%
transformation into an angel.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.600 align:middle line:10%
And he sought to fuse
Christianity with its pagan,

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.400 align:middle line:10%
read--

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.160 align:middle line:10%
Egyptian-- roots.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.680 align:middle line:10%
Bellini's painting, The
Blood of the Redeemer,

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:10%
shows Jesus in the foreground.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.580 align:middle line:84%
In the background, the caduceus
wand of Thoth or Hermes,

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:38.070 align:middle line:84%
the seraphim angels,
is passed off,

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.710 align:middle line:84%
suggesting the torch
had been passed

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:44.820 align:middle line:84%
from Hermes to Jesus
to Christianity and now

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.450 align:middle line:90%
to the Domenici.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:50.920 align:middle line:84%
Ficino realized that
Christianity was actually

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:55.240 align:middle line:84%
a variation in interpretation
of a group of followers

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:57.880 align:middle line:84%
of the Corpus
Hermeticum, specifically

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:00.370 align:middle line:90%
the cult of Serapis.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.530 align:middle line:84%
We recall that this
cult was created

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.710 align:middle line:84%
by the Ptolemies in
the third century BC

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:09.400 align:middle line:84%
to unify the ancient Egyptian
and the Greek religion

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.190 align:middle line:90%
under their rule.

00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:14.180 align:middle line:84%
The God was depicted
as Greek in appearance,

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.990 align:middle line:84%
but with Egyptian trappings,
and combine iconography

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.680 align:middle line:84%
from a great many cults,
signifying both abundance

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.270 align:middle line:90%
and resurrection.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:28.840 align:middle line:84%
Ficino also revised platonism,
the philosophy of Plato.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.250 align:middle line:10%
Plato taught that the human soul
originated in the higher world

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.220 align:middle line:10%
but is trapped in the
body in the lower world.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.990 align:middle line:84%
And his writing
sometimes described

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.270 align:middle line:84%
the return, or
ascent of the soul,

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.460 align:middle line:90%
to its true perfect home--

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.400 align:middle line:90%
the unity of the one god.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.380 align:middle line:84%
For Ficino, the way to return
home was to refine the soul

00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:55.070 align:middle line:84%
and transform into
a seraphim angel.

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.670 align:middle line:10%
In fact, he said it was the
highest human aspiration

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:01.900 align:middle line:10%
to become a seraphim.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.080 align:middle line:84%
The School of Athens is one
of the most famous frescoes

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.640 align:middle line:90%
by Raphael.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.030 align:middle line:84%
It was painted
between 1509 and 1511

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.930 align:middle line:84%
as part of Raphael's commission
to decorate with frescoes

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:15.940 align:middle line:84%
the rooms now known
as the Stanza di

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:19.780 align:middle line:84%
Raffaello in the Apostolic
Palace in the Vatican.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:25.160 align:middle line:84%
This is Lorenzo's platonic
academy brought to life.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Plato with the face of Leonardo
and his student Aristotle

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.560 align:middle line:84%
are the central
figures in this scene.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.880 align:middle line:84%
Plato holds Timaeus, which
tells the story of Atlantis

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
and Plato's ascension cosmology,
which influenced philosophers

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.180 align:middle line:90%
for over a millennium.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:47.220 align:middle line:84%
From these writings,
Ficino began

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.720 align:middle line:84%
to write and perform music
that drew down or attracted

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.490 align:middle line:90%
stellar influences.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:57.000 align:middle line:84%
He called it the music of
the spheres after Pythagoras.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.170 align:middle line:84%
He said that this was possible
because the human soul is

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:03.330 align:middle line:90%
made of star stuff.

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.590 align:middle line:90%
We're star children.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:09.480 align:middle line:84%
Ficino wrote extensively
about techniques

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.930 align:middle line:84%
whereby planetary
powers, stellar powers,

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:18.000 align:middle line:84%
were to be invoked by the
principles of hermetic analogy.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.460 align:middle line:84%
He wrote the famous saying,
"as above, so below; as within,

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.540 align:middle line:90%
so without; as then, so now."

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:32.340 align:middle line:84%
This is the hermetic
law of Marsilio Ficino.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:36.090 align:middle line:84%
The inspiration for this as
well as the Corpus Hermeticum

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:41.160 align:middle line:84%
is probably the emerald tablets
of Hermes, the lost ascension

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.360 align:middle line:90%
tablets.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.470 align:middle line:84%
The opening lines of this text
establish this cosmic law.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:51.420 align:middle line:84%
Hermes said, that which is above
is like that which is below,

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.400 align:middle line:84%
and that which is
below is like that

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.940 align:middle line:84%
which is above for the
performance of the wonders

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.520 align:middle line:90%
of the one thing.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.810 align:middle line:84%
This cosmic law is affirmed
by Jesus in his famous charge

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.370 align:middle line:90%
to Simon Peter--

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.840 align:middle line:84%
whatsoever you bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven,

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.360 align:middle line:84%
and whatever you
loose on earth shall

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:15.180 align:middle line:90%
have to be loosed in heaven.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:20.100 align:middle line:84%
This is a clear confirmation of
a link between earth and heaven

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.100 align:middle line:90%
and between Jesus and Hermes.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.310 align:middle line:84%
Chiefly accused of being
Ficino's follower and the man

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:30.850 align:middle line:84%
who incorporated this
knowledge in his paintings

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.910 align:middle line:90%
was Sandro Botticelli.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:37.600 align:middle line:84%
This painting, Botticelli's
Madonna of the Book,

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.210 align:middle line:84%
represents the
Virgin and Child in

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:45.070 align:middle line:84%
a traditional domestic setting
intent on reading a volume.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:47.870 align:middle line:84%
Who knows-- maybe
The Book of Love.

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:53.580 align:middle line:84%
Jesus holds a golden crown
and three shafts of light.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:57.300 align:middle line:84%
These could represent the
triple shafts of Enlightenment,

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.090 align:middle line:84%
the triple rings of
the Borromean rings,

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:04.420 align:middle line:84%
the triple dots
of the Chintamani.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:07.690 align:middle line:84%
Botticelli's most famous
painting, La Primavera,

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:12.160 align:middle line:84%
was not a portrait, nor an
icon or a holy celebration.

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.670 align:middle line:84%
We're told it was pure
fantasy, inspired by poetry

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.010 align:middle line:90%
and fueled by vivid imagination.

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:22.240 align:middle line:84%
But actually, it was
truly a powerful icon.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.100 align:middle line:10%
This much-analyzed
painting shows

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:27.520 align:middle line:10%
Venus, the ancient goddess
of beauty and fertility,

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.090 align:middle line:10%
celebrating the arrival
of spring, La Primavera.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.000 align:middle line:84%
She's surrounded by allegorical
figures representing

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.660 align:middle line:84%
the virtues and gods
of the ancient world.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:40.780 align:middle line:84%
Another Botticelli painting,
The Birth of Venus,

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.430 align:middle line:84%
was like any other, any
other painting of its time.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:48.670 align:middle line:84%
Botticeli presents us with
a beautiful world to enter.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.470 align:middle line:10%
Featuring the
goddess of love, it

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.450 align:middle line:10%
was designed to be hung above
the marital bed of the de

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:54.250 align:middle line:10%
Medici.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.640 align:middle line:10%
It was a daring celebration
of human desire.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.890 align:middle line:10%
Previous to this,
it was unheard of

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:04.360 align:middle line:10%
to see any woman except
for Eve in the nude.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.850 align:middle line:84%
This painting was
so controversial it

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:10.700 align:middle line:84%
was kept behind closed
doors for half a century.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's considered one of
the most iconic pieces of art

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.190 align:middle line:90%
in the Western world.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:20.930 align:middle line:84%
Our eye is drawn to Venus
coming out of her shell.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.660 align:middle line:84%
According to many
analysts, Botticelli

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:27.150 align:middle line:84%
is depicting the spiritual
beauty of the soul.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:31.190 align:middle line:84%
Botticelli paints Venus
being born or reborn

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.530 align:middle line:90%
from the philosophical sea.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:36.860 align:middle line:84%
This represents the gnostic
idea of the divine spark

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:40.130 align:middle line:84%
of the soul rising
from the cosmic waters

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:44.470 align:middle line:90%
and receiving its cosmic cloak.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:47.200 align:middle line:84%
In 1482, the de Medici
family commissioned

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Sandro Botticelli's painting,
Pallas and the Centaur.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.880 align:middle line:84%
This painting, cited
as Camilla and a Satyr,

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:84%
is recorded in the interior
of the so-called old house

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.750 align:middle line:84%
of the de Medici family in
a room on the ground floor

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.960 align:middle line:84%
alongside the chamber
of Lorenzo together

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.060 align:middle line:90%
with Botticelli's Primavera.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.160 align:middle line:84%
It was hung high
up above the door

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.740 align:middle line:90%
leading to the antechamber.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.040 align:middle line:10%
In the painting, Athena,
the Virgin goddess,

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:19.090 align:middle line:10%
is wearing a light
gown, a transparent gown

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:22.120 align:middle line:10%
that's white and
transparent that's decorated

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:10%
with diamond tipped rings.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.970 align:middle line:84%
She's wrapped in a
large green cloak.

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:31.870 align:middle line:84%
A mesh of olive shoots encircles
her shoulders, arms, breast,

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and thighs, forming a sort of
vegetable breastplate, which

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.140 align:middle line:84%
makes her gown
cling to her body.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.620 align:middle line:10%
Botticelli decorated
the goddess's dress

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.380 align:middle line:10%
with a diamond ring
and the triple rings

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.240 align:middle line:10%
symbol of the de Medici.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.000 align:middle line:84%
Which, as we noted, is also
the symbol of the Chintamani,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.470 align:middle line:84%
or wish fulfilling jewel, that
produces the rainbow light

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:55.670 align:middle line:90%
body.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:58.250 align:middle line:84%
This indicates that
he has portrayed

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:03.950 align:middle line:84%
Athena in her light, or diamond
body, as it's also called.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.160 align:middle line:84%
The points where the branches
cross are fixed with diamond

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.500 align:middle line:84%
tipped rings, while
on her nipples

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.050 align:middle line:84%
are two mounted
diamonds, further

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:17.540 align:middle line:84%
affirming this idea of the
transparent diamond body.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.960 align:middle line:10%
In my opinion, she is
wearing the robe of light

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.150 align:middle line:10%
of the ascension keepers.

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:26.000 align:middle line:10%
Its presence on
Botticelli's Athena

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.120 align:middle line:10%
tells us that they
are identifying her

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.520 align:middle line:10%
and themselves with
they who taught

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:34.010 align:middle line:10%
the secrets of this
robe, including

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:39.530 align:middle line:10%
Hermes and Jesus among others.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.290 align:middle line:84%
Did the de Medici believe
that through the principle

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:44.000 align:middle line:90%
of correspondences--

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.810 align:middle line:84%
as above, so below; as
within, so without--

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:49.760 align:middle line:84%
that the vibration
of this garment

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:84%
could be transmitted
through the painting?

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:57.065 align:middle line:84%
The evidence we have examined
says that the answer is yes.

00:29:57.065 --> 00:29:59.650 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:02.710 align:middle line:84%
Botticelli would help
the de Medici visualize

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.350 align:middle line:84%
a new golden age,
and in so doing

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:10.320 align:middle line:84%
is credited with creating
a whole new genre of art.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:13.180 align:middle line:84%
Embedded symbolism
and private jokes

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.060 align:middle line:90%
characterized this new genre.

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:21.130 align:middle line:84%
So did the intention to
draw down planetary powers

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:24.440 align:middle line:90%
into his art.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:29.050 align:middle line:10%
Renaissance art, including
Leonardo's Michelangelo's, and

00:30:29.050 --> 00:30:32.390 align:middle line:10%
Raphael's-- but particularly
that of Botticelli--

00:30:32.390 --> 00:30:37.520 align:middle line:10%
can only be understood with this
magical knowledge or arcanum

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.670 align:middle line:10%
in mind.

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:42.340 align:middle line:84%
These paintings are
not just works of art.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.990 align:middle line:84%
They are icons designed
to be portals or gateways

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:51.010 align:middle line:84%
into the celestial realms
and a method of contacting

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:55.170 align:middle line:90%
cosmic beings, including Jesus.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.390 align:middle line:10%
What we have seen
in our investigation

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:10%
is a remarkable flowering of
the Essene and Cathar ascension

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:07.350 align:middle line:10%
teachings and their
transmission into a new medium--

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:10.770 align:middle line:10%
sacred art, paintings
that were cleverly

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:14.490 align:middle line:10%
created to draw
down mystic powers

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.700 align:middle line:10%
from the celestial realms,
from stellar powers,

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:22.410 align:middle line:10%
or perhaps even from
ascended beings themselves.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.770 align:middle line:84%
Today, we recognize
the Renaissance

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:28.360 align:middle line:84%
as one of the golden
eras of human history.

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.440 align:middle line:84%
But now we know the
rest of the story.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.810 align:middle line:84%
That in fact, the
de Medici were part

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.260 align:middle line:84%
of our long line of
ascension keepers

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:41.280 align:middle line:84%
who were seeking to remember
the lost ascension teachings

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.740 align:middle line:90%
of the Essenes and Cathars.

00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.220 align:middle line:84%
In fact, as we have seen,
the Renaissance itself

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:50.400 align:middle line:84%
was inaugurated by
a man, Rene d'Anjou,

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:54.030 align:middle line:84%
who claimed that he was a
descendant of Jesus and Mary

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.230 align:middle line:90%
Magdalene.

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.320 align:middle line:10%
We can only imagine that, apart
from the Corpus Hermeticum

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.870 align:middle line:10%
and other texts,
it's quite possible

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:05.040 align:middle line:10%
that the de Medici even found
lost copies of the Cathar Book

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.300 align:middle line:10%
of Love.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.990 align:middle line:10%
Or it's even equally possible
that they got their hands

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:13.860 align:middle line:10%
on lost copies of the Dead
Sea Scrolls of the Essenes.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.310 align:middle line:90%
