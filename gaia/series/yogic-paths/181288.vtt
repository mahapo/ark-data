00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The cosmic dance
of spirit and matter,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.200 align:middle line:84%
of transcendence and eminence,
of heaven and Earth, masculine,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.480 align:middle line:84%
feminine, in breath
and out breath.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.200 align:middle line:90%


00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.250 align:middle line:84%
>> We become part of the
whole and achieve yoga, union.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:50.850 align:middle line:90%


00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Union consciousness, or
the amalgamation of opposites,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.400 align:middle line:90%
is a foundational force in yoga.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.640 align:middle line:84%
Hatha yoga utilizes
this force of opposites

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.460 align:middle line:84%
to create balance and
awaken dormant energy

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.283 align:middle line:84%
through breath, postures,
and meditation techniques.

00:01:07.283 --> 00:01:10.940 align:middle line:84%
>> Ha is the sun,
Tha is the moon.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.590 align:middle line:84%
To bring those equal and
opposite forces in equilibrium,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.700 align:middle line:84%
in balance, in
harmony is Hatha yoga.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the ancient forms
of mostly physical practice

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.840 align:middle line:90%
part of yoga.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.480 align:middle line:84%
So Hatha yoga includes asana,
pranayama, and meditation.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.110 align:middle line:10%
>> With over 38 million
followers in the US alone,

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.750 align:middle line:10%
the physical
postures, or asanas,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.350 align:middle line:10%
of Hatha yoga make it the
most recognizable form of yoga

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.490 align:middle line:10%
in the West.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.220 align:middle line:84%
Many beginners are
drawn to the relaxation

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.790 align:middle line:84%
and perceived laid-back tone
of the classes over other yoga

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.810 align:middle line:90%
styles.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.620 align:middle line:84%
But in India, Hatha yoga
has a very different appeal.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.480 align:middle line:90%


00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.080 align:middle line:84%
>> I was intrigued to discover
recently that in the West,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Hatha yoga is seen as the easy,
relaxed postural practice.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.550 align:middle line:10%
Because the word
"Hatha" in Sanskrit,

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.060 align:middle line:10%
and Hat in Hindi means
force, means hardcore.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.990 align:middle line:90%
It really means hardcore.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Hardcore because the union
of prana, energy, and chitta,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.120 align:middle line:84%
mind, is meant to strike
and create friction in order

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.250 align:middle line:90%
to generate heat.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.182 align:middle line:90%
>> Power is power.

00:02:25.182 --> 00:02:26.140 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of like fire.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.170 align:middle line:84%
You can use it to cook
food or burn down a house.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.365 align:middle line:84%
So the rituals,
they amass power.

00:02:32.365 --> 00:02:34.936 align:middle line:84%
>> It's whenever you want
anything more than anything

00:02:34.936 --> 00:02:37.060 align:middle line:84%
else in the world, and
you'll do anything to do it,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.940 align:middle line:84%
and you won't stop
until you get it.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.240 align:middle line:90%
That's what Hat means, Hatha.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.940 align:middle line:90%
>> Legs should be straight.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.390 align:middle line:84%
Now extend the right hand,
and then go touch the floor.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.270 align:middle line:10%
>> To begin to understand
Hatha's seemingly dual

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.020 align:middle line:10%
personality, it's important
to understand some of its rich

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.830 align:middle line:10%
history.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.350 align:middle line:84%
>> My work trying to
contextualize the history

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.380 align:middle line:84%
of Hatha yoga looks at the
different traditions and sects

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.220 align:middle line:90%
that practiced it.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.100 align:middle line:10%
And received wisdom, received
history of Hatha yoga

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.780 align:middle line:10%
is that this sect
called the Naths who

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.114 align:middle line:10%
are responsible for all of it.

00:03:10.114 --> 00:03:11.780 align:middle line:10%
But actually, there
are other traditions

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.110 align:middle line:10%
of yogis that are also equally
responsible for developing

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.400 align:middle line:10%
and promoting the techniques
of Hatha yoga in their text.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.290 align:middle line:84%
>> The practices of these
medieval movements offer

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.465 align:middle line:84%
scholars clues on
Hatha's origins.

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:26.030 align:middle line:90%


00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.210 align:middle line:84%
>> As I looked into it, I
realized that the only Sanskrit

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.296 align:middle line:84%
text of any relevance to
these holy men, Babas--

00:03:32.296 --> 00:03:33.920 align:middle line:84%
and they have various
different names--

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.690 align:middle line:84%
that I've been living with in
India are the ones on yoga,

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.560 align:middle line:90%
in particular Hatha yoga.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.540 align:middle line:84%
The teachings of
yoga are originally

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.250 align:middle line:84%
developed by these renouncers,
these holy men whose lives you

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.420 align:middle line:84%
or I can't aspire to emulate,
because they're the yogis par

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.334 align:middle line:90%
excellence.

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:53.000 align:middle line:84%
They're practicing
breathing techniques,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.790 align:middle line:84%
sitting down in an
asana, meditating--

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.705 align:middle line:84%
that's what they do 100% of
their time, 24 hours a day.

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.130 align:middle line:90%
[SITAR PLAYING]

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.050 align:middle line:90%


00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.880 align:middle line:84%
>> These renouncers follow very
closely Patanjali's eight limb

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.790 align:middle line:84%
structure, as outlined
in the Yoga Sutras,

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.960 align:middle line:84%
the foremost detailed
exposition of all Yogic paths.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.450 align:middle line:10%
>> It's a very systematic
way to recognize the mind,

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.390 align:middle line:10%
to purify the mind,
focus the mind,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.290 align:middle line:10%
and then ultimately learn how
to subdue or silence the mind

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.300 align:middle line:10%
so we get an expanded awareness
and consciousness when our mind

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:10%
becomes quiet.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.130 align:middle line:90%


00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.060 align:middle line:84%
>> So to understand Hatha,
one must have a foundational

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.540 align:middle line:84%
understanding of Patanjali's
eightfold path of techniques

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.790 align:middle line:84%
designed to train
the body, mind,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.240 align:middle line:84%
and senses for
spiritual evolution.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.940 align:middle line:84%
While there are many ways
scholars reference the eight

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.640 align:middle line:84%
limbs, they are simply
illustrated here

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.090 align:middle line:84%
as the limbs of a tree that
build on each other for easier

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.740 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.460 align:middle line:84%
>> There have been beautiful,
beautiful books and teachings

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.280 align:middle line:90%
on how they actually intertwine.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.670 align:middle line:10%
So I don't want to talk
about them as though they

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:10%
were necessary states that one
had to go through sequentially

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.030 align:middle line:10%
or hierarchically.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.580 align:middle line:84%
But it really does help
to think about them

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.150 align:middle line:84%
and learn them like that, that
in many ways, each of the limbs

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.510 align:middle line:84%
exists in each of
the other limbs.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:10%
Now, as anyone who's ever
tried to build anything knows,

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.610 align:middle line:10%
you've got to have a foundation.

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.700 align:middle line:84%
And the foundation of yoga
is what Sage Patanjali called

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:90%
the yamas and the niyamas.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.720 align:middle line:90%


00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.340 align:middle line:84%
>> These ethical foundations are
laid out in the first two limbs

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.500 align:middle line:90%
of Patanjali's eightfold path.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.370 align:middle line:84%
The first limb holds the five
yamas, considered the great,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.330 align:middle line:84%
mighty, and universal vows to
be practiced on all levels--

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.070 align:middle line:90%
actions, words, and thoughts.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The first skill is to
make nonviolence the baseline

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.950 align:middle line:90%
for our decisions.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.280 align:middle line:84%
Then he says, put
every speech act

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.950 align:middle line:84%
through the sieve
of truthfulness.

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:11.420 align:middle line:84%
Use your words very,
very carefully.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.180 align:middle line:90%
Do I really need to say this?

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.740 align:middle line:90%
How will I say this?

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.950 align:middle line:84%
How will my word give honor
to the ultimate existence?

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And then the third
practice is not stealing.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.020 align:middle line:84%
How much feeds our greed
instead of our need?

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.450 align:middle line:84%
The fourth practice
is brahmacharya,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and brahmacharya takes
two forms in India.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.640 align:middle line:84%
One is for the monks
and the nuns to abstain,

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.660 align:middle line:84%
and the other is for
people to commit themselves

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.380 align:middle line:84%
in a relationship and to
really honor that other person

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.780 align:middle line:90%
as divinity.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And then the fifth vow
of non-possession, or not

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.600 align:middle line:90%
take up more than we need.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.880 align:middle line:84%
That gives us a
place of freedom.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.000 align:middle line:90%


00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The next limb, the niyamas,
also has five leaves and are

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.870 align:middle line:84%
considered things to
do, or observances.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.540 align:middle line:10%
>> It comes along with
a more positive way,

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.450 align:middle line:10%
the second phase of yoga,
which are the niyamas.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And this says purify,
sauca, to clean yourself,

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.300 align:middle line:84%
to clean your thoughts, to
be mindful, to eat pure food.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.140 align:middle line:84%
And then santosa-- to
develop contentment,

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.770 align:middle line:84%
to say let's appreciate
every morning.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.370 align:middle line:84%
Whether it's a cloudy
day-- we need the rain.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.250 align:middle line:84%
If it's a sunny
day, how beautiful.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.200 align:middle line:90%
And then the third is tapas.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.160 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that it's
the difficulty that

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.990 align:middle line:90%
strengthens our character.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.620 align:middle line:10%
Then this leads
naturally into svadhyaya,

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:47.000 align:middle line:10%
a sense of self-cultivation
through study.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.050 align:middle line:10%
The final is isvara
pranidhana-- to have

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:53.110 align:middle line:10%
an idea of something
that is wonderful

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.950 align:middle line:10%
and a person that is wonderful,
and as Maya Angelou said,

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.550 align:middle line:10%
to work every day at
becoming our best self.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:07.750 align:middle line:90%


00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.210 align:middle line:10%
>> The next three limbs are
quite practical in nature,

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.850 align:middle line:10%
the first being asana, which
in this context means posture.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.700 align:middle line:90%
>> Where do our problems reside?

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.450 align:middle line:84%
They're going to show up in
the body, in the tightness,

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:30.100 align:middle line:84%
in the rigidity, and in some
instances in the over-fluidity.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.100 align:middle line:84%
The moving into pranayama is
the quieting of the breath.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.350 align:middle line:10%
Sit, calm yourself,
breathe, and let

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:45.110 align:middle line:10%
yourself turn inward to move
into that fifth phase of yoga.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.240 align:middle line:10%
And that fifth phase
of yoga is called

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.460 align:middle line:10%
pratyahara, which is
that place of inwardness,

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.410 align:middle line:10%
to be able to position
yourself to truly move

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.310 align:middle line:10%
into a state of holding.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.430 align:middle line:10%
>> The final three limbs
describe a deepening meditative

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.780 align:middle line:10%
state culminating in samadhi,
a state of complete absorption

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:08.730 align:middle line:10%
with infinite spirit.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:11.910 align:middle line:84%
>> The sixth level of
yoga is called dharana,

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:14.700 align:middle line:90%
and it literally means holding.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.570 align:middle line:84%
And these dharanas
build into meditation

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:23.580 align:middle line:84%
where whatever your focus,
we're able to place ourselves

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.390 align:middle line:84%
for a sustained period
through the quieting

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.720 align:middle line:90%
of the body and the breath.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And that meditation
then informs everything

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.100 align:middle line:90%
that we do throughout the day.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.300 align:middle line:84%
So the eighth limb
of yoga is samadhi,

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.170 align:middle line:84%
that place of being totally
absorbed, being totally well.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:42.810 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what you're
doing, but you're present,

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and you're in a
place of exuberance.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.220 align:middle line:84%
You have everything
that you need.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.020 align:middle line:90%
And that's yoga.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:54.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:58.310 align:middle line:84%
>> While samadhi is the
aim of all Yogic paths,

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:02.190 align:middle line:84%
it is not easily attained and
can take a lifetime to achieve,

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:02.990 align:middle line:90%
if at all.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:09.980 align:middle line:90%


00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.950 align:middle line:10%
So Hatha yoga, as
stated in the sutras,

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.800 align:middle line:10%
was meant as a total
life philosophy,

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.190 align:middle line:10%
its steady and comfortable
asanas meant as a path

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.580 align:middle line:10%
to achieve mastery of the
mind so that self-realization

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.380 align:middle line:10%
can be experienced.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.230 align:middle line:10%
>> At least 2,000 years ago,
you start seeing the Buddha

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:33.360 align:middle line:10%
and the Jain saints in Lotus
position and other postures

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.830 align:middle line:10%
that provide a kind of steady,
solid base for meditation.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:40.870 align:middle line:84%
The way yoga is understood
in those early texts

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.350 align:middle line:84%
is a way of just completely
stilling the body

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.180 align:middle line:90%
and stilling the mind.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.940 align:middle line:10%
So anything that is
uncomfortable can

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.620 align:middle line:10%
be held indefinitely
is really not

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:54.330 align:middle line:10%
going to wash in that context.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.180 align:middle line:84%
>> A prime example
of a classic asana,

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.600 align:middle line:84%
meant to still the body in order
to still the mind and increase

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.040 align:middle line:90%
focus, is the Headstand.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.210 align:middle line:84%
>> Now, there's this notion
central to the first Hatha yoga

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.340 align:middle line:90%
text that--

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.710 align:middle line:84%
they're all written from
the point of view of men--

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.560 align:middle line:84%
that in men, there's this
substance called bindu

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.000 align:middle line:90%
which is produced in the head.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.160 align:middle line:84%
And it's constantly
dripping down

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.560 align:middle line:84%
and either being
ejaculated as semen

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.466 align:middle line:84%
or being burnt up by
fire in the stomach.

00:11:22.466 --> 00:11:24.840 align:middle line:84%
And then there are these
various methods of stopping that

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.870 align:middle line:90%
from happening.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.480 align:middle line:10%
The most crude, basic,
obvious one is the Headstand.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.280 align:middle line:90%
You use gravity.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.610 align:middle line:84%
If you stand on your
head, then gravity

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.227 align:middle line:84%
will stop it from dripping
down and being burnt up.

00:11:35.227 --> 00:11:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And the idea is that
in normal people,

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:38.420 align:middle line:84%
it's constantly
being wasted away.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.550 align:middle line:84%
And that's the process that
brings about old age and death.

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:45.630 align:middle line:84%
But yogis can stop that process,
and thereby, often the text

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.510 align:middle line:90%
will say, remain immortal.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:53.930 align:middle line:84%
Through these various practices,
you can achieve enlightenment.

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.310 align:middle line:84%
The notion of
something rising up

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.180 align:middle line:84%
through the body of
the mystic to the head

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.481 align:middle line:84%
is very common to some
kind of mystical ascent.

00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:02.730 align:middle line:90%
It's common to all traditions.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:05.220 align:middle line:84%
And whether you see that
as the breath or the bindu

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.380 align:middle line:84%
or kundalini, it's all
just different names

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:13.908 align:middle line:84%
for this notion of sublimation
of a one's existence.

modern postures we see today

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:20.584 align:middle line:90%
came much later.

00:12:20.584 --> 00:12:22.250 align:middle line:84%
>> When it's first
taught systematically

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.280 align:middle line:84%
in the 13th-century texts,
you would do the eight limbs,

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:27.980 align:middle line:84%
and you would do the
Hatha techniques as well.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.960 align:middle line:84%
The texts of Hatha
yoga were first

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.990 align:middle line:84%
written down 10th, maybe
11th century CE, AD.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
And the by the
14th, 15th century,

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:37.610 align:middle line:84%
that's well-established
in texts.

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:40.237 align:middle line:84%
And from then on, that's
how it's understood.

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:47.240 align:middle line:84%
Around the middle
of the 15th century,

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.950 align:middle line:84%
a text was compiled called the
"Hatha Yoga Pradipika," which

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.480 align:middle line:84%
means illuminating
the practice of Hatha.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.030 align:middle line:84%
The "Hatha Pradipika"
seems to be

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:58.930 align:middle line:84%
the text which subsequent
writers on yoga and Sanskrit

00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.000 align:middle line:84%
or on Hatha yoga, that's
the one they refer to.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.580 align:middle line:90%


00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.580 align:middle line:84%
>> The "Hatha Yoga Pradipika"
followed as a continuum

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.180 align:middle line:84%
to the "Yoga Sutras" and became
one of the foremost foundations

00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.140 align:middle line:84%
of modern yoga, illustrating
the techniques of asanas,

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.450 align:middle line:90%
pranayams, and mudra.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:20.270 align:middle line:84%
So while self-mastery is
the ultimate goal of yogis,

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.206 align:middle line:84%
Hatha became the
means to achieve it.

>> Over the
subsequent centuries,

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:33.260 align:middle line:10%
we do find this huge increase
in the popularity and also

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.960 align:middle line:10%
legitimation of the
Hatha Yoga practices.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.910 align:middle line:84%
Up to then, they're
seen as something

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.137 align:middle line:84%
that these wild people
are doing on the fringes.

00:13:40.137 --> 00:13:41.720 align:middle line:84%
And then the techniques
of Hatha yoga,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.850 align:middle line:84%
these physical
methods predominantly,

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:47.030 align:middle line:84%
get more and more incorporated
in orthodox formulations

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.320 align:middle line:90%
of yoga.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So that's the triumph of
Hatha yoga over the 16th

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.620 align:middle line:90%
to 18th centuries.

more physical postures,

00:13:56.370 --> 00:14:00.300 align:middle line:84%
or power asanas, into modern-day
Hatha yoga is what some

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.810 align:middle line:84%
consider yoga's breakthrough
to mainstream America and its

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.310 align:middle line:90%
body-centric ideals.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The body has been
used to assess the mind.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:09.930 align:middle line:90%
The body is visible.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:90%
It's tangible.

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:12.210 align:middle line:90%
We can see, we can sense.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.040 align:middle line:90%
But the mind we can't see.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.660 align:middle line:84%
So movements have been
used to assess the mind.

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
For example, I have a
hand, and most of the time,

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.970 align:middle line:90%
I'm not aware.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:26.280 align:middle line:84%
But if, in yoga,
I'm told to hold

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:31.050 align:middle line:84%
this hand for three minutes,
I'm totally aware of my hand.

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:33.670 align:middle line:84%
So when I'm aware,
my mind goes there.

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.730 align:middle line:90%
So mind and body becomes one.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.070 align:middle line:84%
Instead of me running
around in the world

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.410 align:middle line:84%
while I'm sitting
in a Yogic posture,

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:45.870 align:middle line:84%
these have given
me the opportunity

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:90%
to go deeper into my body.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.190 align:middle line:90%
It has awakened sensations.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.470 align:middle line:84%
It has opened up
my sensory system.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:56.000 align:middle line:84%
It has opened up my
awareness into myself.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.010 align:middle line:84%
That is the base idea behind
the movement of the body--

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.310 align:middle line:84%
so the mind can be
anchored into it.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:04.280 align:middle line:90%


00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.870 align:middle line:84%
>> In the Hatha yoga, they also
have purification techniques

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:12.540 align:middle line:84%
of washing of the organs, and
the throat, and the stomach.

00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.085 align:middle line:84%
But more important is to do
mantras through visualization,

00:15:15.085 --> 00:15:19.100 align:middle line:84%
through prayers, through
contemplation, pure lifestyle

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.940 align:middle line:90%
and pure food, pure drink.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.525 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, slowly the whole system
becomes pure and purified.

00:15:24.525 --> 00:15:28.500 align:middle line:90%


00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.260 align:middle line:84%
>> When you bring the body
into a balanced state,

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.110 align:middle line:84%
it awakens higher
layers of consciousness.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.660 align:middle line:84%
At such moments, the
world reveals itself

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:90%
as quite a different place.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.850 align:middle line:84%
>> The consciousness is drawn
to higher levels of perception,

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:45.130 align:middle line:84%
gradually bringing an inner
awakening that is more blissful

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.660 align:middle line:84%
and more deeply satisfying
than any of the experience that

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.670 align:middle line:84%
the mind or the senses or the
ordinary human emotions can

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:52.470 align:middle line:90%
give.

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.700 align:middle line:84%
>> From there, you start
being guided by intuition.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.330 align:middle line:90%
You naturally feel more relaxed.

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.460 align:middle line:84%
You naturally start
feeling much more at ease,

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.440 align:middle line:90%
more fearless, less fearful.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.080 align:middle line:90%
And you're guided.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.430 align:middle line:84%
Effortless action
starts to happen.

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's where you feel
fulfillment, because then it's

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.590 align:middle line:90%
purpose, not your purpose.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.840 align:middle line:90%
There is less and less of you.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.760 align:middle line:84%
So when there is
less and less of you,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:17.480 align:middle line:84%
then you will be less
manipulative, less stressed.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.560 align:middle line:84%
>> And when you can
slow down your mind,

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:24.140 align:middle line:84%
even that concept will dissolve,
and your consciousness will

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.910 align:middle line:84%
merge with the universal
consciousness, we say.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:84%
We become part of the whole
and achieve yoga union.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.450 align:middle line:10%
>> When you think about our
tendency to want to work

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:37.090 align:middle line:10%
on aerobic energy, that's the
first thing that gets charged

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.610 align:middle line:10%
up is your aerobics--

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:10%
the heart pumping
up a good energy,

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.840 align:middle line:10%
moving the circulation around,
getting the body loosened up.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.600 align:middle line:84%
So the aerobic energy
is an important part

of the body's stimulation.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:49.720 align:middle line:84%
And we can have buns of steel
and all that good stuff.

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.150 align:middle line:84%
But there are
meditations that we

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.080 align:middle line:84%
do for 62 minutes that really
have a way of affecting

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:57.630 align:middle line:90%
the gray matter in the brain.

00:16:57.630 --> 00:17:00.940 align:middle line:84%
We're learning that the brain
can grow new brain cells.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.500 align:middle line:84%
The science is catching up
with the yoga teachings.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:09.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Quantum physics
is now giving,

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.950 align:middle line:84%
through the lens of science,
what spirituality has been

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.980 align:middle line:84%
telling us for
thousands of years,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.020 align:middle line:84%
which is how
interconnected we are.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Pull an end of the
string over here,

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.337 align:middle line:90%
and it rattles over there.

00:17:28.289 --> 00:17:32.720 align:middle line:90%


00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.960 align:middle line:10%
- No one was more influential
in developing the modern Hatha

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.290 align:middle line:10%
yoga postures as
T. Krishnamacharya.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:42.260 align:middle line:10%
As a young man in India,
he immersed himself

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.060 align:middle line:10%
in the pursuit of classical
Indian disciplines,

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:48.410 align:middle line:10%
including Sanskrit, the
Indian medicine of ayurveda,

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.510 align:middle line:10%
and the study of yoga.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:52.550 align:middle line:84%
After years of
practice and study,

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.040 align:middle line:84%
Krishnamacharya took
to the streets of India

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.860 align:middle line:84%
and began demonstrating
the supernormal abilities

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.040 align:middle line:84%
of the yoga body on the
belief that to teach,

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.580 align:middle line:84%
he had to first gain
one's attention.

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.120 align:middle line:84%
- Krishnamacharya brought
wisdom to the threshold

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.580 align:middle line:84%
of houses of the people
in the United States.

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:12.320 align:middle line:84%
And even in India, he gave
lots of discourses and talks.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.830 align:middle line:84%
So common man started
moving towards it.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.220 align:middle line:84%
>> But perhaps his greatest gift
to Hatha yoga today is his four

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.350 align:middle line:90%
most famous disciples--

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.130 align:middle line:84%
Pattabhi Jois, B.K.S.
Iyengar, Indra Devi,

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.460 align:middle line:84%
and Krishnamacharya's
son, T.K.V. Desikachar,

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.240 align:middle line:84%
who played a huge role in
popularizing yoga in the West.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:36.530 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, they all
learned from Krishnamacharya.

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:37.930 align:middle line:90%
That is a fact.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:42.070 align:middle line:84%
And Krishnamacharya
has got these varieties

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.960 align:middle line:90%
which he learned from his Guru.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.800 align:middle line:84%
There is a sequential
order of asanas.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.890 align:middle line:84%
There is a sequential
action in the asanas.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.301 align:middle line:84%
And that makes a
difference there.

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.736 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:18:57.736 --> 00:19:04.570 align:middle line:90%


00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Just a few decades later,
another influential yogi,

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.670 align:middle line:84%
Swami Vishnudevananda, arrived
on the shores of San Francisco.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.640 align:middle line:10%
His book, "The Complete
Illustrated Book of Yoga,"

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.160 align:middle line:10%
was to become one of the
most essential guidebooks

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:22.820 align:middle line:10%
of its time and helped further
the popularity of Hatha yoga.

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.390 align:middle line:84%
>> Swami Vishnudevananda, who is
a disciple of Swami Sivananda,

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.540 align:middle line:84%
he was serving in the
army at that time,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.750 align:middle line:84%
and he happened to go and
visit the Divine Life Society

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:33.400 align:middle line:90%
in Rishikesh.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:10%
He said after he
was initiated, he

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:10%
found he was very
skilled in Hatha yoga.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.280 align:middle line:84%
He was the main Hatha yoga
teacher in the ashram.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.960 align:middle line:84%
And in 1957, 10 years
later, Swami Sivananda

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:45.880 align:middle line:84%
encouraged him to go abroad,
specifically to the West.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.110 align:middle line:84%
He said, people
are ready to learn.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:10%
So he basically traveled
to the West on his own

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.830 align:middle line:10%
and started teaching yoga in
America, initially in Canada,

00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:00.170 align:middle line:10%
and then after that,
moving around the world.

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:04.270 align:middle line:84%
>> Swami Vishnudevananda was
trained in the art of yoga

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.960 align:middle line:84%
at the Vedanta Forest
University in India.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.990 align:middle line:84%
He is a missionary who
conducts classes in yoga

00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:12.840 align:middle line:90%
nightly in downtown Montreal.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.925 align:middle line:90%


00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:21.120 align:middle line:84%
>> Head stand position,
hands in triangle position.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.730 align:middle line:90%
Place the knees, hands firm--

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:27.240 align:middle line:84%
>> Swami Vishnudevananda wanted
to help them develop a yogic

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.040 align:middle line:90%
lifestyle.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.623 align:middle line:84%
He said our physical
body is basically

00:20:29.623 --> 00:20:32.760 align:middle line:84%
a vehicle for our
mind and our soul.

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And even if you're
on a spiritual path,

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.720 align:middle line:84%
our first responsibility
is actually

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.590 align:middle line:90%
to maintain our physical health.

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:42.000 align:middle line:84%
>> So our theory is you should
not give too much hard exercise

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.810 align:middle line:84%
to the muscles so that the heart
will not be affected too much.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.840 align:middle line:10%
Here you may do three
hours or 10 hours

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.190 align:middle line:10%
yogi exercises, never feel
any fatigue or tiresome.

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.920 align:middle line:90%
You're coming full of energy.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:56.850 align:middle line:84%
You can do more work
and more contemplation.

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:00.900 align:middle line:84%
>> In 1969, he conducted the
first yoga teachers' training

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.170 align:middle line:90%
course in the West.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And today, Hatha
yoga, with its mastery

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.920 align:middle line:84%
of the body as a way to attain
a state of spiritual perfection,

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.230 align:middle line:84%
is indelibly written
into the hearts

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.180 align:middle line:90%
of millions of Westerners.

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.370 align:middle line:84%
>> I think people are
appreciating the value of yoga

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.710 align:middle line:90%
asanas, pranayama, Hatha yoga.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.300 align:middle line:90%
That's a global phenomenon now.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.310 align:middle line:84%
People are practicing
yoga all over the world

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.836 align:middle line:90%
and appreciating the benefits.

00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:26.460 align:middle line:84%
And more and more,
people are naturally

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.590 align:middle line:84%
taking to meditation
too as a follow-on.

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:35.135 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.135 --> 00:21:37.510 align:middle line:84%
>> With that unitive experience,
that supreme experience,

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:38.884 align:middle line:84%
the realization
that everything--

00:21:38.884 --> 00:21:41.850 align:middle line:84%
that God has become everything,
and that internal flash

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.480 align:middle line:84%
of understanding of union
with God or experience of God,

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.360 align:middle line:84%
the experience that
liberates us and frees us.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.890 align:middle line:90%
Frees us to what?

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:54.390 align:middle line:84%
Frees us to experience the play,
the majesty, the relationship

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:55.680 align:middle line:90%
with the divine.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.490 align:middle line:84%
>> Basically, yoga is understood
by physical practices,

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:04.720 align:middle line:84%
and that is very,
very unfortunate.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.900 align:middle line:10%
People need to
understand yoga begins

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:13.040 align:middle line:10%
with the quality of waiting,
patience, understanding,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.700 align:middle line:10%
acceptance.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.530 align:middle line:84%
Unless we learn to
accept life as a whole,

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:22.300 align:middle line:90%
we haven't learned yoga.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Because ultimately,
what is the aim of yoga?

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.720 align:middle line:90%
To discover yourself.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.020 align:middle line:84%
It is the path of
self-discovery.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.990 align:middle line:90%


00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:38.810 align:middle line:84%
>> In our next episode,
we explore three paths

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:39.680 align:middle line:90%
of devotion--

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.430 align:middle line:90%
Bhakti, Karma, and Jnana.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.970 align:middle line:84%
>> It's a traditional system
of teaching and practice

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:47.270 align:middle line:84%
the Margas, and
it's well-described

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.100 align:middle line:84%
in the scriptures,
like "Bhagavad Gita."

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:52.640 align:middle line:84%
>> Krishna does advise Arjuna
that he should practice yoga

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.330 align:middle line:84%
in order to change his mind in
such a way that he can then go

00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and fight without
concern for the result.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:05.390 align:middle line:84%
>> The main idea is to
cultivate selflessness.

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:09.860 align:middle line:84%
That enables us to break out
of the cycles of our own likes

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:10.820 align:middle line:90%
and dislikes.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:10%
That's where the
sufferings come from.

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:10%
>> It's the feeling that
we get when we chant.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:20.760 align:middle line:90%


00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
While we're doing it, we're
involved in a very intense

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.780 align:middle line:90%
spiritual practice.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:30.770 align:middle line:84%
Every repetition of one of these
names is a seed that's planted.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:32.160 align:middle line:90%
And that seed will grow.
