You don't have to hold onto it

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:52.370 align:middle line:84%

not know ABC of yoga,

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:02.310 align:middle line:84%
he still can attain that
realization by serving someone,

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:84%
by helping someone, by just
looking after the family in its

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:07.400 align:middle line:90%
totality.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.570 align:middle line:84%
Yoga, in its simple definition
means that whatever you do,

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.500 align:middle line:90%
you do it in its totality.

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.420 align:middle line:84%
Instead of being
absent in the action,

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:16.250 align:middle line:90%
you are present in the action.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.414 align:middle line:90%
That's yoga.

And then, the soul will more and
more tend toward that uplift.

And then, with a life perfectly
lived, with a life well lived,

there will be an ascent to
a place of perfect freedom

paths of yoga.

from Karma yoga or the

from bhakti yoga, the
search for self-realization

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:26.300 align:middle line:90%
can be mere idle speculation.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:29.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Jnana means
knowledge and wisdom.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:34.070 align:middle line:84%
Here, we are working with our
higher mental faculties as

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.750 align:middle line:84%
opposed to our
ordinary mind, which

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.270 align:middle line:84%
is just kind of gently
scattered and thinking

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.010 align:middle line:90%
very short-term things.

00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:42.560 align:middle line:84%
With Jnana yoga, we're
trying to cultivate

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.160 align:middle line:84%
our intellectual capacity to
do rather deeper questioning

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:48.650 align:middle line:84%
and understanding about
the nature of ourselves

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.400 align:middle line:90%
and life around us.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.490 align:middle line:84%
So it's a more
philosophical approach.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're based on the
philosophy called Vedanta

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.560 align:middle line:90%
philosophy, Advaita Vedanta.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.300 align:middle line:84%
That's our tradition
and the philosophy

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:01.610 align:middle line:90%
we follow in Jnana yoga.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.980 align:middle line:84%
>> Based on the sacred
Veda scriptures,

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.980 align:middle line:84%
Vedanta is one of the world's
most ancient spiritual

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:84%
philosophies and
one of its broadest.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:15.990 align:middle line:84%
>> It is an inquiry into
the ultimate reality.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:19.290 align:middle line:84%
We find here
everything is changing.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So in this changing
phenomena, whether there

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:middle line:84%
is any changeless thing is
there, that inquiry is Vedanta.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.960 align:middle line:84%
>> Vedanta is the innermost
core of the yogic teachings.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.600 align:middle line:10%
Without the
realization of Vedanta,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:10%
you cannot set your mind free.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.730 align:middle line:84%
The essence of these
teachings is contained

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.680 align:middle line:90%
in the "Brahma Sutras."

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.590 align:middle line:10%
The first sutra of the
"Brahma Sutras" text

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:55.620 align:middle line:10%
is Athato brahma jijnasa, which
means in the here and now,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.510 align:middle line:10%
inquiry into the self.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.310 align:middle line:84%
That is the first
step of Vedanta--

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.810 align:middle line:90%
who am I?

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.060 align:middle line:90%
It's not about any god.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.510 align:middle line:90%
It's not about anybody else.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:06.970 align:middle line:90%
It's about the self.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.360 align:middle line:84%
The Sufis, they say, when I went
to find the self, I found God.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.290 align:middle line:84%
And when I went to find
God, I found the self.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.700 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most influential
teachers of the Jnana path is

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.940 align:middle line:10%
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa,
a well-known saint

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.980 align:middle line:10%
of 19th-century India.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.590 align:middle line:84%
His high attainments in
approaching the Divine

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.160 align:middle line:84%
earned him the role of
avatar, or incarnation of God,

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.010 align:middle line:90%
by many of his disciples.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.553 align:middle line:84%
>> He talked more and more about
this Jnana yoga because he know

00:21:46.553 --> 00:21:48.340 align:middle line:90%
they were very intellectual.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.946 align:middle line:84%
But a believe in
Jnana yoga, you don't

00:21:49.946 --> 00:21:51.570 align:middle line:84%
have to take any
recourse to any ritual

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:56.270 align:middle line:84%
or worship or gods and
goddesses, forms and all that.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.630 align:middle line:84%
These were extremely abhorrent
to the Western people

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.710 align:middle line:90%
in those times.

00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:05.860 align:middle line:84%
So he very carefully taught them
largely the idea of Jnana yoga.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Ramakrishna's chief disciple,
Swami Vivekananda entered onto

the world stage with the keynote
address at the World Parliament

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:17.030 align:middle line:90%
of Religions in Chicago in 1893.

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:23.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Vivekananda is the first,
most prominent messenger

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:26.820 align:middle line:90%
of India to the West.

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:29.670 align:middle line:84%
And he took the
message of Hinduism

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.930 align:middle line:90%
in the form of Vedanta.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:33.300 align:middle line:10%
Why Vedanta?

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:37.200 align:middle line:10%
Simply because Vedanta
is nonsectarian.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.700 align:middle line:90%
There is no God, the God in man.

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:46.590 align:middle line:84%
He taught that human, in
the form of human being--

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:84%
if we can serve, we
can reach that state

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:55.650 align:middle line:84%
of purification of mind
by which ultimately we

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.640 align:middle line:90%
can realize the ultimate.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.880 align:middle line:84%
The goal of life,
according to Jnana

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.730 align:middle line:84%
yoga is to realize
the supreme oneness

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:08.190 align:middle line:84%
with the entire humanity,
existence, everything.

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:12.690 align:middle line:84%
So that, you know, is largely
the part of reasoning--

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.040 align:middle line:90%
Jnana-- the inquiry.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.899 align:middle line:90%
That's what leads to that.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Satsang, or associating
with true people,

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.860 align:middle line:84%
is a primary belief all
yogic paths share that spread

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.990 align:middle line:84%
spiritual knowledge
in a profound way.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:42.580 align:middle line:84%
>> "Sat" means truth, and
"sang" means together.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:47.309 align:middle line:84%
So satsang means gathering
together in truth.

00:23:47.309 --> 00:23:48.850 align:middle line:84%
This is not about
going to the movies

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:50.530 align:middle line:90%
together or going out to eat.

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:54.490 align:middle line:84%
It's to gather together to
go deeper into the truth

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:58.140 align:middle line:84%
and to help each
other find the truth.

00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:03.160 align:middle line:84%
>> In typical satsang, where
if it's led by a teacher,

00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.920 align:middle line:84%
you would have the teacher
giving a discourse potentially

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:09.370 align:middle line:84%
on the teachings of the guru
in that particular lineage

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:10.930 align:middle line:90%
or readings.

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.850 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, it's even
a Q&A where you're

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.450 align:middle line:84%
discussing matters of the
heart, matters of life,

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.050 align:middle line:84%
but then also doing
practice together.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.270 align:middle line:84%
>> There's more power in
the energy of the group than

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.020 align:middle line:90%
on individual practice.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.220 align:middle line:84%
And this is quite
obvious if you come

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.630 align:middle line:84%
to an ashram like this, what
we achieve in one day will

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:33.280 align:middle line:84%
be very, very
difficult for a person

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.295 align:middle line:90%
to do by themselves at home.

00:24:35.295 --> 00:24:38.350 align:middle line:84%
>> Buddha asked Ananda,
what's the most important part

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.370 align:middle line:90%
of teaching?

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.185 align:middle line:90%
Is it the teaching?

00:24:40.185 --> 00:24:42.430 align:middle line:84%
Or is it the Dharma
or the Sangha?

00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:46.000 align:middle line:84%
And so Ananda said, it's the
teaching, it's you, the Buddha.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.050 align:middle line:90%
And he said, no.

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:48.940 align:middle line:84%
The most important
thing in spiritual life

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:51.430 align:middle line:90%
is the sangha, or the satsung.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:54.700 align:middle line:84%
People who are working
together, individually

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.830 align:middle line:90%
together, on the path.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.730 align:middle line:84%
We help each other stay
centered, focused, and heading

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.350 align:middle line:90%
in the right direction.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:05.320 align:middle line:84%
Who you hang out with has a
lot to do with how you think

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.900 align:middle line:90%
and how you spend your day.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:10.000 align:middle line:84%
And the choices
you made about who

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.240 align:middle line:84%
you're going to hang out
with is your previous karmas

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.430 align:middle line:90%
manifesting themselves.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:18.610 align:middle line:84%
So you begin to see that
you surround yourself

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.270 align:middle line:84%
with things that will help
you satisfy your desires,

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.070 align:middle line:90%
what you want.

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.910 align:middle line:90%


00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.590 align:middle line:84%
>> Another powerful technique
often used in the three margas

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.830 align:middle line:90%
is japa.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Unlike kirtan that
have no fixed form,

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.560 align:middle line:84%
japa uses very
specific repetitions

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:38.410 align:middle line:84%
that focus the mind and
harness subtle energies

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:42.890 align:middle line:84%
meant to achieve an inner
evolution of consciousness.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:48.260 align:middle line:10%
>> Japa practice is the
repetition of a special name

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:51.590 align:middle line:10%
or a word or a syllable that's
been given as a particular

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:52.400 align:middle line:10%
practice.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.960 align:middle line:84%
In many traditions in India,
your teacher, or your lineage,

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.290 align:middle line:84%
will initiate you into
a particular mantra.

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.890 align:middle line:90%
So that could be anything.

00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:03.470 align:middle line:90%
It could be om.

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.150 align:middle line:84%
It could be om shri
matre namaha if you're

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:10.096 align:middle line:90%
a follower of the goddess.

00:26:10.096 --> 00:26:12.320 align:middle line:84%

you can even stop
using the mala beads.

But initially, it can
be very helpful just

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:27.602 align:middle line:84%

you're longing for that love.

And the first thing about

technicolor, and you're only
