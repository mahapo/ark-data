describe Raja yoga as being

the ultimate goal
of yoga practice.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.340 align:middle line:84%
Often referred to
as the royal yoga,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.860 align:middle line:84%
because of its
Sanskrit meaning king,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.550 align:middle line:84%
raja yoga deals directly with
controlling and transcending

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.430 align:middle line:84%
the thoughts of the mind
through deep meditation.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.230 align:middle line:90%
>> The king is within us.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.740 align:middle line:84%
Our soul is the
king who is ruling

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.880 align:middle line:84%
over all our body, our mind, our
intelligence, our conscience.

made still and pure,

true self will automatically,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.520 align:middle line:90%
instantaneously shine forth.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.880 align:middle line:90%
>> What is Raja yoga?

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.070 align:middle line:84%
The way soul descended
from divinity

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.910 align:middle line:84%
and came down to the
materialistic plane

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.040 align:middle line:90%
or God caught with excellence.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.550 align:middle line:84%
Reversing that path,
the path of ascension.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.740 align:middle line:84%
That is Raja yoga--
the path of ascension,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.610 align:middle line:84%
which is to be taken by
any soul who travels back

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.710 align:middle line:90%
from where we came down.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.992 align:middle line:90%
So paradise lost.

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:56.450 align:middle line:84%
Now paradise is to
be the regained.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.530 align:middle line:90%
live like a king in this world.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.110 align:middle line:10%
>> Raja yoga actually
is a very broad area.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.400 align:middle line:84%
It includes many
techniques that will help,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.060 align:middle line:90%
including Hatha yoga.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.050 align:middle line:84%
Hatha yoga is the more
physical practices

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.320 align:middle line:90%
such as asana pranayama.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.480 align:middle line:84%
These physical practices also
have a very strong effect

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:90%
on our mind.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.690 align:middle line:84%
So they are considered
part of raja yoga.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.680 align:middle line:84%
>> Raja yoga meditation connects
the mind directly to the source

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.420 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual power.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.220 align:middle line:84%
That pure source is seen as the
ruler or the king of our lives.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.250 align:middle line:84%
>> In Raja yoga, we start
to understand the mind,

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle line:84%
recognize the mind
for what it is,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.440 align:middle line:84%
and learn how to work with it
and change it in a positive way

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.830 align:middle line:90%
that we choose.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.680 align:middle line:84%
So we can become
essentially kings

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.630 align:middle line:90%
of kings or queens of queens--

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.060 align:middle line:84%
really masters of our own
mind rather than victims

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.530 align:middle line:90%
of our mind.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.300 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately Raja
yoga translates

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.150 align:middle line:84%
into meditation, which is maybe
the most advanced technique

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.950 align:middle line:90%
of mind control.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:21.250 align:middle line:90%

>> One of the oldest
systems of yoga,

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.220 align:middle line:84%
Raja follows closely the more
renounciate path outlined

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.790 align:middle line:84%
in Patanjali's eightfold system,
making it one of the most

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.550 align:middle line:90%
difficult paths to traverse.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.660 align:middle line:10%
>> Raja yoga follows potentially
Yoga Sutras based on eight

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.770 align:middle line:10%
steps or eight parts.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.290 align:middle line:90%
It's a step-by-step process--

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.740 align:middle line:84%
first starting with
the physical posture

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.590 align:middle line:84%
of finding physical comfort,
which is basically asana.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.700 align:middle line:90%


00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.890 align:middle line:84%
>> In meditation
when the person sits,

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.420 align:middle line:84%
asana is very important where
you keep the body very relaxed

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.710 align:middle line:84%
and the spine straight and
eyes fixed on the point between

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.210 align:middle line:84%
the eyebrows-- the Kutastha
center, as it is called.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Then learning how to focus on
the breath and how to regulate

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.840 align:middle line:10%
the breath and
reduce the breath,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.910 align:middle line:10%
which we can call pranayama.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:10%
>> The quieting of the breath,
recognizing the in breath,

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.750 align:middle line:10%
being able to hold
the in breath.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.970 align:middle line:84%
Recognizing the out
breath and then being

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.840 align:middle line:90%
able to hold the out breath.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.660 align:middle line:84%
>> Through that
pranayam process,

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.190 align:middle line:84%
the soul then accesses intuitive
perceptions of the divine

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:90%
realms.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.000 align:middle line:90%


00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.190 align:middle line:84%
>> Automatically when you
are reducing your breath,

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.710 align:middle line:90%
your mind is going to slow down.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.270 align:middle line:84%
And you are naturally
going to start

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.700 align:middle line:84%
withdrawing your attention
from the outside world

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.140 align:middle line:84%
towards your own inner
experience, which

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.250 align:middle line:84%
is called pratyahara
and then learning

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.410 align:middle line:84%
how to keep them
mind more focused

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.590 align:middle line:84%
and not allowing it to
wander in imagination, which

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.650 align:middle line:84%
is the next major challenge,
which is called concentration

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.540 align:middle line:90%
in dharana.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:90%
>> It literally means holding.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.500 align:middle line:84%
We were given the
instruction to hold to Earth,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.920 align:middle line:84%
to sit and gaze and thread your
thoughts into an acknowledgment

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.710 align:middle line:84%
and an appreciation of
Earth for a full month

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.230 align:middle line:84%
and train your mind to
honor and to recognize

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.840 align:middle line:84%
the power and the beauty
of the water outside,

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.070 align:middle line:84%
to recognize the sunrise,
the noon time, the sunset

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.270 align:middle line:84%
as well as the darkness
and then breath

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.600 align:middle line:84%
into wind to see that that which
moves the leaves of the trees

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.920 align:middle line:84%
is the same force that
moves our body, that

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.379 align:middle line:84%
moves with our breath, with
the waves of the ocean,

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:57.670 align:middle line:90%
with the passing of the clouds.

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.970 align:middle line:90%


00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.840 align:middle line:84%

build into meditation--

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.740 align:middle line:10%
--where whatever
your focus, we're

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.030 align:middle line:10%
able to place ourselves
for a sustained period

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.100 align:middle line:10%
through the quieting of
the body in the breath

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.490 align:middle line:10%
and through that concentration
into a state of meditation.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.670 align:middle line:90%


00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.760 align:middle line:84%
>> The experience of the
opening of consciousness,

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.080 align:middle line:84%
it's called dhyana, which
opens you to the entire world

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:36.375 align:middle line:90%
of possible subtle experience.

00:06:36.375 --> 00:06:37.920 align:middle line:90%
It happens on its own.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.380 align:middle line:90%
You can't make it happen.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.750 align:middle line:84%
And then that
experience culminates

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.100 align:middle line:84%
in what's called samadhi, the
utter absorption in the very

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle line:84%
subtlest states
of consciousness,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.950 align:middle line:90%
which is progressive.

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.800 align:middle line:84%
Now there are many, many
types of samadhi, samadhis

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.600 align:middle line:84%
in which you become immersed in
a form like a mantra or a light

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.820 align:middle line:84%
and a samadhi where
you're completely absorbed

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.280 align:middle line:90%
in formless consciousness.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.710 align:middle line:84%
And "The Yoga
Sutras of Patanjali"

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.650 align:middle line:84%
actually gives all
these experiences.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:11.290 align:middle line:84%
But you can't really understand
them from reading the text.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.210 align:middle line:90%
You need a teacher.

Raja yoga became
an instant success

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.520 align:middle line:10%
and was highly influential
in the Western understanding

of yoga.

bright, brilliant young man.

He was basically a
member of this society

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.600 align:middle line:10%
called Brahmo Samaj.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.940 align:middle line:10%
By nature, you
know, from birth, he

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.640 align:middle line:10%
was deeply attracted
to a meditative life.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.340 align:middle line:10%
That was his spontaneous
and real nature.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:17.090 align:middle line:10%
So he was born an adept,
true yogi in that sense.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.810 align:middle line:10%
He would go into deep
depths during meditation

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.090 align:middle line:10%
and it was a great task
for Sri Ramakrishna

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.040 align:middle line:10%
to bring him out of
that and make him work

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.910 align:middle line:10%
for the welfare of the world.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.560 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, you may say
his basic drift was personally,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.869 align:middle line:84%
he was given to a deeply
meditative and contemplative

00:08:33.869 --> 00:08:34.669 align:middle line:90%
life.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.710 align:middle line:84%
>> My master was his Holiness
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi--

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:19.170 align:middle line:84%
when I was a student
in university 1977,

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.250 align:middle line:90%
I listened about him.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.450 align:middle line:90%
Later I got initiation from him.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:28.140 align:middle line:84%
And then I realized that
meditation is not an act.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.440 align:middle line:90%
It's the effortless effort.

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.170 align:middle line:84%
So it is just
simplest and natural.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.690 align:middle line:90%
And it is our ownness.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:40.410 align:middle line:84%
We can experience
it intuitionally.

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Through intuition, we
experience absoluteness.

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.400 align:middle line:84%
And it's a
traditional technique.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:53.280 align:middle line:84%
We can say in this technique
we utilize body, mind,

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.650 align:middle line:90%
and heart together.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.500 align:middle line:90%
>> So it takes practice.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.840 align:middle line:84%
It takes a commitment really in
the beginning to be a seeker.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.650 align:middle line:84%
>> But for the dedicated
student who really wants to use

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:10.362 align:middle line:84%
a technology to be able to
sustain and manage their lives,

00:10:10.362 --> 00:10:11.820 align:middle line:84%
then they're going
to work on this.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.365 align:middle line:84%
They're going to work
on it every single day.

00:10:14.365 --> 00:10:19.122 align:middle line:84%

just that, relax.

00:10:19.122 --> 00:10:20.114 align:middle line:90%

>> Recent studies have proven
that meditation improves focus,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.310 align:middle line:84%
increases brain and immune
function, decreases pain,

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:45.810 align:middle line:84%
symptoms of depression, stress,
anxiety, and improves memory.

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:52.300 align:middle line:84%
But how exactly does meditation
affect consciousness and why?

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.100 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, what
is consciousness?

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.560 align:middle line:84%
One way of thinking of
it is simply awareness.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.800 align:middle line:84%
That's like the mystery is
how am I aware of anything?

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.840 align:middle line:90%
How am I aware of myself?

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.067 align:middle line:90%
So that's consciousness.

00:11:03.067 --> 00:11:04.150 align:middle line:90%
But it's bigger than that.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.890 align:middle line:84%
So we know from
the neurosciences

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.040 align:middle line:84%
that your conscious awareness
is a very thin slice.

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And you have a huge amount
of unconscious processes

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.110 align:middle line:90%
going on all the time.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The human beings-- our
conscious mind is only 5%.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.920 align:middle line:84%
We are dominated by our
subconscious tendencies.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:84%
>> Through the
process of meditation,

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.860 align:middle line:84%
you slowly begin to
increase that percentage.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.956 align:middle line:84%
And ultimately what you'd hope
to do is go all the way down.

00:11:29.956 --> 00:11:31.330 align:middle line:84%
If you could go
all the way down,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.230 align:middle line:84%
you'd be aware of
things that are there

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:36.920 align:middle line:84%
and normally most people would
not even know that they exist.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.370 align:middle line:90%


00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:44.350 align:middle line:84%

that meditation has to do with

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:45.580 align:middle line:90%
silencing the mind.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.020 align:middle line:90%
That's not what it is at all.

beginner's meditation,

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:10%
they will start going
from a state of stress,

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:19.470 align:middle line:10%
where their brainwaves
being dominated by beta,

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:22.270 align:middle line:10%
high frequency beta, they will
start going to middle range

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:25.550 align:middle line:10%
beta to low range
beta to alpha theta.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:29.017 align:middle line:90%


00:12:29.017 --> 00:12:31.100 align:middle line:10%
When you start going into
just in the alpha state,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.280 align:middle line:10%
you are much more receptive,
much more relaxed.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:35.080 align:middle line:90%
Yes?

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.496 align:middle line:90%
People are too wound up, man.

00:12:36.496 --> 00:12:37.370 align:middle line:90%
They're too stressed.

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:41.070 align:middle line:84%
They're too-- just
too tightly wound, too

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.010 align:middle line:84%
sense of self-importance,
my purpose, my purpose.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.080 align:middle line:90%
You have no purpose.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.160 align:middle line:90%
Be quiet for a while.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.740 align:middle line:84%
The mountain is not
asking, what is my purpose

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:51.570 align:middle line:90%
the mountain is just there.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.490 align:middle line:84%
So meditation is
the process where

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.070 align:middle line:84%
you get so silent
inside that you

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:58.770 align:middle line:90%
start listening to existence.

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.870 align:middle line:84%
Then it is not so
much your purpose.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:03.810 align:middle line:84%
It is purpose of
existence through you.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:08.940 align:middle line:84%
And that's what we call inspired
action, not ambitious action.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.830 align:middle line:90%
Ambition destroys the world.

00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:15.057 align:middle line:84%
Inspiration, vision, these
are not products of thought.

00:13:15.057 --> 00:13:16.140 align:middle line:90%
This is something subtler.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:17.910 align:middle line:84%
This is an event in
your consciousness.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.090 align:middle line:84%
And for that to happen, you
have capacity to see it.

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.620 align:middle line:84%
If you are only dominated
by external environment

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.250 align:middle line:84%
and you are looking
for meaning there,

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.170 align:middle line:84%
then you will never be
able to listen to it.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:29.670 align:middle line:84%
So in the process
of meditation, you

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.160 align:middle line:84%
start going through
this source of power.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.680 align:middle line:84%
You start having an
experience of silence.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:41.970 align:middle line:84%
In that silence you start
being open to seeing what is.

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.470 align:middle line:84%
>> You begin to sense that
there's something within you

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:47.940 align:middle line:90%
that's guiding you.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.060 align:middle line:84%
It's almost as though there's
this unseen hand that's

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:54.120 align:middle line:84%
walking you through all the
activities and the events

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.050 align:middle line:84%
of your life so that
you're at the right place

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.920 align:middle line:84%
at the right time, and
you do the right thing.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
>> Effortless action
starts to happen.

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:07.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's when you feel a
fulfillment because then it's

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:09.420 align:middle line:90%
purpose, not your purpose.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.640 align:middle line:90%
There is less and less of you.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.469 align:middle line:84%
So when there is
less and less of you,

00:14:13.469 --> 00:14:15.510 align:middle line:84%
then you will be less
manipulated, less stressed.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.342 align:middle line:90%

>> That subtle stuff that we
call consciousness or awareness

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.680 align:middle line:84%
or God-ness, it's
radically creative.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.590 align:middle line:84%
And it creates inside
human awareness

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:39.920 align:middle line:84%
just as it creates
in the outer world.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.560 align:middle line:84%
So there are many,
many layers of subtlety

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:44.330 align:middle line:90%
that we can go through.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.400 align:middle line:84%
My personal
meditation experience

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.410 align:middle line:84%
is often a feeling of sinking
deeper and deeper and deeper.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.990 align:middle line:84%
And then my awareness
will kind of expand

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:59.450 align:middle line:84%
and I'll be in this
vast kind of realm.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.500 align:middle line:90%
Feelings will appear.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.610 align:middle line:90%
Colors will appear.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.860 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I'll have a
sense of a being there.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.340 align:middle line:84%
But it's not particularly
exciting or colorful

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:90%
or full of stories.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Many, many people
have these experiences

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:16.520 align:middle line:84%
of moving through worlds
where you actually

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.130 align:middle line:84%
see these kind of light
grids, which they say

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.570 align:middle line:84%
are the precursors to
the physical world.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:25.460 align:middle line:84%
So there's a lot that can
arise in consciousness

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.170 align:middle line:90%
in deep meditation.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.520 align:middle line:84%
And you actually can learn
how to enter these realms

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:35.150 align:middle line:84%
and revisit these realms if you
do certain kinds of practices.

There is creativity happening

but it is not through
thought because it is not

the human mind
which is creating.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.220 align:middle line:84%
It is a global,
conscious mind, what

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.240 align:middle line:84%
we call the mind of God, which
is ready to manifest that.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.610 align:middle line:84%
So through the meditation
you start listening to God,

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.130 align:middle line:84%
for the lack of a better
word, because God ultimately

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:90%
is a word.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.110 align:middle line:84%
There is ultimately no
being who is sitting
