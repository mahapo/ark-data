kind of psychic powers that are

available.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.630 align:middle line:84%
And they're fine, but we're
told not to get stuck on them.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.170 align:middle line:84%
If you touch them,
then you'll get caught.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.600 align:middle line:90%
>> Energy is not a plaything.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.450 align:middle line:84%
It should come to
the hand who wants

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.600 align:middle line:84%
to help others, not to show
his power to others, no.

>> If we as humans contain
the entire universe within us,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.810 align:middle line:84%
then we possess the heart of
a lion, the grace of a swan,

and even the flight of a bird.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.030 align:middle line:84%
>> A siddhi,
S-I-D-D-H-I, siddhi,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.520 align:middle line:84%
is an attainment
or a perfection.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.490 align:middle line:84%
That's the translation
from Sanskrit.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.160 align:middle line:10%
>> Siddhi simply means
an accomplished goal,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.480 align:middle line:10%
so a siddhi means something
that's been perfected.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.700 align:middle line:84%
>> And the notion is that once
you have achieved a certain

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.320 align:middle line:84%
level of ability in meditation,
and also this Samyama approach

that it causes things to happen.

>> You know, the capacity for
becoming so heavy that nobody

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:84%
can move you, the capacity for
becoming so light that you fly.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Becoming really small,
becoming really big,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.890 align:middle line:90%
becoming invisible.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
>> The ability to bilocate,
to appear here and in Delhi

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.450 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.910 align:middle line:84%
>> Be able to grab
things from another room,

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.430 align:middle line:84%
all these kind of strange
things that don't quite fit

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.020 align:middle line:84%
the Western idea
of psychic powers.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.620 align:middle line:90%


00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.290 align:middle line:84%
>> So from our perspective,
it causes powers to occur.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.680 align:middle line:84%
Some are what we would
call exceptional mind-body

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.500 align:middle line:84%
connections, so things
like super-healing

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
of yourself and of others,
being able to drink poison

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.510 align:middle line:90%
and having no effect on you.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.060 align:middle line:84%
Levitation is kind
of a mind-body effect

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's your mind and
your body is doing something.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.840 align:middle line:10%
>> They exist in the literature
and in tradition because people

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.850 align:middle line:10%
have experienced them.

>> If you've read books like
"Autobiography of a Yogi,"

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.230 align:middle line:84%
Yogananda talks about meeting
people who had that capacity.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.810 align:middle line:84%
>> The emergence of these
supernormal powers while

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.110 align:middle line:84%
following the Eightfold
Path, or any yogic path,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.610 align:middle line:84%
diligently is stated in other
matter-of-fact terms in classic

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.050 align:middle line:84%
yoga texts, such as
Patanjali's "Yoga Sutras."

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.960 align:middle line:84%
>> The siddhis are first
kind of closely analyzed

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.750 align:middle line:90%
in Patanjali's "Yoga Sutras."

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.670 align:middle line:10%
In the third
chapter, he explains

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.920 align:middle line:10%
how to get them, saying
that if you practice

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.522 align:middle line:10%
this three-fold meditation on a
particular thing, the planets,

00:03:06.522 --> 00:03:07.980 align:middle line:10%
or the sky, or a
part of your body,

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.390 align:middle line:10%
or so forth, you will get
this particular power.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.050 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.840 align:middle line:84%
>> While Patanjali doesn't
discourage these supernormal

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.770 align:middle line:84%
states, he also makes it clear
that the siddhis are potential

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.125 align:middle line:90%
impediments to the goal of yoga.

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:25.310 align:middle line:84%
>> And yoga has always been
closely associated with

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.110 align:middle line:90%
the siddhis.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.860 align:middle line:84%
And it's clear that he
doesn't see it as a bad thing

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:84%
if you strive directly to get
these supernatural powers.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.200 align:middle line:84%
He goes through
20 or 30 of them.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.050 align:middle line:84%
So why would he do that if he
thought it was a bad thing?

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.900 align:middle line:84%
And it does say
about three of them

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.440 align:middle line:84%
that they are not to be
pursued, that the direct aim

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.752 align:middle line:84%
for those ones is a hindrance
to the final goal of yoga.

00:03:47.752 --> 00:03:49.460 align:middle line:84%
But he doesn't say
that about the others.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.043 align:middle line:84%
So it's a hard one to understand
because later texts certainly

00:03:52.043 --> 00:03:55.220 align:middle line:84%
do say that pursuing siddhis
directly is a bad thing,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.780 align:middle line:84%
is an obstacle to the
ultimate goal of yoga.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.360 align:middle line:90%
But Patanjali's not so clear.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.920 align:middle line:90%


00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.800 align:middle line:84%
>> My sense of it is, probably,
at a certain period in history,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.740 align:middle line:84%
at a certain period in Indian
society no one disbelieved

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.470 align:middle line:84%
in these powers,
in these siddhis.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle line:84%
And I think collective
consciousness

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.720 align:middle line:90%
is incredibly powerful.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.170 align:middle line:84%
I think people actually
really could do things

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.600 align:middle line:84%
that we don't see now
because we don't have

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.540 align:middle line:84%
this sort of critical
mass of total faith

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.140 align:middle line:90%
in those possibilities.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.310 align:middle line:84%
So if consciousness is creating
reality moment to moment,

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.890 align:middle line:90%
why shouldn't that be possible?

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.730 align:middle line:90%
In my view, anything's possible.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.100 align:middle line:84%
But the question is,
is it significant?

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.136 align:middle line:84%
And the answer in
the tradition is no.

00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:41.440 align:middle line:84%
No, it's not any
more significant

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.300 align:middle line:90%
than any random thing.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.650 align:middle line:90%


00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.220 align:middle line:10%
>> The siddhas in the tradition
that I come from were extremely

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:56.130 align:middle line:10%
eccentric yogis, all of
whom had major yogic powers.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.110 align:middle line:84%
So a siddha is one who has
the full complement of what

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.310 align:middle line:84%
are sometimes defined
as supernatural powers,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.990 align:middle line:90%
paranormal powers--

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.620 align:middle line:84%
for instance, answer the
prayers of their devotees

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.710 align:middle line:90%
such that diseases are cured.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Miraculous occurrences
happen just

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.350 align:middle line:90%
by the master giving a blessing.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.010 align:middle line:90%
I'll tell you an amazing story.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:25.210 align:middle line:84%
My guru's guru was once sitting
in his room in Ganeshpuri,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.160 align:middle line:90%
India, outside Mumbai.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.280 align:middle line:84%
And he suddenly raised
his hand, and cried out,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.760 align:middle line:84%
and made a gesture like
this at a plane that

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.290 align:middle line:90%
was flying by overhead.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.460 align:middle line:84%
And several days later, one of
his devotees came from Mumbai

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.360 align:middle line:84%
and said he'd been on this plane
that was flying from Mumbai

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.250 align:middle line:90%
to Chennai.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.860 align:middle line:84%
And suddenly, the plane
started to fall out of the sky.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.560 align:middle line:84%
And there was this
feeling as though a hand

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.150 align:middle line:90%
came and held the plane up.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.630 align:middle line:84%
So that's the kind of story
that is told about siddhas.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.855 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.855 --> 00:06:04.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Samayama is a method that
is talked about in the "Yoga

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.630 align:middle line:84%
Sutras," which is said to
give rise to special powers,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.050 align:middle line:90%
siddhis.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.590 align:middle line:84%
So it's a combination
of what we would

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:84%
think of in the West
as concentration plus

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.980 align:middle line:90%
meditation plus samadhi.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.690 align:middle line:84%
And then Sanyama is a
slightly different approach

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.590 align:middle line:84%
where once you've achieved
samadhi, full mystical union,

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.867 align:middle line:84%
you put a little bit of
intention on an object.

00:06:30.867 --> 00:06:32.450 align:middle line:84%
So the object could
be another person.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:33.533 align:middle line:90%
It could be another thing.

00:06:33.533 --> 00:06:34.700 align:middle line:90%
It could be a concept.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And by becoming union with that
object, you gain the power.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.920 align:middle line:84%
>> In most branches of yoga,
and certainly in tantric yoga,

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.075 align:middle line:84%
it was always clearly understood
that magical powers, siddhis,

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.770 align:middle line:90%
vibhutis--

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.120 align:middle line:90%
they go by different names--

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.960 align:middle line:84%
have nothing to do with
spiritual realization.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.990 align:middle line:84%
They're just an independent
thing that can be cultivated.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.580 align:middle line:84%
Indeed, in tantric
yoga it's taught

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.510 align:middle line:84%
if you want to cultivate
siddhis, which includes

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.140 align:middle line:84%
not only magical powers
but things like the ability

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.230 align:middle line:84%
to make lots of money, or
attract lots of lovers,

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.100 align:middle line:90%
or, you know--

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.570 align:middle line:90%
it's like those are all siddhis.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.710 align:middle line:90%
But it's very clear.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.390 align:middle line:84%
If that's what you
want to pursue,

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.630 align:middle line:84%
it's very unlikely that
you'll be spiritually realized

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.740 align:middle line:90%
in this lifetime.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.915 align:middle line:84%
You're essentially deferring
that until the next lifetime.

00:07:23.915 --> 00:07:26.590 align:middle line:90%


00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:29.830 align:middle line:84%
>> Thought not to be magical
in nature but, rather,

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.490 align:middle line:84%
ordinary human abilities,
siddhis take years,

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.570 align:middle line:84%
even lifetimes, of practice and
only show up when consciousness

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:42.080 align:middle line:84%
has reached a supreme
level of development.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.990 align:middle line:84%
>> First of all, what
is consciousness?

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.930 align:middle line:84%
So one way of thinking of
it is simply awareness.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.200 align:middle line:84%
That's like the mystery is,
how am I aware of anything?

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.240 align:middle line:90%
How am I aware of myself?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.550 align:middle line:84%
So that's consciousness,
but it's bigger than that.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.290 align:middle line:84%
So we know from
the neurosciences

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.440 align:middle line:84%
that your conscious awareness
is a very thin slice,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.560 align:middle line:84%
and you have a huge amount of
unconscious processes going

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.850 align:middle line:90%
on all the time.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
One estimate I
read said that when

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.080 align:middle line:84%
you look at the total amount
of information that's impinging

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.650 align:middle line:84%
on you, you are consciously
aware of one trillionth

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.340 align:middle line:90%
of what's actually there.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:84%
So through the
process of meditation,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.060 align:middle line:84%
you slowly begin to
increase that percentage.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.070 align:middle line:90%


00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:26.300 align:middle line:84%
>> My guru used to say that all
of these siddhis come to you

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.160 align:middle line:84%
automatically once you have
realized your oneness with

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.960 align:middle line:90%
the absolute.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.239 align:middle line:84%
He said that the siddhis
don't have to be cultivated.

00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:34.039 align:middle line:90%
They come.

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:37.549 align:middle line:84%
They arrive naturally
to one who's

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:40.900 align:middle line:84%
united themself
with the absolute.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.950 align:middle line:84%
>> However, you don't need
to reach full enlightenment

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:48.190 align:middle line:84%
to begin experiencing
the gifts of the siddhis.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:52.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Among the things that could
arise as a result of having

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.450 align:middle line:84%
an expanded consciousness,
people will start reporting

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.280 align:middle line:84%
that they feel energy
in their bodies.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.130 align:middle line:90%
They feel it from other places.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.550 align:middle line:84%
They feel information
coming from objects.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.220 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, the whole panoply
of psychic and mystical

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%
experience, they live
in that deep space.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.960 align:middle line:84%
So the notion of something like
the chakras, energy centers

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.870 align:middle line:84%
in the body, from a Western
science perspective,

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.510 align:middle line:84%
that doesn't exist because
we don't have instruments

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:20.740 align:middle line:90%
to measure it yet.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.290 align:middle line:84%
This is true in general
about subtle energies,

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:24.820 align:middle line:84%
we call it, or
subtle perceptions.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.403 align:middle line:84%
We don't have instruments
that can nail it down.

00:09:28.403 --> 00:09:30.070 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
that they don't exist.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.050 align:middle line:84%
Because it's pretty
clear that when

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.790 align:middle line:84%
you have people
who meditate a lot,

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.620 align:middle line:84%
they all start reporting
similar outcomes.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.880 align:middle line:84%
In fact, we did a survey
of 1,200 meditators

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.975 align:middle line:84%
and asked them
questions, not along

00:09:41.975 --> 00:09:44.350 align:middle line:84%
mental health and physical
health, because that's already

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:46.270 align:middle line:84%
pretty well understood,
but more about,

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:48.370 align:middle line:84%
what kinds of
experiences have you

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.100 align:middle line:90%
had as a result of meditation?

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.760 align:middle line:84%
75% of them are talking about
things like clairvoyance,

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.980 align:middle line:84%
and synchronicities,
and telepathy

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
simply arising spontaneously
as a result of their practice.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.890 align:middle line:84%
>> The power of consciousness
is more far-reaching than most

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.410 align:middle line:90%
people would suspect.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:12.680 align:middle line:84%
If you want to do something like
walk on water, first of all,

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.530 align:middle line:84%
you have to have some yogic
attainment and concentration

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:16.330 align:middle line:90%
ability.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.030 align:middle line:84%
But you spend a few
years very, very vividly

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:22.060 align:middle line:84%
and one-pointedly
imaging a disk of earth.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.160 align:middle line:84%
And then when you
master it, you can just

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.310 align:middle line:84%
come to a body of water,
image a disk of earth

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.640 align:middle line:84%
there just underneath the
water, and step onto that.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:32.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the traditional
way that it's done.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.560 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.720 align:middle line:84%
We do have first-person
reports of yogis

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.620 align:middle line:84%
who could stop British
trains with their mind

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:44.770 align:middle line:84%
by visualizing a mountain
bearing down on the train

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:47.170 align:middle line:84%
but, again, only if
they had massive skills

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:90%
in concentration, right?

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.490 align:middle line:84%
In terms of whether these
things really happen, well,

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:54.865 align:middle line:84%
in my view and experience,
consciousness creates reality.

00:10:54.865 --> 00:11:02.700 align:middle line:90%


00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.610 align:middle line:84%
>> Siddhis have been known among
Western practitioners as well.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:09.360 align:middle line:84%
For instance, there are
well-documented sightings

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.560 align:middle line:84%
of St. Francis of Assisi
hovering in the air.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.440 align:middle line:84%
Telekinesis is another
example of siddhi.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.260 align:middle line:84%
In Indian culture,
it's called Indrajal,

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:22.300 align:middle line:84%
which translates to
concentrating thought power,

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:27.928 align:middle line:84%
giving someone the ability to
move objects or bend spoons.

00:11:27.928 --> 00:11:30.220 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the phenomena that
we've become more and more

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle line:84%
aware of in the West is the fact
that human beings actually have

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.570 align:middle line:84%
capacities that we've
come to call paranormal,

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.690 align:middle line:90%
meaning beyond the ordinary.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But more and more,
we're aware that these

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.950 align:middle line:84%
are capacities that
are within the range

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:90%
of ordinary human experience.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.590 align:middle line:84%
And some of the ones
that more and more people

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:53.950 align:middle line:84%
that I know experience are
a kind of clairvoyance.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.390 align:middle line:90%
It's not so unusual.

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.120 align:middle line:84%
For instance, it's
probably happened to you.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.220 align:middle line:84%
The phone rings, and you know
that it's your cousin Janet.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.220 align:middle line:10%
And you pick up the phone,
and sure enough, it's

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.360 align:middle line:10%
your cousin Janet.

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Or you start thinking
about somebody

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:07.840 align:middle line:84%
that you haven't
seen in 20 years,

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.900 align:middle line:84%
and then there's a letter
from that person in the mail.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.840 align:middle line:84%
So these are actually
examples of siddhis,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.690 align:middle line:84%
that there is the capacity for
knowing something that you have

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:24.910 align:middle line:84%
no sensory means of knowing, the
experience of having a thought

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.740 align:middle line:84%
or having a strong
intention, for instance,

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.352 align:middle line:84%
making a blessing or
wishing for something--

00:12:30.352 --> 00:12:32.560 align:middle line:84%
remember how they say, be
careful what you wish for--

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.610 align:middle line:84%
and having it show
up in your life.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:39.480 align:middle line:84%
These are examples of siddhis
that are not that uncommon.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.020 align:middle line:84%
>> I think in the West, the way
that we think of common sense

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:47.770 align:middle line:84%
is literally the common
senses and what they see.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:50.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's how much of
our physics has developed.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.200 align:middle line:84%
That's much of our
civilization has developed.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.310 align:middle line:90%
It's all based on common sense.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.680 align:middle line:84%
Science has showed us
that common sense is

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.270 align:middle line:90%
a very thin slice of the world.

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.160 align:middle line:84%
Every time we develop
a new instrument,

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.847 align:middle line:90%
we see more of the world.

00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:03.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's not too
surprising that if you

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.650 align:middle line:84%
have traditions that
are specifically

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:09.790 align:middle line:84%
going inside subjectively
and expanding your ability

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.790 align:middle line:84%
to perceive that you're
going to start seeing things

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:14.770 align:middle line:90%
that other people can't see.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.860 align:middle line:84%
This also is relevant to the
notion from, mostly from,

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Eastern philosophy but
from the West as well,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.950 align:middle line:84%
about where does the
physical world come from?

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.200 align:middle line:84%
What gives rise
to it, especially

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.325 align:middle line:90%
in light of subjectivity?

00:13:28.325 --> 00:13:29.200 align:middle line:90%
So we have awareness.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.060 align:middle line:84%
We have consciousness
in the head.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.130 align:middle line:84%
Neuroscience thinks
it's in the brain,

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.190 align:middle line:84%
like a computer in there, and
it's generating it somehow.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:38.440 align:middle line:84%
Nobody has any idea
how that would work.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.210 align:middle line:84%
But that's a
Western perspective.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.400 align:middle line:84%
You take a more of a
idealist perspective

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.620 align:middle line:84%
or a Vedantic perspective, it's
because consciousness was here

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:47.080 align:middle line:90%
first.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:84%
It's really the
base of everything,

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.250 align:middle line:84%
and the physical world
comes out of that.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.450 align:middle line:90%
If that is true--

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.922 align:middle line:84%
and this comes out of the
meditative traditions.

00:13:54.922 --> 00:13:56.380 align:middle line:84%
I think the reason
why it comes out

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.290 align:middle line:84%
of the meditative traditions is
because the further down, like

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:02.860 align:middle line:84%
the more and more you expand
your ability to be aware,

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.350 align:middle line:84%
not just senses but just
awareness in general,

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:10.030 align:middle line:84%
the more you begin to understand
that you and the universe

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.120 align:middle line:90%
are really not different.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.950 align:middle line:84%
I think that's the basic idea
that comes out of Vedanta.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.200 align:middle line:10%
You and the consciousness
are the same, Mahatma equals

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:25.480 align:middle line:10%
Brahman

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.500 align:middle line:10%
>> Institutions like
Esalen, founded in 1962,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.710 align:middle line:10%
have been supporting alternative
methods for exploring human

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.650 align:middle line:10%
consciousness for decades
and have reported many

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.310 align:middle line:10%
well-documented cases of
extraordinary psychic abilities

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.190 align:middle line:10%
and paranormal phenomena.

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.580 align:middle line:90%
>> I've been up to Esalen.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.100 align:middle line:84%
And there has been
a sustained study

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:51.380 align:middle line:84%
of psi phenomena at Esalen as
has been going on for some 100

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.150 align:middle line:90%
years in the United States.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.940 align:middle line:84%
My own mother was
one of the subjects

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.900 align:middle line:84%
studied by JB Rhine at Duke
University in the 1930s.

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:00.920 align:middle line:90%
She was clairvoyant.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.050 align:middle line:84%
And they had done a
nationwide talent search,

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:06.230 align:middle line:84%
and she was a student at
the University of Buffalo.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:10.340 align:middle line:84%
And they flew all these kids
in to Duke for a semester.

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:84%
And they did the very famous
test of five cards, you know,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.300 align:middle line:84%
the square, the triangle, the
circle, and the squiggles.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.780 align:middle line:84%
And she paired remarkably
well with this woman.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.170 align:middle line:90%
They always got like over 80%.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:27.560 align:middle line:84%
And they did it first face to
face, and then room to room,

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.080 align:middle line:84%
screen to screen, room to
room, building to building.

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.360 align:middle line:10%
And, yeah, it's all
in that research

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.104 align:middle line:10%
that JB Rhine
published-- so, yeah.

00:15:35.104 --> 00:15:37.996 align:middle line:90%

00:15:37.996 --> 00:15:42.820 align:middle line:90%


00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.160 align:middle line:84%
>> The transformative,
and even magical,

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:84%
powers of words is recognized
in spiritual traditions all over

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.010 align:middle line:90%
the world.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:54.490 align:middle line:10%
The word "spell" comes from
Proto-German "spellen,"

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.110 align:middle line:10%
meaning "to tell."

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And the word "abracadabra"
was originally

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.570 align:middle line:84%
a Hebrew word which
Kabbalistic practitioners

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:06.530 align:middle line:84%
use to mean, "I create
according to my word."

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.380 align:middle line:84%
Mantras are among the
most ancient of these word

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.560 align:middle line:84%
formulations and can also be
used for magical purposes.

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:15.300 align:middle line:90%


00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Mantras can be
tools for meditation,

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:19.280 align:middle line:90%
for calming the mind.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.500 align:middle line:84%
And then they can
be, essentially,

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.440 align:middle line:84%
the equivalent of
magical spells that are

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.140 align:middle line:90%
accomplishing specific tasks.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:32.480 align:middle line:84%
Where you receive a mantra
from a guru or master who

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.020 align:middle line:84%
has infused it with some of the
energy of their own awakening,

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.540 align:middle line:84%
and they received it from
their teacher who infused it

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.000 align:middle line:84%
with some of the energy
of their awakening,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.510 align:middle line:84%
those are considered the
most powerful mantras

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.430 align:middle line:84%
because those
mantras help activate

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:51.320 align:middle line:84%
the energy of waking
up in your system

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:56.240 align:middle line:84%
at a kind of transmental
level, at a level beyond what

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.000 align:middle line:84%
the rational mind
can comprehend.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Because mantras partake
of awakened consciousness,

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.520 align:middle line:84%
the degree of your
own awakeness will

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:10.970 align:middle line:84%
determine the power with which
the mantra is able to operate.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:13.490 align:middle line:84%
>> The text I worked on for
my PhD has a what's called

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.510 align:middle line:90%
a mantra dhara.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:18.380 align:middle line:84%
So that's like a sort of
cryptic riddle or puzzle

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.439 align:middle line:84%
from which you
extract the mantra.

00:17:20.439 --> 00:17:23.930 align:middle line:84%
And If you repeat that mantra
hundreds of thousands of times,

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:27.980 align:middle line:84%
then you will achieve various
magical powers and so forth.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.880 align:middle line:84%
But also your mind will expand
and become one with the ether.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:37.760 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of seen as being
equivalent to enlightenment.

There are lots, and lots, and
lots of texts teaching mantras

how to repeat this mantra
100,000 times whilst offering

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:51.320 align:middle line:84%

your neighbor's goat will

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.183 align:middle line:90%
fall over.

00:17:52.183 --> 00:17:54.320 align:middle line:84%
Or something like
that, you know?

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:90%
Sometimes it's as basic as that.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.940 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of
mumbo-jumbo black magic.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:01.810 align:middle line:84%

the development of lower siddhis

00:18:36.310 --> 00:18:40.240 align:middle line:84%
or psychic powers is largely
a waste of precious time

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.890 align:middle line:84%
and effort, the allure of the
siddhis has led to many means

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.720 align:middle line:90%
of trickery.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.383 align:middle line:84%
>> The idea of the siddhis--
and they're powerful things--

00:18:49.383 --> 00:18:50.800 align:middle line:84%
show there's a
very long tradition

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.550 align:middle line:84%
in every culture of people who
fake these things because they

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.600 align:middle line:90%
know it will delight people.

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And there's also a
whole thread of people

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:02.920 align:middle line:84%
who fake these
kinds of powers, who

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.840 align:middle line:84%
make it a very
blurry distinction

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.220 align:middle line:84%
as to whether they're
real or not real.

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.937 align:middle line:84%
So if you go to a magician
who does illusions onstage,

00:19:09.937 --> 00:19:11.020 align:middle line:90%
you know that that's fake.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.520 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter
how good it looks.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.345 align:middle line:90%
You know it's fake.

00:19:13.345 --> 00:19:15.950 align:middle line:84%
But if you see somebody
on the street doing it,

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:84%
and they don't look
like a magician,

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.615 align:middle line:84%
and they don't sound
like it, and everything,

00:19:19.615 --> 00:19:21.100 align:middle line:90%
it's very hard to tell.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:24.040 align:middle line:84%
However, in the "Yoga Sutras"
and in other traditions,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.470 align:middle line:84%
there is a very
strict prohibition

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:28.710 align:middle line:84%
about demonstrating the
powers that you gain.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.220 align:middle line:84%
So if you gain real
powers of these types,

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.600 align:middle line:84%
whether it's simple
telepathy or levitation,

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
there it specifically said
in one of the "Sutras,"

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.010 align:middle line:90%
do not demonstrate this--

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:40.250 align:middle line:90%
and for good reason.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.910 align:middle line:84%
The reason is that
power is seductive.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.980 align:middle line:84%
And the yogis knew
this long ago.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.650 align:middle line:84%
You gain a certain power,
and you're excited about it.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:49.400 align:middle line:84%
You want to demonstrate
it to people.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.680 align:middle line:84%
So there's two reasons
not to do that.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.888 align:middle line:84%
First of all, other people
will begin to worship you,

00:19:52.888 --> 00:19:54.910 align:middle line:84%
and your ego will
become inflamed,

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:56.800 align:middle line:90%
and then you become Darth Vader.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.750 align:middle line:84%
And the other is
that it deflects

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:02.050 align:middle line:84%
from the original purpose of
yoga, which is not the powers.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:03.790 align:middle line:90%
It was enlightenment.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:05.730 align:middle line:84%
So the very people,
as a scientist,

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:08.540 align:middle line:84%
who I want to study
in the laboratory,

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.490 align:middle line:90%
they follow the prohibitions.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:12.730 align:middle line:84%
So only on a few
occasions have I

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:15.940 align:middle line:84%
worked with people who have
long traditions in the siddhis,

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.150 align:middle line:84%
and can probably do them,
who worked with experiments

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.510 align:middle line:84%
under controlled conditions
and did extremely well.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.900 align:middle line:84%
So in one case, I saw a
really, really good result

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:25.700 align:middle line:90%
in the laboratory.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And I knew this guy came
from a Himalayan tradition

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:middle line:84%
where they study
the siddhis, and he

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.213 align:middle line:90%
had been doing it for 70 years.

00:20:32.213 --> 00:20:34.630 align:middle line:84%
This was an experiment looking
at this quantum measurement

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:36.700 align:middle line:84%
problem with the
movement of light.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:39.610 align:middle line:84%
So he was able to change
the behavior of light, which

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.040 align:middle line:84%
was in a shielded room next
door, simply by sitting

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.150 align:middle line:90%
there and meditating.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:46.270 align:middle line:84%
So I asked him, how
did you do that?

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:49.150 align:middle line:84%
How did you make this
system change at a distance?

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.630 align:middle line:84%
And all he would do was
smile because you're not

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.790 align:middle line:84%
supposed to demonstrate
it, which he kind of did

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.150 align:middle line:90%
in a controlled environment.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.520 align:middle line:84%
But he certainly wasn't going
to tell me how he did it.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.320 align:middle line:90%
So I don't know.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.340 align:middle line:90%


00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.150 align:middle line:84%
>> One of the puzzling pieces
of yoga is that if you do yoga,

00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:11.450 align:middle line:84%
it's guaranteed you're going
to look a little bit better.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:16.210 align:middle line:84%
You're also going to gain
a degree of mastery that

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.770 align:middle line:90%
will surprise others.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:23.170 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it cannot be denied
that change comes with yoga.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Yoga leads to this
wonderful place of samadhi.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.090 align:middle line:84%

becomes, what does

one do, having had this
wonderful moment, what William

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.580 align:middle line:84%
James called that moment of
the conversion of the heart,

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.230 align:middle line:90%
what do you do?

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.700 align:middle line:90%
You're given many choices.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:48.970 align:middle line:84%
And as you re-enter the world,
you can construct that world.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:53.590 align:middle line:84%
You can sort of spin
that world in a way that

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:57.640 align:middle line:84%
can be for the greater good,
or you could spin that world

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.780 align:middle line:90%
to your own advantage.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.390 align:middle line:84%
And the yogi says, you know,
I can cross that river just

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.810 align:middle line:84%

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And the yogi says,
well, that's very nice.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.360 align:middle line:84%
But I can get across
the river by paying

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.910 align:middle line:84%

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.830 align:middle line:84%
What was cutting-edge
is no more.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.615 align:middle line:10%
So at every evolutionary
stage, the elder beings who

00:23:29.615 --> 00:23:32.530 align:middle line:10%
will start having
these experiences,

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:33.893 align:middle line:10%
they have to find each other.

00:23:33.893 --> 00:23:35.560 align:middle line:84%
And now as you start
finding each other,

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.150 align:middle line:90%
you start having conversations.

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.760 align:middle line:84%
That's how we shape
the new world.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.350 align:middle line:84%
>> It's not about how
many books you read.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:45.290 align:middle line:84%
You can read all the
books in the world,

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.410 align:middle line:84%
have all the information
in the world,

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:52.100 align:middle line:84%
and not know anything because
you only can know something

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:55.100 align:middle line:90%
when you've experienced it.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.600 align:middle line:84%
>> They call it
practice for a reason.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.590 align:middle line:90%
You've got to do it.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:03.200 align:middle line:84%
You've got to find a way
to uncover what's in there.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And this is not something
we get from someone else.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.920 align:middle line:84%
Someone can turn the lights on
and show you what's in there.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.510 align:middle line:84%
But then the lights
go off again,

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.440 align:middle line:84%
and you have to find
your way back in.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.860 align:middle line:84%
>> If you practice it and you
do it consistently on a daily

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.560 align:middle line:84%
basis, you will have an
experience that will open up

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.900 align:middle line:84%
your awareness and
knowledge that's all yours.

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:26.070 align:middle line:90%


00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:31.040 align:middle line:84%
>> My first realization,
I saw two birds flying.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And I never saw birds flying
the way I saw on that day.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.500 align:middle line:90%
That was my realization.

00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.762 align:middle line:90%
Then it became my life.

all of our sadhana,

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.930 align:middle line:10%
of all of our
spiritual practice,

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:58.640 align:middle line:10%
of all of our meditation,
yoga, whatever we're doing,

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:04.030 align:middle line:10%
it's all about actually
connecting with our soul

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.710 align:middle line:10%
so that we're
connecting soul to soul.

>> The last mantra of the
Rigveda is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:15.842 --> 00:25:18.120 align:middle line:90%
Let us speak alike.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.432 align:middle line:90%
Let us think alike.

00:25:20.432 --> 00:25:21.860 align:middle line:90%
Let us walk together.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:25.730 align:middle line:90%


00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.130 align:middle line:84%
>> I believe that all the
systems of yoga on this planet

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:33.180 align:middle line:84%
are very helpful now and that
we're needing that to help

00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.390 align:middle line:84%
shift the frequency of
our thinking and feeling

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.980 align:middle line:90%
as the human species.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:44.300 align:middle line:84%
So now's a good time for us
to find a discipline that

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.060 align:middle line:84%
makes sense, to bring
a level of devotion

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:53.150 align:middle line:84%
to it so that we can usher
in this age of peace and joy

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:54.398 align:middle line:90%
and light.

00:25:54.398 --> 00:25:56.190 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter what
kind of yoga you do.

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.930 align:middle line:90%
Just do yoga.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:00.985 align:middle line:84%
Just do yoga because
that's what's

00:26:00.985 --> 00:26:02.110 align:middle line:90%
going to bring us together.
