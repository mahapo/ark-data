terms.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.240 align:middle line:84%
But when it comes
to Tantric yoga,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.630 align:middle line:84%
it's involving all
parts of and awareness

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.520 align:middle line:84%
of all the different layers
and facets of our being.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.100 align:middle line:84%
It dissolves the
false boundaries

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.710 align:middle line:90%
between spiritual and worldly.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.690 align:middle line:84%
And spiritual practice
and worldly life

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.920 align:middle line:90%
get intimately intertwined.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.830 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a coincidence
that the word "Tantra" also

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.100 align:middle line:84%
means a loom, for interweaving
different kinds of cloth.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.850 align:middle line:84%
>> According to Tantra, all that
is found in the cosmos can be

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.440 align:middle line:90%
found within each individual.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.340 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the same principles
that apply to the universe,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.320 align:middle line:90%
apply to the individual being.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.650 align:middle line:84%
By weaving various rituals
and inner practices,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.530 align:middle line:84%
Tantra seeks to
balance, not renounce,

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.001 align:middle line:84%
human instincts in order
to reach enlightenment.

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:27.650 align:middle line:90%


00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.370 align:middle line:84%
>> There's a view that I
am Brahman, I am the vine,

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.960 align:middle line:90%
I am God--

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.300 align:middle line:84%
philosophical God, not the
controller of everything.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.840 align:middle line:84%
Tantra holds that God has become
everything, not that I am God.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.530 align:middle line:84%
So all we have to do
is think of the divine,

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.930 align:middle line:90%
but it's not that easy.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The goal of
Tantra is twofold--

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.290 align:middle line:84%
simultaneously awakening to
the true nature of reality

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.040 align:middle line:84%
as a whole and also
becoming radically free

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.460 align:middle line:84%
of all forms of
mind-created suffering.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Becoming radically
free of the experience

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.160 align:middle line:90%
of bondage and limitation.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.030 align:middle line:90%


00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.810 align:middle line:10%
>> It is, perhaps, this idea of
being radically free that has

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.010 align:middle line:10%
mistakenly identified
Tantra as the yoga of sex.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.730 align:middle line:84%
>> A lot of times, these days,
people think that Tantra just

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.820 align:middle line:84%
has to do with sex and
actually, that's not the case.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.740 align:middle line:90%
That Tantra is a science.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.500 align:middle line:84%
It's actually-- we could even
say it's a religion itself.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.370 align:middle line:10%
And it's very difficult
to even trace fully or say

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.170 align:middle line:10%
how far back its roots go.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.960 align:middle line:90%
>> It's a very subtle science.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.330 align:middle line:84%
And the West-- the
West plays around

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.120 align:middle line:84%
with these concepts in
primarily, in an occult way.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.650 align:middle line:10%
Starting with Pierre Bernard
in 1900 in San Francisco,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.380 align:middle line:10%
and Aleister Crowley in
England, and a few other folks,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.484 align:middle line:10%
but those are two
of the main ones.

00:03:56.484 --> 00:03:58.150 align:middle line:84%
They were teaching
something they called

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.700 align:middle line:90%
"Sex Magick" or Tantric sex.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.550 align:middle line:10%
And there was no real connection
to the original tradition,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.000 align:middle line:10%
except for the fact that the
sexual practices that they came

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.050 align:middle line:10%
up with were sometimes
overlaid with relatively

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.180 align:middle line:10%
vague pronouncements from the
Indian spiritual tradition.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.089 align:middle line:10%
Literally, hundreds
of millions of people

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:22.870 align:middle line:10%
have heard Sting use the
word Tantra in association

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:10%
with things like prolonged
orgasms and increased

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.320 align:middle line:10%
intimacy with one's life
partner or sexual partner.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.500 align:middle line:84%
And so that, of
course, is emblazoned

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.170 align:middle line:90%
on everyone's imagination.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.260 align:middle line:90%


00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.740 align:middle line:84%
The original Tantric tradition
has no sexual techniques

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.120 align:middle line:90%
at all.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.890 align:middle line:10%
The most important
thing for people

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.610 align:middle line:10%
to get to make sense of this
incredibly complex yoga Tantra

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.060 align:middle line:10%
traditions-- they're
lineage-based.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.570 align:middle line:10%
And you can not make
sense of them as a whole

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.390 align:middle line:10%
because that's not
how they ever worked.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.790 align:middle line:10%
It's about the energy
coming through the lineage.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.080 align:middle line:84%
>> The passing of Yogic
knowledge from teacher

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.190 align:middle line:84%
to student, from generation
to generation over thousands

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.710 align:middle line:84%
of years is a sacred
undertaking for all Yogic paths.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.270 align:middle line:84%
And it is within these
lineages that the diversity

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.660 align:middle line:84%
of practicing Tantra
really shows up.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.530 align:middle line:84%
>> There are many different
streams within Tantra

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.330 align:middle line:84%
and that's where we get
these different lineages.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.890 align:middle line:84%
It is more complex than
just what it's been made out

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.500 align:middle line:84%
or what it's been
presented to be.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And I think it's very
important that we

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.180 align:middle line:84%
know the different
lineages or at least,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.570 align:middle line:84%
are familiar because each has
something different to offer.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.420 align:middle line:84%
>> The one distinction all
Tantra practices share,

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.230 align:middle line:84%
however, is the very intentional
break from yoga's ascetic

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.160 align:middle line:90%
traditions.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.710 align:middle line:84%
>> The most prominent
distinguishing feature

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.760 align:middle line:84%
of Tantra is that it was
designed for householders.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of people don't realize
that Patanjali's "Yoga-Sutra"

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.250 align:middle line:84%
was written for and intended for
Brahmin men who had renounced

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.020 align:middle line:84%
worldly life and were doing
full-time ascetic Yogic

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.203 align:middle line:90%
practice.

00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.518 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:12.518 --> 00:06:13.450 align:middle line:90%


00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.930 align:middle line:84%
So along comes Tantra,
about 1,500 years ago.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.400 align:middle line:84%
And that is a movement
of inclusivity

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.840 align:middle line:84%
that radically challenged
some of the basic assumptions

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.440 align:middle line:84%
because people up to that point
assumed that yoga could only

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.900 align:middle line:84%
be done by a
renuncient-- someone who

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.940 align:middle line:84%
had renounced family,
job, money, and sex.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.340 align:middle line:84%
And Tantra is for people who
hadn't renounced those things.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.910 align:middle line:84%
In fact, Tantric
yoga is the only form

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.970 align:middle line:84%
of yoga specifically
designed for people who

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.290 align:middle line:90%
hadn't renounced those things.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:47.970 align:middle line:90%
Who were engaged in the world.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.850 align:middle line:84%
And who had families,
and jobs, and so on.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.325 align:middle line:84%
So the teachings and
practices are quite distinct.

00:06:53.325 --> 00:06:59.420 align:middle line:90%


00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.320 align:middle line:84%
So all the Tantric texts,
and all the oral teachings,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.820 align:middle line:84%
the whole tradition really
covers four basic topics.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.020 align:middle line:84%
Wisdom teachings or spiritual
knowledge-- insight.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.920 align:middle line:84%
Lifestyle-- Yogic lifestyle,
daily life observances

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:84%
that are in alignment
with and support

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.240 align:middle line:90%
our spiritual development.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.720 align:middle line:84%
Yoga, which consists of
meditation, energy body

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.400 align:middle line:90%
practice, awareness cultivation.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.830 align:middle line:84%
So in Tantra, most
yoga is inner yoga.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.270 align:middle line:90%
And then the fourth is ritual.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.210 align:middle line:90%


00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.000 align:middle line:84%
>> Modern Tantra can be
distilled into two main

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.650 align:middle line:90%
approaches.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.460 align:middle line:84%
>> Some may be more of a fierce
or a left-handed path using

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.370 align:middle line:84%
what is so-called
taboo in our culture,

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:50.460 align:middle line:84%
even using sexual practices
or other substances.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:52.290 align:middle line:84%
Others would be
more right-handed,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.130 align:middle line:84%
having to do more
with visualization,

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.560 align:middle line:84%
and more interior
experiences, or bridging

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.030 align:middle line:90%
the external and internal.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.910 align:middle line:10%
>> The left-handed path involves
extreme spiritual practices

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.350 align:middle line:10%
that deliberately run counter
to conventional social behavior.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.960 align:middle line:84%
Though these tend to be
practiced by smaller fringe

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:16.524 align:middle line:84%
groups, their wild ways add
to the mystique of Tantra.

00:08:16.524 --> 00:08:18.440 align:middle line:84%
>> There are definitely
left-handed paths like

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.520 align:middle line:90%
the Aghori path.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.670 align:middle line:10%
Or also, an earlier string--
the Kapalikas-- that

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:27.590 align:middle line:10%
are doing practices in
the cremation grounds.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.750 align:middle line:10%
And they appear to
be very grotesque,

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:31.970 align:middle line:10%
but it's really
this understanding

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.440 align:middle line:10%
that the divine is everything.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.929 align:middle line:84%
The divine is
ultimately, impartial.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:38.990 align:middle line:84%
And while there are
practitioners that literally

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.820 align:middle line:84%
go to a cremation
ground and maybe are

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.630 align:middle line:84%
working with corpses or with
the spirits of that place

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.450 align:middle line:84%
to overcome certain
fears, it's also

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.400 align:middle line:84%
an opportunity to look
at our attachments

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.615 align:middle line:90%
to this material reality.

00:08:50.615 --> 00:08:58.510 align:middle line:90%


00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.900 align:middle line:84%
>> Part of what Aghori is
really about is this intimate

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.870 align:middle line:84%
engagement with mortality and
with the whole cycle of life,

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.850 align:middle line:84%
such as taking your food and
drink out of a human skull.

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:12.250 align:middle line:84%
And traditionally included,
wearing bone ornaments--

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.280 align:middle line:84%
human bone ornaments-- some
of which were also sexual.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.770 align:middle line:84%
A lot of which,
though, were mortuary--

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:22.380 align:middle line:84%
meaning encountering death in
the most visceral way, really.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.830 align:middle line:90%


00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.050 align:middle line:10%
Simply encountering
death in a visceral way

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:29.580 align:middle line:10%
is spiritually powerful.

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.200 align:middle line:90%
Because in our culture--

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.560 align:middle line:84%
as many other Western
European cultures-- death

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.250 align:middle line:84%
is hidden, sanitized as
much as humanly possible.

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:84%
There's no visceral
encounter with it at all.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.850 align:middle line:84%
And I think that's a huge
problem, actually, spiritually

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.360 align:middle line:84%
because if you don't have a
visceral encounter with death,

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.990 align:middle line:84%
you don't seriously believe
it's going to happen to you.

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:55.680 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.970 align:middle line:84%
Right-handed Tantra is much,
much closer to non-Tantric

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:03.990 align:middle line:84%
forms of yoga like what we see
in Patanjali's "Yoga-Sutra."

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.060 align:middle line:84%
Right-handed Tantra
is much more oriented

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.870 align:middle line:84%
towards transcendentalistic
experiences.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:15.420 align:middle line:84%
And it's much less embracing
of the full range of energy.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.410 align:middle line:84%
The other distinguishing
feature of it as a tradition

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.890 align:middle line:84%
is its veneration
of the feminine.

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.790 align:middle line:84%
So the role of the
divine feminine

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.420 align:middle line:84%
is absolutely central in Tantra
and not in other forms of yoga.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:34.415 align:middle line:90%


00:10:34.415 --> 00:10:36.890 align:middle line:84%
>> Most Tantric practice
focuses on Shakti--

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:37.760 align:middle line:90%
the feminine.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.250 align:middle line:10%
And we call that Shaktis
or Shaktism that give

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:44.240 align:middle line:10%
precedence to the
feminine power aspect.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.580 align:middle line:84%
In Tantra, we have a term
called [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.060 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] is that unitive of
experience of Shiva and Shakti

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.050 align:middle line:90%
uniting.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.000 align:middle line:10%
This Tantric
worldview of the one

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.400 align:middle line:10%
becoming many through
the power of Shakti

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.850 align:middle line:10%
through the divine mother
manifesting as everything.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.520 align:middle line:84%
And so if that's true of
the universal manifestation,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.030 align:middle line:84%
it's also true of our little
individual manifestation.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.775 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.775 --> 00:11:11.280 align:middle line:84%
>> In Tantra, there's a
word called [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.760 align:middle line:84%
[NON-ENGLISH] meaning the
manifested cosmic womb.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Before anything comes
into manifestation,

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.110 align:middle line:84%
it exists in an
unmanifested state.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.830 align:middle line:84%
The manifest reality is
primarily, first feminine.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:27.040 align:middle line:84%
From that is more both
masculine and feminine.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.550 align:middle line:84%
We never say Father Nature,
it's always Mother Nature.

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:31.860 align:middle line:84%
It's mother country,
its mother tongue.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:35.165 align:middle line:90%
It has a feminine quality to it.

00:11:35.165 --> 00:11:38.730 align:middle line:84%
>> A yogini is a practitioner,
and an attendant,

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.700 align:middle line:90%
and devotee of goddess herself.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.550 align:middle line:84%
The practices that
she engages in

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.200 align:middle line:84%
are really about
marrying or understanding

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.350 align:middle line:84%
the relationship between the
absolute and the relative,

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.890 align:middle line:84%
which translates to our
everyday experiences.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.800 align:middle line:84%
So she does different practices
using Tantric techniques,

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.870 align:middle line:84%
mantras so chanting, yantra,
different visualizations,

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:04.440 align:middle line:90%
or meditation techniques.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.915 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:06.915 --> 00:12:09.890 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.580 align:middle line:84%
The yogini's
themselves really came

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.500 align:middle line:84%
about between the
8th, 9th centuries

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.314 align:middle line:84%
and the 16th centuries
of the Common Era.

00:12:17.314 --> 00:12:19.980 align:middle line:84%
>> In the beginning times, there
were a lot of temples dedicated

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.840 align:middle line:84%
to the divine feminine because
a lot of practices were based

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle line:90%
around that.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle line:84%
>> Yogini temples are
circular, open to the sky,

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.640 align:middle line:84%
and sacred to several
forms of the goddess.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.100 align:middle line:84%
>> There aren't
many yogini temples.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.570 align:middle line:10%
The period that
they were built--

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:38.430 align:middle line:10%
between the 8th and
the 16th century--

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.210 align:middle line:10%
maybe have 10 to 14 temples
that were only discovered

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:10%
as recently as the 1950s.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.390 align:middle line:84%
And each of the temples
is open to the sky

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.690 align:middle line:84%
so that also warrants is a
question of, well, what's

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:51.490 align:middle line:90%
happening?

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.680 align:middle line:90%
Why are they open?

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.240 align:middle line:90%
What are they practicing?

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.190 align:middle line:90%
Are they taking flight at night?

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.560 align:middle line:84%
Is it through the use,
maybe, of altered substances?

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.740 align:middle line:90%
Is it their ritual practice?

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.380 align:middle line:84%
Is it related even to this
expansion of consciousness?

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:07.800 align:middle line:84%
It's really about cultivating,
deepening our relationship

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.020 align:middle line:84%
with the divine in
many, many forms.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:15.713 align:middle line:90%

>> Another Tantric practice
utilizing divine feminine

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:36.590 align:middle line:90%
energy is Kundalini rising.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:40.250 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini is a Sanskrit word
used for thousands of years

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.100 align:middle line:84%
to describe life
force energy or prana.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.930 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:49.020 align:middle line:84%
>> In Tantra and yoga, we
sometime have the idea that we

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:52.260 align:middle line:84%
have a power at the base of
the spine called Kundalini.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:54.433 align:middle line:84%
That is actually the
divine mother's form.

00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:57.670 align:middle line:84%
Kula Kundalini is
Shakti, it's Kali's form.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:01.740 align:middle line:84%
The mantra says [NON-ENGLISH],,
that she exists in the fire pit

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.290 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness at
the base of the spine.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And so the whole
process of Tantric yoga

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.470 align:middle line:84%
is to awaken Kundalini and bring
it back to union with her lord.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:13.230 align:middle line:90%


00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:18.090 align:middle line:84%
>> The path of Kundalini Rising
brings one's self up into these

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.990 align:middle line:84%
wonderful encounters in the
Yoga Sutra, it says, you ascend,

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:25.380 align:middle line:84%
and you make connection with
these saints that have gone

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.580 align:middle line:84%
before, and then the
breath continues.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.740 align:middle line:84%
And there must be the return
to the place of encounter.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.080 align:middle line:84%
The return to the
place of heart.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.980 align:middle line:90%


00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.570 align:middle line:10%
>> The purpose of ritual in
Tantra is for you to attune

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.630 align:middle line:10%
yourself to those archetype
aspects of nature,

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.460 align:middle line:10%
because they are ultimately
a reflection of you.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.610 align:middle line:84%
When you start using the
mantras, specific chants,

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:84%
specific taranas,
what you are doing

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.470 align:middle line:84%
is you are opening yourself,
your consciousness,

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:00.940 align:middle line:84%
and you're making it receptive
to that aspect of nature.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.300 align:middle line:84%
>> So Tantra is a highly
ritualized tradition,

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.340 align:middle line:84%
but it approaches ritual in a
very different way from most

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.670 align:middle line:90%
religions.

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:15.070 align:middle line:84%
So in non-dual Tantra, when
you are performing a ritual,

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:84%
you're not trying to win the
favor of some external deity.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.890 align:middle line:84%
And it's not like you're
trying to accomplish

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.510 align:middle line:90%
some magical goal.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Rather, you're cultivating
awareness in action.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And this practice
culminates in the experience

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:35.080 align:middle line:84%
that ritual is nothing other
than God worshipping God on God

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:39.760 align:middle line:84%
by means of God for
the sake of God alone.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.300 align:middle line:84%
>> Some focus on fire, some
focus on its power to burn.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:44.990 align:middle line:84%
The goddess worshippers
or the chakras

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.711 align:middle line:84%
would focus on its
energetic manifestation.

00:15:47.711 --> 00:15:49.210 align:middle line:84%
In the ritual that
they're doing are

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:51.736 align:middle line:84%
based upon Tantric
forms of worship,

00:15:51.736 --> 00:15:53.110 align:middle line:84%
and they're using
mantra, they're

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:56.760 align:middle line:84%
using mudras, hand gestures,
and physical offerings--

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.165 align:middle line:90%
worshipping images and yantras.

00:15:58.165 --> 00:16:01.900 align:middle line:90%


00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.930 align:middle line:84%
>> A yantra is a geometrical
pattern made of several

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:09.940 align:middle line:84%
concentric figures, squares,
circles, lotuses, triangles,

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.170 align:middle line:90%
and points.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:14.910 align:middle line:84%
It is the Yogic equivalent
of the Buddhist mandala.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
>> The Tantric yantras are
essentially meditation devices,

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.040 align:middle line:90%
and you see them on the petals--

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.140 align:middle line:84%
seven or eight petals
of the lotus flower--

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.727 align:middle line:84%
and they each represent a
different afflicted emotion.

00:16:26.727 --> 00:16:28.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Often they'll have a yantra--

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.690 align:middle line:84%
a geometric form that's
supposed to embody the deity--

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:35.710 align:middle line:84%
and it has a mantra, a word,
or a name, or a series of names

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.150 align:middle line:84%
and sounds, that
have that same power.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.900 align:middle line:84%
And so by meditating on
the image or the yantra

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.620 align:middle line:90%
while repeating the mantra--

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.290 align:middle line:84%
that contact connection--
that's the primary practice.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.100 align:middle line:84%
Generally speaking,
the mantras are--

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.320 align:middle line:84%
can't say they're secret--
but they're private.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.580 align:middle line:84%
They are something that's
whispered from mouth to ear,

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.830 align:middle line:84%
passed down from guru
to disciple and teacher

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.650 align:middle line:84%
to student through
oral transmissions

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.104 align:middle line:84%
or oral tradition,
through lineage.

00:17:02.104 --> 00:17:04.270 align:middle line:84%
There are mantra that are
kind of universally known,

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.099 align:middle line:84%
like [NON ENGLISH SPEECH]
or the Hare Krishna mantra.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:10.510 align:middle line:84%
Then some mantras will
be based upon a name,

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.140 align:middle line:90%
like Shiva or Krishna.

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.900 align:middle line:84%
So mantras will have more
esoteric sounds that have more

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.700 align:middle line:90%
affect than they have meaning.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.750 align:middle line:84%
>> When tantra and
mantra combine together,

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.690 align:middle line:90%
you become yantra.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.700 align:middle line:90%
Yantra means the machine.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.985 align:middle line:84%
You have the tool to
go past into your past

00:17:27.985 --> 00:17:29.770 align:middle line:90%
or into your future.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.940 align:middle line:84%
The perfection of this
process is known patandra.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.400 align:middle line:84%
Once you have gone
beyond the perfection

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.130 align:middle line:84%
and you become the
master of this process,

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:43.250 align:middle line:84%
you are known as sutundra
which means freedom.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:49.880 align:middle line:90%


00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.510 align:middle line:84%
>> Tantric rituals always
include one of the Earth's five

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:55.280 align:middle line:90%
basic elements.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The rituals were designed
to balance the elements.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.870 align:middle line:84%
Use all the elements,
balance the elements--

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:04.970 align:middle line:90%
sound, light, water, fire--

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.760 align:middle line:84%
all the elements are used
with specific intention.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:12.860 align:middle line:90%


00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.560 align:middle line:84%
Especially with the fire, fire
is one of the most hypnotic

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.520 align:middle line:90%
of the elements.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.145 align:middle line:84%
And you're using the
mantras, so you're

00:18:18.145 --> 00:18:19.730 align:middle line:84%
creating a deep
hypnosis, and then

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.660 align:middle line:84%
you're introducing
your intention.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.690 align:middle line:84%
Then your intention
has more of a chance

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.570 align:middle line:90%
to get into your subconscious.

00:18:26.570 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Sometimes tantra is described
as a path of fire and water.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.930 align:middle line:84%
Exploring fire, whether
it's literal fire,

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.720 align:middle line:84%
that tremendous heat, the
tremendous transformation,

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:39.170 align:middle line:84%
the challenges that these
practices can bring,

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:40.910 align:middle line:84%
or the path of
water because we're

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:42.770 align:middle line:90%
working with the emotions.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.520 align:middle line:84%
But also, this understanding
that we have this physical form

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:48.170 align:middle line:84%
and then we also have
the energetic body.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:56.170 align:middle line:90%


00:18:56.170 --> 00:19:00.400 align:middle line:84%
>> Puja is a simple way of
expressing devotion and service

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.520 align:middle line:90%
to a very respected guest.

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.035 align:middle line:84%
Almost every temple you go to
the Pujas that they're doing,

00:19:06.035 --> 00:19:07.660 align:middle line:84%
the ritual that you're
doing, are based

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.510 align:middle line:90%
upon Tantric forms of worship.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.460 align:middle line:84%
They say in idea that
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.140 align:middle line:90%
a guest is God.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.470 align:middle line:90%
Even a common guest is god.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.072 align:middle line:84%
The elaborate Pujas
can take hours,

00:19:20.072 --> 00:19:21.280 align:middle line:90%
and they're very complicated.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.550 align:middle line:84%
Usually require years
of training to do.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.400 align:middle line:84%
Certain monks and
priests and juries

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
are expert and trained
in these rituals.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.160 align:middle line:84%
And as a result, most
common people won't learn.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not easy.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:39.730 align:middle line:84%
So they'll often hire a priest
to do the ritual in their name.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:41.560 align:middle line:84%
And the most simple
form that's universally

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.550 align:middle line:84%
practiced in every temple
and in most homes is Aarti.

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.050 align:middle line:84%
And Aarti means the
waving of lights.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.640 align:middle line:84%
And when the image-- when the
light is waved at the feet,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.660 align:middle line:90%
you'd see the feet.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:54.701 align:middle line:84%
When it's waved at the
head, you'd feed the head.

00:19:54.701 --> 00:19:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So you'd actually show
the deity with the light.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So the lights are the
primary thing that's offered,

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:05.320 align:middle line:84%
but then usually we're offering
those five elements that make

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.950 align:middle line:90%
up creation back to its source.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.030 align:middle line:84%
In ritual way-- by ringing a
bell, we're offering the light,

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.080 align:middle line:90%
we're offering light means fire.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.700 align:middle line:90%


00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.360 align:middle line:84%
The conch full of
water is water.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.180 align:middle line:90%


00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.784 align:middle line:84%
Cloth represents space
that covers everything.

00:20:27.784 --> 00:20:31.580 align:middle line:90%


00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.920 align:middle line:84%
The flower represents earth--
fragrance of the Earth.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.040 align:middle line:90%


00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:43.300 align:middle line:90%
And the fan represents air.

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.220 align:middle line:84%
So these five items are
offered with the idea

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:48.500 align:middle line:84%
that the foundations
of the entire universe

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:50.430 align:middle line:84%
are being offered
back to their source.

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:54.110 align:middle line:84%
So in a simple ritual
devotional form,

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.410 align:middle line:84%
it's also representing
the ultimate goal

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.530 align:middle line:84%
of Kundalini raising or
that supreme experience

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:90%
of universal awareness.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.985 align:middle line:84%
It's the goal ritualized
as a daily practice.

00:21:05.985 --> 00:21:12.030 align:middle line:90%


00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:16.680 align:middle line:84%
>> All of this nourishes
all the senses while engaged

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.110 align:middle line:84%
in movements--
ritual movements--

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:22.800 align:middle line:84%
which are memorized so you're
not having to think about what

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.790 align:middle line:90%
to do next.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:26.910 align:middle line:84%
Rather, you can immerse
in awareness of the whole

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:30.000 align:middle line:84%
as you're engaging in
these ritual actions.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.860 align:middle line:84%
Ritual achieves its
culmination when

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.410 align:middle line:84%
that's your experience,
not the thought,

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.330 align:middle line:90%
but the direct experience.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.135 align:middle line:84%
So ritual is a kind
of celebration.

00:21:39.135 --> 00:21:45.096 align:middle line:84%
It is the one celebrating
itself in all the modes

00:21:45.096 --> 00:21:46.095 align:middle line:90%
of the different senses.

00:21:46.095 --> 00:21:50.320 align:middle line:90%


00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.960 align:middle line:84%
>> While the Tantric tradition
offers many different

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.050 align:middle line:84%
and diverse practices depending
on an individual's need

00:21:56.050 --> 00:22:00.400 align:middle line:84%
and life, it is by design that
its deepest meaning remains

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.230 align:middle line:90%
hidden.

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:05.950 align:middle line:84%
>> There's actually a very good
and specific reason that people

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.700 align:middle line:84%
have a hard time really
getting what Tantra is,

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.420 align:middle line:84%
and that's because it's
an initiate tradition,

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.870 align:middle line:84%
meaning to say, you're not
supposed to get what it is

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.170 align:middle line:84%
until you're actually being
initiated into the practice

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:21.470 align:middle line:90%
of it.

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.890 align:middle line:84%
So in the West, we've
developed a culture

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.120 align:middle line:90%
of know In order to do.

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:84%
Tell me all about this
thing, and then I'll

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.390 align:middle line:90%
know whether I want to do it.

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:32.170 align:middle line:84%
But that is not the
culture of pre-modern India

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:84%
or Asia, which was
more of a, do in order

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.980 align:middle line:84%
to know culture where
you explore something

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.500 align:middle line:84%
experientially,
and that gives rise

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:45.700 align:middle line:84%
to insights and knowledge and
understanding-- experiential

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.570 align:middle line:90%
understanding.

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.960 align:middle line:10%
So a lot of traditional
Tantra teachers

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.350 align:middle line:10%
maintain that sort of
shroud of secrecy--

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:55.030 align:middle line:10%
that you're not
going to know what

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.510 align:middle line:10%
this is, and you can't know
what it is unless you actually

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:01.690 align:middle line:10%
want to do it, unless you
actually want to give it a try.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.000 align:middle line:84%
And then, you're going
to start to experience

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.570 align:middle line:84%
what it is in a way that
your mind can't categorize

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.710 align:middle line:90%
or conceptualize.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:12.990 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:18.040 align:middle line:84%
>> So temples, images,
yantras, mantras, kirtan--

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.160 align:middle line:84%
all these things are designed
to help us think, remember

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.300 align:middle line:90%
God, who is the only reality.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.390 align:middle line:84%
So people visit
temples regularly,

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:27.280 align:middle line:90%
they go on pilgrimages yearly.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.780 align:middle line:84%
And daily, they
have a little shrine

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.390 align:middle line:84%
in a little corner
in their house.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Every day they do
their prayers and they

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.870 align:middle line:84%
offer some flowers, some
sweets, they burn some incense.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:38.219 align:middle line:84%
It's such a simple thing
that maybe it does nothing,

00:23:38.219 --> 00:23:39.760 align:middle line:84%
but it's a huge
thing, because you're

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.320 align:middle line:90%
remembering the infinite.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.870 align:middle line:84%
By making God the
center of your house,

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.050 align:middle line:84%
you can make God the
center of your day.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:49.640 align:middle line:84%
Slowly, you can make God
the center of your life.

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.970 align:middle line:90%
And that is ultimately the goal.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:57.050 align:middle line:84%
>> Tantra teaches how to engage
with all the aspects of worldly

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:57.930 align:middle line:90%
life--

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.020 align:middle line:84%
so your sexuality,
the way you relate

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:03.440 align:middle line:84%
to food, your relationships,
and everything

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:07.350 align:middle line:84%
else-- it's all part of
the spiritual practice.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.620 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why Tantra is
ultimately dropping all

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:12.900 align:middle line:84%
projections and experiencing
the meaning of life,

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.930 align:middle line:84%
which cannot be contained
in any ideology.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.180 align:middle line:84%
That's why yoga is
not an ideology.

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.790 align:middle line:84%
For me it's an invitation
to the meaning of life.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:28.110 align:middle line:90%


00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:32.880 align:middle line:84%
>> In our next episode, Raja
yoga aims at learning how

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:36.540 align:middle line:84%
to control our mind so we
can become, essentially,

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:84%
kings of kings or
queens of queens--

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:42.420 align:middle line:84%
masters of our own mind, rather
than victims of our mind.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:46.800 align:middle line:84%
>> That subtle stuff that we
call consciousness or awareness

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.960 align:middle line:84%
or godliness, it's
radically creative.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.120 align:middle line:84%
>> You are much more
receptive, much more relaxed.

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.555 align:middle line:90%
People are too wound up, man.

00:24:56.555 --> 00:24:57.430 align:middle line:90%
They're too stressed.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:58.700 align:middle line:90%
They're too self-important.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.640 align:middle line:90%
My purpose, my purpose.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.720 align:middle line:90%
You have no purpose.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.960 align:middle line:90%
Be quiet for a while.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:14.176 align:middle line:90%
