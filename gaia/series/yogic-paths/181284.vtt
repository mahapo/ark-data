>> What's interesting
to note is that while

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.000 align:middle line:84%
Patanjali's eightfold path is
seen to provide all one needs

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.740 align:middle line:84%
to live an intentional life, it
mentions no poses at all other

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.530 align:middle line:84%
than the seated
meditation posture.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.920 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the Sanskrit
word "asana," as used

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.904 align:middle line:84%
in the Yoga Sutras,
means posture or seat,

00:19:27.904 --> 00:19:29.320 align:middle line:84%
and are intended
as ways you could

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.680 align:middle line:84%
sit for extended amounts of
time with the sole purpose

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.300 align:middle line:90%
of cultivating awareness.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:84%
>> At least 2,000 years ago,
you start seeing the Buddha

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.380 align:middle line:84%
and the Jain saints
in Lotus position,

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:44.590 align:middle line:84%
and other postures that are
suitable and provide a kind

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:47.710 align:middle line:84%
of steady, solid
base for meditation.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:50.740 align:middle line:84%
The way yoga is understood
in those early texts

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.230 align:middle line:84%
is as a way of just
completely stilling the body

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:57.280 align:middle line:84%
and stilling the mind, so
anything that is uncomfortable

00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.960 align:middle line:84%
that couldn't be
held indefinitely

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:04.188 align:middle line:84%
is really not going to
wash in that context.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.820 align:middle line:84%
One of the purest
understandings of asana

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:11.700 align:middle line:90%
is as the throne of the divine.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:14.190 align:middle line:84%
The remembering
through our practices

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:18.590 align:middle line:84%
that we are divinity
in human form.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:23.110 align:middle line:84%
>> Which means that we
as the creation have all

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:26.920 align:middle line:84%
of the qualities, the
fullness, the wholeness,

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:32.510 align:middle line:84%
the completeness, the
divinity of the divine.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:36.070 align:middle line:90%
So that's who we are.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:40.270 align:middle line:84%
>> The Yoga Sutras went in and
out of popularity many times

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:41.770 align:middle line:90%
in the years that followed.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:46.210 align:middle line:84%
Its austere nature appealed
more for aesthetics and holy men

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:90%
than common householders.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:51.670 align:middle line:10%
>> A lot of people don't realize
that Patanjali's Yoga Sutra was

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:57.700 align:middle line:10%
written for and intended for
Brahmin men who had renounced

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.440 align:middle line:10%
worldly life and were doing
full-time ascetic yogic

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.730 align:middle line:10%
practice.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:06.100 align:middle line:84%
And so a lot of the
teachings and practices

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.250 align:middle line:84%
in Patanjali's Yoga Sutra make
sense within that context.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.370 align:middle line:10%
And this is precisely
why modern readers

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:15.362 align:middle line:10%
find that text so inaccessible.

mid 20th century,

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:24.030 align:middle line:84%
a 5 foot 2 inch giant
hit the yoga scene.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.720 align:middle line:10%
Born in a small Indian
village, T. Krishnamacharya

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.930 align:middle line:10%
ascribed therapeutic
value to specific asanas,

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.990 align:middle line:10%
and refined the postures
in a sequential order,

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:36.360 align:middle line:10%
making them an integral
part of meditation

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.080 align:middle line:10%
instead of just a step
leading toward it.

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Krishnamacharya's
yoga instruction

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.250 align:middle line:84%
reflected his beliefs
that yoga could

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.720 align:middle line:84%
be both a spiritual practice
and a mode of physical healing.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.300 align:middle line:90%


00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:54.240 align:middle line:84%
>> He brought yoga for
the general public.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:59.850 align:middle line:84%
Down to earth, he did that so
a common man will adopt yoga.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:01.850 align:middle line:90%
And that is what is needed.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:03.750 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, everybody
has got a picture

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.960 align:middle line:90%
in the mind quite different.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.490 align:middle line:84%
Oh, if you are to
become a yogi, you

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.780 align:middle line:84%
have to be completely
a different person,

00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:15.750 align:middle line:84%
or having different personality,
having different ethnicities.

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.695 align:middle line:84%
But here, Krishnamacharya
introduced it

00:22:17.695 --> 00:22:21.600 align:middle line:90%
to the normal, common people.

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:25.920 align:middle line:84%
>> He repackaged, reformulated
yoga for a global audience that

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.540 align:middle line:84%
perhaps had different needs from
it than what was prior to him.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:84%
He's clearly-- whatever
the influences were,

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.410 align:middle line:84%
he came up with
something very special

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:84%
which has captured people
all around the world

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.170 align:middle line:90%
and continues to do so.

native home of India, today,

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.830 align:middle line:84%
it's difficult to find a yoga

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.430 align:middle line:90%
hasn't influenced.

transcendence in prayer,

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:09.580 align:middle line:84%
meditation, asana postures,
or a combination of all three,

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:11.590 align:middle line:90%
one thing is clear.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.110 align:middle line:84%
All of them play
a significant role

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:middle line:90%

There's no mistakes.

But in order to find out
what really works for you,

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.950 align:middle line:84%
you have to get
out there and just

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.930 align:middle line:90%
do stuff, and see what happens.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:34.730 align:middle line:84%
If it doesn't work,
you try something else.

>> We are holistic beings.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:40.330 align:middle line:84%
We have bodies, and emotions,
and thoughts, and intellects,

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:43.690 align:middle line:84%
and spirit, for lack of a better
term, for the part of ourselves

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.370 align:middle line:90%
that we can't name.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:47.260 align:middle line:84%
All of that needs
to be addressed.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:49.780 align:middle line:84%
All of that, like
so holistic yoga

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.640 align:middle line:84%
is internally
coherent in addressing

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:55.045 align:middle line:84%
all the layers of our
being under whatever name.

00:23:55.045 --> 00:23:58.520 align:middle line:84%
Now the question
is, is my practice,

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:00.100 align:middle line:84%
and is what I'm
learning, does it

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:84%
address all aspects of my being
and allow me to integrate them

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.660 align:middle line:84%
all into my spiritual life,
or is something left out?

or any discipline,

any spiritual discipline, should
take you more and more inward

to understand and appreciate
your own inner extraordinary

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.560 align:middle line:90%
nature.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.820 align:middle line:90%
That's the goal of yoga.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:37.085 align:middle line:84%

it points us toward, not
as an object of study

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.450 align:middle line:90%
for its own sake.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:53.980 align:middle line:84%
Yogic path's aim is to deepen
your understanding of this very

sacred practice with
the ultimate goal

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.320 align:middle line:84%
of raising the consciousness

is that more and more people are

going to take in
yoga and be moved,

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.320 align:middle line:84%
probably through the physical
practice to begin with,

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.200 align:middle line:84%
to really start to explore
our own consciousness

and to recognize that the
consciousness in me is not

00:25:20.484 --> 00:25:22.150 align:middle line:84%
different than the
consciousness in you,

even though our
personalities are different,

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.770 align:middle line:84%

But the knower, the seer,
the lover within us is one.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:38.680 align:middle line:90%
And we need to know that.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.880 align:middle line:84%

Without that grace, you wouldn't
be looking for anything.
