And there's 22 major
shrutis, or tones.

You are one with
the sound garden.

00:19:27.855 --> 00:19:30.240 align:middle line:90%
No more structure.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.660 align:middle line:84%
It has gone beyond
the structure.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.490 align:middle line:84%
The way the universe sings
the sounds, that is laya.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.280 align:middle line:84%
The way we sing the song,
it's called Mantra yoga.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.840 align:middle line:90%

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:05.990 align:middle line:84%
>> These mantras, they
have a precise intonation.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:10.980 align:middle line:84%
These mantras are not
written by a conscious mind.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.840 align:middle line:84%
They are revealed mantras
so that has come down

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.170 align:middle line:90%
to us from them directly.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.960 align:middle line:84%
From generation to
generation it is passed on.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:24.580 align:middle line:90%
It is oral tradition.

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.150 align:middle line:84%
>> In the words of Yogi Bhajan,
somebody asked him, sir,

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:32.290 align:middle line:84%
how do I know that I
have perfected my mantra?

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:36.900 align:middle line:84%
He said, when you hear the
sound from the universe,

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.945 align:middle line:84%
know that you have perfected
the sound, perfected the mantra,

00:20:39.945 --> 00:20:41.980 align:middle line:90%
perfected the laya yoga.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.310 align:middle line:90%
So everything sings that song.

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:48.970 align:middle line:84%
When the planes are flying,
you hear your mantra in it--

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.860 align:middle line:84%
that means you have
perfected the sound.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.440 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.640 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
sound the earth hums.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.570 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
sound the galaxy hums.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:07.500 align:middle line:84%
This is the same
sound the sun hums.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.315 align:middle line:84%
And that's why we call laya
yoga the yoga to dissolve.

00:21:10.315 --> 00:21:16.890 align:middle line:90%


00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.310 align:middle line:84%
>> So there are levels
of mantra source.

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:21.420 align:middle line:90%
So there's not only one type.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:23.640 align:middle line:84%
And they work on
different parts.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:25.350 align:middle line:90%
Some work on the body.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.030 align:middle line:90%
Some work on energy.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.620 align:middle line:90%
Some work on emotions.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:90%
And some work on thinking mind.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:36.320 align:middle line:84%
>> If you chant correctly,
you have direct access to that

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.020 align:middle line:90%
treasure.

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:39.595 align:middle line:90%
And it works beautifully.

00:21:39.595 --> 00:21:45.260 align:middle line:84%
There are prayers in nature,
And prayers have so much power.

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.920 align:middle line:84%
You can achieve anything,
literally anything,

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:51.690 align:middle line:90%
through prayers.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.690 align:middle line:84%
That is not the only
thing, because you

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:58.796 align:middle line:84%
could be a master of
chanting a particular mantra.

00:21:58.796 --> 00:22:01.990 align:middle line:90%
[CHANTING]

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:03.950 align:middle line:84%
But that will not
give you what it

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.370 align:middle line:84%
takes to live life
meaningfully, unless you do it

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.920 align:middle line:90%
with all your feelings--

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:13.430 align:middle line:84%
with conviction,
understanding of the mantra--

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.980 align:middle line:90%
and then put it into practice.

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.220 align:middle line:90%
Then the mantra is useful.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.520 align:middle line:90%


00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:23.190 align:middle line:90%
>> We are losing the reality.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:29.100 align:middle line:84%
We are losing the scientific
way of spirituality.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:33.530 align:middle line:10%
And it is in market nowadays.

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:37.820 align:middle line:84%
And for purity of teaching,
we have to do hard work.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.250 align:middle line:90%
And people have no time.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:43.430 align:middle line:90%
And they have no patience.

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.920 align:middle line:90%
They want, immediately, results.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:49.410 align:middle line:84%
so they are ready to listen
mantra through online,

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:51.540 align:middle line:90%
or through by phone.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.100 align:middle line:84%
But this is not a
traditional way.

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:58.280 align:middle line:84%
Traditional way is
only scientific way.

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.860 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
really enjoy meditation,

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.820 align:middle line:84%
you have to do
practice by yourself.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.360 align:middle line:90%
There is no way.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:12.080 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise you cannot sell it
like vegetables in the market.

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.350 align:middle line:84%
So master said, every
day, morning, evening, you

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.300 align:middle line:90%
relate with the absolute.

00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.100 align:middle line:90%
Take some power from there.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.510 align:middle line:90%
Enjoy there.

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:24.990 align:middle line:84%
And go to bank, take money
from there, and enjoy market.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:29.440 align:middle line:84%
When you have right knowledge,
Vedic knowledge in yourself,

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:33.420 align:middle line:84%
then this material
life is very joyful.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:37.320 align:middle line:90%
God sent us here for enjoy.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.880 align:middle line:84%
Blessings are brought to light,
but only whom those who have

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.450 align:middle line:90%
the right knowledge of life.

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:47.810 align:middle line:90%

>> Coming up on Yogic Paths--

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:03.750 align:middle line:84%
>> Enter Kali, with her wild
eyes and protruding tongue,

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:08.040 align:middle line:84%
said to have emerged from the
third eye of Shiva himself.

>> Myths are ways of putting
the deep truths that come from

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:16.410 align:middle line:84%
these levels of reality into
what I would call pictorial,

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.350 align:middle line:90%
or story, terms.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:24.000 align:middle line:84%

battle around by lapping up

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.250 align:middle line:84%
Raktabija'a blood before
it hits the ground.

goes in and it impacts us really

on a soul level.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And it can change
our consciousness.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:39.270 align:middle line:84%
>> So some of the Kali imagery
can be downright terrifying.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.410 align:middle line:90%
But why?

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:42.090 align:middle line:90%
Why is Kali terrifying?
