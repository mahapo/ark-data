00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.970 align:middle line:84%
>> When the demon King Ravana
abducted Queen Sita and forced

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.830 align:middle line:84%
her to live in his
expansive compound,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.530 align:middle line:84%
Sita was already very much in
love with her husband, Rama.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.040 align:middle line:84%
So when Ravana vowed
to cook and eat her

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.480 align:middle line:84%
if she did not accept
him within a year's time,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.695 align:middle line:84%
Sita moved outside and lived
amongst the healing ashoka

00:00:36.695 --> 00:00:37.495 align:middle line:90%
trees.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:40.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.330 align:middle line:84%
There, the trees spoke to her,
telling her to stay still,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.560 align:middle line:84%
focused on her love for
Rama, and to remain as steady

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.970 align:middle line:90%
as the trees themselves.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.850 align:middle line:10%
Her diligent attention paid
off, and with Hanuman's help,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.330 align:middle line:10%
she was happily reunited
with her husband.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:18.150 align:middle line:90%


00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.290 align:middle line:84%
>> Most of today's yogis
attempt Vrksasana, or Tree Pose,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.020 align:middle line:90%
regularly in their yoga classes.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.560 align:middle line:84%
But few would recognize
the mythology or story

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.480 align:middle line:90%
behind this Vedantic era pose.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.230 align:middle line:90%


00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.570 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the ancient
mythology that

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:84%
helped inform most of yoga's
asanas is often misunderstood

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.710 align:middle line:84%
or overlooked entirely in
today's Western society.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.560 align:middle line:84%
But in India, myth
is known and revered

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.558 align:middle line:84%
for its inspirational
metaphorical nature.

00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:59.100 align:middle line:84%
>> The Indian tradition and the
Buddhist tradition-- in fact,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.370 align:middle line:84%
all the ancient traditions--
understood is that this

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.040 align:middle line:84%
physical reality is just
one layer of the universe,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.050 align:middle line:84%
that there are many, many
subtle realms which we can visit

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.716 align:middle line:90%
in meditation or in dreams.

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:15.150 align:middle line:84%
And most of us don't
meditate deeply enough

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.300 align:middle line:84%
to actually experience them
in meditation, but many of us

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.200 align:middle line:84%
have dreamed ourselves
into subtle realms.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.080 align:middle line:84%
Joseph Campbell, of course,
has done extraordinary work

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.850 align:middle line:84%
explaining the way in
which myth is reality.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.330 align:middle line:84%
And of course, Carl Jung
understood that certain kinds

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.660 align:middle line:84%
of truths cannot be communicated
in ordinary visual terms

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.960 align:middle line:84%
or in ordinary words because
they exist at a much subtler

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.760 align:middle line:90%
level.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:52.560 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.790 align:middle line:84%
Myths are ways of putting
the deep truths that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.590 align:middle line:84%
come from these
levels of reality

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.090 align:middle line:84%
into what I would call
pictorial or story terms.

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.680 align:middle line:84%
We hear a story, it goes
in, and it impacts us really

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.700 align:middle line:90%
on a soul level.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.010 align:middle line:84%
And it can change
our consciousness.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Just by listening to
and imbibing the story,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.290 align:middle line:84%
it expands our sense
of possibilities.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.310 align:middle line:84%
It's very important
to recognize both

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.360 align:middle line:84%
that these are subtle
realities and yet the stories

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.280 align:middle line:90%
should not be taken literally.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.240 align:middle line:84%
Myths should be held lightly
and also should be revered.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:38.446 align:middle line:90%


00:03:38.446 --> 00:03:41.940 align:middle line:84%
>> The myths and stories of
each culture give an insight

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.090 align:middle line:84%
to the human condition
through a specific lens.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.540 align:middle line:84%
In yoga's roots of Hinduism,
the mythological stories

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.770 align:middle line:84%
revolve primarily around three
characters of the Trimurti,

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.600 align:middle line:90%
or Hindu trinity--

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.550 align:middle line:84%
Brahma, the creator; Vishnu, the
sustainer of life; and Shiva,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.350 align:middle line:90%
the destroyer.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Each plays an important
role in the cycle of life

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.770 align:middle line:84%
and is complemented by its
feminine counterpart, together

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.660 align:middle line:90%
known as the Tridevi.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Saraswati, Rama's consort, is
the goddess of intelligence,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.660 align:middle line:90%
knowledge, and consciousness.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.860 align:middle line:10%
Lakshmi, consort of Vishnu, is
goddess of wealth, fertility,

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.330 align:middle line:10%
and prosperity.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.530 align:middle line:84%
And Parvati, Shiva's consort, is
the goddess of transformation,

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.100 align:middle line:90%
power, and love.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.770 align:middle line:84%
Their collective stories
permeate the teachings

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.740 align:middle line:84%
of yoga via ancient
texts, mantra,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:84%
and even the Sanskrit
names of yoga

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.980 align:middle line:84%
poses that hold the essence
of a universal lesson relating

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:90%
to all beings on the planet.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.110 align:middle line:90%


00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.310 align:middle line:84%
>> Ultimately, the yogi is
not Hindu, Indian, American,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.193 align:middle line:90%
or nobody, ultimately.

00:04:56.193 --> 00:04:58.610 align:middle line:84%
The purpose of yoga is to go
beyond these identities which

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.570 align:middle line:90%
are imposed upon us.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.370 align:middle line:90%
What is Indian?

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.330 align:middle line:90%
It's just a concept.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.130 align:middle line:90%
What is American?

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.922 align:middle line:84%
It's just a concept,
a collection of ideas.

00:05:03.922 --> 00:05:04.740 align:middle line:90%
That's all.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:05.540 align:middle line:90%
Is it not?

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:06.800 align:middle line:90%
These are based on separation.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.800 align:middle line:90%
That's not what yoga is.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.660 align:middle line:90%
It's about unity.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.870 align:middle line:84%
So we are supposed to
be very clear of that.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.680 align:middle line:10%
>> In the narratives in
the stories of Buddhism

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.080 align:middle line:10%
and the stories of all of the
different saints and the gurus

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.600 align:middle line:10%
and the peers of
the Sufi tradition,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.120 align:middle line:10%
there will be saint-like people.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.390 align:middle line:84%
And the stories of these
saints serve to inspire others.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.660 align:middle line:10%
And it is said that
one could enter

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:10%
into the company of the
siddhas of these saintly people

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.150 align:middle line:10%
by imitating them and by
going through the purification

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.960 align:middle line:10%
that they endured and modeling
one's own life after the life

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.300 align:middle line:10%
of this community of saints.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And this is true
in Christianity,

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.120 align:middle line:84%
this is true in the
stories of Islam

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.910 align:middle line:84%
and the stories of
Hinduism and the stories

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.460 align:middle line:84%
of the Chinese sages, such
as Confucius and Lao-Tse

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.162 align:middle line:84%
that this is the calling
to the higher life,

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:04.870 align:middle line:84%
and that would be the
life of the siddha.

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.943 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.943 --> 00:06:09.360 align:middle line:84%
>> We speak
unlimitedly about God,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.010 align:middle line:84%
but we never
actually can see God.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.280 align:middle line:84%
He's beyond, she's beyond,
it's beyond understanding,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.590 align:middle line:84%
intellectual understanding
or mental grasp.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.950 align:middle line:84%
So that infinite
reality, in Hinduism

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.690 align:middle line:84%
we give it the
name Brahman, which

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.750 align:middle line:84%
means huge, infinite,
inconceivable--

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.070 align:middle line:90%
how you hold the inconceivable.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.370 align:middle line:84%
And so the image of Kali
and the images of these gods

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.250 align:middle line:84%
and goddesses of ancient
Hinduism are faces,

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.130 align:middle line:84%
are masks, are
approaches to that

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.340 align:middle line:84%
which is beyond conception,
ways of thinking about that

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.645 align:middle line:90%
which is unthinkable.

00:06:39.645 --> 00:06:42.620 align:middle line:90%


00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.550 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the most recognizable
Hindu gods is Hanuman,

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.960 align:middle line:10%
who often appears as a man with
the face and tail of a monkey

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.930 align:middle line:10%
and was the god that brought
hope and secret messages

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:59.320 align:middle line:10%
to Sita while being held
captive in the ashoka trees.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.160 align:middle line:84%
>> Hanuman is a deity which had
mastered all aspects of yoga,

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.520 align:middle line:90%
all Ashtanga yoga.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.100 align:middle line:84%
He was also an accomplished
yogi because many

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.200 align:middle line:84%
of the things which you get in
his life that he carried out--

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.170 align:middle line:84%
becoming small, becoming
big, becoming light, becoming

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.250 align:middle line:90%
heavy--

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.130 align:middle line:84%
those are called
glories of yoga.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.320 align:middle line:84%
And he had every kind
of glory with him.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.170 align:middle line:84%
Then secondly,
Hanuman is Vayu putra.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:31.030 align:middle line:84%
That means son of a
deity of air and wind.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.690 align:middle line:84%
If that is not there,
we won't be living.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.590 align:middle line:84%
And then Hanuman
is all on breath.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:37.120 align:middle line:90%
It's all on Pran.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.870 align:middle line:84%
The whole yogic aspect is not on
body and mind, which is wrongly

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:middle line:84%
construed by people that
something is physical,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:90%
something is mental.

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.330 align:middle line:90%
But that's not true.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.580 align:middle line:90%
Basically, it is about breath.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.530 align:middle line:84%
And Haruman is
therefore very right

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.950 align:middle line:84%
that Guruji had special
devotion for him.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:00.400 align:middle line:90%


00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:03.670 align:middle line:10%
>> Saraswati, wife of
the great god Brahma,

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.030 align:middle line:10%
is known as the goddess of
learning, wisdom, music,

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:09.490 align:middle line:10%
and aesthetics.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.750 align:middle line:10%
>> Saraswati is another goddess,
very important in the Hindu

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.550 align:middle line:10%
pantheon.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.700 align:middle line:10%
And just again,
breaking it down,

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.010 align:middle line:10%
goddesses of birth,
life, and death.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:20.610 align:middle line:10%
Maybe, well these are
everything goddesses--

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.850 align:middle line:10%
Kali is death; Lakshmi,
life; Saraswati, birth.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.750 align:middle line:10%
And we even have going back to
her roots, the Saraswati Indus

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.480 align:middle line:10%
Valley civilization,
she was a mighty river.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.390 align:middle line:84%
She is very powerful
forms that may not

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.780 align:middle line:84%
be as evident in the way that
she is presented in the more

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.770 align:middle line:90%
orthodox traditions today.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.780 align:middle line:10%
She is a goddess
of creativity, she

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.830 align:middle line:10%
is a goddess of the
generative force,

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.380 align:middle line:10%
of that generative
power, the animating

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.540 align:middle line:10%
power behind all existence.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.260 align:middle line:84%
And she's a goddess of
meditation, contemplation,

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:58.180 align:middle line:84%
education, nowadays even,
say, technology, all the arts.

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.610 align:middle line:90%


00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:05.490 align:middle line:10%
>> One of the incarnations of
the goddess Parvati is Kali,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.770 align:middle line:10%
a multifaceted avatar most
often associated as the goddess

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.050 align:middle line:10%
of death and time.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.800 align:middle line:84%
Kali first appears
around the year 600

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.810 align:middle line:84%
CE on the battlefields
of the gods,

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.295 align:middle line:90%
in combat with the demons.

00:09:19.295 --> 00:09:21.800 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.850 align:middle line:84%
>> In one particularly
bloody and legendary battle,

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:30.620 align:middle line:84%
the demon Raktabija is battling
with the goddess Durga.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:34.310 align:middle line:84%
Every time a drop of the
demon's blood spills and touches

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:38.930 align:middle line:84%
the ground, it becomes
another deadly fighting demon,

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:41.780 align:middle line:84%
quickly outnumbering
Durga and the other gods,

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.360 align:middle line:84%
making the effort
of killing Raktabija

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.780 align:middle line:90%
seem nearly impossible.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:51.810 align:middle line:84%
Enter Kali, with her wild
eyes and protruding tongue,

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:55.760 align:middle line:84%
said to have emerged from the
third eye of Shiva himself.

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.510 align:middle line:84%
Watch as Kali turns
the battle around

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:03.740 align:middle line:84%
by lapping up Raktabija's blood
before it hits the ground,

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:06.950 align:middle line:84%
then devouring all
the replicates,

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.420 align:middle line:84%
thereby defeating the demon
and ending the battle.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:16.960 align:middle line:90%


00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.560 align:middle line:84%
>> In this ancient tale, the
multiplying demons are thought

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.090 align:middle line:84%
to represent our human ego, and
Kali serves as the destroyer

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.880 align:middle line:90%
and liberator of our true self.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:31.000 align:middle line:84%
The meaning is clear,
through mortal death

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.180 align:middle line:90%
comes everlasting life.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:40.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Kali, her name means the
dark one, the dark goddess.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.140 align:middle line:10%
Well, her name also
refers to time.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.710 align:middle line:84%
The thing is Kali is a
completely multi-valent

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:47.510 align:middle line:90%
goddess.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.330 align:middle line:84%
So she is worshipped
and utilized

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.340 align:middle line:84%
in many, many
different lineages.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.890 align:middle line:84%
And so who she is, it
depends on who you ask,

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:55.870 align:middle line:90%
what lineage they're in.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.810 align:middle line:10%
Now, in my favorite
nondual tantric tradition,

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle line:10%
they do not picture
Kali as with a form,

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.130 align:middle line:10%
with a face or
anything like that.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:12.310 align:middle line:84%
They, in fact, regard her as
the void of pure consciousness.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:16.300 align:middle line:84%
But not a kind of static
void, but a void pregnant

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.220 align:middle line:90%
with infinite possibility.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.640 align:middle line:84%
So like a void humming with
potential energy, which

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.280 align:middle line:84%
is the kind of ground
of being, the field

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.650 align:middle line:90%
of absolute potential.

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:28.960 align:middle line:84%
They use these incredible
esoteric names for her

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.950 align:middle line:84%
like she is the
resounding silence,

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:41.260 align:middle line:84%
she is the radiant dark, these
apparently paradoxical names.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.040 align:middle line:10%
So some of the Kali imagery
can be downright terrifying.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.420 align:middle line:10%
But why?

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:49.060 align:middle line:84%
Well, in some of the
lineages I study,

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:54.670 align:middle line:84%
the answer is really that
the inner void terrifies us.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.240 align:middle line:84%
Because if you go into
the very heart of being,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:84%
what you discover is that
your worst fear is true,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.120 align:middle line:90%
that at the heart--

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.860 align:middle line:90%
way deep down inside--

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.020 align:middle line:90%
you're nothing and nobody.

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.390 align:middle line:84%
And we're terrified
of that realization.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:12.220 align:middle line:90%
And that's why Kali is scary.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:14.620 align:middle line:84%
But here's what people
don't get unless they've

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:17.920 align:middle line:84%
had the experience is that from
the perspective of standing

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:84%
outside the void,
it's terrifying.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.990 align:middle line:84%
But when you become
the void, you

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.710 align:middle line:84%
realize it's a space
of infinite openness

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:29.740 align:middle line:90%
that makes room for everything.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.680 align:middle line:84%
Your secret hope that
there's much more to you

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.170 align:middle line:84%
than has yet been
revealed is true.

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.740 align:middle line:84%
Your secret fear that
you're nothing and nobody

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.690 align:middle line:90%
is also true.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.460 align:middle line:84%
Realize how both are
true simultaneously,

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:44.260 align:middle line:90%
and you're free.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:48.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.790 align:middle line:84%
>> Derived from the Sanskrit
lakshya meaning aim or goal,

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:56.240 align:middle line:84%
Lakshmi is a household goddess
for most Hindu families

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.230 align:middle line:84%
and worshipped daily for wealth
and prosperity in both material

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:02.860 align:middle line:90%
and spiritual forms.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.420 align:middle line:84%
>> So Lakshmi is a
much beloved goddess.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:09.560 align:middle line:84%
She does have tantric
emanations in her form

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.770 align:middle line:84%
as the 10 tantric wisdom
goddesses as Kamala.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.950 align:middle line:84%
She has another very
esoteric tantric form

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.200 align:middle line:90%
called Sri Lakshmi in Nepal.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.340 align:middle line:84%
She is ultimately a
goddess of abundance.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.750 align:middle line:84%
And while she is
often worshipped

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:25.940 align:middle line:84%
for material abundance,
she's really a goddess

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:28.460 align:middle line:90%
of spiritual abundance.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.170 align:middle line:84%
They say the goddess
was spousified.

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:31.520 align:middle line:90%
She was domesticated.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.400 align:middle line:84%
And we definitely see
that with Lakshmi,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.890 align:middle line:84%
that around the fourth
century her wings are clipped.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:40.120 align:middle line:10%
She had a very wild
earlier appearance.

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.910 align:middle line:10%
She is very much associated with
the trees, known as Yakshinis,

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.940 align:middle line:10%
or the Yakshis,
the tree spirits.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.370 align:middle line:10%
They're sort of like the
fairies of the Hindu tradition.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And the Yakshis also
have a connection

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.630 align:middle line:90%
to the Matrikas and Yoginis.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.700 align:middle line:84%
Lakshmi is very much
about embodiment.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.440 align:middle line:90%
She's the Earth itself.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.260 align:middle line:90%


00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:03.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The seven Matrikas,
or seven little mothers,

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:08.180 align:middle line:84%
are often said to represent the
energies of seven male gods.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.940 align:middle line:84%
They are all aspects
of the goddess Shakti

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:16.570 align:middle line:84%
and are described as having both
wild and protective qualities.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.780 align:middle line:84%
>> The number seven is
very important in the Hindu

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:22.170 align:middle line:84%
tradition, the Hindu
tantric tradition.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.360 align:middle line:84%
In one way, it's a way of
ordering or understanding

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.990 align:middle line:84%
the working ordering of
the universe in the cosmos.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.390 align:middle line:84%
And you do find
different references.

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.625 align:middle line:10%
There are seven
sacred rivers, there

00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:36.220 align:middle line:10%
are seven rishis,
or sages, there

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:40.090 align:middle line:10%
are different legends about
seven sisters all over India.

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:44.510 align:middle line:10%
And then also within that,
you find the seven Matrikas.

00:14:44.510 --> 00:14:46.430 align:middle line:10%
Another thing about
the number seven

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.500 align:middle line:10%
is if you think of
the ancients and how

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.600 align:middle line:10%
they ordered the universe,
we have seven musical notes

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:10%
or we have seven
days of the week

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.780 align:middle line:10%
or all these different
groupings of seven.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.390 align:middle line:84%
And so similarly,
we find the Matrikas

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.130 align:middle line:84%
together in this group
of seven goddesses.

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.710 align:middle line:10%
The Matrikas, or the
goddesses, didn't only

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:08.570 align:middle line:10%
have an anthropomorphic
form; they

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.950 align:middle line:10%
were worshiped as a tree
itself or worshiped as a stone.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:17.960 align:middle line:84%
The Matrikas themselves
are aspects of a goddess

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.040 align:middle line:90%
known by many names--

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.150 align:middle line:84%
Durga, Ambika, Bhagavati--
very ancient goddess

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.120 align:middle line:84%
going as far back as the
Saraswati Indus Valley

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.350 align:middle line:90%
civilization.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.980 align:middle line:84%
Today she is understood
as a goddess of strength,

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:33.870 align:middle line:84%
she is a goddess of courage,
she is a goddess of justice.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.590 align:middle line:84%
She removes difficulty,
she removes fear,

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.270 align:middle line:90%
she alleviates suffering.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:41.350 align:middle line:90%


00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:44.170 align:middle line:10%
The mother goddess, Durga,
calls forth her shakti.

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.030 align:middle line:10%
Shakti is her power.

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.930 align:middle line:84%
And out of her third eye springs
these seven, sometimes eight,

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:53.820 align:middle line:84%
Matrikas and help her
in devouring the demons.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.180 align:middle line:90%
What do the demons represent?

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:58.170 align:middle line:84%
They represent our minds,
they represent the elements.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:03.610 align:middle line:84%
They're different expressions
of fire, water, air, ether.

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.220 align:middle line:84%
These goddesses, or
these elemental energies,

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.110 align:middle line:90%
are navigators of space.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.040 align:middle line:84%
In a sense, what
are they protecting?

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.880 align:middle line:84%
They're protecting
inhabitants of that mandala,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.790 align:middle line:84%
that city from the
jungles or the forests

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.640 align:middle line:84%
around or the wild
energies around

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.180 align:middle line:84%
or even in considering their
relationship with the Pleiades.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.930 align:middle line:84%
They are navigating between
this earthly realm and the star

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:27.790 align:middle line:90%
realms, the cosmic realms.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.380 align:middle line:90%


00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.630 align:middle line:84%
The constellation of the
Pleiades, the Seven Sisters,

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:38.650 align:middle line:84%
would rise every time
around the vernal equinox

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:41.390 align:middle line:84%
and then it would go below
the horizon around the fall

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.190 align:middle line:90%
equinox.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.700 align:middle line:84%
And it was a way of
dividing the year,

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.070 align:middle line:84%
acknowledging the birthing, the
life, the fruition, the summer

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.610 align:middle line:84%
months and then going into
the autumn dark season.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.430 align:middle line:84%
What's significant about
this is the Durga festival

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.960 align:middle line:84%
takes place several
times a year.

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.230 align:middle line:84%
The two main times
relate to the equinoxes,

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.350 align:middle line:84%
actually to the first dark
moon after the equinox.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:13.520 align:middle line:90%


00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.410 align:middle line:84%
So the symbols of the goddesses
are very interesting because it

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.650 align:middle line:84%
really gives us insight into
the fullness of their powers,

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.510 align:middle line:90%
their functions.

00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:24.750 align:middle line:10%
With Lakshmi, for
example, she sometimes

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.520 align:middle line:10%
is represented with an owl.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:29.460 align:middle line:10%
This is a bird that can
see through the dark, that

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:34.520 align:middle line:10%
is said to have this vision that
it can almost turn its head 360

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.320 align:middle line:10%
degrees.

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:39.240 align:middle line:84%
And so we can think of
Lakshmi as the full moon.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:43.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the dark moon is
Kali, or a very fierce form

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:45.150 align:middle line:90%
as the Matrika Chamunda.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.580 align:middle line:84%
Chamunda's vehicle
is also the owl.

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.860 align:middle line:90%
There is one moon.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.350 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes it's full,
sometimes it's dark.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.020 align:middle line:84%
Just like birth and
death, they co-exist;

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.340 align:middle line:84%
they can't exist
without the other.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.530 align:middle line:10%
She's a goddess
of life, but also

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.420 align:middle line:10%
death and that regenerative
force that comes with it.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:08.190 align:middle line:10%
The elephants, too,
being a strong symbol

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.430 align:middle line:10%
comes more with her in
association with royalty.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And then the lotus,
too, is a symbol.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.660 align:middle line:84%
We see her holding
these two lotus flowers.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:17.850 align:middle line:84%
And the lotus is such
a beautiful symbol

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.460 align:middle line:84%
for the tantric
practitioner because if you

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.770 align:middle line:84%
think of the beginnings
of that lotus plant,

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:26.610 align:middle line:84%
the roots are down in the mud
and it has to find its way up

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.460 align:middle line:84%
through that dark,
murky water not knowing

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.675 align:middle line:90%
if the direction is correct.

00:18:30.675 --> 00:18:40.260 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.770 align:middle line:10%
>> Derived from the Sanskrit
word nata, meaning dance,

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:48.120 align:middle line:10%
and raja, meaning king,
Nataraj, or king of dance,

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.600 align:middle line:10%
is meant to express the dynamic
composition of the rhythm

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.230 align:middle line:10%
and harmony of life.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.990 align:middle line:84%
>> That beautiful statue
or picture of Nataraj,

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.830 align:middle line:84%
or the dancing Shiva, it's a
mythic image that describes

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:05.640 align:middle line:84%
a very, very profound teaching
of the Shiva tradition,

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.640 align:middle line:84%
which has to do with the
five acts of consciousness

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:12.930 align:middle line:84%
or the five acts of the divine,
which are manifestation--

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.660 align:middle line:84%
and of course, we know that
things are constantly being

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.720 align:middle line:84%
manifest, coming into
being; sustenance, they

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.330 align:middle line:84%
remain for a while;
and dissolution.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Everything that comes
into being also dissolves.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.720 align:middle line:84%
So these functions are
going on at every level,

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.760 align:middle line:84%
from of course the cosmic to
literally the movement of cells

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.390 align:middle line:90%
inside the body.

00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:37.710 align:middle line:84%
And those are considered
to be divine function.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you look at
the statue of Nataraj,

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.740 align:middle line:84%
you see that one of
his hands is pointing

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.820 align:middle line:90%
towards his lifted foot.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.240 align:middle line:90%
The foot represents grace.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.640 align:middle line:84%
Another of his hands is held
in a gesture called Dola mudra,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.510 align:middle line:90%
which signifies concealment.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:57.840 align:middle line:84%
Concealment is the
cosmic act by which

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.230 align:middle line:84%
the omnipresent divine
which has become everything

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:03.390 align:middle line:90%
conceals its presence.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.760 align:middle line:84%
In one of the Christian
mystical books, it says,

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.460 align:middle line:84%
the maker is hidden
in what he has made.

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.980 align:middle line:84%
So this understanding
that the divine

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.480 align:middle line:84%
is hidden inside the cosmos
is really in every tradition.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.110 align:middle line:10%
One of the hands holds
fire, which is dissolution;

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:22.490 align:middle line:10%
one hand holds a drum, which
signifies the cosmic sound that

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.190 align:middle line:10%
creates all things.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.010 align:middle line:84%
The statue itself
holds the secret

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:32.090 align:middle line:84%
of how the whole universe
is the dance of the divine.

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:35.100 align:middle line:90%


00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.430 align:middle line:84%
>> So that's why in yoga, the
first teacher of yoga is Shiva,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.280 align:middle line:84%
the Lord of Death,
the destroyer.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.980 align:middle line:84%
So something has to die in
you-- your false identity,

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.570 align:middle line:90%
your stories have to die--

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:49.870 align:middle line:84%
so that the new
identity can be born.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:51.418 align:middle line:10%
(SINGING)

00:20:51.418 --> 00:20:57.510 align:middle line:90%


00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.870 align:middle line:10%
>> Another ancient tradition
of India steeped in story is

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:04.140 align:middle line:10%
Jainism, principled in
its fundamental tenant

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:08.040 align:middle line:10%
for nonviolence and thought by
its worshipers to be an eternal

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.140 align:middle line:10%
faith without beginning or end.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.260 align:middle line:84%
>> Jain tradition is one of
the very old traditions of this

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.580 align:middle line:90%
planet Earth.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.550 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the English
word gin, or genie,

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.680 align:middle line:84%
which fulfills all
your wishes, come

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:84%
from Jain, which means the one
who knows the self, the one who

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.920 align:middle line:84%
can fulfill everybody's wishes,
the one who works on the self

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.490 align:middle line:90%
as well as work on someone else.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.370 align:middle line:90%
Bodhisattva, basically.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.640 align:middle line:84%
So this is how the genie
actually came into being.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.920 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's a spoiler
version of the genie,

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.330 align:middle line:90%
but this is how it came.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.390 align:middle line:10%
The one who works
on the self, who

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.490 align:middle line:10%
is satisfied with what he is.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.470 align:middle line:10%
He sits in the
bottle, basically.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:49.880 align:middle line:90%
He knows the self.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.720 align:middle line:84%
I am different from the
bottle, the bottle of the body.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.410 align:middle line:84%
Inside this bottle he
sits, fully satisfied.

00:21:57.410 --> 00:22:03.830 align:middle line:84%
And then someone who has the
respect, who has the devotion,

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:06.140 align:middle line:90%
he approaches this bottle--

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.750 align:middle line:84%
the awakened bottle-- and
then that realized soul

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.550 align:middle line:84%
comes out of that and
guides that individual.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.950 align:middle line:10%
So the genie was
actually once upon a time

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:20.160 align:middle line:10%
enlightened beings that got
hijacked by the human society,

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.980 align:middle line:10%
and we brought them
down to our fairy tales.

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:31.160 align:middle line:90%


00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:33.800 align:middle line:84%
>> Dating back at
least as early as yoga,

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:38.240 align:middle line:84%
around 5,000 years ago,
Shaivism is a spiritual practice

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:41.360 align:middle line:84%
and philosophy that many
important concepts and ritual

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.650 align:middle line:84%
traditions are thought
to be derived from.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:48.310 align:middle line:84%
This sect regards Lord
Shiva as Brahman himself

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:53.650 align:middle line:84%
and believes that all other
divinities are aspects of him.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:56.590 align:middle line:84%
>> The really important thing
about Keshra Shaivism is that

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:59.740 align:middle line:84%
it is totally and
fully non-dual.

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.240 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
the understanding

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.800 align:middle line:84%
is that Shiva, the
absolute god, the vastness,

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:10.310 align:middle line:84%
exists in its fullness inside
every atom of the cosmos.

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:12.910 align:middle line:84%
So even though we may
not be aware of it,

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:84%
when we move through
the process of return,

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.510 align:middle line:84%
we become aware that there is
nothing in the universe that

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:22.600 align:middle line:84%
isn't sacred, that isn't
divine, and that we ourselves

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.100 align:middle line:90%
contain the whole universe.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.030 align:middle line:90%


00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:30.840 align:middle line:84%
>> While myths help us reconnect
and access the divine universe

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.740 align:middle line:84%
within us, Yogic vortex
centers are physical portals

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.740 align:middle line:84%
on the planet through
which grace, consciousness,

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.040 align:middle line:84%
and healing energy
constantly flow.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.200 align:middle line:84%
Visiting one of
these vortex centers

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.570 align:middle line:84%
is thought to elevate
one's capacity

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:49.110 align:middle line:90%
for spiritual consciousness.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:53.940 align:middle line:84%
>> In the past, there was a
whole science of activating

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:56.760 align:middle line:90%
vortex centers around the world.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.210 align:middle line:84%
In the Yogic world,
we call it tirtha.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:04.080 align:middle line:84%
Tirtha is an activated
vortex center.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.070 align:middle line:84%
The word tirtha comes
from the word Tirthankar.

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Tirthankar means the creator
of the vortex center.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.560 align:middle line:10%
So every great master
in the Yogic world

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.430 align:middle line:10%
who came to the planet Earth,
it became his responsibility

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.950 align:middle line:10%
to activate a point
which can be assessed

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:24.120 align:middle line:10%
or through which beings can
assess the totality when

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.660 align:middle line:10%
he is no more available
in the physical realm.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.660 align:middle line:10%
And if you really go
back, this whole tradition

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.570 align:middle line:10%
of creating the vortex
center originates

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:35.850 align:middle line:10%
in the Jain tradition.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Every teacher or every
enlightened master

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.100 align:middle line:84%
that passed away,
he made it a point

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:45.320 align:middle line:84%
to leave his body in
this specific point.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.520 align:middle line:84%
So the first master left
the body, the second master

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.770 align:middle line:84%
left the body, the
idea was to energize,

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.820 align:middle line:84%
to create one of the largest
vortex centers on the planet

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:54.390 align:middle line:90%
Earth.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.610 align:middle line:84%
Because when a master
leaves the body,

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:01.490 align:middle line:90%
his aura expands 2.5 miles.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:04.250 align:middle line:84%
Two times in an
individual's life

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.470 align:middle line:90%
the aura expands like that.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:09.696 align:middle line:84%
One, when the individual
is enlightened, on the day

00:25:09.696 --> 00:25:12.650 align:middle line:84%
he is enlightened or
he realizes the self

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:15.550 align:middle line:84%
or the universal consciousness,
however you would put that.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.310 align:middle line:90%
His aura expands to 2.5 miles.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.910 align:middle line:90%
And at the time of death.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.350 align:middle line:90%
There's two types.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's a navel center
of the mother Earth,

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.980 align:middle line:90%
which is the Mount Kailash.

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:34.590 align:middle line:84%
Every enlightened being
in the Yogic tradition

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:39.550 align:middle line:84%
made it a point to
leave or to transmit

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:43.820 align:middle line:84%
a part of his teachings
into Mount Kailash.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.120 align:middle line:84%
All the 24 masters in
the Jain tradition,

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.980 align:middle line:90%
they spent some time there.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.850 align:middle line:84%
It's a spiritual library,
actually, that can be accessed.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:55.840 align:middle line:90%


00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.590 align:middle line:84%
And then you have the
Golden Temple, which

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:58.840 align:middle line:90%
is the other vortex center.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, the idea behind
all these vortex centers

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:07.010 align:middle line:84%
is to find the vortex
centers within the body.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm talking about
the secret sites.

00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.580 align:middle line:84%
The Yogic science also say
there is this one sacred site

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.380 align:middle line:90%
inside you.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.530 align:middle line:84%
If you assess that, you
assess all these sacred sites.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.406 align:middle line:84%
And that is the sacred
site of the heart.

00:26:18.406 --> 00:26:22.600 align:middle line:90%


00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.090 align:middle line:84%
So if you can assess
this, connect with this,

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:32.540 align:middle line:84%
it's equal to taking a vow,
meditating at all sacred sites

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.606 align:middle line:90%
on the planet Earth.

00:26:33.606 --> 00:26:49.500 align:middle line:90%


00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:51.390 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at
all of this, you

00:26:51.390 --> 00:26:53.790 align:middle line:90%
begin to get a whole picture.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.610 align:middle line:84%
All teachings are
ultimately channeled.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:58.830 align:middle line:84%
Ultimately, all
teachings trace back;

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:00.610 align:middle line:90%
they don't belong to anybody.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:04.038 align:middle line:84%
And all teachings
belong to everybody.

00:27:04.038 --> 00:27:05.580 align:middle line:84%
You see, because it
belongs to Shiva.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:08.400 align:middle line:84%
Shiva is absoluteness, of
absolute, the ultimate rebel.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:11.370 align:middle line:10%
In the manifest form, Shiva
is the ultimate rebel.

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:13.030 align:middle line:90%
Yes, he is the ultimate rebel.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:16.590 align:middle line:84%
He does not adhere to any
philosophy, any tradition.

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:84%
He's the ultimate
kind of crazy man.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.730 align:middle line:10%
That's the beauty of
metaphor and myths,

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.415 align:middle line:10%
that we have metaphors
to give clues,

00:27:26.415 --> 00:27:31.200 align:middle line:10%
to give and to create a
poetic quality to our history.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.150 align:middle line:84%
It's wonderful to
have a poetic history

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.710 align:middle line:84%
than just a reductionist
history, fables and all

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:36.510 align:middle line:90%
of that.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:39.660 align:middle line:10%
They are ultimately
tools to ignite,

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.990 align:middle line:10%
excite a certain aspect of
your consciousness to take you

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.565 align:middle line:10%
in the mystical realm.

00:27:44.565 --> 00:27:51.930 align:middle line:90%


00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:55.530 align:middle line:84%

becoming really big,

00:27:57.525 --> 00:27:59.640 align:middle line:84%

>> The ability to bi-locate,
to appear here and in Delhi

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.070 align:middle line:90%
at the same time.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.840 align:middle line:90%
These are examples of cities.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.710 align:middle line:90%
They're not that uncommon.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.820 align:middle line:84%
>> Brahma Krishna, he warned
against making the cities

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.560 align:middle line:84%
the goal of practice,
because you get trapped.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:18.900 align:middle line:84%
>> It can be for the greater
good or you can spin that world

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.970 align:middle line:90%
to your own advantage.

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:22.910 align:middle line:90%
What do you do?
