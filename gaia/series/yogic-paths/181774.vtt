In the yogic tradition,
this primordial energy

is known as Kundalini,
the Sanskrit

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.095 align:middle line:90%
term for that which is coiled.

up the central channel.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
Then around the
13th, 14th centuries,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.850 align:middle line:84%
different traditions kind of put
their stamp on the practices.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.540 align:middle line:84%
And that's when we see the
influx of the tantric tradition

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.473 align:middle line:84%
in which Kundalini in the
chakras is very important.

as its life force, or prana.

consciousness when it
begins to wake up to itself.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.500 align:middle line:84%
It's a subtle form of
intuition that guides you

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.420 align:middle line:84%
in terms of what
to pay attention to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.020 align:middle line:84%

conscious energy.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.090 align:middle line:84%
Most of us, because
we are conditioned

by our background,
how we're raised,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.560 align:middle line:84%

not available to us.

It becomes dormant To a child
before the age of three years,

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.080 align:middle line:90%
the full energy is there.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.510 align:middle line:84%
That is why child is
such a delightful.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.460 align:middle line:84%
But ultimately, we become
such miserable adults.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.880 align:middle line:84%
That why war, conflict,
all kinds of things born.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.610 align:middle line:84%
Because this bioenergy becomes
dormant during that growing up.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.880 align:middle line:84%
Idea of Kundalini
to access this,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.450 align:middle line:90%
to approach it, and activate it.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.950 align:middle line:84%
Because that
conditioning is sitting

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.910 align:middle line:90%
in our central nervous system.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
So once this energy
is activated,

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.230 align:middle line:84%
it will rush through
our nerves, spinal cord,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.920 align:middle line:90%
and all of the brain.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Once our brain is
brimming with energy,

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.070 align:middle line:84%
it will be a very delightful
brain, a very passionate brain.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.550 align:middle line:84%
It will clean out all those
traumas, scars, guilt, anger,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.550 align:middle line:84%
jealousy which we
slowly grow up with.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.400 align:middle line:84%
We live with hundreds of
yesterdays, which have no use.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.760 align:middle line:90%
And we suffer.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.920 align:middle line:90%
We are so confused.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.080 align:middle line:84%
So then when this
energy is activated,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.530 align:middle line:84%
we perceive the word
entirely in a fresh way.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.420 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.720 align:middle line:84%
>> The whole process of
yoga is to awaken Kundalini

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.510 align:middle line:84%
and to bring it back to union
with her lord, top of the head.

to raise the Kundalini.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.690 align:middle line:90%
It is a very powerful energy.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.860 align:middle line:84%
And it does rise when all the
chuckles are spinning properly.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.330 align:middle line:84%
The balance of the
chakras is just

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.050 align:middle line:84%
as important as the balance of
your organs and your glands.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.200 align:middle line:84%
In fact, chakras, well, it
comes from the word "circle,"

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.120 align:middle line:90%
"energetic circle," "chakra."

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.210 align:middle line:84%
And it is a field of energy
that usually comes together

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.340 align:middle line:84%
when there are certain
nerves, or glands, or organs

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.010 align:middle line:84%
or parts of the body that
have an energetic place where

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.200 align:middle line:84%
they kind of come together
or affect each other.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.110 align:middle line:84%
Then that energy will
move from the base

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.460 align:middle line:90%
all the way to the crown.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.760 align:middle line:84%
It's a very peaceful,
sweet energy, like a glow.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.362 align:middle line:84%
And not everybody
experiences it.

00:05:09.362 --> 00:05:10.820 align:middle line:84%
And even if you
experience it once,

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.237 align:middle line:84%
you may never
experience it again.

00:05:12.237 --> 00:05:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And it's not even necessary
and hopefully, no one's

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.960 align:middle line:84%
going in there with the idea of
getting their Kundalini raised.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.748 align:middle line:84%
Because even that alone
will stop it from happening.

00:05:21.748 --> 00:05:24.290 align:middle line:84%
And if you're blessed, you'll
have several experiences of it.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.540 align:middle line:84%
And if you're not, you'll maybe
come back in another lifetime

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.120 align:middle line:90%
and get it, you know?

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.130 align:middle line:90%

to understand this tangible,
these extended self of you.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.480 align:middle line:84%
We have forgotten this
extended self of ourself.

We have hurt of the Earth

But now, in the Aquarian
age, people of us

started becoming conscious of

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.480 align:middle line:10%
His form of Kundalini

influenced by his

as a seeker, the one who seeks,

the one who wants to know,
who am I, to seek that I.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.390 align:middle line:84%
The one who seeks that
is known as a Sikh.

The other definition
that's given

is that the one who is
conscious of his or her feet

when he or she walks, that's
the definition of a Sikh.

The one who dwells
here, who's humble,

who's connected to the
Earth instead of being here.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.320 align:middle line:90%
That's another definition.

what scholars call a thoroughly

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.890 align:middle line:84%
It is combining things from
many different sources that

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.930 align:middle line:90%
were never combined before.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:07.280 align:middle line:84%
And so, syncrestistic,
drawing on Sikh religion,

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.780 align:middle line:84%
it's drawing on some
tantric and quasi-tantric,

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.680 align:middle line:84%
and drawing on 20th century
development of Indian exercise

forms.

When we talk about
meditation in Kundalini yoga,

What is the first step?

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.840 align:middle line:90%
First, you've got to be aware.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And once you become
aware, you begin

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.808 align:middle line:84%
to take responsibility
for yourself

00:09:07.808 --> 00:09:10.350 align:middle line:84%
in a way that will allow you to

that you need to
make in your life

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:17.640 align:middle line:84%
so that you can create
positive outcomes.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.270 align:middle line:84%
We have a system
we called kriyas,

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.450 align:middle line:90%
which is a very generic word.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:29.310 align:middle line:84%
It means "action that
has a specific outcome."

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.010 align:middle line:10%
So for example, for
us, a kriya would

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:37.070 align:middle line:10%
be a series of movement,
postures, breath, mantra,

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.003 align:middle line:10%
all are leading to
a specific outcome.

00:09:39.003 --> 00:09:40.920 align:middle line:84%
There are a lot of
movements in Kundalini yoga

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.740 align:middle line:84%
that are just really
simple movements.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.967 align:middle line:84%
It just-- it don't
even look like yoga.

00:09:44.967 --> 00:09:46.100 align:middle line:90%
You know?

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.500 align:middle line:84%
But they're working on specific
parts of the body, parts

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.680 align:middle line:84%
of the nervous system, that need
to be stimulated with repeated

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.884 align:middle line:90%
motion, repeated action.

00:09:57.884 --> 00:10:01.370 align:middle line:90%
>> [CHANTING]

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.990 align:middle line:84%
>> What happens when you
chant or use a mantra?

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.790 align:middle line:90%
Two things.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.510 align:middle line:84%
One is that you use your
mouth and the tongue

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:12.830 align:middle line:84%
in your mouth to strike
certain parts of the mouth.

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:16.380 align:middle line:84%
There are like 84 meridian
points in the mouth.

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:19.700 align:middle line:84%
Meridian points are
channels of subtle energy.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.220 align:middle line:84%
And these meridian points
will affect the hypothalamus,

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.120 align:middle line:84%
which will send a message to the
pituitary, which will activate

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.910 align:middle line:84%
the pineal gland to
have a relationship

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:33.000 align:middle line:84%
with the various organs, and
parts, and systems of the body.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.620 align:middle line:84%
So just by chanting
repeatedly using your tongue,

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.820 align:middle line:84%
you activate this
whole limbic system.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:42.020 align:middle line:84%
And so the power of
mantra is that it

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.210 align:middle line:90%
can change your feeling.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.520 align:middle line:84%
It can change the
way you're thinking,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.780 align:middle line:84%
and can change the
way you're behaving,

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and change the way
you're seeing yourself

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.150 align:middle line:90%
in relationship to your world.

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:54.810 align:middle line:90%
That is a technology.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And all those
internal systems which

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.630 align:middle line:84%
have to work in balance in
order for us to really reach

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.000 align:middle line:84%
that higher state of
consciousness, which is

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.400 align:middle line:90%
the intention of all the yogas.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:08.140 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.080 align:middle line:84%
>> Color has an effect on
consciousness, which is why,

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.960 align:middle line:84%
in Kundalini yoga,
white is worn.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.090 align:middle line:90%
White represents purity.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:18.160 align:middle line:84%
And in Kundalini
tradition, it's said

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:21.250 align:middle line:84%
that white clothing expands
your energetic field

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.153 align:middle line:90%
to those around you.

00:11:23.153 --> 00:11:24.070 align:middle line:90%
>> It's like a doctor.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:90%
A doctor wears a uniform.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.520 align:middle line:90%
Policemen wear uniforms.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're all
uniforms which signal

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.160 align:middle line:84%
something about your profession
and what you're doing.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.860 align:middle line:84%
So, yes, if you're
teaching Kundalini yoga,

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.705 align:middle line:84%
you're obligated to wear the
white and to cover your head.

00:11:39.705 --> 00:11:43.300 align:middle line:84%
So covering your head, it
doesn't have to be a turban.

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.460 align:middle line:90%
I like my turban.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.480 align:middle line:84%
But I've been wearing
this long before I started

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.130 align:middle line:90%
practicing Kundalini yoga.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:51.760 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, when we
got to Kundalini yoga,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.210 align:middle line:90%
it became a white head wrap.

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:58.780 align:middle line:84%
But the idea is that, when
you practice a technology that

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.960 align:middle line:84%
has the kind of
power and potential

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:07.510 align:middle line:84%
that the combination of breath,
mantra, and meditation has,

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:13.360 align:middle line:84%
you begin to activate
parts of your brain.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.110 align:middle line:84%
You begin to stimulate
the crown chakra, which

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.573 align:middle line:90%
is at the top of the head.

So you want to make sure that
you are containing that energy.

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.360 align:middle line:84%
They're like
pressure points here,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.730 align:middle line:84%
the temples, and right
here, where the forehead

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.585 align:middle line:84%
has this little
module bone there,

00:12:35.585 --> 00:12:38.200 align:middle line:84%
you know, these two
little places here?

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.200 align:middle line:84%
If you wrap your turban
so it comes across that,

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.740 align:middle line:84%
you put a little pressure there
by the wrapping of it, which

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.395 align:middle line:90%
also helps to contain the mind.

00:12:47.395 --> 00:12:50.590 align:middle line:90%

known as the Breath of Fire

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:57.720 align:middle line:84%

And yet, we don't pay a
lot of attention to it.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.910 align:middle line:84%
That pranayama, that breath,
that movement of prana,

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:20.075 align:middle line:84%
is a very deep and important
part of the whole process

Sanskrit name.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.190 align:middle line:84%
And [SANSKRIT] means "fire" or
the psychic heat in the body.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:33.560 align:middle line:10%
It is one of the fast ways
to stimulate Kundalini, not

awaken Kundalini, stimulate it.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.100 align:middle line:84%
It's important that you do
some other pranayama before you

indulge into Breath of Fire.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:42.430 align:middle line:90%
You see, we have two breaths.

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.780 align:middle line:90%
One is the incoming breath.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.490 align:middle line:90%
One is the outgoing breath.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
The incoming breath
represent life.

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.440 align:middle line:84%
The outgoing breath
represents death.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.390 align:middle line:84%
The whole idea is, first, your
incoming and your outgoing

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.330 align:middle line:84%
breath, your life and
death balanced first

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.490 align:middle line:90%
before you start amplifying it.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.610 align:middle line:84%
Breath of Fire, you amplify
both life and death.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.490 align:middle line:84%
So if you are in
the wrong space,

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.540 align:middle line:84%
you are actually going to
amplify only the internal more

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.660 align:middle line:90%
than the external.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.010 align:middle line:84%
So first, you need to
balance or equalize

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:17.140 align:middle line:84%
the outgoing and
the incoming breath.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Once you have done that,
then all you need to do

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:21.220 align:middle line:90%
is pump with the navel.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.670 align:middle line:84%
And the inhale and the
exhale will remain equal

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:27.620 align:middle line:84%
all by itself without
somebody telling you

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:30.250 align:middle line:84%

In fact, the reason we'd
call this Kundalini yoga

00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:49.120 align:middle line:84%
It magnetizes is the body,
feeding the cells with light,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.350 align:middle line:84%
keeping the cells in
a magnetized state.

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.710 align:middle line:84%
>> So instead of the energy
going out and getting lost

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.650 align:middle line:84%
in the muscles and
all the senses,

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.510 align:middle line:90%
that energy is withdrawn.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.340 align:middle line:90%
And it goes into the spine.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:07.110 align:middle line:84%
>> He then reveals that life
force up and down the spine

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:11.640 align:middle line:84%
through those cerebral
spinal centers or chakras.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.630 align:middle line:84%
>> Then you become aware of
the subtle happenings which are

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.600 align:middle line:84%
in the spine, which
is insane the spine.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:22.530 align:middle line:84%
And then we go up and down the
spine and magnetize the spine.

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:28.470 align:middle line:84%
>> As he revolves this life
current through those chakras

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:33.370 align:middle line:84%
up and down, a powerful
magnet is created.

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:36.030 align:middle line:84%
>> And because of
the magnetization,

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.270 align:middle line:84%
the energy is
withdrawn more inside.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.830 align:middle line:84%
So it is like a
positive feedback.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:44.430 align:middle line:90%
Has to be draw inside.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:45.540 align:middle line:90%
Then you practice.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.700 align:middle line:90%
Then you withdraw more.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:50.520 align:middle line:84%
And you keep on
strengthening, revitalizing,

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.900 align:middle line:90%
the centers in the spine.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So then, finally, you are
able to bring all that energy

00:18:57.030 --> 00:18:59.850 align:middle line:84%
to the point between
the eyebrows.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:05.023 align:middle line:84%
And then we get the experience
of the super consciousness.

00:19:05.023 --> 00:19:08.130 align:middle line:90%


00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:12.360 align:middle line:84%
>> And then the yogi enters
an interiorized state of God

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.430 align:middle line:90%
communion.

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.330 align:middle line:84%
That communion that's
taking place in the spine

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:25.260 align:middle line:84%
produces an inner awakening of
intoxicating cosmic bliss that

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.760 align:middle line:90%
is indescribable.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:32.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.150 align:middle line:84%
>> Kriya yoga is subtle
practices based around

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.500 align:middle line:90%
Meditation, yes?

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.020 align:middle line:84%
Because meditation requires
a certain [SANKSKRIT],,

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:43.010 align:middle line:84%
[SANKSKRIT] meaning a flow of
attention based on the law that

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.430 align:middle line:84%
whenever your attention
goes, energy will follow.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.180 align:middle line:84%
It has two full effect,
physiological and

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:49.980 align:middle line:90%
psychological.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So physiologically, you're
shifting the energy.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.277 align:middle line:84%
And then, of course,
you're having

00:19:53.277 --> 00:19:58.020 align:middle line:90%
these meditative benefits, yes?

00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:01.300 align:middle line:84%
>> We have four basic techniques
in Params Yogananda-Ji.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.040 align:middle line:84%
The energization exercises,
and the concentration technique

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.670 align:middle line:84%
called Hong-Sau technique,
and the meditation technique

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:09.740 align:middle line:84%
called om technique and
the Kriya Yoga technique.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.730 align:middle line:84%
So with these four techniques,
we can bring the cosmic energy

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:17.030 align:middle line:84%
through the body, charge the
body with the cosmic energy,

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.300 align:middle line:84%
and distribute the energy
properly throughout the body,

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:24.400 align:middle line:84%
so that the body is
strengthened and it's purified,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:27.350 align:middle line:84%
and it is made ready
for the meditation.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:29.748 align:middle line:84%
So this is also a
sort of pranayama,

00:20:29.748 --> 00:20:31.790 align:middle line:84%
because the energy control
is there in that also.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.950 align:middle line:84%
It's not simple
physical exercise.

the secret of
controlling the mind.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.580 align:middle line:90%
Breath control is self-control.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:59.090 align:middle line:90%
Breath mastery is self mastery.

concentration technique,

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.420 align:middle line:84%
we have that deep
breathing exercise,

coming where we inhale,
hold, and exhale.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.480 align:middle line:10%
>> We will begin with a
simple technique of pranayama,

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:20.480 align:middle line:10%
where we will count and inhale
at the same time to a count

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.340 align:middle line:10%
of 5.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.480 align:middle line:84%
We will hold the
breath to a count of 5.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And we'll exhale the
breath to a count of 5.

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:34.670 align:middle line:90%
We will repeat this three times.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:39.360 align:middle line:84%
Before we begin, we
exhale the breath

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:49.410 align:middle line:84%
to release from the lungs
all carbon and breath.

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:53.143 align:middle line:84%

of darkness, guru.

00:23:09.735 --> 00:23:13.555 align:middle line:84%
Guru is one who has attained
self realization, who

00:23:13.555 --> 00:23:15.030 align:middle line:90%
has become one with God.

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.150 align:middle line:84%
>> The guru is not
a physical being.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:23.200 align:middle line:84%
He comes for a time to live
in the world as a human being,

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.880 align:middle line:84%
but he's really
divine consciousness.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.550 align:middle line:84%
The student usually has an
inner awakening of some sort

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:35.920 align:middle line:84%
and begins to seek and search
for that path, for that master.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:40.660 align:middle line:84%
When they find the path
that they feel attracted to,

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.330 align:middle line:84%
then they begin to
study and investigate.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.490 align:middle line:84%
And that's very
important, because you

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.190 align:middle line:84%
have to understand
what you're studying

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:54.330 align:middle line:84%
and you have to feel
compelled and feel inwardly--

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.830 align:middle line:90%
this is resonating.

00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:59.680 align:middle line:90%


00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:84%
>> As the person
evolves more and more,

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.800 align:middle line:84%
the longing becomes deeper the
yearning becomes very strong

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.500 align:middle line:90%
maybe owning is really strong.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.670 align:middle line:84%
I really want to know
the purpose of play.

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:15.120 align:middle line:84%
And if there is a god, I want
to have the realization of god.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.900 align:middle line:90%
Then God sends the guru.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.780 align:middle line:84%
And finally ultimately,
when that person

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:22.350 align:middle line:84%
has come to the last lap of
the spiritual journey, then

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:25.800 align:middle line:84%
the guru is drawn by god
to the disciple's life.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:28.950 align:middle line:84%
When the disciple is
ready, the guru comes.

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:34.640 align:middle line:84%
>> The guru accepts the
disciple as his guide.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.720 align:middle line:84%
And the disciple accepts
the guru with faith

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.600 align:middle line:84%
and follows to the best
of his or her ability,

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.290 align:middle line:84%
follows the teachings, follows
the meditation practice.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:50.720 align:middle line:84%
Then the relationship
progresses from there.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.500 align:middle line:84%
>> This sacred guru-disciple
relationship within Kriya,

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.440 align:middle line:84%
kept it veiled in
secrecy for centuries,

00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:01.520 align:middle line:84%
prior to its 19th century
revival by a mysterious Indian

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.380 align:middle line:90%
Saint named Mahavatar Babaji.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:07.310 align:middle line:84%
>> It does first
start by Krishna to--

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.860 align:middle line:90%
>> How do you know?

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.520 align:middle line:90%
>> So after time, it lost.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.880 align:middle line:84%
Then in the last
century, Babaji Maharaj,

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.820 align:middle line:84%
he again revived it and
gave it to the mankind.

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.550 align:middle line:90%


00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:26.315 align:middle line:84%
>> Babaji is a celestial being,
who was moving around in astral

00:25:26.315 --> 00:25:27.650 align:middle line:90%
realm.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:29.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's why he's
calling immortal,

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.570 align:middle line:84%
immortal really we
are all immortals.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:32.990 align:middle line:90%
We don't really die.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.400 align:middle line:90%
What dies is the idea of us.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So we are ultimately
all immortals.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.840 align:middle line:84%
So is the physical manifestation
of that state of consciousness,

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:41.625 align:middle line:90%
which is the ultimate teacher.

00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:43.250 align:middle line:84%
And that's what yoga
is saying, there's

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:45.300 align:middle line:90%
guru-shishya relationship.

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.430 align:middle line:84%
That's why Babaji's place
is there that he's bodyless,

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:50.630 align:middle line:90%
ultimately meaning what?

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:53.010 align:middle line:84%
That there is no guru
who doesn't have a guru.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:53.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:56.510 align:middle line:84%
The answer is not a
golden chain of teachers.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:26:00.000 align:middle line:84%
It's a golden chain of
students, ultimately leading up

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.300 align:middle line:84%
to a being who doesn't
exist in physical realm.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So the ultimate teacher
is the absolute.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:06.680 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
the Babaji reflects

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.760 align:middle line:84%
is the absoluteness
crystallized in finite shape

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.100 align:middle line:84%
and form, but yet
without any story,

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.620 align:middle line:90%
without any beginning or end.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:84%
>> Mahavatar Babaji passed
on the Kriya techniques

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:23.780 align:middle line:84%
to the general public through
his disciple Lahiri Mahasaya.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:27.890 align:middle line:84%
>> In the 19th century,
Mahavatar Babaji felt that

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:31.970 align:middle line:84%
the time was right to
reintroduce the science

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.670 align:middle line:84%
of Kriya Yoga into
the world again.

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.220 align:middle line:84%
Up until that time,
it had only been

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:41.030 align:middle line:84%
practiced by solitary
aesthetics in Himalayan regions

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.770 align:middle line:90%
and forests in India.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:46.190 align:middle line:84%
He called the Lahiri
Mahasaya wasn't his disciple

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:47.350 align:middle line:90%
at the time.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:51.420 align:middle line:84%
But he was a humble accountant
in the city of Benaras.

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.660 align:middle line:84%
He called him to the
Himalayan regions

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.360 align:middle line:84%
and initiated him
into Kriya Yoga.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.970 align:middle line:84%
>> And after that, Lahiri
Mahasaya wanted to stay with

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.480 align:middle line:90%
Babaji, you know.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.280 align:middle line:84%
After having that
experience and remaining

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.900 align:middle line:84%
in Nirvikalpa
Samadhi, one would not

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.850 align:middle line:84%
want to come back again to
the mundane and the world.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:09.650 align:middle line:90%
[CHUCKLES]

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.140 align:middle line:84%
But then Mahavatar
Babaji told him,

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:14.620 align:middle line:84%
god has given you this
role for this life.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.020 align:middle line:84%
So you should lead the
life of a householder

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:20.870 align:middle line:84%
and set an example for millions
of people in this world.

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:24.260 align:middle line:84%
They will see the
example of you.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:29.300 align:middle line:84%
>> He said, my son, you must
now mingle in the world of men.

00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.180 align:middle line:84%
You have been chosen to
bring spiritual solace

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:36.650 align:middle line:84%
through Kriya Yoga to
numerous earnest seekers.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.780 align:middle line:84%
You should guide
them to understand

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:41.810 align:middle line:84%
that the highest yogic
attainments are not

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:44.510 align:middle line:90%
barred to the family man.

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:47.960 align:middle line:84%
Even in the world, the yogi
who faithfully discharges

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.820 align:middle line:84%
his responsibilities without
personal motive or attachment

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:55.730 align:middle line:84%
treads the sure path
of enlightenment.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:28:03.550 align:middle line:90%


00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Lahiri Mahasaya initiated
many spiritual seekers

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:12.350 align:middle line:84%
into the science of Kriya Yoga
for a period about 30 years.

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:15.800 align:middle line:84%
And then, at a Kumba
Mela, Mahavatar Babaji

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:21.560 align:middle line:84%
meets Lahiri Mahasaya'a foremost
disciple, Swami Sri Yukteswar

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.670 align:middle line:90%
Giri.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:26.060 align:middle line:84%
He tells him, you
Swamiji, have a part

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:31.130 align:middle line:84%
to play in the coming harmonious
exchange between Orient

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.200 align:middle line:90%
and Occident.

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:37.280 align:middle line:84%
The vibrations there of many
spiritually seeking souls

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.160 align:middle line:90%
come flood like to me.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:45.140 align:middle line:84%
I perceive potential saints
in America and Europe

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.500 align:middle line:90%
waiting to be awakened.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:52.910 align:middle line:84%
And so, that disciple was
Paramahansa Yogananda.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:57.060 align:middle line:84%
And when Yoganandaji met his
guru Swami Sri Yukteswarji,

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:02.210 align:middle line:84%
he said, my son smiling at
me in the bright moonlight,

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:08.740 align:middle line:84%
you are that disciple that years
ago Babaji promised to send me.

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:11.990 align:middle line:84%
>> Yogananda became one of
the greatest saints of modern

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.790 align:middle line:90%
India.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.910 align:middle line:84%
And his role in bringing
international awareness to yoga

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:20.020 align:middle line:84%
became legendary, after his
book "Autobiography of a Yogi"

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.655 align:middle line:90%
captured the hearts of millions.

00:29:21.655 --> 00:29:25.520 align:middle line:90%


00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.310 align:middle line:84%
>> He was an incredibly
amazing being,

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.410 align:middle line:84%
incredibly courageous
to see what he did.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:33.320 align:middle line:84%
I mean, when Yogananda went, he
went at a very specific time.

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.330 align:middle line:84%
And he was very
traditional Hindu.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:38.760 align:middle line:84%
You know, he was a round man
wearing a funny hat and robes

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.560 align:middle line:90%
and all of that.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:42.468 align:middle line:84%
And this is we are talking about
a Christian dominant America.

00:29:42.468 --> 00:29:43.760 align:middle line:90%
That was the brilliance of him.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.500 align:middle line:10%
He was speaking to a
particular audience

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.250 align:middle line:10%
and instead of
fighting, he adapted.

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:48.560 align:middle line:10%
And he adopted the teachings.

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.270 align:middle line:90%
That's the hallmark of genius--

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.490 align:middle line:90%
adaptability, not rigidity.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.830 align:middle line:90%
Rigidity is ignorance.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:57.470 align:middle line:84%
The more aware you are,
the more adaptable you are.

00:29:57.470 --> 00:30:00.200 align:middle line:84%
So he was at a very high state
of being, consciousness being.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.990 align:middle line:90%


00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:08.370 align:middle line:84%
>> Paramahansa Uganda taught
that we are made in the image

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:09.170 align:middle line:90%
of the divine.

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:10.880 align:middle line:90%
We are the soul.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:13.610 align:middle line:84%
And the purpose
of life is for us

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:17.210 align:middle line:84%
to return back to
that relationship

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:90%
and that oneness with God.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:20.540 align:middle line:90%
>> And may we be able.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.860 align:middle line:90%
>> And may we be able.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Awaken thy love.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:24.230 align:middle line:90%
>> Awaken thy love.

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.200 align:middle line:90%
>> In all hearts.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.000 align:middle line:90%
>> In all hearts.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.020 align:middle line:90%
>> Om.

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.710 align:middle line:90%
Shanti.

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:31.510 align:middle line:90%
Shanti.

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.430 align:middle line:90%
Shanti.

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:33.230 align:middle line:90%
Shanti.

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:43.790 align:middle line:90%


00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:84%
>> That's why you
yoga is important,

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:51.370 align:middle line:84%
because whenever you take up one
project, we waste our energy.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.880 align:middle line:84%
We waste our mental
energy, physical energy,

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:58.450 align:middle line:84%
our pranic energy,
everything we waste.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:02.440 align:middle line:84%
But if we have a little
bit knowledge of yoga,

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.980 align:middle line:90%
we can stop that wastage.

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.690 align:middle line:84%
That's why yoga
is very important.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:09.820 align:middle line:84%
And we see everywhere
in the world,

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:13.120 align:middle line:84%
there is tremendous interest
in yoga, because of that,

00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.010 align:middle line:90%
to stop the wastage of energy.

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:16.630 align:middle line:90%
Life is very short.

00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:20.244 align:middle line:84%
So we have to have the proper
utilization of that time

00:31:20.244 --> 00:31:21.044 align:middle line:90%
and energy.

00:31:21.044 --> 00:31:24.680 align:middle line:90%


00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.070 align:middle line:84%
>> Retraining ourselves
to learn to meditate,

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:31.100 align:middle line:84%
to learn to get to
know the divine.

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:33.030 align:middle line:90%
And it's a constant effort.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:37.950 align:middle line:84%
Yogananda would say,
just keep on keeping on.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:39.240 align:middle line:90%
One day, you're good.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.740 align:middle line:90%
The next day, you're not.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:45.490 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't matter,
because in here,

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and because the divine
knows, effort is progress.

00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:54.240 align:middle line:90%
No effort is lost.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:02.690 align:middle line:90%


00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.060 align:middle line:90%
>> Up next on "Yogic Paths."

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:09.140 align:middle line:84%
>> We're talking about yoga as
being a technology for raising

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.830 align:middle line:90%
one's consciousness.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:15.410 align:middle line:84%
The mind-- it is so sensitive,
it holds onto things very

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.503 align:middle line:84%
deeply, until
something comes along

00:32:17.503 --> 00:32:19.670 align:middle line:84%
that can recalibrate the
way the nerves are working,

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.100 align:middle line:84%
recalibrate the way the
mind is functioning,

00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:24.710 align:middle line:84%
recalibrate the way the
emotions are holding things.

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:28.270 align:middle line:84%
And that's what this
practice does for you.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:38.000 align:middle line:90%
