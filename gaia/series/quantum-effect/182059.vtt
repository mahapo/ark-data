00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.060 align:middle line:84%
>> Everybody asks the
question, who are you.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.540 align:middle line:84%
But I ask the
question, what are you?

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.260 align:middle line:10%
I am Randy Veitenheimer.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.560 align:middle line:10%
And for years, I
have been studying

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.650 align:middle line:10%
with some of the top masters
of the world that deal

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:10%
with the idea of consciousness.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.760 align:middle line:84%
Today, I want to offer a
new view on consciousness

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.460 align:middle line:84%
that I hope might
help you removes locks

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.600 align:middle line:90%
and get you back to who you are.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.420 align:middle line:90%
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.730 align:middle line:90%


00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.190 align:middle line:10%
So what is consciousness?

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.040 align:middle line:10%
The greatest thing about
being human is consciousness.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.930 align:middle line:10%
In fact, it's the only thing
that defines our existence.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.470 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is awareness
of one's self existence

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.480 align:middle line:90%
and existence of self.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.100 align:middle line:90%
This is the duality.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.750 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is self-awareness
and awareness of the self.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.040 align:middle line:84%
There have been many attempts
to examine consciousness.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.280 align:middle line:90%
But what is it?

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.540 align:middle line:90%
How does it work?

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.390 align:middle line:84%
The current model is breaking
down human consciousness

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.030 align:middle line:90%
into subcategories.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.340 align:middle line:10%
Per Freud, he broke
consciousness down

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.470 align:middle line:10%
into three layers--

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.650 align:middle line:10%
the alert consciousness,
the subconsciousness,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.720 align:middle line:10%
and unconsciousness.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.490 align:middle line:10%
In my opinion, consciousness
is not layered or subdivided.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.600 align:middle line:90%
It is homogeneous.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.640 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.070 align:middle line:84%
When we deal with
human consciousness,

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.720 align:middle line:84%
we also deal with a collective
consciousness of humanity.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And not as a separate,
but as an integrated part

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.050 align:middle line:84%
of human consciousness
and knowledge.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.150 align:middle line:90%


00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.970 align:middle line:84%
We can examine human
collective consciousness.

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.509 align:middle line:90%
What does it mean to be human?

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.530 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean to share
a collective consciousness,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.920 align:middle line:84%
to share and be a part of
a collective consciousness

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.730 align:middle line:90%
identity?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.030 align:middle line:90%


00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:29.700 align:middle line:84%
Group consciousness,
religion, family, politics,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.010 align:middle line:84%
tribal consciousness,
creative consciousness, these

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.600 align:middle line:84%
are all aspects of what
it means to be human.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.530 align:middle line:84%
And if you are a human,
you are human as a species

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.000 align:middle line:90%
and as an individual.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.490 align:middle line:90%


00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.100 align:middle line:10%
Rupert Sheldrake
introduces the concept

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.370 align:middle line:10%
of morphic fields, which
is also the same concept

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.660 align:middle line:10%
of consciousness,
subconsciousness, unconscious,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.430 align:middle line:10%
and individual consciousness.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.890 align:middle line:90%
Why is it important?

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It gives us additional insight
into the origins of problems

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.855 align:middle line:90%
and behavior and disease.

00:03:15.855 --> 00:03:21.800 align:middle line:90%


00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.990 align:middle line:84%
You have an energy field,
a human energy field.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.160 align:middle line:84%
The first layer is referred
to as the aetheric field.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.110 align:middle line:84%
And on most people, that is
probably two to three inches.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.030 align:middle line:84%
There's ways to become
sensitive to that.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.400 align:middle line:90%
We're sensitive to it already.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.640 align:middle line:84%
It comes in the form of somebody
that walks up behind you

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.460 align:middle line:84%
or you feel like somebody
is looking at you.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.410 align:middle line:90%
It's called a proximity sense.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.440 align:middle line:84%
And that is when you
are directly engaged

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.120 align:middle line:90%
with your aetheric field.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.090 align:middle line:90%


00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.430 align:middle line:84%
But nobody ever
seems to explain it.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.730 align:middle line:90%
So let's use acupuncture.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.340 align:middle line:84%
When you stick that needle
onto one of those energy

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.000 align:middle line:84%
points on the body, you are
changing the energy flow

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.300 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.970 align:middle line:84%
Acupuncture needles stick
up into your aetheric field.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.860 align:middle line:90%
It represents a short circuit.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.480 align:middle line:84%
You're taking the entire
human energy field

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.840 align:middle line:84%
and you're able to short
circuit it to some degree

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.410 align:middle line:84%
and cause the energy
flow around you

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:90%
to now be introduced into you.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.740 align:middle line:84%
Another stage of
acupuncture would

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.700 align:middle line:84%
be to be able to take
one needle and be

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.700 align:middle line:84%
able to hit one
point, and through it

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.760 align:middle line:84%
to engage any other or all
other points on the body.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.170 align:middle line:84%
A third level of acupuncture,
the ability to use your touch.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.850 align:middle line:84%
When you touch somebody,
you're actually

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.760 align:middle line:84%
touching them with your
entire electromagnetic field.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.250 align:middle line:84%
But the method of contact
and the method of transfer

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.140 align:middle line:90%
is your aetheric field.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.510 align:middle line:84%
When you touch somebody
on one of these points,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:08.990 align:middle line:84%
you are able at a
certain level of practice

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.730 align:middle line:84%
to be able to do the same thing
as what the needle is doing.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.810 align:middle line:90%


00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.030 align:middle line:84%
The next level of
advancement would

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.540 align:middle line:84%
be to be able to touch one
point on the human body,

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.350 align:middle line:84%
and be able to hit any other
point, or to hit all points,

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.845 align:middle line:84%
and thereby energize
the whole system.

00:05:27.845 --> 00:05:30.900 align:middle line:90%


00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.120 align:middle line:10%
But those points
have correspondence--

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.950 align:middle line:10%
they correspond to your organs
or to processes in the body.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And these have been
extensively studied.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.900 align:middle line:84%
All human health depends
on energy and energy flow.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.700 align:middle line:90%


00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.690 align:middle line:90%
So what is an energy field?

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.240 align:middle line:90%
You are an energy field.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.920 align:middle line:90%
What is a morphic field?

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.260 align:middle line:90%
It is an energy field.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.240 align:middle line:84%
What is collective
consciousness?

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.250 align:middle line:90%
It's an energy field.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.920 align:middle line:84%
The difference is,
the human energy

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.680 align:middle line:90%
field has a physicality to it.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.820 align:middle line:84%
What does the energetic
field look like?

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:16.860 align:middle line:84%
The easiest way I've come
to define it and see it

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.060 align:middle line:84%
is as a bubble, a
human energy bubble.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.650 align:middle line:84%
It extends out ideally to
a minimum of nine feet.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.970 align:middle line:84%
At the nine-foot mark,
you have a causal barrier.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.240 align:middle line:84%
You have the limit of
your own consciousness

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.250 align:middle line:90%
and your own existence.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.330 align:middle line:84%
Now that does not include
your ability to be projective,

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.010 align:middle line:84%
your ability to connect
to other energy fields.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.430 align:middle line:84%
But morphic fields are
strictly information.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.090 align:middle line:84%
Energy slowed down in
physics is information.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.640 align:middle line:84%
Extra-dimensional
information flows

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.750 align:middle line:84%
are trans-dimensional
information flows.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.660 align:middle line:90%
We connect, we have connections.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle line:84%
We have connections
to energy fields,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.640 align:middle line:84%
we have connections
to information fields.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.050 align:middle line:84%
They are different, they
process at a different rate.

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.190 align:middle line:84%
So morphic fields
is an ideal way

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.170 align:middle line:84%
to explain a body of
information that is limited,

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.840 align:middle line:84%
that we can put a
causal barrier on,

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.540 align:middle line:84%
that we can put
brackets on, that we

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.570 align:middle line:90%
can call a set of information.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.340 align:middle line:84%
So not only do you have a big
nine-foot bubble of yourself,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.130 align:middle line:84%
you're connected to all
these other bubbles.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.010 align:middle line:84%
Let's say you don't
have a nine-foot bubble.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.030 align:middle line:84%
You're more subject
to information flows

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle line:90%
that are larger than you.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.900 align:middle line:84%
And some of the
information flows

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.990 align:middle line:90%
we're subject to are massive.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.210 align:middle line:84%
It's incredible the
amount of information

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.320 align:middle line:84%
that has been dumped into
them over thousands of years.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.140 align:middle line:84%
And when we touch upon
them, that's all we do.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:02.260 align:middle line:84%
We touch upon them
until we can decide

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:06.240 align:middle line:84%
whether to move into them,
to accept that information,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.240 align:middle line:90%
or to explore it.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.220 align:middle line:84%
I like the idea that
we're a nine-foot bubble,

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.220 align:middle line:84%
that we can expand out to
hundreds of feet or thousands

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.960 align:middle line:90%
of feet or millions of miles.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.740 align:middle line:84%
But in the process,
that we can encompass

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.010 align:middle line:90%
other bubbles of information.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.740 align:middle line:84%
And that we can integrate
them or synchronize with them

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.300 align:middle line:84%
or become congruent
where there is values.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.330 align:middle line:84%
And that information
becomes something

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.299 align:middle line:84%
that we can utilize
in our everyday life

00:08:34.299 --> 00:08:35.925 align:middle line:84%
and our experience
as human beings.

00:08:35.925 --> 00:08:44.970 align:middle line:90%


00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:49.620 align:middle line:84%
To me, one of the most important
things to understand and study

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:53.420 align:middle line:84%
is the nature of these
trans-dimensional interactions,

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:56.550 align:middle line:84%
these extra-dimensional
interactions that affect

00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:59.250 align:middle line:90%
us energetically at all times.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.760 align:middle line:84%
One of those is
participatory consciousness.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.680 align:middle line:84%
We don't think about that
when we identify ourselves

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:13.580 align:middle line:84%
as a particular religious group
or a particular political group

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.380 align:middle line:84%
or of a particular
tribe, that we

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.580 align:middle line:84%
are in a state of
participatory consciousness.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.140 align:middle line:84%
When you say, I am anything
other than your name,

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:31.680 align:middle line:84%
you are exhibiting participatory
consciousness participation.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.380 align:middle line:84%
You're identifying
with something

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.990 align:middle line:84%
outside of who you
are and what you are.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:42.120 align:middle line:84%
Group consciousness
is the same thing.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.130 align:middle line:84%
We identify as a group, as a
nation, as an organization.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.890 align:middle line:84%
Same thing-- it does not exist
except as a morphic field,

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.760 align:middle line:84%
as a level of information
that we are tapped into,

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.300 align:middle line:84%
something that we
draw information from.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:84%
And eventually we get to
creative consciousness.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And creative consciousness
is where we are best

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:12.070 align:middle line:84%
able to express
ourselves, identify

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:15.070 align:middle line:84%
ourselves, and
progress ourselves

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.230 align:middle line:90%
to a greater state of being.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:25.540 align:middle line:90%


00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:27.940 align:middle line:84%
The study of human
consciousness is

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.870 align:middle line:84%
a very mental and
intellectual exercise.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:36.280 align:middle line:84%
But there are other ways
to acquire this knowledge.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.430 align:middle line:10%
One of those ways is
through another teacher

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:10%
and a body of teachings that he
brought to the United States,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.260 align:middle line:10%
and that is Yogi Bhajan.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.850 align:middle line:10%
Yogi Bhajan came to
the United States

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:53.500 align:middle line:10%
and declared that he would
teach Kundalini Yoga.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini Yoga gives
you an opportunity

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:02.050 align:middle line:84%
to explore consciousness
from a physicality,

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.560 align:middle line:84%
from your physical
existence to begin with.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.730 align:middle line:84%
But it also is
open-ended in its ability

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:14.770 align:middle line:84%
to allow you to move upward in
your levels of consciousness.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:19.320 align:middle line:90%


00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:84%
I lived in Los Angeles when
I was in my 20's and found

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:28.430 align:middle line:84%
that I had a big problem of
what they call monkey mind.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.990 align:middle line:90%
I couldn't go to sleep at night.

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:32.940 align:middle line:84%
My mind would go in a
million miles an hour.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:38.090 align:middle line:84%
A commercial came on
the TV about doing yoga.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:43.940 align:middle line:84%
In 1971, yoga was not very
well known or very popular.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.560 align:middle line:84%
But it said that it would
give you the ability to relax.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.910 align:middle line:84%
I went to that first Hatha
Yoga class, and it was true--

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:56.890 align:middle line:84%
I was able to sleep after
doing those exercises.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.150 align:middle line:84%
And that is one of
the things about being

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:01.470 align:middle line:90%
alive is we need our sleep.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:05.870 align:middle line:84%
And if you don't get your sleep,
you tend to be not yourself.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.440 align:middle line:84%
Being not yourself
is a classic thing

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.510 align:middle line:90%
that Kundalini Yoga addresses.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.190 align:middle line:90%


00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:18.660 align:middle line:84%
All of this information has
to come to a single place,

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.340 align:middle line:90%
and that is inside you.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:25.050 align:middle line:90%


00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:27.330 align:middle line:84%
I think one of the
most difficult things

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.300 align:middle line:84%
that a person
encounters in life is

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:35.160 align:middle line:84%
trying to find some
internal understanding

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:40.140 align:middle line:84%
or some internal balance about
everything from morphic fields

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.960 align:middle line:84%
to level of
consciousness to New Age,

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.620 align:middle line:84%
to the entire reality
we're presented with.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:49.800 align:middle line:10%
One of the things I did
was to divide it up--

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle line:10%
the duality of reality.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:54.360 align:middle line:10%
Number one reality,
the physicality

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.850 align:middle line:10%
of everything you
do during the day.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:59.040 align:middle line:10%
And then zero
reality, everything

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.550 align:middle line:10%
that exists in your
imagination and your emotions

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.190 align:middle line:10%
and your relationships,
that all occurs

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.830 align:middle line:10%
all at an energetic level.

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.480 align:middle line:84%
Number one reality has
an energetic level,

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.910 align:middle line:84%
it's where you expend a lot of
energy in the course of a day.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.020 align:middle line:84%
But we also know that
just thinking all day long

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:19.950 align:middle line:90%
will wear you out.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.970 align:middle line:90%
It dissipates your energy.

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.540 align:middle line:84%
We want to be able
to integrate all this

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.570 align:middle line:90%
and not suffer because of it.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:33.090 align:middle line:84%
Kundalini yoga is zero and
number one reality combined.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:36.210 align:middle line:84%
It has physical
exercises, but it also

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:41.430 align:middle line:84%
has the work of the imagination,
the work of the intellect

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.530 align:middle line:90%
also at play.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.170 align:middle line:84%
Hatha Yoga is
number one reality.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:48.690 align:middle line:84%
Hatha Yoga, for
the most part, is

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.190 align:middle line:90%
to do the physical exercises.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:56.400 align:middle line:84%
And so is Zumba, and so
is running or cross fit.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.370 align:middle line:84%
All of these have the
same desired outcome--

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:03.690 align:middle line:84%
to achieve a higher level
of energy and consciousness,

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:08.920 align:middle line:84%
because energy and consciousness
levels are interchangeable.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.130 align:middle line:84%
It's just that each
of these approach it

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:13.140 align:middle line:90%
from different directions.

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:16.560 align:middle line:84%
You can approach the advancement
of your own consciousness

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:23.850 align:middle line:84%
from a physical level or from a
mental, from a creative level.

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:28.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a quote from
Yogi Bhajan in 2003.

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:31.760 align:middle line:84%
It still has value
and resonance today.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.450 align:middle line:84%
"A new age calls for its
own words to live by."

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.570 align:middle line:84%
Spiritual teachers, and
there are thousands of them,

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:41.670 align:middle line:90%
share principles.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:middle line:84%
Some of these principles
have come to us

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.730 align:middle line:90%
in the form of sutras.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.050 align:middle line:84%
A sutra is a complex
spiritual concept.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:53.940 align:middle line:84%
Sutras allow sacred teachings
to be protected from harm,

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.220 align:middle line:84%
and were brief enough
to be remembered

00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:01.070 align:middle line:84%
by students in ancient
times and also under stress.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.800 align:middle line:84%
"The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali"
have sustained the world

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:09.180 align:middle line:84%
over thousands of years
in their perfect wisdom.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.150 align:middle line:10%
These are the five sutures
of the Aquarian Age,

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.090 align:middle line:10%
given to us by Yoga Bhajan.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:19.050 align:middle line:84%
Number 1, recognize the
other person is you.

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:23.370 align:middle line:10%
This is where our
consciousness can encompass

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.870 align:middle line:10%
the ideal of another person's
consciousness and the ideal

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:30.805 align:middle line:10%
that it is different but
still can be accepted.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:34.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:38.780 align:middle line:84%
The second one is there is
a way through every block.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.220 align:middle line:10%
One of the things about the
speed of our civilization

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.090 align:middle line:10%
is that it appears to be
speeding up to everybody,

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.340 align:middle line:10%
and it doesn't
give us enough time

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.550 align:middle line:10%
to work through
the blocks we have,

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.740 align:middle line:10%
to work through
the interference,

00:15:54.740 --> 00:16:01.260 align:middle line:10%
to recognize the path we need
to pursue to move forward.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.170 align:middle line:84%
The third one, when
the time is on you,

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:06.350 align:middle line:84%
start, and the
pressure will be off.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.330 align:middle line:90%
This is a very simple act.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.790 align:middle line:84%
It is one of the
primary things that

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:14.650 align:middle line:84%
is required of you
is to stop thinking,

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:19.220 align:middle line:84%
to stop feeling, and turn
around and make an action.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.010 align:middle line:84%
So many people are stuck
in their consciousness,

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.840 align:middle line:84%
they're stuck at
a certain level,

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.670 align:middle line:84%
and they can't seem
to get out of it.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.220 align:middle line:90%
And it requires you to move.

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:32.340 align:middle line:84%
The fourth sutra
is understanding

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.720 align:middle line:84%
through compassion, or you
will misunderstand the times.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.530 align:middle line:90%
This deals with the ego.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:44.640 align:middle line:84%
The ego wants to be right, and
compassion requires the truth.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.830 align:middle line:84%
If you seek the truth, you will
not misunderstand the person

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:52.770 align:middle line:84%
in front of you or
the circumstances that

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:56.310 align:middle line:90%
are going on around you.

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:57.470 align:middle line:90%
The fifth one--

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.600 align:middle line:84%
I love the fifth one--
vibrate the cosmos.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.060 align:middle line:84%
When you vibrate
the consciousness,

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.369 align:middle line:90%
you vibrate the cosmos.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:09.480 align:middle line:84%
When you vibrate the cosmos
with the idea of love,

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.270 align:middle line:84%
with the level of love,
with the idea of joy,

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:16.829 align:middle line:84%
with a level of joy, you are
changing your environment

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:20.790 align:middle line:84%
and you're changing every
one you relate to and

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.839 align:middle line:90%
everyone you interact with.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.870 align:middle line:84%
Every morphic field and
every level of consciousness

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:34.460 align:middle line:90%
has values.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And it also has a timeline for
when we either experience them

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.110 align:middle line:90%
or when we adopt them.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:46.670 align:middle line:84%
Astrologers have determined that
every 2,000 years time moves us

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.740 align:middle line:90%
into a new age.

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:50.570 align:middle line:84%
In simple language,
this means we

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:53.660 align:middle line:84%
are completing the Age
of Pisces and moving

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:56.360 align:middle line:90%
into the Age of Aquarius.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.900 align:middle line:84%
Each age has its own
theme, its own axiom.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:05.450 align:middle line:84%
Piscean values work from the
ego, creating boundaries.

00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:08.640 align:middle line:84%
They were necessary to
advance our consciousness.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:84%
Aquarian values
have no boundaries.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.530 align:middle line:90%
That's what we see today--

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:14.300 align:middle line:90%
they are infinite.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.290 align:middle line:84%
And we see the turmoil that
goes on from the adjustment.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.470 align:middle line:10%
Aquarian consciousness
takes you inside your soul

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:24.320 align:middle line:10%
so that you can relate
to the soul in all.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.010 align:middle line:90%


00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:31.410 align:middle line:10%
In addition to Rupert
Sheldrake's work,

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:35.370 align:middle line:10%
Dr. David Hawkins has
presented another approach

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.960 align:middle line:10%
to human consciousness.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:42.720 align:middle line:84%
He delineated human awareness
into levels of consciousness.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.840 align:middle line:84%
Several years ago, I
attended a lecture.

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.100 align:middle line:10%
During the course of that
lecture, he brought out a book,

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.240 align:middle line:10%
and the title of the book
was "Power Versus Force."

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.260 align:middle line:10%
And I was shocked because
the information in that book

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.080 align:middle line:10%
was things that I had
been studying through all

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.560 align:middle line:10%
these other teachers,
and yet here it all

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:09.780 align:middle line:10%
was in a concise form,
laid out in a way

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:14.080 align:middle line:10%
that you could explore
it and understand it.

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.850 align:middle line:84%
He was explaining the
basic ideal and levels

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:22.810 align:middle line:84%
of consciousness that
every human experiences

00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:25.730 align:middle line:90%
in the course of their life.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:29.290 align:middle line:84%
It's a reason why
advocated for anybody

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:32.350 align:middle line:84%
who is studying
consciousness that this

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:middle line:90%
is something they should read.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.880 align:middle line:84%
It will give you a
basic understanding

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.900 align:middle line:84%
and give you mechanisms
to understand energy flow,

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:43.840 align:middle line:84%
energy transference,
the connections we have.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Everything I've talked about is
also talked about in that book.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Except I learned it from
all these other teachers

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.350 align:middle line:90%
in the same way that David did.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:56.710 align:middle line:84%
He consolidated them
and advance the ideas

00:19:56.710 --> 00:20:01.240 align:middle line:84%
by expanding them and
making them relate.

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And that is the
greatest thing we can do

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:08.290 align:middle line:84%
is to learn to relate to all
the different ideals and levels

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.850 align:middle line:90%
of consciousness out there.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.900 align:middle line:90%


00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.780 align:middle line:84%
When I went to Dr.
David Hawkins' lectures,

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.060 align:middle line:84%
realization was
something that happened.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.540 align:middle line:84%
It wasn't something
that I worked for.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.160 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the work that you
do up to now is important.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.910 align:middle line:84%
But realization is when
it all comes together.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:34.650 align:middle line:90%


00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.450 align:middle line:10%
So Dr. Hawkins when he laid out
the levels of consciousness,

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.430 align:middle line:10%
the map of consciousness
he presented

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:45.540 align:middle line:10%
was not meant to be the
end-all study of consciousness.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.460 align:middle line:84%
It was meant to give
you a guideline.

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.740 align:middle line:10%
And each level
was something that

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.600 align:middle line:10%
could be studied and
understood, and something

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.010 align:middle line:10%
that could be related
to in your everyday life

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:00.770 align:middle line:10%
and your own experiences
and your own studies

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.630 align:middle line:10%
and your own reading.

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.460 align:middle line:84%
I was able to
integrate it, I was

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:06.560 align:middle line:84%
able to come
synchronized with it,

00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.850 align:middle line:84%
and I was able to
become congruent,

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:12.120 align:middle line:84%
meaning to work out of a
new level of consciousness.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.350 align:middle line:84%
And particularly as it
applies to other people

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:20.240 align:middle line:84%
and to companies and to
business and to all manner

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:25.670 align:middle line:84%
of other information bubbles
and all manner of individuals,

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:28.940 align:middle line:84%
because consciousness
is interactive.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.460 align:middle line:90%
It is in between.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.050 align:middle line:90%
It's the relationship.

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:35.710 align:middle line:90%


00:21:35.710 --> 00:21:38.820 align:middle line:10%
So one of the things
about "Power Versus Force"

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:42.100 align:middle line:10%
is that when you study the
levels of consciousness,

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.730 align:middle line:10%
we come back to a
very important thing.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.650 align:middle line:10%
And that is, you are
in an energy crisis,

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:51.070 align:middle line:10%
because if you participate
in everything under 200 level

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.040 align:middle line:10%
consciousness--
it's in the book--

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.690 align:middle line:10%
it deletes energy from
your energy field.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:21:59.760 align:middle line:10%
It distracts you.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.250 align:middle line:90%
It takes energy away from you.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:05.040 align:middle line:90%
It makes you less than yourself.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.350 align:middle line:84%
And then all the magic
occurs at the level of 200.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.520 align:middle line:10%
At 200, the level
of consciousness

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.840 align:middle line:10%
is one of courage, the
courage to advance yourself,

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.080 align:middle line:10%
the courage to explore
the truth, the courage

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:25.260 align:middle line:10%
to accept reality for what it is
and not be judgmental about it.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And this of course is
also one of the things

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.510 align:middle line:84%
that Dr. Rupert
Sheldrake talks about,

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:34.920 align:middle line:84%
and accepting the consciousness
of animals and trees.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.800 align:middle line:84%
One of the things that
Yogi Bhajan talked about,

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.710 align:middle line:84%
and that is accepting the
consciousness of other living

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:44.100 align:middle line:84%
beings as something that
exists and something

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.930 align:middle line:90%
not to be judgmental about.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.550 align:middle line:90%


00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.590 align:middle line:84%
One of the things
that occurs if we

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:55.450 align:middle line:84%
look at collective consciousness
and political consciousness,

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.540 align:middle line:84%
religious consciousness,
every one of those

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:00.510 align:middle line:84%
has some form of
judgment in them,

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.640 align:middle line:84%
and judgment lowers
your energy field.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:06.676 align:middle line:90%
It is an activity of below 200.

00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:09.250 align:middle line:84%
And 200 level
conscious of courage

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:12.170 align:middle line:84%
is one that allows
you to move upwards.

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:15.070 align:middle line:84%
And until you find the
courage to be yourself

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:17.890 align:middle line:84%
and to accept these
things as truth,

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:22.030 align:middle line:84%
you will always be stuck, you
will always have no energy,

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:26.110 align:middle line:84%
and you will always be a
victim of the environment

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.389 align:middle line:90%
and the universe.

00:23:27.389 --> 00:23:34.880 align:middle line:90%


00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.840 align:middle line:90%
We go out of victimhood.

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:38.790 align:middle line:84%
When we move our
consciousness above 200,

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:43.660 align:middle line:84%
we move it from not just
courage into acceptance.

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.470 align:middle line:84%
And then acceptance
is the entire universe

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:52.340 align:middle line:84%
is available to you, because
you're not judgmental about it.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.280 align:middle line:90%
He wrote an additional 14 books.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:57.970 align:middle line:10%
The last one is
called "Letting Go,"

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.840 align:middle line:10%
and probably is one of the
most effective techniques

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.390 align:middle line:10%
to break the connections
that you have formed

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:08.170 align:middle line:10%
with your own energy existence,
your own energy bubble,

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:10.570 align:middle line:10%
because some of those
no longer serve you.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:14.770 align:middle line:84%
Those values and the
time of their existence

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.870 align:middle line:90%
no longer applies.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So now we have the whole
idea that we can elevate

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:24.220 align:middle line:84%
or that we can move
upwards in consciousness.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.640 align:middle line:84%
Here's the concepts that
you can explore and find

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.900 align:middle line:84%
some way to integrate,
synchronize, and make congruent

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:36.120 align:middle line:84%
where you can act out of the
new level of consciousness.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.090 align:middle line:84%
Consciousness is a
process of growth.

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.730 align:middle line:84%
It is something that
we're on the path of.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.060 align:middle line:84%
And that's what it
means to be on the path,

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.030 align:middle line:90%
is to move forward.

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:51.040 align:middle line:90%


00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.380 align:middle line:84%
Now that I have showed
you some different ways

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.960 align:middle line:84%
to understand consciousness
and how we are connected,

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I want to take you a step
further on how understanding

00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.020 align:middle line:90%
this leads to healing.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:05.650 align:middle line:84%
Stay tuned for the next
episode as we dive deeper

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:10.990 align:middle line:84%
into the ancient medicine
origins of these same concepts.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.574 align:middle line:10%
